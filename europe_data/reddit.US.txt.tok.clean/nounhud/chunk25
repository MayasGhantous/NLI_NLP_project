  seems a bit less-comfortable to carry on one 's hip all day long ... i mean , no disagreement with the principle or all that , but ... 
   france pm warns extreme islam winning the propaganda war i 'm dubious . 
  i find myself more sympathetic to hollande than to `` extreme islam '' . 
  nixon was replaced with ford , who promptly pardoned nixon . 
  i wonder if the icelandic prime minister has similar powers . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the turks on reddit are n't representative of the whole population . 
  i was looking at a site that showed turkish votes from overseas from various countries , for example , and turks in the us * massively * voted for chp -- not exactly enthusiastic about erdogan . 
  i think that the more-interesting picture here is that mali is historically a french concern and france and germany are working together on overseas military projects . 
  might not be an eu army yet , but ... 
   in the usa can an employer terminate an employee 's contract for refusing to work overtime ? 
  [ normally an employer can fire someone without a reason , just as an employee can walk out the door without a reason -- this doctrine is termed `` at will '' employment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/at-will_employment ) . 
  you should n't * have * to do so , but : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ship_transport, 
  the guy from the stopped train thing was in the coast guard . 
  `` soldiers '' refers to army , not coast guard -- that 's `` coast guardsmen '' or `` coasties '' . 
  also , while , yeah , feels good to have stopped that one , realistically having military -- and particularly foreign military -- doing law enforcement in a country ai n't the way to go . 
  this one worked out well , but what happens when someone decides to use a fake gun to do a political protest or something like that and gets clobbered ? 
  you want people who know the language well , who can talk people down , who can read people well . 
  foreign military just does n't fit the bill -- these are relatively-young guys without training in non-lethal control of a situation . 
  to be fair , that metric is based heavily on ( a ) self-perception and ( b ) several things like government subsidies for media , which i personally do not see as essential to press freedom . 
   when european or american sponsored media like radio svoboda or deutche welle try to push their agenda in russia it 's completely normal , but when russian media do the same it 's propaganda . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voice_of_america  on september 2008 , the voa eliminated the hindi language service after 53 years . 
  [ 26 ] previously , radio programs in russian were gone off the air in july . 
  [ 26 ] the same fate happened to broadcasts in ukrainian , serbian , macedonian and bosnian . 
  [ 27 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt_%28tv_network%29  russian president vladimir putin prohibited the reduction of funding for rt on october 30 , 2012 . 
  [ 93 ]   about 80 percent of rt 's costs occur outside russia , paying partner networks around $ 260 million for the distribution of its channels in 2014 . 
  [ 94 ] [ 95 ] in september the moscow times reported that rt `` received 11.87 billion rubles ( $ 310 million ) in state funding this year , will receive 15.38 billion rubles ( $ 400 million ) in 2015 '' . 
  [ 96 ] for comparison the bigger bbc world service group had a $ 367 million budget in 2014-15 . 
  [ 97 ] however at the start in 2015 , as the ruble 's value plummeted and a ten percent reduction in media subsidies was imposed , it was thought that rt 's budget for the year would fall to about $ 236 million . 
  [ 94 ] [ 95 ] during the year , government funding was increased to 20.8 billion roubles ( around $ 300 million in september ) . 
  [ 98 ] in october the moscow times reported that rt `` will receive 19 billion rubles ( $ 307 million ) from the budget in 2016 '' . 
  [ 99 ] the ruble 's value remains volatile , hitting a new record low of almost 86 per dollar on january 21 , 2016 . 
  [ 100 ] we pulled out of russia and russia started ramping up propaganda funding targeting the west . 
  just saying . 
   it 's stupid but it works , as simple as that . 
  going outside the law decidedly did not work for [ patco with reagan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/professional_air_traffic_controllers_organization_%281968%29 ) . 
  yeah , i 'm going to kinda second that . 
  crime happens . 
  protests happen . 
  sometimes protesters cause damage . 
  but how common is it for police to simply not protect property ? 
  this is n't the first article i 've read recently along the lines of `` french police just stand by and watch shipments be destroyed '' . 
  that is n't to say that french police officers are expected to politically-agree with anti-protectionist positions . 
  but as law enforcers , it really seems to me that they * should * be expected to uphold the law , regardless of their own political positions . 
  it would be absurd to expect everyone applying to become a police officer to agree with every policy that the government adopts , and part of the job of a law officer is to enforce policy even if you personally would n't have voted for it . 
   do n't use it , people will think you are a californian . 
  oh , look at the east coaster talking smack because nobody uses * his * slang -- it 's clearly not radical enough !, 
  i 'm not sure that this is a drastic change from the historic state . 
  finland would be a lot bigger too , for that matter . 
   both sides agree on one point : relations between the two countries are at their lowest point since the early days of the cold war . 
  that 's a pretty strong statement . 
  i mean , the [ berlin crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_crisis_of_1961 ) was n't * early * in the cold war , and i 'm pretty sure that things are n't as rocky now as then . 
   the best selling vehicles in the united states , canada , and mexico tend to be larger suvs and trucks . 
  might be better to check best-selling * class * of vehicles rather than best-selling * vehicles * in a class . 
  the latter might have more to do with a reduced model number in an area , and us auto manufacturers managed to get a [ fat protectionist tariff on light trucks in the form of the chicken tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax ) . 
  i 'm hoping things like tpp and ttip will wind up killing this . 
  < doubtfully  maybe . 
  i think that there 's something of a tendency to play up characteristics that people are told they have . 
  like , okay , italians have a reputation for having good food , right ? 
  and a big chunk of the reason that they know this is that they 're told it , so so now it 's part of their identity . 
  it kinda gets repeated and everyone just * knows * it . 
  but who chooses to have * bad * food ? 
  it 's not like there are real technical or geographical constraints any more in food production . 
  if you want to make spaghetti in northern sweden , you 're going to just go right ahead and do that . 
  food preservation is n't an issue any more . 
  maybe some of that is historically italian cuisine , but that northern swede has access to the same recipes , the same materials , and so forth . 
  i 'm pretty sure that there is n't anything substantial at the genetic level that stops someone from making a particular dish . 
  yeah , some areas are lower-population density ... but just about everyone lives in cities these days anyway . 
  there 's some cultural inertia , sure -- my family still makes christmas cookies using ethnic recipes using some approximation of the materials that my ancestors had available some five generations back ... but that has a pretty small impact on day-to-day life . 
  if someone sees a particular set of customs or technologies or practices as working well , there 's a tendency to pick them up . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if a resident of helsinki gets a hankering for curry or sushi , they can pick some up with no problems these days . 
  i do n't know what the national image of most countries are . 
  i 'm pretty sure that candians keep being told that they 're a really amiable people . 
  the western frontier used to be something kinda unique to the us a hundred and fifty years ago -- cowboys and maybe a somewhat lawless situation in places . 
  the us likes selling the idea of `` rugged individualism '' to people living in the us , and maybe at one point there was a bit of something to that , at least for people in part of the country . 
  but how meaningful is that today ? 
  just like the bulk of europe , [ we 're city boys today ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization ) . 
  someone from ireland is more-likely to live in the country than someone in the us . 
  when i mentioned east asia , i do think that there are real , active political efforts by leadership in east asia to encourage collectivist positions for political stability , and to emphasize the preeminence of the group -- north korea 's leadership has a love of [ encouraging things like large-scale synchronized dance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrq0bjpx7d4 ) that would come off as a bit creepy in the us . 
  i also think that that used to be more-widespread than was the case today , due to the changing political situation in east asia . 
  but does europe today have anything remotely like that ? 
  when the us was being put together , there were certain political ideas in vogue , and some of that was frozen in the legal code ( e.g. 
  separation of church and state ... but not secularism , the importance of access to arms , the idea that because there was enough land for everyone , what people needed was mostly equality of opportunity ) . 
  postwar europe had some of its own political ideas in vogue , and some of that was frozen in place as the eu formed . 
  socialism was a * thing * in part of europe 's political history -- one of my favorite fiction books was written by a polish engineer some decades back , and had the main character clearly struggling with being a good catholic and a good socialist because that was how he was brought up , while also leaning decidedly towards a post-religious and capitalist society -- he was kind of embarrassed about the values he was actually living by and how they conflicted with the ones that he had been told that he should have had as a boy . 
  but how much * practical * impact does stuff like this still have today , versus just acting as a source of just so stories for people trying to define an identity ? 
  [ rt : nation-state model of europe has failed , breeding wars and misery ] ( https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/197368-eu-state-model-independence/ ) < resumes munching popcorn , 
   [ batesian mimicry , in particular , is when a toxic species is mimicked by a more palatable one ... ] ( http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/scarlet-kingsnake-still-mimics-extinct-venomous-species ) yes , that does seem to fit . 
  gah , you 're right -- i was thinking of discretionary , not disposable income . 
  edit : ... and i ca n't find statistics gathered by anyone for that , possibly because there is no standardized metric of what is an `` essential '' . 
  i guess you could call air conditioning a luxury in poland and an essential in saudi arabia . 
  hmm . 
  edit2 : the other problem is that some countries will artificially inflate one price or another as a subsidy , and i 'm not sure that luxuries normally get counted toward ppp -- if , say , alcohol is a big chunk of non-essential spending in a country , a country with a high tariff ( like india ) might wind up with less * effective * discretionary income . 
  i really would like to have a general metric for that , though . 
  i mean , ppp is n't perfect , but people clearly use that to get an idea of spending . 
  you 'd think that there 'd be a un - gathered estimate at least . 
  the whole `` collectivist culture '' explanation might work for a us-east asia comparison , but i do n't know about us-europe . 
  * is * europe particularly collectivist ? 
  in the technical sense of the word , the driver might be putting on pretenses . 
  i mean , there 's the `` beat up old truck '' ( often small ) that is clearly used for actual landscaping work and the crowd that has the much-newer-and-immaculate truck . 
  disposable income already has healthcare taken out .
