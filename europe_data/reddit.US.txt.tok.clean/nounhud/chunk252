  < continued from parent   finally , hosting and , in some cases , integrating refugees and migrants poses a challenge to all european societies that must be dealt with in a spirit of responsibility and solidarity . 
  germany and france to not share the same historical experience of immigration and integration but are committed to learning from each other . 
  through dialogue , exchange and cooperation , we intend to foster a more objective debate about the challenges and opportunities of immigration and integration for our societies . 
  we hope thus to use the lessons we have learned to benefit other european states that are confronted with similar challenges . 
    ** fostering growth and completing the economic and monetary union **   to this day , our common currency constitutions the most visible and ambitious undertaking of european unification . 
  the euro has helped protect its member states from international speculation and contributed to building a common economic area . 
  the euro reflects our commitment to the irreversibility of european integration . 
    however , we must admit that the crisis and its aftermath have shown up deficiencies that make citizens question whether the common currency delivers on its promises and even casts doubt on the sustainability of the project itself . 
  we therefore intend to proceed on three fronts simultaneously : strengthening economic convergence , enhancing social justice and democratic accountability and improving shock resistance to safeguard the irreversibility of the euro . 
  france and germany have always seen it as their major responsibility to build a robust eurozone able to assert its model in a more and more competitive world . 
    we believe we urgently need to revive this spirit to carry the debate forward . 
  and it is the responsibility of our two countries to bilaterally proceed beyond that . 
  we have to acknowledge that the requirements of membership and the fiscal implications stemming from the common currency have been higher than one could have expected when the euro was founded . 
  we must therefore respect the wish of others to decide on their own when to join the euro . 
    * to overcome the crisis , the euro area has to enter into a renewed phase of economic convergence . 
  to this end , france and germany will shoulder the main responsibility of organising a process of economic convergence and political governance which balances obligations and solidarity to accompany the process . 
  surplus and deficit countries will have to move , as a one-sided alignment is politically unfeasible . 
    * growth potential has been severely hampered by the crisis . 
  europe urgently needs to unlock the untapped potential inherent in the completion of the single market in specific sectors of strategic interest . 
  france and germany remain committed to bilateral initiatives to rapidly harmonise regulation and oversight as well as corporate tax schemes . 
  to unlock growth and to increase the productivity of the european economy , a renewed effort for more investment , both private and public , is necessary . 
  france and germany reiterate their commitment to structural reforms to attract international investment and to further enhance the competitiveness of their economies . 
    * in that respect , specific initiatives should be taken in order to foster growth and convergence between member states in strategic sectors such as energy , the digital sector , research and innovation or professional training . 
  in the short term , common targets could be set , linked to regulatory objectives and investment means based on the amplification of the european fund for strategic investment . 
  over the medium term , those strategic sectors should evolve towards a common regulatory framework and even a shared supervisory authority , and benefit from a structured european investment capability to foster convergence through cross-border investment . 
  bilateral initiatives by germany and france should be undertaken within that framework . 
    * the current architecture of the euro is not sufficiently resilient to external shocks or internal imbalances . 
  leaving the emu incomplete jeopardises the survival of our common currency in the long term . 
  completing the emu will involve the continuous intensification of political governance as well as fiscal burden sharing . 
  in light of existing imbalances a deepening of the emu will not come as a big bang but as the result of a pragmatic and gradual evolution taking into account the necessary results in terms of growth and employment . 
  these results are indispensable to reinforce confidence in the european union among member states and citizens and create the appropriate political conditions for new steps of integration towards completing the emu . 
    * we should acknowledge that emu member states share different traditions of economic policy making , which have to be balanced out for the euro to function properly . 
  a future architecture of the euro will neither be solely rules based nor prone to mere political decision making nor will it be steered exclusively by market forces . 
  every step in deepening the emu will encompass all of these aspects . 
    * since economic policy-making in the emu is increasing a domain of shared decisions , citizens rightly expect to regain control via supranational institutions accountable to them . 
  in the short term a full time president of the eurogroup should be accountable to a eurozone subcommmittee in the european parliament . 
  in the longer term , the eurogroup and its president should be accountable to a parliamentary body comprising members of the european parliament with the participation of members of national parliaments . 
  this chamber should have full authority on any matters regarding fiscal and macroeconomic oversight . 
    * in this context we should develop the european stability mechanism ( esm ) into a fully-fledged european monetary fund subject to parliamentary control . 
    * a fiscal capacity -- a common feature of any successful monetary union around the globe -- remains a missing keystone in the emu architecture . 
  in the long run it should provide macroeconomic stabilisation at the eurozone level while avoiding permanent unidirectional transfers . 
  whereas these capabilities should be built up over time and in line with progress on common decision making regarding fiscal and economic policy , it should start by 2018 at th latest to support investment in the member states most severely hit by the crisis . 
  germany and france should form a group prepared to lead on this matter . 
    * public support for the euro is undermined by a lack of progress on its social dimension and fair taxation among its member states . 
  hence , as a general principle , any step to further deepen the emu should be accompanied by progress in the field of common taxation , in particular with regard to transnational corporations , as well as the development of a social union underpinned by common social minimum standards . 
  < continued from parent    * on the basis of this common understanding , the european union should establish agreed strategic priorities for its foreign and security policy , in accordance with european interests . 
    * the european union global strategy is a first step in that direction . 
  but we need to push further : on a more contested and competitive international scene , france and germany will promote the eu as an independent and global actor able to leverage its unique array of expertise and tools , civilian and military , in order to defend and promote the interests of its citizens . 
  france and germany will promote integrated eu foreign and security policy bringing together all eu policy instruments . 
    * the eu will need to take action more often in order to manage crises that directly affect its own security . 
  we therefore need stronger and more flexible crisis prevention and crisis management capabilities . 
  the eu should be able to plan and conduct civil and military operations more effectively , with the support of a permanent civil-military chain of command . 
  the eu should be able to rely on employable high-readiness forces and provide common financing for its operations . 
  within the framework of the eu , member states should consider establishing standing maritime forces or acquiring eu-owned capabilities in other key areas . 
    * in order to live up to the growing security challenges , europeans need to step up their defence efforts . 
  european member states should reaffirm and abide by the commitments made collectively on defence budgets and the portion of spending dedicated to the procurement of equipment and to research and technology ( r&t ) . 
  within the eu , france and germany propose the establishment of a european semester on defence capabilities . 
  through this process , the eu will support efforts by member states by ensuring the coherence of defence and capability-building processes and encourage member states to discuss the priorities of their respective military spending plans . 
  the establishment of a european defence research programme will support an innovative european industry . 
    * the european union must invest more in preventing conflict , in promoting human security and in stabilising its neighbourhood and regions affected by crisis all over the world . 
  the eu should help its partners and neighbors develop their capacity and governance structures , to strengthen their crisis resilience and their ability to prevent and control emerging crises as well as terrorist threats . 
  france and germany will conduct join initiatives in stabilisation , development and reconstruction in syria and iraq when the situation allows . 
  together , france and germany will strengthen their civilian crisis management tools and reaffirm their commitment to support and sustain political processes of conflict resolution . 
    * in order to ensure our internal security , the immediate challenges are primarily operational . 
  the objectives are to implement and monitor eu decisions and make the best use of existing frameworks : pnr ; europol and its counterterrorism centre ; the fight against terrorist financing ; and eu action plans against trafficking of weapons and explosives . 
  a special emphasis should be put on strengthening transport safety . 
  we also want to increase our dialogue and cooperation with third countries in north africa , the sahel strip , the lake chad basin , west africa , the horn of africa and the middle east , as well as regional and sub-regional organizations ( africa union , g5 ) . 
    * in order to address the root causes of terrorism , france and germany will develop a european platform to share experience and best practice in preventing and counteracting radicalisation . 
    * in the medium term , we should work towards a more integrated approach for eu internal security , based on the following measures : creation of a european platform for intelligence cooperation , fully respecting national prerogatives and using the current frameworks ( e.g. 
  ctg ) ; improvement of data exchange ; european contingency planning for major crisis scenarios affecting several member states ; creation of a european response capability ; establishment of a european civil protection corps . 
    * in the longer term , it would make sense to enlarge the scope of the european public prosecutor 's office in future ( currently limited to prosecuting offenses concerning the eu 's financial interests ) to include fighting terrorism and organised crime . 
  this would require harmonisation of criminal law among the member states . 
    in order to drive this effort , france and germany propose that the european council should meet once a year as a european security council , in order to address internal and external security and defence issues facing the eu . 
  this european security council should be prepared by a meeting of foreign affairs , defence and interior ministers . 
    ** common european asylum and migration policy **   large-scale migration towards europe will be the key challenge for europe 's future . 
    there shall be no unilateral answers to the migration challenge , which is a truly european challenge of the 21th century . 
  our citizens expect that we firmly regain control on our external borders while preserving our european values . 
  we have to act jointly to live up to this expectation . 
  germany and france are convinced that it is high time to work towards establishing truly integrated european asylum , refugee and migration policy . 
  given the urgency of the matter , we should not rule out the possibility of a group of member states that share a sense of common responsibility making progress on common policies .
