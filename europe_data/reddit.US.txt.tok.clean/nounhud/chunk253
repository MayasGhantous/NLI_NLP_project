    * securing our external border is no longer exclusively a national task but also a common responsibility . 
  we are determined that the eu should establish the world 's first multinational border and coast guard . 
  in the short term , frontex will be manned by mean of secondments from member states . 
  france and germany should propose a join contribution to that end . 
  over the medium term frontex should be scaled up not only in terms of having its own permanent staff but also with adequate technical equipment to fulfill this task . 
    * we also propose the creation of a european esta for visa-exempt third country nationals as a useful instrument to reinforce our borders and security . 
    * it is our common duty to protect those fleeing from war or political persecution . 
  in our efforts we strive to allow refugees to find shelter as close to their homeland as possible . 
    * asylum seekers reaching europe have a right to be treated according to the geneva convention no matter where they reach our shores . 
  to this end we must further harmonise and simplify our standards and procedures in specific areas . 
  we shall stand ready to grant eu support for the establishment of efficient asylum systems where needed . 
  over the medium term the european asylum office should be transformed into a european asylum agency to support this process of standardisation and host join databases to prevent the misuse of differences in standards as well as multiple registrations and discourage secondary movements . 
  this european asylum agency would help reinforce convergence in the way applications for international protection are assessed , with due regard to the dublin basic principles such as the responsibility of the member state of first entry to deal with an asylum application . 
    * solidarity remains a cornerstone of our european project . 
  citizens expect that the benefits and burdens of eu membership be evenly shared among member states . 
  a situation in which the burden of migration is unevenly carried by a limited number of member states is unsustainable . 
  as a first step , the dublin system has to be improved to deal with exceptional circumstances by means of a permanent and binding mechanism which forsees burden sharing among all member states . 
  if necessary , germany and france stand ready to proceed on this matter with a group of like-minded partners . 
    * the eu must find a common answer to the rising number of migrants seeking to enter the eu for economic reasons . 
  the asylum system is a misleading entry point for them to use . 
  europe should stay open to what migration and mobility can contribute to our societies in the fields of the economy , culture and diversity . 
  we need to work towards a european immigration act that clearly states what the legal options are when it comes to working in europe , taking into account the different states of national labour markets in the eu . 
  at the same time , we have to improve eu tools and support in the field of return policy , underpinned by eu funds to finance the deportation of those who entered the eu illegally . 
    * in our relations with the key countries of origin and transit , we will work to reduce push factors for irregular migration , for example by generating economic and social opportunities , particularly for young people . 
  we expect constructive cooperation in crucial fields such as return and readmission , border management and control and the fight against migrant smuggling . 
  germany and france have already held high-level migration dialogues with a number of african states on behalf of the eu and will extend this dialogue to other countries . 
  root causes of migration , such as poverty , lack of security and political instability should also be addressed by the eu . 
  i 'm going to hand-type a text transcription of the english , because reading that watermarked image is just awful . 
   ** a strong europe in a world of uncertainties **   * by [ jean-marc ayrault ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-marc_ayrault ) and [ frank-walter steinmeier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank-walter_steinmeier ) *   the decision of the british people marks a watershed moment in the history of europe . 
  the european union is losing not only a member state , but a host of history , tradition and experience , with which we shared our journey throughout the past decades . 
  france and germany therefore take note of this decision with regret . 
  this creates a new situation and will entail consequences for both the united kingdom and for the eu . 
  the treaty of lisbon sets out the procedures for the orderly departure of a member state ( article 50 ) . 
  once the british government has activated these procedures , we will stand ready to assist the institutions in the negotiations clarifying the future relationship between the eu and the uk . 
    the british case is unique . 
  but we must also acknowledge that support and passion for our common project has faded over the last decade in parts of our societies . 
  neither a simple call for more europe nor a phase of mere reflection can be an adequate answer . 
  to prevent the silent creeping erosion of our european project we have to be more focused on essentials and on meeting the concrete expectations of our citizens . 
  we are convinced that it is not the existence of the union that they object to but the way it functions . 
  our task is twofold : we have to strictly focus our joints efforts on leaving others to national or regional decision making and variation . 
  and we must deliver better on those issues we have chosen to focus on . 
    france and germany remain most firmly of the belief that the european union provides a unique and indispensable framework for the pursuit of freedom , prosperity and security in europe , for shaping peaceful and mutually beneficial relationships amongst its people and for contributing to peace and stability in the world . 
  our two countries share a common destiny and a common set of values that provide the foundation for ever closer union between our peoples . 
  we will therefore move further towards political union in europe and invite the other europeans to join us in this endeavour . 
  france and germany recognize their responsibility to reinforce solidarity and cohesion within the european union . 
  to that end , we need to recognize that member states differ in their levels of ambition member state when it comes to the project of european integration . 
  while not stepping back from what we have achieved , we have to find better ways of dealing with different levels of ambition so as to ensure that europe delivers better on the expectations of all european citizens . 
    we believe the eu can and needs to develop common answers to today 's challenges abroad and at home . 
  in a context of rising global challenges and opportunities , we see the european union as more necessary than ever and as the only framework capable of providing appropriate collective answers to the changing international environment . 
  france and germany will therefore promote a more coherent and a more assertive europe on the world stage . 
  to deliver better , europe must focus on today 's main challenges -- ensure the security of our citizens confronted with growing external and internal threats ; establish a stable cooperative framework for dealing with migration and refugee flows ; boost the european economy by promoting convergence and sustainable and job-creating growth and advancing towards the completion of the economic and monetary union . 
    we are seeing the european union being severely put to the test . 
  it is challenged by a series of crises in its southern and eastern environment . 
  it is recovering slowly on the path of economic growth . 
  looking back at the history of the european edifice , we strongly believe in the strength of the eu and its ability to overcome these situations . 
  but something is new in these critical times , namely the perception that these crises jeopardise the very fabric of our societies , our values , our way of life . 
  we see terrorists attempting to spread fear and division in our societies . 
  we have to face increasingly interwoven internal and external challenges . 
  we see the need to preserve the combination of growth , competitiveness and social cohesion which lies at the heart of our european model while preserving our common values both internally and vis-a-vis the outside world . 
    we know there are no quick solutions to these very demanding problems . 
  but we are determined to address them , working to deal with current challenges while remaining focused on important long-term issues . 
  in this spirit , we have agreed on the following proposals . 
    ** a european security compact **   the eu has to face a deteriorating security environment and an unprecedented level of threat . 
  external crises have become more numerous , closer to europe -- both east and south of its borders -- and more likely to have immediate consequences for european territory and the security of eu citizens . 
  power politics are back on the world stage and conflict is being imported into our continent . 
  the terrorist threat is growing , feeding on complex networks in and outside europe and stemming from crisis zones and unstable , war-torn regions all over the world . 
  europe 's role as a credible force for peace is more important than ever . 
    the security of eu member states is deeply interconnected , as these threats now affect the continent as a whole : any threat to one member state is also a threat to others . 
  we therefore regard our security as one and indivisible . 
  we consider the european union and the european security order to be part of our core interests and will safeguard them in any circumstances . 
    in this context , france and germany recommit to a shared vision of europe as a security union , based on solidarity and mutual assistance between member states in support of common security and defence policy . 
  providing security for europe as well as contributing to peace and stability globally is at the heart of the european project . 
    we see the eu as a key power in its neighborhood but also as an actor for peace and stability with global reach . 
  an actor able to make a decisive contribution to tackling global challenges and to support a rules-based international order underpinned by strategic stability , based on a peaceful balance of interests . 
  we have considerable achievements that deserve recognition and can provide inspiration . 
  the historic agreement on iran 's nuclear programme was only possible because of the eu 's determined and persistent commitment . 
  european engagement in the minsk process has helped to contain a military confrontation in eastern ukraine that could have easily spiralled out of control . 
  our diplomatic efforts have paved the way for a political settlement to the conflict which we will continue to pursue . 
  in libya , we support the emerging government of national accord endeavouring to address the risks posed by state fragility and instability in the southern mediterranean . 
  beyond the crises , we are convinced that africa needs also a continuous commitment , being a continent of great challenges and opportunities . 
    one of the mean features of today 's security environment is the interdependence between internal and external security , since the most dangerous and destabilising risks emanate from the interaction between external threats and internal weaknesses . 
  to respond to this challenge , germany and france propose a european security compact which encompasses all aspects of security and defence dealt with at the european level and thus delivers on the eu 's promise to strengthen security for its citizens . 
    a first step is to share a common analysis of our strategic environment and common understanding of our interests . 
  france and germany propose that the eu conduct regular reviews of its strategic environment , to be submitted and discussed at the foreign affairs council and at the european council . 
  these reviews will be supported by an independent situation assessment capability , based on the eu intelligence and situation centre and expertise from outside european institutions , with production of strategic and intelligence analysis approved at european level . 
   the document does n't mention foreign policy . 
  on that point , i do n't agree -- it does talk about working toward unifying foreign policy . 
     now it will take huge bribes to smooth feelings . 
    ... changing the euro to target unemployment like the federal reserve or the bank of england ... ... you 're saying that operating like the uk or the us does is bribing people ? 
   they want to create a federal superstate . 
  `` they '' being france and germany ? 
  sure , i agree , at least incorporating france and germany and anyone else who wants to federalize . 
  but that was never a secret , right ? 
   they tricked the brits into thinking they could leave while the british political elites are actually not in favour of it . 
  < blinks  the british * can * leave , from the standpoint of the uk-eu relationship . 
  if you mean tricked the british public into thinking that the british leadership was fine with leaving ... okay , i do n't follow the media in europe , so maybe i 'm missing a lot of messages being put out , but as far as i can tell , if anyone gave that impression to british voters , it was a subset of british politicians , not the eu . 
   as a result , the brits are now in limbo , and all the signals that have been given up to know , from johnson to corbyn , are indicating that they will not go through with leave . 
  the only limbo that exists is internally , in the british political system . 
  from the standpoint of the eu leave mechanism , the uk has not initiated a leave . 
   this means that if the eu superstate goes through , the british are now in .
