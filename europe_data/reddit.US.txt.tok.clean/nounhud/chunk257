  sorry , i forgot that you guys use the term `` government '' to mean what we mean when we say `` administration '' . 
  `` no country is * forever * . '', 
  ah , good point . 
  there currently are n't any polls out to support the idea that a * substantial * chunk of the electorate truly did not understand until after the referendum the implications of what they were voting on . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's not a plausible idea , but there is n't hard data -- right now , it 's a couple of anecdotes and a twitter hashtag . 
  however , if it turns out that that is the case , above-and-beyond this referendum , i think that it 's a very strong argument for reforming the processes around referendums in the future . 
  well , degree-level educated professionals wanted remain , so you 're probably pretty representative of that group . 
  bottom of the ocean is n't well-known . 
   subbed to / r/unitedkingdom and / r/europe as i understand it , / r/unitedkingdom will generally have a center-left , pro-eu position from the uk 's standpoint , and / r/europe an eu-friendly position ( though there are folks from across the spectrum ) . 
  there 's also / r/ukpolitics , which i believe is closer to center -- more people enthusiastic about leave there . 
   the rest of the eu members have already made clear that they will not accept that i think that would be an unwise move for other eu members on multiple levels . 
  ** first ** , successfully-recovering a brexit would be a win for the eu . 
  yes , i think that it 's unlikely too , but it would be a tremendous political recovery . 
  ** second ** , the referendum is , after all , a matter of british internal governance , not an eu-specified affair . 
  the only thing that matters from an eu standpoint is article 50 invocation . 
  the uk * could * have chosen to have a referendum kick it off , a prime minister simply trigger it , or control could be given to the queen . 
  it could even be that the uk chooses to flip a coin each decade to determine whether to brexit . 
  attempts to control internal uk political processes would be exceeding the eu 's scope of authority , and be a poor precedent within the eu -- do you want members pressuring other members on internal matters of procedure ? 
  this was a non-binding referendum -- is the eu going to * de facto * declare a non-binding referendum binding , and specify how a government should deal with it ? 
  that would be extremely inadvisable , i think . 
  if cameron steps down and all of the uk 's party leaders stand up and say `` we misjudged the public 's depth of concern over immigration and we will offer a subsidy to workers who suffer wage drops or unemployment cuts as well as government-funded retraining , which we all commit to supporting '' , and it goes to a referendum and passes , surely that 's a better outcome for the eu ? 
  ** third ** , i think that it would be quite dangerous to start playing with the idea of forcing members out . 
  there is a reason that the eu does not have a mechanism for other members to boot out a member -- because the people constructing it did not think it was a good idea . 
  i could understand , perhaps , in the event of some sort of overwhelming emergency , bending rules , but the uk remaining an eu member -- even if temporarily -- does not represent a dire political threat to the eu . 
  to start evicting members would mean that coalitions could force out members ... that seems very dangerous to me indeed .

  well , no government is * forever * . 
  even san marino . 
  whether-or-not the eurozone has worked well , the tiered nature of the euro - and non-euro areas does seem to have worked well , yes ? 
  that is , they did n't really wind up interfering with each other ? 
   the problems with referendums are n't specific to europe ; they 're universal to the human race . 
  yeah ... but the frequency with which they are scheduled does seem to me to be relatively-high in europe . 
   people want easy answers . 
  a world that 's black and white . 
  i agree , and that that 's probably not realistic . 
   they want answers that appeal to their gut , not their intellect . 
  i think that having gut questions may be surprisingly reasonable . 
  as i put in [ more detail to my other response ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4psqms/nigel_farage_said_5248_result_should_lead_to_a/d4nu6nw ) , i think that the things that direct democracy does best on is on extracting * values * from people . 
  you want to give people two choices and see which feels better to them . 
  you do n't need the intellect of voters running the same computation in their head each time . 
  if your choice necessarily involves analysis , i think it makes sense to have experts enumerate the tradeoffs and how they impact the voter , and let the voter choose between package a or package b , again letting their gut make that decision . 
  a person with a few minutes in a voting booth is n't the best place to have people doing deep analysis . 
  and ... well , it 's not very efficient to ask every person in the country , maybe millions upon millions of people , to have to re-run their own analysis . 
  if you ca n't reduce a vote to something like that , i 'm a lot more enthusiastic about representative democracy , where you can afford the time to provide the person actually going over the options with a high level of familiarity of what he 's voting on . 
  that much is . 
  but did the voter understand : * what impact this will have on immigration from outside the eu ? 
  * what impact this will have on immigration from inside the eu ? 
  * what impact this will most-likely have on uk business and employment ? 
  what will happen to my real wages ? 
  * what impact will this likely have on the unified uk ? 
  * what impact will this have on my ability to travel within the eu ? 
  the idea of a vote , aside from building political capital for something , is to transfer a voter 's values into policy . 
  it 's hard to make a value judgment if the voter does n't understand what he 's trading in terms of things that affect him . 
  and that means that if the most-effective route to winning a vote is to propagate misleading ideas , that 's what you 're going to get . 
  and even if you get a result that you like that way , you may wind up with angry , cynical people afterward if they do n't get what they thought that they were voting on . 
  my guess , without data available , is that most people voting `` leave '' here thought that they were eliminating all of their job competition in the uk in exchange for decreasing the size of the overall pie by some ill-defined , probably-not-that-serious reduction in terms of employment . 
  and they considered that trade to be a worthwhile one and made a value judgment on it . 
  if that is n't the outcomes that they were actually voting on ... you might manage to get them to * accept * the outcome by saying `` well ... you should have informed yourself better '' . 
  but in this case , i think that many people across europe , as well as the uk , may regret the outcome now or when they understand what it amounts to . 
  and that seems like a rather dysfunctional process , if the vote amounts to producing an outcome that none of the groups involved actually wanted . 
  and this is n't assigning blame or anything . 
  i 'm just saying that if you have a process that does n't seem to take into account human factors very well ... something might be said to be wrong with the process . 
  edit : note that i 'm not saying that the us does this right -- as i said , i 've been very underwhelmed with the results of direct democracy in the past here as well . 
  i think that direct democracy works the best when it can most-directly translate someone 's values into a set of understood options . 
  things like , say , aesthetics -- while an expert could contribute * something * to the discussion on which flag is better ( e.g. 
  remember that the flag should be recognizable at a distance , certain symbols are offensive to some cultures , that it should n't look like another flag , that there may be value in making it easy to see whether it 's upside-down , etc ) , people can make a judgment about what appeals to them pretty easily . 
  but if i ask someone to decide whether their country should use train or air transportation ... that 's a question that really involves a lot of fairly-complex tradeoffs . 
  it really needs a lot of expert input . 
  and if that * must * be converted into a direct democracy vote , then i 'd rather have all of the expert information extracted and placed down in a form that is as simple-as-possible on the page -- e.g. 
  `` this will cost your state about this much , you about this much ; it will be faster for people traveling from x to y but slower from people from y to z '' . 
  at that point , the vote amounts to making a value judgment between a set of benefits on one hand and a set of benefits on the other . 
  i realize that it 's controversial to come up with an official set of plusses and minuses for a ballot , but to simply punt on it because it 's hard is n't great either . 
  and looking at the discussion ... i do n't just mean the `` if we vote to stay , turkey is joining '' thing that 's been making the rounds here , but it did n't really seem to me that leave or stay did a very competent job of providing that list of salient points . 
  there was n't even an estimation of the impact on business and employment . 
  people * complained * about the 350m pound/week number as being misleading ... but i think that the reason that people latched onto it was because it was the * only * real number i saw widely-provided . 
  if that 's all you have in terms of concrete information , you make the best decision you can with what you have . 
  regardless of what happens ( and if it 's recoverable , i 'll be amazed but delighted ) , i think that something really needs to be done about direct democracy in europe . 
  that 's now greece and the uk where direct votes have arguably been used where voters did n't get clear , accurate choice a versus clear accurate choice b. 
  we do n't have direct democracy at the federal level here , and when it 's happened at the state level , i 've been really disappointed at the degree of understanding over the implications of a vote . 
  maybe there needs to be a better way to express upset or something . 
  maybe there needs to be a better mechanism to ensure that voters are better-informed . 
  or maybe there just plain needs to be fewer direct votes in favor of representative votes . 
  i do n't think i 'm biased here because i do n't like the outcome -- it 's because i think that people wound up making a choice that they did n't understand the implications of and did n't like and which was a serious one . 
  you sure that he was n't referring to things like the constitutional referendum ? 
  what would you want the eu to do ? 
  `` eroded '' has kind of a negative connotation . 
  britain acquired tea and curry from its international involvement . 
  does that make britain worse off ? 
  http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nsaebb/nsaebb374/ has more material . 
  probably should n't have provided a path to leave if you did n't want one . 
  is n't that money from england , routed through the eu ? 
  reagan gave a blank check to the military on it ( `` give maggie whatever she needs '' ) . 
  the only way argentina could win would be to take out a carrier , and we 'd arranged to turn over a us carrier with crew if that happened . 
  also satellite surveillance . 
  i do n't know what was behind the decision not to send ships , other than that the us offered itself as a neutral party to mediate the final outcome , and could n't have swung that as a participant . 
  could have been that thatcher wanted to re-establish the uk 's reputation , too . 
  afaik , there was n't a request that was turned down . 
   ` if you 've got money , you vote in ... if you have n't got money , you vote out '   brexit is about more than the eu : it 's about class , inequality , and voters feeling excluded from politics . 
  so how do we even begin to put britain the right way up ? 
  i assume , given that this is * the guardian * , that the answer is `` give more money '' ?
