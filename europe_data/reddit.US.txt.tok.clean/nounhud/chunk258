  edit : ah , no , the article does n't propose a solution further then asking leading questions . 
  no way of knowing how significant it is . 
  it 's easy to cherry-pick a few opinions . 
  i mean , i think that this is a bad move for the uk ( and the eu ) but that 's not based on any sort of evidence that half of the voters have suddenly decided that they 've made a horrible mistake . 
  the color of a cat does n't matter -- what matters is how well it catches mice . 
  i 'm favoring representative democracy over direct democracy ... 
  i 'd add that the combination of upset and misinformed voters and referendums have caused a lot of eu damage recently in multiple members . 
  yes , it can . 
  none of the moves thus far actually mean anything so far as the legal process goes . 
  theoretically , a uk government could simply say say `` this is a terrible vote and we 're ignoring it '' . 
  in practice , i would imagine that that wo n't happen , even though both sides would , imho , be better-off . 
  london was independent for longer than texas . 
  seems like kind of a silly thing to compete on . 
  you 're both hurting now . 
  i strongly suspect that obama only came to campaign after a cameron request . 
  not the uk 's foreign office . 
  how is he a hostage ? 
  short of ukip taking over , where 's the political threat ? 
  might have been better if this were proposed 24 hours ago . 
  i do n't think we 'd let argentina take the falklands , even if the uk could n't stop it , which i doubt . 
   a version of this piece first appeared in * sputnik news * . 
  well , * counterpunch * has n't changed much since the last time i read it . 
  the us is n't a continent , though . 
  in terms of wealth , it 's [ actually australia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_continents_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) #gdp _ per_capita _ .28 nominal .29 _ by_continents ) at the moment . 
  2 years * after article 50 is invoked * . 
  soo....switzerland-uk bloc ? 
  ... he did n't say `` there is no need to invoke article 50 immediately '' , but rather `` there is no need to invoke article 50 '' . 
  * the new yorker * is what it is . 
  you do n't read it if you do n't want the sort of content that it puts out . 
  well , any one vote really does n't . 
  public good problem , really . 
  going to change your flair or [ use it in its original sense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe ) ? 
   i hope the rest of the eu falls so we can all start to heal and maybe build better relations between each one of us . 
  i 'd say that 's a pretty costly way to try to do that . 
  not le pen ? 
   bringing back manufacturing tariffs into any developed nation is just a matter of tariffs . 
  in dollar terms , the us [ still has a manufacturing economy bigger than ever ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-manufacturing-dead-output-has-doubled-in-three-decades-2016-03-28 ) . 
  in job count terms , it 's collapsed . 
  the manual-labor-heavy manufacturing economy that used to exist for low-education workers is simply dead . 
  technology and the development of the undeveloped world has made it irrelevant . 
  if british workers were hoping to recreate that , they 're going to need to cut their standard of living to indonesian standards to be wage-competitive . 
   people sometimes call it the united states of europe . 
  ultimately i think that will occur because it 's such a cool idea . 
  that argument is ... perhaps a bit less-data-driven than one might want . 
   five more years of worthless undemocratic compromises , well , this was democratic . 
  there was a ( in the uk , very slow ) shift towards increased favor of the eu . 
  the margin was not large here , and it 's unlikely that such a perfect storm of factors would have come up together at the same time . 
  plus , silicon valley got its name from when there was hardware fabrication in the area . 
  it 's mostly software now -- the area successfully reinvented itself and switched industries , but the name lives on ... 
  ireland and the uk cut a lot of special deals . 
  the us and canada have been living pretty comfortably next to each other for two centuries . 
  you could do that or you could start a senseless feud . 
  [ pew research center : u.s. 
  politics & policy ] ( http://www.people-press.org/2016/05/05/6-nato-u-s-allies-the-eu-and-un/ )  by large margins , the american public has positive views of nato , the north atlantic treaty organization . 
  ** fully 77 % say being a member is good for the u.s. ** , and by about a two-to one-margin , more say they have a favorable view of nato than an unfavorable one ( 53 % vs. 25 % ) . 
  yet the u.s. public is about equally likely to say the alliance is more important to its non-u.s. members ( 37 % ) as to say it is about as important to the u.s. as it is to other member nations ( 41 % ) . 
  few ( 15 % ) consider the nato alliance to be of more import to the u.s. than it is to other member countries . 
  it would be very unpopular . 
  in a global sense , you 've still got it pretty good . 
  and those same people had to put up with the same thing when they were young . 
  whether or not that 's a good idea , i disagree about it applying to the membership of countries . 
  you have no idea how long a country or union will last , and it could easily be far longer than a lifetime . 
  well , at least there 's a silver lining . 
   when the uk has a minimum wage of # 9 ( ~ $ 13 ) i do n't think that the minimum wage is really all that relevant one way or the other . 
  if you have a high supply of labor relative to demand for that labor , it could either be expressed through greatly-depressed wages or through unemployment , but it 's going to still show up for workers in some way . 
   always the same promises - the people will have the power , the working class will finally be heard , the elite will be displaced . 
  when in history has this ever actually happened ? 
  well , mostly [ in violent revolutions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peasants%27_revolt ) , i suspect . 
  but the monarchy and aristocracy was displaced peacefully in much of europe . 
  i 'm not disputing that the vote here was probably not in the uk 's interests . 
  i just do n't think that dubious should be so bitter . 
   you guys should just take trump off our hands [ i mean , they tried to bump him off less than a week ago ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/21/michael-sandford-trump-rally-assassination-las-vegas ) . 
  what do you want from them ? 
   no more poles , latvians and lithuanians tuking yer jerbs . 
  do you really expect much good will in the east when everyone knows what this referendum was all about ? 
  could have been anyone in the world , dubious . 
  how many people are enthusiastic about people coming in and competing for their jobs ? 
  cultural or language shift where they live ? 
  is latvia enthusiastic about muslim immigration ? 
  the us has gotten cheesed off over every big wave of immigration to happen . 
  if you want to be angry at the uk for being human , it 's pointless . 
  if you want to be angry at the uk for doing a bad job of managing its political structures ... okay , but it 's probably going to hurt them more than it will you . 
  the us 's early history had its central government collapse and a civil war , with a third of the thing splitting off . 
  as things go , i 'd say that the eu 's gone pretty smoothly . 
  is this ideal from an eu standpoint ? 
  but it 's something that you work with . 
   the ditch digging morons in to neo-proletariat morons ... by throwing a wrench in the machinery , whilst having a stupid hopeful look on their face . 
  [ snip ]  that being said , i , and i 'm sure many others , will from today on , pay very close attention to everything i buy , just to make sure it was n't manufactured in the uk . 
  i know feelings are running high , but come on , read what you just wrote . 
  to be fair , so did the ireland independence and the falling apart of the british empire . 
  i do n't see another referendum happening , but in that hypothetical world , what would the eu have to do with the uk holding another ? 
  if your income and assets are in canadian dollars , probably would have been better to have waited , if you 'd had advance knowledge . 
  but you did n't , and if you spend all your time wishing that you 'd have had advance knowledge , you passed up purchasing volatile stocks that would have made much more money -- and that 's the case every day . 
  no sense living in senseless regrets -- was a reasonable decision at the time . 
  i 'm assuming that he 's a londoner talking about reviving the thousand-year-old independent london . 
  macron 's rather-nasty quotes probably did not help remain 's case in the run-up . 
  nah , man , [ get with the times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_border_and_coast_guard ) . 
   that backward shithole you call a continent err . 
  for the bulk of the past several hundred years , europe has been the wealthiest and most technologically-advanced part of the world . 
  and even when it was n't , it was still doing pretty well .
