  there is n't a country starting with `` bre '' either , but you still had `` brexit '' . 
  france 's economy minister , macron , has been giving various [ less than diplomatic statements ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-macron-idukkcn0xe0fy ) for some time . 
  not sure how many votes that affected , but i doubt that it helped remain . 
  i do n't really think that people see the problem as a lack of turnout -- after all , as turnouts go , this was relatively solid -- and more than the outcome was n't what they wanted ... and wistfully thinking of a different outcome that might have come from a higher turnout . 
  * there were some people who said on here that they did n't feel well-informed enough to make a good call . 
  that 's probably a lot more honest than most -- i doubt that most people * were * making a call based on the best understanding of the consequences . 
  * [ tragedy of the commons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy_of_the_commons ) . 
  the consequence of any one individual with a particular viewpoint not voting is not large . 
  in aggregate , many people with that viewpoint do not vote . 
   kinda dreading coming in to work . 
  the way things are going , * that * may be a self-resolving problem ... 
  well , let me remember the ones that people have talked about on here in the run-up : * workers in the uk , especially low-education ones , concerned about low-wage workers from other countries exerting wage pressure on their jobs . 
  * the eu being used as something of a political scapegoat to get through unpopular-with-the-public-but-wanted-by-the-leadership policies . 
  * people who established the single market ( and thus right to free movement and labor ) without also establishing brakes on grants of citizenship -- this means that countries had to accept whoever other members chose to give citizenship to , whether via asylum or other mechanisms . 
  * the refugee crisis . 
  to the extent that there was involvement from policy-makers , it would have been from national leaders ( and i 'd include merkel here ) , not eu leaders . 
  * perhaps the prospect of a ukraine accession without having sold the public on it first . 
  i do n't know how serious uk concerns are here , but i would imagine that it did n't help . 
  i do n't think that corbyn is the sole cause of brexit either , any more than `` merkel and the heads of the eu '' -- i think that both you and / u/numbchicken are providing an over-simplified case . 
  it 's why i said '' * any * one party '' causing brexit would be too simplistic . 
  in london ? 
  the topic 's come up on this forum before , and i 've strongly-advocated for relaxing construction restrictions : to make height restrictions less-tough . 
  that means that the skyline will change , of course , but if you 've n people who need housing , instead of making them fight over too-small of a supply , it makes more sense to just let builders build more -- as they happily will , as long as housing prices are above the cost of construction . 
  [ new york suffers from similar construction restrictions ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-skyscrapers-can-save-the-city/308387/ ) , as does [ san francisco ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/11/san_francisco_zoning_needs_more_density_and_tall_buildings.html ) , and both have relatively-high housing costs as us cities go as well . 
  on a referendum on membership in a supranational organization , though ? 
  that might be more-normal -- that 's a pretty important vote . 
  [ puerto rico 's statehood referendum in 2012 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rican_status_referendum,_2012 ) had 78 % turnout . 
  on the other hand , better fish-and-chips and curry . 
  and the accent . 
  `` strength '' does n't refer to the absolute count of units , which is not very interesting -- you could have chosen the cent instead of the dollar as the base unit of us currency , and it would n't change anything . 
  it refers to the relative shift -- if three days ago a dollar bought more yen than it does today , the dollar is `` weakening '' relative to the yen . 
  well , you know your country better than i do . 
  they promised to honor the referendum on ukranian association , though . 
  that phrase needs to be further [ snowcloned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snowclone ) . 
  we [ actually tried it briefly in the phillippines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippines#colonial_era_.281521-1946.29 ) between 1898 and 1934 :  the islands were ceded by spain to the united states as a result of the latter 's victory in the spanish -- american war . 
  [ 113 ] a compensation of 20 million us dollars was paid to spain according to the terms of the 1898 treaty of paris . 
  [ 114 ] as it became increasingly clear the united states would not recognize the nascent first philippine republic , the philippine -- american war broke out , the first republic was defeated , and the archipelago was administered under an insular government . 
  [ 115 ] the war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians , mostly from a cholera epidemic . 
  [ 119 ]   the americans then suppressed other rebellious sub-states : mainly , the waning sultanate of sulu , as well as the insurgent tagalog republic , the cantonal republic of negros in the visayas , and the republic of zamboanga in mindanao . 
  [ 122 ] during this era , a renaissance in philippine culture occurred , with the expansion of philippine cinema and literature . 
  was n't all that great . 
  people do n't like being colonized much . 
  fighting ongoing guerrilla wars costs money . 
  better to just cut mutually-advantageous deals for whatever it is that you want instead of forcing through a one-sided deal and then having to constantly beat the other side up over it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tydings%e2%80%93mcduffie_act  the tydings -- mcduffie act , officially the philippine independence act ( pub.l . 
  73 -- 127 , 48 stat . 
  456 , enacted march 24 , 1934 ) is a united states federal law that established the process for the philippines , an american colony , to become an independent country after a ten-year transition period . 
  in the long term , the eu is more important , i think . 
  nato can stop an invasion , but it 's not going to cause people to think of themselves as being one group . 
  okay , it does n't have to be the eu , but if europe hypothetically started splitting into fragments that do n't want to associate with each other ... nato just would n't be able to * do * much about that . 
  and outside of europe and north america , nato is n't involved . 
  some of the major nato powers ( us , uk , maybe france in particular ) might do things overseas , but it would n't be within the scope of nato . 
  nor do i really think it * should * be , since some members in nato simply would n't want to sign up for that . 
   is socialism still far left in europe [ socialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism ) was always left -- what people are typically referring to when they say `` center left '' in europe is ( capitalist ) [ social democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy ) . 
   a good start for the eu would be to seek an immediate recall of juncker as he has greatly contributed to this mess . 
  how so ? 
  he 's only been in office since the end of 2014 . 
  he did n't arrange the referendum , and my understanding is that the eu 's leadership has taken a smaller role than member state leaders in driving most crisis response . 
  i do n't agree . 
  i think that most people , not simply cameron , believed that the referendum would be remain , given the information available at the time they agreed to do it . 
  why is it that wilders , trump , and boris johnson all have that similar hair thing going on ? 
  that being said , the brexit referendum was n't binding either , but my understanding is that it is considered extraordinarily-unlikely that the government will move against its wishes . 
  good grief . 
  that 's just amazing . 
   countries like finland were not `` unusual '' in being in the third world ( political sense ) and being well-off ? 
  sure they were . 
  [ here 's the map of the first , second , and third world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:cold_war_alliances_mid-1975.svg ) in 1975 . 
  here 's a ( first historic world map that came up in a search ) [ 1965 nominal gdp map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  the only top per-capita gdp bracket countries in the third world are , what , finland , sweden , switzerland , and kuwait ? 
  the only second-highest per-capita gdp bracket countries in the third world were austria , yugoslavia , colombia , and ireland . 
   any more so than turkey , which strictly belonged to the first world and was a poor shithole until very recently . 
  sure , and turkey was unusual in that as well . 
  over time , the term `` second world '' simply died out -- i have never actually heard it used in any kind of an income context aside from the german commenter above -- and `` third world '' was used as a euphemism for `` poor countries '' . 
   you genuinely think that first world was about being wealthy no . 
  i think that the first world was about being allied with the us , uk , france , and the other countries in the west . 
  it later became used as a shorthand for being wealthy . 
  in the long run , the eu matters far more wrt russia 's involvement in eastern europe than nato does . 
  nato might forestall russian military involvement , but in the long term , it 's movement of population and economies that matter . 
  i suspect that there are going to be a lot of faqs and statements made on the question in the very near future , given the number of people affected . 
  my own , personal feeling is that the eu and the uk will probably find some mechanism to grandfather people who are living and working in the other area -- it would be disruptive to both sides not to do so . 
  well , if you wanted collapsing real estate prices , that should certainly happen ... though it 's kind of an overkill way to get there if that 's what you wanted , i think . 
  well , they would n't have automatic rights to live in spain the way they did when the uk was in the european union . 
  / r/russia is in a cheery mood , at any rate . 
   stuff usa forced eu to do is direct assault such as ? 
  on the upside , the euro had gotten pretty close to one dollar , and now the pound sterling is heading in that direction too . 
  this is going to make doing rough mental price conversions a lot easier . 
  mind , there [ has been a long history of that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partition_and_secession_in_new_york ) . 
  how 's it going , texas ? 
  that 's * overstating * it . 
  * that was about a third of the us in population . 
  this is about 12 % of the eu ( though a larger chunk of the economy ) . 
  * that was a unilateral exit . 
  the eu has already agreed to let members leave . 
  it was also a violent exit . 
  it 's closer to something like a bit over one california leaving . 
  the uk is about 14.6 % of the eu gdp . 
  california is about 11.8 % of the us gdp . 
  the uk is about 12.8 % of the eu population . 
  california is 12 % of the us population . 
  not sure whether you 're talking about the guy who said 50 % + 1 or the guy who said 50 % - 1 .
