  everyone has dirt , and the brits do this [ adorable thing with hobbit-hole-looking cob ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cob_%28material%29 ) that , whatever the labor expense and other benefits and drawbacks , probably insulates the hell out of things and provides a ton of thermal mass . 
  just got ta make a robot capable of self-setup at a site that can use dirt and construct a dwelling like that to get rid of labor costs ... 
  in colder environments in the us , bricks are more-common than in warmer ones , and i 'd always thought that they had an impact on thermal mass at least ( since most people dislike temperature extremes and that presumably gives you a zero-energy-input-post-construction reduction in temperatures swings between day and night ) . 
  [ median disposable per-capita income after ppp adjustment ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/166211/worldwide-median-household-income-000.aspx ) . 
  median focuses on the mid-range and ignores the people with extremes of wealth or poverty . 
  disposable income filters out things like `` the state pays for x in country a but not b '' , per-capita takes care of `` some households have more people in them in country a but not b '' , and ppp takes care of `` you need to purchase some things that are more-expensive to provide in country a than b to maintain the same standard of living '' . 
   the real fucker is the transmission costs that does n't reflect actual losses . 
  i was digging up us losses due to transmission , and it 's on the order of a couple percent ... and given europe 's higher population density , it 's almost assuredly less over there . 
   finland in its infinite wisdom thought that it would be a good idea to sell state run infrastructure to private investors . 
  the us ( privately-run systems ) has [ comparatively-cheap electrical costs ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/electricity-rates-around-the-world.html ) , and finland is apparently even lower . 
  the uk is 50 % higher than the us , and italy and germany about 100 % higher . 
  i guess they could [ use sublimation ] ( http://natlands.typepad.com/nlt_preserve_blog/2010/02/mariton-thank-goodness-for-sublimation.html ) :  finally , you can line dry laundry in the middle of winter because of sublimation . 
  maureen and i have n't used a clothes dryer for over a decade . 
  we line dry year ` round . 
  in fact , we got rid of our dryer to use the space for something else . 
  line drying laundry is just one way we try to reduce our energy footprint . 
  in the winter , it is actually more efficient than most people realize ( because of sublimation ) . 
  if we do laundry after work and hang it out in the evening it is frozen before we finish hanging it up . 
  but some of the lighter items will be totally dry in the morning . 
  most everything , including jeans , will be dry that evening . 
  the frozen water in your clothes goes into water vapor and laundry literally freeze dries . 
  in fact , it dries more quickly if the temperature does n't go above freezing . 
  the `` sublimation is faster than evaporation '' thing sounds sketchy to me , but i 'll believe that it can be done year round . 
  probably do n't have to worry about mildew in winter , either ... 
   electricity is the least common source of energy for heating as it 's the most expensive one so i would n't attribute electricity usage to house insulation . 
  ya , though the us peaks in electrical consumption during summer rather than winter , and almost all cooling ( barring the rare [ swamp cooler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swamp_cooler ) or the like ) is electrical a/c . 
  the clothes dryer thing i was completely-unaware of . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  that 's interesting , particularly given the widespread deployment of 240v in europe ; i 'd think that it 'd be even easier to deploy clothes dryers . 
  just out of curiosity , do you have an opinion on why folks in , say , poland , would n't go in for clothes dryers ? 
  the noise produced , the initial cost , the electrical cost of operation , the fact that they tend to put stress on clothes and reduce their lifetime ( though they do make for fluffier , softer clothes ... my few experiences with line-dried clothes have been that they are stiff ) ? 
  widespread use of clothing types ( e.g. 
  natural wool ) that are not particularly dryer-friendly ? 
  also , interesting trivia tidbit that i like : while south korea and japan seem like they would be similar , south korea makes use of insulation in construction . 
  japan has historically not used insulation ( single-pane windows , no insulation in exterior walls ) , and instead makes use of heaters and [ * kotatsu * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kotatsu ) :  a kotatsu ( \u70ac\u71f5 ? ), 
  is a low , wooden table frame covered by a futon , or heavy blanket , upon which a table top sits . 
  underneath is a heat source , often built into the table itself . 
  [ 1 ] kotatsu are used almost exclusively in japan , although similar devices are used elsewhere . 
  [ snip ]  most japanese housing is not insulated to the same degree as a western domicile and do not have central heating , thus relying primarily on space heating . 
  heating is expensive because of the lack of insulation and the draftiness of housing . 
  [ snip ]  during the winter months in japan , the kotatsu often is the center of domestic life . 
  in the evening family members gather around the kotatsu to enjoy food , television , games , and conversation while keeping the lower half of their bodies warm . 
  while western-style exterior insulation has ( slowly ) been spreading , it 's [ still not the norm ] ( http://www.wideislandview.com/2009/11/08/the-japanese-way-no-insulation-no-central-heating/ ) . 
  i do n't know how much goes to home climate control , but i 'll certainly believe a difference , though i do n't know how much is due to insulation . 
  * [ the average anglosphere house floor footage ( excluding the uk , which is very small ) is on the order of twice that of europe ] ( http://www.elledecor.com/life-culture/fun-at-home/news/a7654/house-sizes-around-the-world/ ) . 
  the rate of heat transfer increases proportionally to surface area ( and in inverse proportion to the thickness of insulation ) . 
  * air conditioning is spreading but [ still not the norm in europe ] ( http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/hotter-days-but-much-of-europe-still-cool-toward-air-conditioning/ ) .

  i suppose that one could say that africa settled the entire world . 
  [ telegraph : replace * god save the queen * with new english national anthem , urge mps ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12096839/replace-god-save-the-queen-with-new-english-national-anthem-urge-mps.html ), 
  re : the [ categorical imperative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/categorical_imperative ) ( `` only accept a moral rule if you can apply it to everyone '' ) , it seems like a pretty meaningless restriction on moral codes . 
  i should be able to rewrite any moral requirement that fails the categorical imperative by adding a clause to it that makes it exclude the people in question ; then i can globally-apply the moral requirement to all . 
  for example :  people should be able to marry . 
  okay , that 's certainly the subject of some moral dispute . 
  let 's see if it passes the categorical imperative ... nope !, 
  we are n't applying it to everyone !, 
  only heterosexuals . 
  now let 's rephrase :  people should be able to marry those with whom they can produce viable offspring . 
  ooops . 
  suddenly , we 've got a statement with identical effect to the statement that failed the categorical imperative , which we can globally apply and thus passes the categorical imperative ... simply because we 've added a qualifier that has the same * effect * as * not * universally-applying the rule . 
  or should we phrase the rule like this ? 
   people should be able to marry those that they love . 
  hmm . 
  * that * passes the categorical imperative ... but that moral rule , same-sex marriage gets a thumbs up . 
  i make the following claim : for * any * moral rule which fails the categorical imperative , there exists a moral rule which passes the categorical imperative which has the same real-world effect as the failing rule . 
  if my claim is true , this renders the categorical imperative ineffective as a standard for selecting moral rules . 
  i love these guys : they 're hillarious . 
   not to mention that his argument of `` they will find employment elsewhere '' simply does n't hold true in today 's economy . 
  while i would certainly say that they would , that was not part of friedman 's argument . 
  he compared people in export industries losing their jobs in one case to people in the steel industry losing their jobs in the other . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant  isil has detailed its goals in its dabiq magazine , saying it will continue to seize land and take over the entire earth until its :    blessed flag ... covers all eastern and western extents of the earth , filling the world with the truth and justice of islam and putting an end to the falsehood and tyranny of jahiliyyah [ state of ignorance ] , even if american and its coalition despise such . 
    -- 5th edition of dabiq , the islamic state 's english-language magazine [ 191 ] they 're not going to get very far with that effort if customs stumps 'em . 
  seems kind of insulting to ignore us . 
  i 'm pretty confident that bdsm is n't independent of culture . 
  while the rules are typically more stringent for muslims than for christians , it 's not as if the non-muslim world does n't have its own modesty requirements . 
  in ancient minoa , proper wear for women might have a [ full length dress , with the breasts exposed ] ( http://www.nmia.com/~jaybird/thomasbakerpaintings/ancient_minoan_costumes.html ) . 
  there are peoples in africa where public nudity has been normal . 
  if you try doing either in much of europe or the us , not only will you be subject to social ostracism , you 'll probably be arrested , and have the government impose a set of society-mandated modesty requirements on you . 
   still , it 's in such bad taste to see such cars when the country is so poor . 
  i think the number of luxury cars in chisinau might actually be equal to bucharest , i really would n't be surprised . 
  [ wikipedia : conspicuous consumption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspicuous_consumption ) :  sociologically , conspicuous consumption was thought to comprise socio-economic behaviours practiced by rich people ; yet , economic research indicated that conspicuous consumption is a socio-economic behaviour common to the poor social-classes and economic groups , and common to the societies of countries with emerging economies . 
  that among such people , displays of wealth are used to psychologically combat the impression of poverty , usually because such men and women belong to a socio-economic class society perceives as poor . 
  [ 4 ] in the millionaire next door : the surprising secrets of america 's wealthy ( 1996 ) , thomas j. stanley and william d. danko reported that americans with a net worth of more than one million dollars are likely to avoid conspicuous consumption . 
  that millionaires tend to practice frugality , e.g. 
  prefer to buy used cars with cash rather than new cars with credit , in order to avoid material depreciation and paying interest for a loan to buy a new car . 
   it 's ukraine that will be doomed to exist in limbo between russia and the eu unable to fully trade with either . 
  i do n't understand . 
  ( a ) this is n't a binding referendum , though i can understand the idea that politically going against it might be unwise . 
  ( b ) ukraine is talking about a trade agreement at the moment , not membership . 
  would ukraine like to join the eu some years down the road ? 
  sure , i strongly suspect so . 
  but it 's not as if a referendum today is going to have much effect on a dutch government twenty years down the line , right ? 
  how is this dooming ukraine ? 
  right -- but what i mean is that for * any * statement , if you can say :  being for x ? 
  who is n't ? 
  it probably is n't a terribly meaningful political position . 
  i 'm not willing to say that a society where we try to strongly-control the executive and the legislature via the judiciary could n't exist and work well , but i think that it would be a very different one from the one that exists today , and i certainly see some pretty substantial risks . 
  whoever could `` capture '' the judiciary would have a terrific amount of political clout , and certainly the judiciary is not very directly-responsible to the public , so there 's a possibility that interests would diverge , with all the friction that that would entail . 
  well , if you 're requiring less government spending as a requirement , i will concede that it 's probably going to be somewhat-difficult to find ( economically ) - left ideas . 
  i do n't think that / u/samiumabisare is making that requirement , though .
