  the us got a bunch of polish immigrants when times were hard in poland . 
  at the time , people protested about jobs . 
  but no catastrophe happened , and now nobody cares . 
  same process with almost every immigrant group . 
  that being said , you guys * did * manage to maintain catalonia , scotland , the gypsies , and so forth as separate national groups , so maybe there 's an argument that it would n't be the same . 
  in what way is ttip ( or ceta ) more objectionable than any of the existing eu free trade agreements ?

  i dunno if i 'd call canada `` tiny '' -- at 36m , she 's over half the size of france . 
  impossibility today , maybe . 
  but down the line ? 
  well ... i mean , it 's a trade deal . 
  certainly i can see it enabling liberal economics -- it 's certainly not marxist , say . 
  but ... i do n't really see how a trade deal has much to do with societal progressivism or dissolution of the nation-state other than in the most indirect terms , like maybe facilitating products containing cultural material from the outside to come in . 
  i mean , it 's not as if the trade negotiators are making deals on marriage conditions or religion or whatever . 
  for the liberal bit ... if i understand correctly here , your concern is that , say , adopting liberal trade practices would be undesirable to someone for whom trade is ideologically-objectionable , like a communist party or something like that ? 
  will you have the right to live and work in france ?

  clearly poor color choice -- the designer confusingly-enough used red instead of green . 
  inequality increasing does n't mean that people are getting poorer , though ( at least not in an absolute sense ) , though it 's compatible with it .

  was some local business group . 
  the artwork is real though ( as well as the bit about the huge horse statue with the glowing red eyes killing its creator ) . 
   and it would go further the way it is going for some time : countries are getting richer , but somehow people are getting poorer . 
  [ well ... ] ( http://www.progressive-economy.org/trade_facts/polands-per-capita-income-has-doubled-since-1989/ )  ` real wages : ' poland 's per capita income , measured by purchasing power , was about $ 11,300 in 1989 . 
  ( using 2014 dollars for convenience , although the zloty remains in place despite ash 's worries . ), 
  this was about a third of french income . 
  by the time poland joined the eu in 2004 , real wages were just under $ 17,000 . 
  a decade later -- the foreign ministry describes the eu experience as `` a civilisational leap forward '' -- they are at $ 24,400 and two-thirds of the way to parity with france . 
  would you not consider that people becoming wealthier ? 
  all right , so let me ask the obvious question -- why is it that europe 's negotiators would be corrupt and sell out to canada , but canadian negotiators would be honest and not sell out to europe ?

  hmm . 
  could you be more-concrete ? 
  that is , in what way do you feel they will not serve their public 's interests ? 
   but how can you help people that are trying so hard , to stay where they are forever , they 're throwing away any helping hand , * is * ukraine trying to stay where she is ? 
  [ i do n't know if `` openly '' is quite the word i 'd use ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/03/04/285653335/putin-says-those-arent-russian-forces-in-crimea ) . 
  you have teams of specialist trade negotiators . 
  do you feel that they do not represent your best interests ? 
  why would they have an incentive to make an arrangement that would be disadvantageous to the eu ? 
  i like being able to purchase things online and have wikipedia and have populated forums and have fast internet service and all the other things that a large userbase permits for . 
  we used * both * child porn * and * terrorism as our justification for monitoring legislation . 
  sure , but eyeballs are a necessary component of adwords working . 
  no eyeballs , adwords are worth less . 
  that difference is potential room for taxation . 
   you ca n't tax online services . 
  sure you can . 
  it might be hard or a bad idea , but google is making money from showing ads to french people . 
  if google is making money , and if france can control google 's access to the french , france can potentially take some of that money . 
  hell , they should play a combined team with ireland too !, 
   to job part is not a problem , it 's more `` they take our homes and our roads ca n't handle this anymore '' . 
  well , that one is fixable . 
  i mean , your roads 50 years ago could n't have handled today 's traffic , either , and our ability to build upwards has greatly-improved . 
  while i agree with you as to inevitability and that it will probably wind up being a net plus ... man , i think that people make bad tattoo and so forth decisions today . 
  can only imagine what happens when they 're choosing someone * else 's * genetic future . 
  i suppose that ireland is the uk 's canada . 
    and let us not forget berlin 's ( as yet ) unopened $ 8billion airport . 
    berlin 's airport was scheduled to open 6 years ago , and has since increased by $ 2.2 billion in total costs . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_blockade#preparing_for_winter  however , france agreed to build a complete , new and larger , airport in its sector , on the shores of lake tegel . 
  french military engineers , managing german construction crews , were able to complete the construction in under 90 days . 
  the airport was mostly built by hand , by thousands of mostly female labourers , who worked day and night . 
  [ 79 ] now , i realize that this dealt with smaller , rugged aircraft , that the standards for `` airport '' was n't quite some huge piece of air-conditioned modern art , that you probably get to ignore a lot of regulations , and that everyone has the incentive of soviet annexation , but good grief , that 's a contrast in the time-to-get-operational . 
  i wonder what the limiting factors are that would keep airports from being * partially * operational -- e.g. 
  `` we do n't have all our stores and we just have some temporary structure as a terminal , only some runways are up , but aircraft can fly in and out and ground transportation is connected , so we can start bringing in revenue '' . 
  the only real objections i can think of is that maybe construction leaves a lot of temporary structures ( scaffolding , etc ) not designed to handle backwash from engines , or leaves a lot of debris around , but you 'd think that there could be reasonable workarounds for both . 
   the referendum has become a way in which they can have their say , and they are saying collectively that their lives have been better than they are today . 
  this might be the popular vote that has the largest impact on the uk in the history of popular referendums . 
  arguing for using this vote as a protest vote does n't seem to me like a very good idea . 
  i mean , there * are * arguments for voting leave , but this is , imho , a bad one . 
  look , i 'm not saying that you ca n't get interesting points from military interviews , but this is kinda dishonest . 
  if you 're going to interview as many military figures as you can , and then cherry-pick the most-alarming bits of the interview ( yes , concern about interior lines is real , but it 's also nothing new and it 's something that about half of the sides in two-sided wars are likely to have as a concern ) , and then make it * sound * as if this is an immediate concern , that 's not really an accurate presentation of nato 's overall position . 
  that 's what people like [ jens stoltenberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jens_stoltenberg ) are for . 
  if stoltenberg says `` nato feels that there is a major imminent risk to europe '' , * that * is something to start getting worried over . 
  i think that maintaining a pipeline through ukraine would have significant political meaning to ukraine . 
   `` why is it so dangerous ? '' mr. tusk asked . 
  `` no one can foresee what the long-term consequences would be . 
  as a historian , i fear that brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the e.u. , but also of western political civilization . '' i sort of know what `` western civilization '' means , but what 's `` western political civilization '' ? 
   the scandinavian countries had free movement of people way before the eu even existed . 
  with all of the other future eu members ? 
   human lives are not numbers i would n't recommend becoming a military leader or working in medicine or insurance . 
  difficult to operate without quantifying things in terms of human lives . 
   and itself is terrible at making trade deals when compared to switzerland for example just out of curiosity , what is it that you would want done differently in trade deal creation ? 
  a few thoughts : * all countries in the eu must trust each other deeply to reliably come to each others ' aid without holding back in any situation or doing things in a fashion that another would n't desire . 
  a country giving up its military to brussels must be certain that that military will never neglect its interests , or use that military in a way contrary to its interests .
