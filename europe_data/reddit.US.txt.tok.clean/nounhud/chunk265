  security guarantees must be credible . 
  nato ( or a nato-like structure ) is `` easier '' for members in this regard in that countries do n't lose militaries -- instead , they are required by treaty to involve themselves if another member is attacked , which is `` safer '' for them . 
  germany would have to face the prospect of being a coalition member in wars overseas ; ireland in fighting in eastern europe and spending on a military ; france and the uk in perhaps being blocked from involvement in situations where they greatly want to intervene ( e.g. 
  if the other members do not want to go to war over the falklands , that must be accepted ) . 
  * the military is , if one is to be blunt , the foundation that lets the other structures exist -- even if it 's not something that one likes to think about in today 's mostly-peaceful world . 
  a country giving up control of the military is turning over the crown jewels , providing absolute control of the country . 
  furthermore , there must be alignment in other areas of that country 's policy , particularly foreign policy . 
  while i am no expert in eu integration , my guess is that control of militaries will be about the last thing to be combined in europe -- that if and when this happens , it will accompany federalization . 
  * it might be possible to have a subset of the eu federalize rather than everything at once , the way a subset adopted the euro . 
  no idea what work has been done along these lines . 
  * there also could be incremental * integration * , even without ceding control . 
  for example , various coalitions operate expensive military hardware or specialize in particular areas today . 
  that 's obviously something that could continue to happen . 
  but for npt conformance ... that 's probably not relevant . 
  as i understand it , the pilots and operators in europe are trained to use them , european warplanes have been modified to use them -- that the us , however , still controls the ability to release them , [ same as it does us-based nuclear weapons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/permissive_action_link ) . 
  wikipedia says [ that some non-europe , non-us , non-ussr countries were not ` let in on ' this interpretation -- that nuclear sharing is acceptable -- at the time that they signed up , and had they been informed , might not have signed the npt at all ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_sharing#nuclear_non-proliferation_treaty_considerations ) . 
  ;-) sorry for being unable to resist the opportunity . 
  ugh , i retract the statement then . 
  i 've read a bunch of that prick 's comments , and they 're chock-full of stupidity . 
  summary notes from listening through :  * america was responsible for ukraine because they like destabilizing countries and profit from war , so they caused ukraine to break away from russia , so russia 's actions in ukraine were just a reaction . 
    * america 's involvement in world war ii was actually with the intent of helping both allies and axis , because they were interested in profiteering . 
    * the objectionable bit in crimea was not the annexation , but that russia seized a lot of private property there in doing so : factories , wineries , etc. 
    * a lot of people in eastern ukraine like russia but not ukraine because ukraine stopped having russian taught and similar things . 
    * this is not the cold war any more , and russia is not the soviet union any more and is not likely to invade the baltics . 
    * one of the primary goals of nato is to have funding . 
  if nato does n't have an enemy , they will be defunded . 
  what if the eu were the successor state to france ? 
  unless france or the uk is merged into it via federalization , i 'd imagine that it would be a [ npt violation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_non-proliferation_of_nuclear_weapons ) . 
  that being said `` allowed '' is kind of a fuzzy term here -- it 'd be fairly-difficult for existing nuclear powers to block a hypothetical eu army from going nuclear even if france and the uk were excluded and the treaty were simply ignored . 
  note that it 's also possible to withdraw from the npt , as in most international treaties , though under limited circumstances ( requires national security emergency and three months notice ; in practice , this apparently is the legal justification for [ nato 's current system where the us transfers authority over us nuclear weapons to various non-nuclear host countries in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_sharing ) if a potentially-nuclear war with the ussr had been imminent . 
   the statement is very revealing of how different putin 's mindset is . 
  he simply ca n't comprehend the inner political workings of the british political system . 
  < doubtful  i suspect that russia has a functioning intelligence system that is n't completely oblivious to the uk . 
   however it is true that the swiss voted in favor of introducing quotas on eu nationals working in switzerland , which is the same as opting out of free movement for eu nationals . 
  was this a binding vote ? 
  if so , what are the penalties for violating eu free movement rules ? 
  what would your preferred policy be ? 
   by john bolton if this is the same [ john bolton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_r._bolton ) that i think it is ( there 's no author bio , so hard to know ) , the [ guy is famous for being less-than-diplomatic about international institutions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voinbs8eodk ) . 
  that 's legal in the uk ? 
   whitehall fears russian football hooligans had kremlin links why , because of the follow-up comments from the russian leadership ? 
  [ wikipedia : hanlon 's razor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanlon%27s_razor )  `` never assume malice when stupidity will suffice '' [ snip ]  a common ( and more laconic ) british english variation , coined by bernard ingham , is the saying `` cock-up before conspiracy '' , deriving from this 1985 quotation :    * many journalists have fallen for the conspiracy theory of government . 
  i do assure you that they would produce more accurate work if they adhered to the cock-up theory . 
  i 'm no photographer , but from a technical standpoint , i like the image -- draws your eye right to the flag and thatcher . 
   sorry , this video can not be viewed from your current location . 
   have you seen practically every world leader ? 
  hmm . 
  what 's wrong with them ? 
  / u/trucidator is probably the most-active and eloquent brexit advocate that i have seen on here , and he uses a british flair . 
   only america has some really good reasons to call itself `` number one '' because if all else fails they still are the only superpower and everywhere in the world us dollar is the most welcome currency . 
  well , that sort of thing is transitory . 
  just over hundred years ago , before world war i kicked off , the united states had a smaller army than portugal did . 
  just after world war i , the uk 's empire involved a fifth of the world 's population . 
  military power is , at the moment , driven by technology . 
  and while the us has something of a technological edge in many areas , information wants to be free \u2122 and that sort of thing relies on continued improvement . 
  much of the rest of the world had either ( a ) trashed itself ( looking at you , europe ) or ( b ) was n't industrialized ( looking at china , india , etc ) . 
  the dollar is popular because it is stable . 
  but stability is n't some intrinsic property of the currency that no other currency has . 
   britain mattered only because it was the key , bridging element between europe and america . 
  the uk is a developed , decent-sized economy . 
  it is technologically-advanced , and well-to-do . 
  it is among the top military and economic powers in the world . 
  it has a pretty liberalized economy . 
  it is not a superpower alone , no , but it can hardly said to be irrelevant . 
  if the uk left , i would say that it would be an important loss to the uk and to the eu ( and the us , for that matter ) . 
  if i lived in the uk , i would vote remain . 
  but i do not think that it would be the end , either . 
  and finally , unless you 're trolling ... while you might take criticism from within the us reasonably well , how well would you take it from someone overseas ? 
  how well do you think insulting the uk is going to go on / r/europe ? 
   they are scathing . 
  do they feel insulted ? 
  because that 's what i was disputing with / u/savannajeff ... 
   pretty much the entire free world is against brexit . 
  with the ( possible , will find out shortly ) exception of the british . 
  i do n't know spain 's history well , but the [ worst air disaster in the history of the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenerife_airport_disaster ) was indirectly caused by [ these guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuerzas_armadas_guanches ) setting bombs because they were angry about spain . 
  and then you 've got the basques and a ton of catalonians even on / r/europe today who feel miffed , and there were [ colonial revolts in the spanish empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_philippines_\\ ( 1521 % e2 % 80 % 931898 \\ ) #the _ philippine_revolution ) . 
  the conquistadors in the americas were pretty bad news . 
  hard to be a country with much history without having walked on people . 
  maybe san marino or some other very small countries could manage it , but ... 
   as you can see , we ( or at least a good chunk of us ) do n't acknowledge those people as irish , even if they were born in ireland and considered themselves irish ... nationalism likes simple ` truths ' ... [ ehhhh ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ), 
   for every arab you guys complain about , there 's a nurse or a it specialist or whatever from portugal/spain/italy / greece entering britain and boosting your gdp . 
    i shit you not : if it 's not nationalism then i have no fucking idea what your problem is . 
  first off , while i think that it * is * in uk interests to have this interchange happen , a couple of points : * the uk may benefit , but that does n't necessarily mean that fred bloggs does -- and you 'll notice that while the leadership favors remain and more education is correlated with remain support , brexit support tends to be low-education . 
  these people also [ experience the brunt of overall downward wage pressure ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/world/europe/european-union-britain-brexit-voters-english.html?_r=0 ) : * the working class feels that it is slipping behind , people here said , and construction jobs that used to be theirs in london are now going to skilled european immigrants who work more cheaply . 
  `` people say to me that ` we have to control the numbers to protect what we have , ' '' ms. harris said . 
  `` they say , ` we 're a tiny nation and we 're full , rebecca , we 're full . ' and there 's anger that europe would n't let us agree to have more control over who comes , that there 's a loss of control . '' * those people [ generally produce the supporters of brexit ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/21/eu-referendum-who-in-britain-wants-to-leave-and-who-wants-to-rem/ ) . 
  seen in that light , brexit is a way to ensure a mechanism that tends to transfer wealth from the better-to-do , better-educated people in the uk to the less-well-off , less-well-educated people remains in place . 
  * the uk is unusual in that it has retained distinct nations within the country . 
  i would think that nationalism would be attached to splitting up the uk . 
  the scottish independence referendum seems to me to be more-closely-attached to nationalism than the brexit referendum . 
  * remember that the eu , as an institution , has affected eu member states in many different ways -- but that these are all fundamental . 
  i wonder if perhaps to you , the changes that portugal faces are more-visible than those that the uk runs into . 
  portugal runs into people * leaving * , and i 've seen people from southern europe and eastern europe express concern about the future of their countries if the youth leave . 
  in sweden and in germany , from-outside-the-eu immigration changing demographics and society , as well as high housing prices are a concern . 
  in the uk , internal-to-the-eu immigration is a bigger concern . 
  the eu changes , and was intended to change , countries . 
  while i think that these changes unlock opportunities for many people and help industry in europe a great deal , and while i think that they are advantageous in the long term , they * are * disruptive , and any form of disruption is going to wind up causing problems in the short term for people . 
  the uk is impacted by those as well . 
  while i certainly respect your knowledge of international trade , i also doubt that you are the most-representative person either politically or in positions on the economy in the commonwealth . 
  while i do n't have my finger on the aussie political pulse , i 'm a bit skeptical that the typical response to a brexit would be a sense of insult ... 
   furthermore , nationalism has nothing to do with the subjugation of other people .
