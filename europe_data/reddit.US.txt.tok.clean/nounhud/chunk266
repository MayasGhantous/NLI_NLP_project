  i suspect you mean colonialism . 
  does n't have to cross race . 
  the american colonies , for example ... 
   a fully automated future where everyone on this planet is sufficiently supported a future where everyone 's just a competitor for resources instead of better-off-by-working-together ? 
  not sure how stable that would be . 
  `` the third reich was n't all that much fun . '', 
  does n't make financial sense anymore . 
  not that much money in resource extraction or unskilled labor . 
   i find it awful that a nation who has subjugated other people for centuries ... 
  i suspect that most nations do n't have clean hands here . 
  yeah , but natural language looks the way it does because of drift over time . 
  if you got a lot of people using esperanto , they 'd start using slang and loanwords and you 'd wind up with similar issues . 
  we understand in what ways language drifts well-enough across languages to be able to work on [ reconstructing proto-indo-european ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-indo-european_language ) , the language that was the grandfather to all of europe 's languages . 
  i was listening to some lectures on where tonality in language comes from -- that is , in languages like chinese , the tone changes from one word to another word -- and a linguist was saying that it comes from changes in the sound of the word caused by bits of the end of the word that are then dropped over time for efficiency , resulting in just the tone producing meaning . 
  that * kind * of thing will tend to let complexity increase in the name of brevity or expressiveness until it hits the level of a day-to-day language . 
  as cgpgrey [ pointed out ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrobz_hzzuc ) , the city of london has been doing that since before any modern-day european country existed , and that includes [ san marino ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_marino ) , which only goes back to 301 ad . 
  the 2018 world cup seems likely to be interesting . 
   he was n't the pm then , he was a regular mep . 
  apparently , giving the speech in maltese was a good idea politically . 
  if you have n languages and you use that system , you need n ^ 2 translators . 
  the way that software compilers deal with this -- since they have to be able to compile x programming languages into y machine languages -- is to have a single intermediate representation . 
  that means that instead of x times y translators to be written , one writes x translators to the intermediate language , and then y translators from the intermediate language to the machine language -- x + y instead of x times y. 
  that * could * be done here -- translate everything to one language and from that one language , and you 'd reduce the number of translators . 
  the eu has 24 official languages , which means that all you need are 24 translators that can speak the one intermediate language and their particular specialty language , rather than 24 x 24 = 576 translators . 
  the downside is that you have two layers to let errors crop up instead of one and that there 's twice as much delay until the live translation comes through .

  if he offers you detroit , do not under any circumstances accept . 
  honestly , if there is n't some mechanism for notifying all of the borders and the law enforcement agencies along a path so that the road immediately-ahead can be cleared so that it 's possible to move as quickly as possible in an emergency , there probably should be . 
   european militaries have some shit-tier logistics . 
  are you going off some source saying that that would be a limiting factor for operating within modern-day europe ? 
  i suppose that you could say that most gifts are investments . 
  nobody else has , as far as i know , been caught having the state run a doping program . 
  if athletes are caught doping , regardless of whether their state is involved , their medals are stripped . 
  do you have a source for claims of chinese state-sponsored doping ? 
  i mean , you ca n't just say `` well , it seems like something that they 'd do . '', 
    governments encouraging their hoologan thugs to cause trouble in other countries should be an automatic disqualification . 
    russian government would n't send hooligans to france . 
  / u/crazy _ israeli is referring to the russian legislator in the news who was encouraging more violence ( who really ca n't be said to speak for russia , to be fair ) . 
  he did n't say anything about sending hooligans . 
  `` so ... you 're telling me that the your future olympics does n't have athletic young men oiled up and wrestling in the nude in front of a crowd ? 
  how the world has changed ... '', 
   russia gifted crimea to ukraine some decades ago ( which while true is also pretty inconsequential unless you want to descend back to the dark ages of bickering over plots of land passed from country to country dozens of times throughout history ) that was going to be my response , but you beat me to it -- europe in particular has seen plenty of chunks of land changing hands . 
   russia has made a huge thing out of making the ukrainian government into a neo-fascist scarecrow , ever since they lost the convenience of having a pro-russia corrupt dictator in power , from which stems the next point i do n't understand how that supports a claim that crimea is a matter of russian internal affairs , though . 
   the russian or rusophile population of crimea needs protection from said neo-fascist scarecrow and good thing russian soldiers were vacationing in crimea just about that time of the year but ... that 's still foreign affairs in the eyes of everyone watching . 
  that is , i 'm not saying that russia did n't provide a rationale for crimea and donbas -- i 'm sure that it has , as it would just be silly not to . 
  but the statement itself is saying that the foreign affairs of other countries be adjusted based upon an assertion that is n't supported by [ any country in the world outside of russia , afghanistan , cuba , nicaragua , north korea , syria , and venezuela ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation_of_crimea_by_the_russian_federation#recognition ) -- that crimea is internal to russia . 
   if they have a russian passport , they are de-facto russian citizens , and countries that accept russian passports accept these people as russian citizens . 
  ah -- fair enough , i had n't understood your distinction between not accepting russian annexation in crimea and russia granting citizenship . 
   a pretty simple answer : any country that feasibly can do it with few repercussions will do it , but nobody in the eu can do it , so they do n't . 
  well , what are you classifying as `` repercussions '' ? 
  aside from resistance in ukraine , nobody has militarily fought with russia ( aside from the unrelated turkish shootdown a while back ) , but certainly i 'd say that there have been repercussions of crimea -- russia has been ejected from the now-g7 , has had sanctions imposed on individuals and the country , has seen relations collapse -- perhaps most significantly with ukraine , which with it could have maintained a relatively-friendly relationship had russia taken a different route -- has seen economic pressures , has seen the once-withering nato reinvigorated ... sure , it has n't led to war , but it seems difficult to say that there have n't been repercussions . 
  economic sanctions ? 
  that 's also turkish , canadian , and us policy , not just eu . 
  [ there are n't plans to end those sanctions ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/05/22/sanctions-on-russia-not-going-away-anytime-soon/#164c801911fe ) . 
  and it 's possible that they might not be sufficient , but they can be increased as necessary : [ eu and us threaten to increase russia sanctions ] ( https://euobserver.com/foreign/133582 ) :  the leaders of france , germany , italy and the uk as well as canada , the us and japan said in a joint statement after the g7 summit in japan on thursday ( 26 may ) that they `` stand ready to take further restrictive measures in order to increase the cost on russia should its actions so require '' . 
   they are , after all , russians . 
  if you mean legally , that 's what russia claims , but not what the bulk of the world recognizes . 
  if you mean ethnically-russian , so are people in other countries bordering russia . 
  russia ca n't simply go in and slice off bits of ukraine any more than it can bits of those countries . 
  well , i mean , it * can * , barring any sort of barrier put in place , but the west has a pretty strong reason to disincentivize that sort of thing . 
  if countries start sending their militaries in and taking bits of land if they can then get a subsequent vote in favor over the objections of the country involved , where does it end ? 
  the sudetenland , a la germany ? 
  how about chechnya ? 
  would the people there favor foreign support ? 
  what about all the bits of europe that historically-belonged to one country or another ? 
  it 's not a universalizable precedent , and it 's one that russia would never accept applied to its own land . 
  i would imagine that he 'd like russia to stop occupying latvia in that case . 
  well ... you * can * ... 
   while acknowledging that the world needs u.s. power , putin insisted russia wo n't tolerate interference in its ** internal affairs ** . 
  if you say `` part of this other , neighboring country is now russia , and affairs there are now our internal affairs , not a matter for anyone else '' , it makes for a rather broad interpretation of the term . 
   if the working classes are left behind by globalization , they will fight against it . 
  the thing is , using the term `` class '' requires simply arbitrarily drawing lines in almost all modern societies -- it 's an allusion to legally-very-real structures in the past , where people actually had different legal rights . 
  when people complain about college tuition , it 's because there 's been such an increase of demand -- so many people have been picking up a higher education that supply of educators has n't been keeping up . 
  a couple of hundred years ago , the brits kicked off the industrial revolution . 
  the combination of [ industrialization of agriculture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jethro_tull_\\ ( agriculturist \\ ) ) and the [ development of factories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derby_silk_mill ) started the great process of urbanization that still has n't completed across the world . 
  it displaced people both on farms and in handmade , artisan industries . 
  [ lots of people lost out in the short term ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution ) ...  the rapid industrialisation of the english economy cost many craft workers their jobs . 
  the movement started first with lace and hosiery workers near nottingham and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation . 
  many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited ( and unskilled ) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver . 
  many such unemployed workers , weavers and others , turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery . 
  these attackers became known as luddites , supposedly followers of ned ludd , a folklore figure . 
  the first attacks of the luddite movement began in 1811 . 
  the luddites rapidly gained popularity , and the british government took drastic measures , using the militia or army to protect industry . 
  those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged , or transported for life . 
    unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised , such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern britain were affected by the captain swing disturbances . 
  threshing machines were a particular target , and hayrick burning was a popular activity . 
  however , the riots led to the first formation of trade unions , and further pressure for reform . 
  ... but that period in time also created the greatest increase in wealth and living standards that the world has ever seen . 
  [ before those changes , life was rough ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution ) :  chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including britain and france , until the late 19th century . 
  until about 1750 , in large part due to malnutrition , life expectancy in france was about 35 years , and only slightly higher in britain . 
  at that time , people started moving off farms and to factories , moving from hand-made crafts to operating machines . 
  that was because of wage pressures -- that 's how the market moves people to new areas . 
  over the past hundred years , there 's been a relative decrease in need for unskilled labor -- and our answer has been to educate and train more people , and had an overwhelmingly-more-educated society than we did in the past . 
  [ in the us ] ( http://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf ) :  during the latter part of the 1800s , enrollment grew rapidly in higher education institutions , but much of this growth was due to increases in the population . 
  enrollment grew by 278 percent between 1869 -- 70 and 1899 -- 1900 , but students as a percent of 18 - to 24-year-olds rose from 1 percent to 2 percent . 
  [ in 2012 ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/09/whos-going-to-and-graduating-from-college-in-7-charts/280069/ ) :  in 2012 , college-educated households brought in one half of all wages -- even though this group represents a third of the u.s. population . 
  ... and i personally think that our educational system * still * does n't have anything like the kind of graduation rates or rate of knowledge transfer that we could theoretically-achieve , and is probably more-costly and less-efficient than it needs to be . 
  speaking of which , should n't the `` e '' in `` editing '' not have been capitalized , given that a semicolon was used ? 
  heck , i would have used a period there , rather than a semicolon .
