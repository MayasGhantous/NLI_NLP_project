  this is how nelson would have brewed his tea if he 'd had pulsejets !, 
  also , i remember that particular brit from [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy5rkw4sep4 ) . 
   [ arguably , the most famous olympic controversy ] ( http://www.randomhistory.com/history-of-olympic-controversies.html ) involved roman emperor nero in the games of a.d. 67 . 
  not only did nero bribe olympic officials to postpone the games by two years , he bribed his way to several olympic laurels . 
  most notably , nero competed in the chariot races with a 10-horse team , only to be thrown from his chariot . 
  while he did not finish the race , he was still proclaimed the winner on the grounds that he would have won had he been able to complete the race . 
  after his death the next year , his name was expunged from the victor list ( swaddling 1999 ) . 
  i think that there has probably always been underhandedness to some degree . 
  not sure that things are worse today . 
  well , it would solve * some * regulatory problems . 
  it would also create new ones , though , because drugs that `` push the human body as far as it can go '' create side effects , and if you wanted to be in the olympics , you 'd need to do that . 
  if you wanted to find some metrics more complimentary to europe , consider these : * us income distribution is more spread out . 
  per-capita gdp is a measurement that 's evenly-distributed , which income is not , so if you wanted to measure approximate quality of life , you 'd want something that 's based on a median rather than mean . 
  * for that matter , you could complain about the [ gini index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gini_coefficient ) if your goal is a more-egalitarian society -- the us has high income disparity . 
  * [ us net worth per adult is significantly-lower than many european countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult ) , even if the rate of economic activity in the country is higher . 
   this ppp crap is just a way for americans to feel better about their shitty quality of life . 
  all that being said , if you * are * trying to get an idea of quality-of-life rather than international economic power , you would prefer ppp-adjusted numbers to non-ppp-adjusted . 
  you piqued my curiosity . 
  i went digging to find the sampan . 
  apparently , there 's a combined cia-navy operation involved here , which was mentioned in your article , but which did n't go into enough detail to cover the sampan . 
  [ lt. eugene f. clark and the inchon landing ] ( https://www.navalhistory.org/2010/09/01/lt-clark-and-the-inchon-landing )  the invasion of south korea in 1950 nearly resulted in a communist victory . 
  un forces were driven into a perimeter around the southeastern port of pusan when general of the army douglas macarthur , commanding u.s. and un forces in korea , decided to launch an amphibious landing against the north korean flank at inchon . 
  a successful assault at inchon and an advance to the nearby south korean capital of seoul would sever the main communist supply lines . 
  an attack launched from pusan would then batter the now cut-off north korean forces . 
  it was a bold plan . 
    the navy knew little of the dangerous waters around inchon despite the fact that the u.s. had occupied korea south of the 38th parallel for four years . 
  with a tidal range of over 30 feet , accurate intelligence of inchon and its water approaches was vital to the success of the landing . 
    no one did more to provide that information than the daring and resourceful [ lieutenant eugene f. clark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugene_f._clark ) , usn , a geographic specialist on macarthur 's intelligence staff . 
  clark had enlisted in the navy in 1934 , became a chief yeoman and earned a commission in world war ii . 
  he commanded an lst and a transport , and participated in several clandestine operations with the nationalist chinese against the communists after the war . 
  invasion planners needed detailed information about the harbor , the approaches and enemy defenses so they dispatched a reconnaissance team under lieutenant clark to get the answers . 
  his small team included two south korean officers who had fought in world war ii and possessed sufficient arms to equip a small irregular force . 
    clark 's team landed on yonghung do , an island only 14 miles from inchon , on 1 september 1950 . 
  they quickly organized a force of local men and boys to watch the nearby enemy held island of taebu do . 
  on the advice of his korean officers , clark had brought in rice and dried fish for the islanders , which brought much good will . 
  clark also equipped yonghung do 's one motorized sampan with a .50 - caliber machine gun and armed his men with carbines and submachine guns . 
  to acquire intelligence about the enemy , the team seized local fishing sampans-interrogating crewmen who generally professed loyalty to south korea-and explored inchon harbor . 
  clark 's young korean operatives also infiltrated inchon , kimpo air base and even seoul and returned with valuable information . 
  clark told the planners that the japanese-prepared tide tables were accurate , that the mud flats fronting inchon would support no weight and that the harbor 's sea walls were higher than estimated . 
  clark also reported that wolmi do , an island in inchon harbor , was fortified with soviet-made artillery . 
    the north koreans , aware of clark 's presence on yonghung do , sent only small parties to the island to investigate his hideaway . 
  on 7 september , however , they sent one motorized and three sailing sampans loaded with troops . 
  south korean lookouts spotted the approaching boats , enabling clark and his men to get their ` flagship ' underway . 
  as clark closed the enemy , a 37 - mm anti-tank gun mounted in the bow of the communist motorized craft opened up . 
  a shell splashed well in front of clark 's sampan . 
  undeterred by their poor shooting , clark directed his flagship to within 100 yards of the enemy squadron . 
  his .50 caliber machine gun raked two of the north korean vessels , sinking one and demolishing another . 
  witnessing this slaughter , the two remaining boats fled the scene . 
  after clark reported that battle to headquarters , the destroyer hanson ( dd 832 ) arrived to take off the team . 
  clark , who had not asked to be extracted , instead requested hanson 's skipper to pound taebu do . 
  hanson blasted the island with 212 5-inch rounds , covered by marine corsairs that bombed and strafed the north korean positions . 
    the team stayed on the island and continued their mission . 
  clark scouted palmi do , an island centrally located in the approaches to inchon , and reported that canadian raiders had only damaged the lighthouse beacon . 
  clark was ordered to relight the lamp at midnight on the 15th . 
  on 14 september , clark 's team moved to palmi do and repaired the light . 
  meanwhile , the north koreans sent a second contingent to wipe out the force on yonghung do that overwhelmed the defenders and executed over 50 men , women and children . 
  clark avenged their sacrifice when he activated the beacon atop the lighthouse at the appointed time on 15 september . 
  with this light to guide them , the ships of the landing force safely threaded their way through the treacherous approach to inchon . 
  the inchon landing was an incredible success and un forces soon drove the remnants of the north korean army across the 38th parallel . 
    in recognition of his heroic work , the navy awarded lieutenant clark the silver star and the army presented him with the legion of merit . 
  clark participated in several other special operations off korea , earning a navy cross and an oak leaf cluster for the silver star . 
  commander clark retired from the navy in 1966 and died in 1998 . 
  i 'm assuming that that the damaged sampan was lt. clark 's sampan . 
  it also appears that the casualties on the north korean side fail to include the sampans that he was fighting . 
  not only was it bewildering to me , but i 've seen official european news outlets confusing the : * [ council of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union ) * [ european council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council ) -- confusingly enough , an unrelated institution of the european union . 
  * [ council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) -- not part of the european union i 've also confused and seen people here ( who are probably more familiar with eu structure than the average bear ) confused on : * [ the european court of human rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_court_of_human_rights ) being part of the eu .

  oh , yeah , and [ this flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe ) refers to europe as a whole -- explicitly including turkey , who had a hand in making it and whose rejection of a cross is , according to wikipedia , apparently the reason that the flag does n't have a cross on it . 
  people do like using it to refer to the eu , though ...

  i mean , the sky-fairy rationale seems of little value to you , because it * is * a sky-fairy to you ... 
  for a truly devout believer , religious laws -- at least the serious ones -- will come first . 
  you can define otherwise in the law , but the will of the creator of the universe kinda trumps that of your local legislative body . 
  how about on abortion ? 
  for local concerns that need to be raised at the national level , fptp makes a lot more sense -- the area has a representative that can represent the majority from your region . 
  it makes less sense in terms of issues that are simply only related to the country as a whole . 
  is the best time to deal with any policy when people are particularly emotional about it ? 
  that might favor an outcome you favor here , but i 'd is it normally how you 'd want issues addressed ? 
  that 's ... a fair point , though i wonder what percentage of britain first this guy was relative to muslims who have done something similar -- i.e. 
  what 's the percentage of each group that has done violence ? 
  i 'm assuming that britain first is n't that large , though i ca n't seem to find hard membership numbers anywhere , but if it 's , say , in the tens of thousands , that guy represents a not-insignificant chunk of the group . 
   this is kind of my thinking for banning the npd ( nazi party ) in germany . 
  in canada , it 's not normal for neo-nazis to march down the street ( even if there are giant counter protests in germany ) and to have their own political party . 
  hmm . 
  the kkk and the american nazi party and similar groups exist , and their parades and so forth are protected , but they really are n't out offing elected officials in the way that the sa was in germany . 
  it seems that people who are killing officials tend to be lone individuals . 
  [ here 's a list of assassinations of us politicians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_assassinated_american_politicians ) . 
  there are 55 entries there . 
  of those , the number that were killed by someone affiliated with a group ( whether acting alone or as part of that group ) : * [ james hind assassination in 1868 by a klansman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_m._hinds ) * [ assassination of john w. stevens in 1870 by a klansman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_w._stephens ) * [ possibly the john m. pinckney assassination in 1905 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_m._pinckney ) during a heated political debate over whether-or-not to ban alcohol -- there were groups on each side , but it does n't sound as if this is quite what you 're thinking of . 
  * [ somewhat-ironically , the only post-1870 assassination of a politician listed by a far-right group was the assassination of george lincoln rockwell in 1967 , who founded the american nazi party , by someone who he had kicked out of the group and was angry about being kicked out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_lincoln_rockwell#assassination ) . 
  he was n't an elected official , but was a politician . 
  of those , that 's three assassinations of politicians by far-right groups in the history of the us ( including rockwell , which i 'm not sure is what you were thinking of ) . 
  the overwhelming majority of assassinations that happened were by lone individuals , most-often angry about job loss . 
  that does n't mean that there have n't been politically-motivated killings -- the [ charleston church shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charleston_church_shooting ) was by an individual motivated by right-wing issues , and left-wing anarchists were well-represented for a while -- but they do n't seem to be affiliated with organizations , but lone wolves . 
  my guess is that that 's in part because organizations that * do * openly advocate violence tend to rapidly attract law enforcement attention and informers are recruited -- e.g. 
  the left-wing [ weather underground ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weather_underground ) , the right-wing [ jewish defense league ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_defense_league ) , the left-wing [ communist party usa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_usa ) . 
  you know , as far as i can tell , killing elected officials that you 're opposed to is n't a very effective strategy to get things changed in most cases . 
  usually they 're elected because people agreed with them , and assassinating them just results in a backlash from people angry that you 're trying to circumvent their democratic system .
