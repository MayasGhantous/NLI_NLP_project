   healthy marriage laws `` healthy '' , like `` natural '' or `` good '' , is often a term that hides a value judgment -- it 's not necessarily shorthand for `` has effects that everyone universally-agrees are desirable '' . 
  maybe polygamy does n't work well . 
  we 've similarly laws against it in the us . 
  but i am not sure whether a society * could * exist that practices polygamy that would n't work well . 
  there are certainly some objections about it , and it 's different , but i do n't think that it 's possible for someone to say `` it is not possible for a society to be well-functioning and be polygamous '' ( or polygynous , for that matter ) . 
  now , that 's a different question from whether germany should allow polygamy . 
  if germany does n't ( and i really do n't think that polygamous refugees are an overwhelming argument for it ) , it will avoid having to change processes and legal procedures and so forth . 
  on the other hand , i strongly suspect that people who are already married will simply live in what amounts to a polygamous relationship , without legal recognition for one of the relationships . 
  that was a very substantial concern for us states at the time that the us was debating whether to create a federal army , actually : whether the federal government , once given an army , could use it to dominate the states . 
  the worry was that the federal government might become a sort of new tyranny . 
  [ federalist paper # 46 ] ( http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa46.htm ) , written by james madison , the author of the constitution , dealt with the debate over whether a federal army , once formed and given to the federal government , could be a tool to subjugate the states . 
  an excerpt from his defense of the creation of such a federal army :  the only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall of the state governments is the visionary supposition that the federal government may previously accumulate a military force for the projects of ambition . 
  the reasonings contained in these papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed , if it could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger . 
  that the people and the states should , for a sufficient period of time , elect an uninterupted succession of men ready to betray both ; that the traitors should , throughout this period , uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the extension of the military establishment ; that the governments and the people of the states should silently and patiently behold the gathering storm , and continue to supply the materials , until it should be prepared to burst on their own heads , must appear to every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious jealousy , or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal , than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism . 
  extravagant as the supposition is , let it however be made . 
  let a regular army , fully equal to the resources of the country , be formed ; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government ; still it would not be going too far to say , that the state governments , with the people on their side , would be able to repel the danger . 
  the highest number to which , according to the best computation , a standing army can be carried in any country , does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls ; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms . 
  this proportion would not yield , in the united states , an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men . 
  to these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands , officered by men chosen from among themselves , fighting for their common liberties , and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence . 
  it may well be doubted , whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops . 
  those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the british arms , will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it . 
  besides the advantage of being armed , which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation , the existence of subordinate governments , to which the people are attached , and by which the militia officers are appointed , forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition , more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of . 
  notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe , which are carried as far as the public resources will bear , the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms . 
  and it is not certain , that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes . 
  but were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves , who could collect the national will and direct the national force , and of officers appointed out of the militia , by these governments , and attached both to them and to the militia , it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance , that the throne of every tyranny in europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it . 
  let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of america with the suspicion , that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession , than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors . 
  let us rather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment , by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious measures which must precede and produce it . 
  i suspect that few politicians do . 
  a bureaucracy is too large and has too many specialists for a politician to understand it to any great degree . 
  the disqualification is suspended . 
  france had nothing to do with the ruling -- that 's uefa . 
  nz does have the [ nuclear reactor thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand_nuclear-free_zone ) . 
  canada , probably followed by the uk and australia . 
  i think that they 've been involved in all major things since at least world war ii . 
  the last time i think canada did n't come along was when we went to pull [ germany 's bits out of the fire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_blockade#the_start_of_the_berlin_airlift ) and the last time i think we split with the uk on something was over [ suez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) . 
  i do n't think that would violate any russian laws . 
  i think that it 's very difficult to reduce eu membership to a simply left-right issue . 
  looking at all the polls recently , there are also many people on the left that are opposed due to labor competition . 
   it was greece who falsified statistics itself . 
  though it was other eu members who were responsible for ensuring that the numbers provided were legitimate , and my understanding is that it was understood that the numbers were fudged ( perhaps not to the * extent * that they were ) at the time . 
   try telling that to people who simply will not believe facts , no matter how easily verifiable , even when you literally hand them the evidence , because they 've constructed themselves a nice little paper-mache cocoon out of issues of the daily mail and are n't interested in anything except `` out , cos immigants ! '' . 
  everyone believes input to * some * degree . 
  maybe the * daily mail * has had fifty years to make its case with * its * input , but nobody is born with an implicit trust of the * daily mail * or any other publication . 
  if the response is `` let 's ignore your complaints about immigrants '' , it 's probably not going to sell well . 
  let 's break down what i 'd guess concerns are . 
  my off-the-cuff bet is that there are probably three major sources of concern over immigration : * ** downward wage pressure ** . 
  that 's a real concern . 
  people 's income * matters * to them . 
  you ca n't tell someone `` oh , your concerns about wages do n't matter '' , because you 're going to be ignored -- and , i think , rightly so . 
  ( particularly if , and i do n't know this to be the case , your * own * wages are likely to see less pressure from the uk being in the eu ) . 
  as poorer countries join the eu , there will be labor movement under freedom of movement and labor , and for some jobs , that creates downwards wage pressure . 
  a better answer would be `` people who come to the uk also buy things and need their own work done , and that eliminates a lot of that pressure -- immigrants do n't just take jobs , but create new ones . '', 
  `` the us public had similar concerns every time waves of immigration happened over the years , and their wages never went into a permanent slump . '', 
  * ** loss of political power ** . 
  if you let people into a democracy , you give up political control , and that will always create some opposition to immigration in such a country . 
  the uk grants voting power to all members of other eu members living and working in the uk . 
  and , after all , if people from country that is n't doing so well come to the uk , wo n't they make the uk look like country that is n't doing so well ? 
  i 'd respond that the people who come to a country are those people who most-see that country as doing things * right * , who * want * to live in a system that looks like that country . 
  oh , they 'll bring their own flavor to the mix , but every person who chooses to come to the uk has looked at their country of origin , looked at the uk , and said `` i like the system over there so much more that i 'm going to move away from family , deal with a different language , and deal with being greatly-outnumbered in that country because that system is the way things should work and where i want to live . '', 
  that 's a powerful vote of confidence in that system . 
  * ** violence from terrorism ** . 
  i do n't know how much of an issue this is in the uk , but certainly isis is a concern . 
  this one seems like the easiest of the three to answer . 
  violence from terrorism involves a tiny number of people , and it 's only media exposure that makes people think that it 's so important : it 's a minuscule blip compared to something like lung cancer , yet carcinogens in the air and smoking are vastly less of a concern . 
  ireland performed far more acts of violence against the uk than have islamic terrorists , and i do n't think that the uk wants to distance itself from ireland . 
  of the incidents , the worst was that on 7/7 , and eu-membership-related immigration had no role to play in at least that event . 
   i do n't really have a problem with the trump one , i guess it 's somewhat similar to his endorsement from putin . 
  well , i 'm not a marketer or an expert on british politics , but let 's hypothetically imagine that you 're a british swing voter who is vaguely-concerned about british sovereignty and people from outside the uk influencing the uk . 
  you 're thinking that maybe the uk should leave the eu to avoid that . 
  is the most-convincing argument to make for remain couched in terms of trump and obama 's positions ? 
  i mean , i can understand the logic behind the pamphleteer -- `` trump is unpopular in the uk , obama is popular in the uk , both are high-profile ... associate them with the positions '' . 
  but i think that there 's kind of a broader point ... 
   and the remain side has been led more by eddie izzard than the leader of the labour party . 
  gee , i wonder why they are in the lead . 
  hmm . 
  that 's corbyn , right ? 
  my understanding is that he 's not very popular with most of the electorate . 
  do you think that corbyn or eddie izzard is more-likely to be an effective salesman for a remain position ? 
   so honest question , what makes us the deal breakers ? 
  frankly , i would guess that a significant chunk of it is that your wages are low , and if you join the eu , serbian workers will create downward pressure on wages for comparable workers in the uk . 
  well , if your understanding is that it 's in the uk 's interests to be in the eu , you 've also a responsibility to explain that position to people . 
  simply dismissing people as `` idiots '' is convenient and perhaps satisfying but also not correct : half of the uk can not , by any reasonable definition of the word , be called `` idiots '' . 
  remain advocates have failed to successfully explain why remain is a benefit to the uk that people should vote for , if leave has that much support . 
  there are , perhaps , three parties who would want remain who have had the ability to affect the outcome and have made fairly-substantial errors : * eu and national leaders of several other countries almost-certainly underestimated british antipathy to immigration from the middle east when they weighed the impact and chose how hard of a line to take on illegal immigration . 
  * cameron almost-certainly underestimated the same when choosing to have a referendum . 
  whether-or-not leave goes through , he certainly did n't expect a vote to be this close ... and he really should have had his finger on the pulse of the electorate better , as that 's his job . 
  * advocates of remain failed to make a compelling case . 
  and , this being a democracy with freedom of speech and all that , that does n't just mean some person officially-charged with making that case -- it 's anyone whose understanding it is that it is in the uk 's advantage to remain but has n't successfully conveyed that point to other voters . 
  this is n't `` someone appointed by the remain campaign did things wrong '' , this is '' * i * did something wrong '' . 
  of those three errors , only the last is still anything that can be changed to any degree . 
  one-and-a-half weeks remain , and telling people that they are `` idiots '' probably is n't a very compelling argument . 
  it would n't sell me , at any rate , were i leaning toward the position that the uk should leave . 
   michael clauss says a chinese company 's offer to buy a top robotics maker in germany has amplified criticism of unfair competition , as state-backed chinese firms are shielded from competitors and have access to huge funds < shrug  if the government subsidizes one company , either in the form of cash or in shielded markets , it does so via weakening all other companies in the country a bit . 
  yeah , it 's less economically-efficient , but in terms of overall competition ? 
  i have a hard time imagining that it 's a point of huge contention in france . 
  i would n't care if a us politician used the terminology . 
   removing the scapegoat would force politicians to be more transparently responsible for their decisions . 
  that seems like a pretty high-cost and ineffective way to try to achieve that . 
  pew did a poll of americans a month ago and [ found similar results ] ( http://www.people-press.org/2016/05/05/3-international-threats-defense-spending/ ) :  the islamic militant group known as isis remains the american public 's top international concern . 
  overall , 80 % say isis is a major threat to the well-being of the united states , while 16 % say it is a minor threat and 3 % say it is not a threat ; views are little changed from december .
