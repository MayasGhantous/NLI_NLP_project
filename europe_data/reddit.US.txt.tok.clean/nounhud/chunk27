  i would probably not advocate the left-wing variant of this myself -- i 'm not trying to argue that it should be adopted here -- but what i mean is that / u/samiumabisare was asking for `` real , new , fresh '' left-wing ideas , and this is one that clearly has a lot of present-day people interested . 
  i do n't know how * actually * fresh it is , as my guess is that probably it has very old origins , but it 's seen a real surge in interest from people that i run into , at any rate . 
  if i were a left-wing politician trying to find a new idea that i could get people interested in , that seems like a not unreasonable vision . 
   hell it 's not even a left wing thing ( friedman proposed a form of it first , did n't he ? ), 
  well , it depends on the implementation -- why i added the caveat . 
  if it 's `` eliminate welfare , and in a spending-neutral way , move to a basic income '' , that moves some of the government 's role to the private world , and a lot of small-government folks like the idea -- it becomes a right-wing proposal . 
  on the other hand , if the amounts involved are * higher * than total current welfare , it might be favored by the left as a route to flatten out wealth in society . 
   as i said before , the justice department can be faulted for ignoring the american warning . 
  they contacted our authorities directly . 
  on that basis i feel this minster should resign . 
  < doubtfully  did he personally cause the adoption of policies that were unwise , given the information he had available at the time ? 
  i mean , it 's not like every issue needs to result in someone being fired for any change to happen . 
  i can understand turkey and the us highlighting the fact that they provided information , because i 'm pretty sure that there are people involved who were frustrated -- they were working precisely to avoid this day and passed on the intelligence that they could gather , it did n't have effect , and right now they probably feel a bit like cassandra . 
  but , frankly , it 's not as if us law enforcement always acts on every piece of information that it is given , either . 
  what 's the ratio of good information to bad ? 
  that does n't mean that there 's not room for improvement , but just because the consequences in this particular case were severe does n't mean that the dutch actions were unreasonable . 
  i think that the idea would be more that if you want a policy change , the right want to do it would be via elections rather than via a stream of lawsuits when someone disagrees with a decision . 
  to do otherwise would be to effectively shift legislative and executive authority to the judicial system . 
  i do n't know what belgian law looks like , but the form that [ sovereign immunity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_immunity ) takes in some countries would block that . 
  fair enough . 
  i was n't intending to undermine your general point , which i agree with anyway , just could n't help but identify that edge case . 
   we desperately need real , new , fresh ideas . 
  i 'd probably be on the other side of the debate , but how about basic income ( obviously , depending upon the implementation ) ? 
   being for `` equality '' and `` fairness '' ? 
  who is n't ? 
  huh . 
  that 's not a bad litmus test for whether a claim of a political position is meaningful and objective -- are the * other * guys willing to say that they are opposed to that position ? 
   china are rumored to be subsidizing the shit out of their steel industry . 
  if that 's true , then it 's bullshit and their steel should have restrictions placed on it . 
  [ watch this clip from the 1970s of milton friedman .

  thank you . 
  my immediate response was '' [ oh boy !, 
  a population map !, 
  aiming for $ 15b , about a year of global profit for vw . 
  i do n't see mention of immunity involved , so i assume and am not surprised by the fact that this is going to be on top of what the private lawsuits are looking for and on top of whatever state regulators are going for , and on * top * of the $ 1k per vehicle in vouchers in the us ( which do n't legally block participation in private lawsuits , which i had been expecting , though may statistically discourage them ) , and on top of the $ 2k trade-in deal . 
  looks like there 's a [ bill out that might neuter the class-action lawsuits ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/256138-fairness-in-class-action-litigation-reform-act-or-volkswagen ) , but it looks like it extends far beyond the scope of the vw case , which makes me doubtful that it would get through . 
  i only recently became a bit interested in tort reform ( partly as a result of the fact that it 's a significant europe-us legal difference ) , so i 'm no expert , but it looks like [ as of 2005 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/class_action_fairness_act_of_2005 ) , large class action lawsuits like this ca n't be independently-run in state courts , so i 'm assuming that the lawyers for the private lawsuits wo n't be able to choose the most-favorable venue . 
  [ my guess would be # 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loss_aversion ) . 
   the out campaign are the most invested in this . 
  if this fails they wo n't get another chance for decades , if ever . 
  i 'd imagine that this is all-in for both sides . 
  if the vote is leave , i do n't reasonably see how the result could be halted . 
  * maybe * have an extended process -- the referendum places no time bound on when the leaving happens -- and have a second referendum canceling the leave process before it takes effect . 
  that seems politically-difficult to me , and particularly if the conservative party is running things , as it would burn many of their voters . 
  broadly-speaking , in the us , attempts to schedule overrides of previous popular votes are typically exceptionally unpopular : things like recall votes normally face a stiff headwind . 
  were the uk to leave , inertia for the * status quo * would presumably shift the weight towards staying out , and the prospect of getting a worse deal than is presently the case would probably tend to add to that -- even if the uk were to join again well down the road , i can not imagine it being in the near future . 
  if the vote is for remain , then the leave campaign faces a steady ( if slow ) shift over time towards remain , as people who treat eu membership as the norm steadily fill the public 's ranks . 
  their chances seem likely to only get worse over time ... you 'd need an ongoing series of eu upsets to people away , and it seems unlikely that you 'd get a better shot than a financial crisis plus ukraine/greece plus uncontrolled population movement from the middle east plus terrorism . 
  i 'd say that the vote is pretty important no matter which way it goes . 
  also , there 's a strong age disparity in those positions . 
  and while i 've no idea what the turnout will be , generally older voters tend to see better turnouts in the uk , just as in the us . 
  leave is normally somewhat-behind in the polls , but popular with older voters , and thus will likely see higher turnout for voting . 
  to me , eu membership seems like a matter of great import , rather larger than which party winds up currently controlling parliament , and something that people on both sides of the matter would turn out for , but i might also not have the pulse of the country well . 
   even if it is n't the purpose of the referendum , i have no doubt it is what the outcome of the referendum will be used for . 
  sure , no dispute there -- but that 's a much weaker statement . 
  in a war , for example , the decision to go to war or not to go to war will almost certainly be used a political bludgeon , but that does n't mean that a country would go to war or avoid war with the intent of * creating * a bludgeon . 
  the consequences are just too high to make sense . 
  that 's different from , say , joining the eu with the intent of having a scapegoat . 
  choosing to have a vote -- and potentially having the country leave the eu -- simply with a goal of creating a scapegoat is something that i 'd call simply silly . 
  it 's not * that * hard to find someone to blame . 
  in the us , a party can always say `` oh , the other party controls the upper house of the legislator/lower house of the legislature/executive '' . 
  or there can be a vote , and it 's moderate members of our party who defected and just could n't * quite * let an issue through , though we * sure did want to put it through * . 
  or we `` could n't quite fit an issue on the agenda '' . 
  or blaming red tape for making it hard to implement something . 
  or they had n't foreseen some loophole or consequence . 
  you do n't need to boot a country out of an organization to * create * a scapegoat . 
  i 'm sure that while in the eu , countries use the eu as a scapegoat . 
  i 'm also sure that regardless of how the vote goes , remain and leave supports will blame the other . 
  but i do not believe that the vote was created with the * goal * of producing something to blame , with a devil-take-the-consequences-of-leaving-or-staying position . 
  it impacts too much policy to do that , and there are far easier ways to find something to blame .

  carbon emissions might have had more visibility . 
  / u/vik1ng did n't expand it to all emissions . 
   and in germany you wo n't get thousands of euros in damages for pain and suffering because you feel cheated . 
  probably more [ punitive damages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punitive_damages ) than pain-and-suffering [ compensatory damages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/damages#compensatory_or_expectation_damages ) . 
  there have been efforts in many us states to cap these , but there are still states with sky-is-the-limit punitive damage awards . 
  i 'd call that an implausibly-high-impact way to find a political scapegoat . 
   i do n't believe for a second that either jeremy corbyn or john mcdonnell believes passionately in the eu . 
  they are both bennite-era thinkers who fundamentally see the eu as a capitalist club . 
  they are much more worried about the brussels-sponsored ttip ( the controversial eu-us transatlantic trade and investment partnership ) than about brexit ; and that goes for many of their momentum supporters as well . 
  that boggles my mind . 
  i realize that the us and the eu are n't the same thing as an organization , but the idea that , say , a center-left political organization in texas would consider nafta as a more-weighty matter than membership in the us seems unfathomable . 
  and nafta was at least somewhat novel -- the [ eu has numerous free trade agreements already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) . 
  i guess it depends on how you define a people . 
  japan had internal wars of conquest , for example , even if it never surrendered to an external power until world war ii . 
  your point is legitimate in a broader `` flagging particular peoples as having special long-term historical baggage of being victims '' can be a stretch , but i think that there are some legitimate ( if rare ) examples that might well qualify : [ wikipedia : uncontacted peoples ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uncontacted_peoples ) has examples of peoples that might not have been conquered , at least after having settled where they lived . 
  you got me curious . 
  while i 'd like a more-specific answer to * rome * : [ wikipedia : genetic history of italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_italy ) :  in 2008 , dutch geneticists determined that italy is one of the last two remaining genetic islands in europe ( the other being finland . ), 
  this is due in part to the presence of the alpine mountain chain which , over the centuries , has prevented large migration flows aimed at colonizing the italian lands . 
  [ 2 ] [ snip ]  a 2012 study by di gaetano et al. 
  presents the first analysis using the 125,799 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) data of 1,014 italians with wide geographical coverage . 
  it showed by using principal component analysis and model-based individual ancestry analysis , that the current population of sardinia can be clearly differentiated genetically from mainland italy and sicily , and that a certain degree of genetic differentiation is detectable within the current italian peninsula population . 
  pair-wise fst statistics northern and southern italy amounts approximately to 0.001 between , and around 0.002 between northern italy and utah residents with northern and western european ancestry ( ceu ) . 
  confirms that the mediterranean sea has acted as a strong barrier to gene flow through geographic isolation following initial settlements . 
  samples from ( northern ) italy , tuscany , sicily and sardinia are closest to other southern europeans from iberia , the balkans and greece , who are in turn closest to the neolithic migrants that spread farming throughout europe , represented here by the cappadocian sample from anatolia . 
  but there has n't been any significant admixture from the middle east or north africa into italy and the rest of southern europe since then . 
  [ 34 ] [ snip ]  ancient dna analysis reveals that \u00d6tzi the iceman clusters with modern southern europeans and closest to italians ( the orange `` europe s '' dots in the plots below ) , especially those from the island of sardinia . 
  other italians pull away toward southeastern and central europe consistent with geography and some post-neolithic gene flow from those areas ( e.g. 
  italics , greeks , etruscans , celts ) , but despite that and centuries of history , they 're still very similar to their prehistoric ancestor .
