  that might be unfortunate :  welby also said that whatever the result , britons should come together after referendum day to heal the divisions caused by the campaign , which has split the ruling conservative party and wider society . 
    `` the language in the campaign has been very blunt , but this is the question of a generation , and merits passionate campaigning , '' he said . 
    `` after the referendum we must come together as one people to make the solution we choose work well . 
  hard words ... must not create enduring bitterness . '', 
   the us trade deficit is hurting them . 
  their gdp would be about 2 % higher if they did n't import so much and instead bought american . 
  at some point in time , we will wind up with a trade equilibrium . 
  but let 's say that we restricted trade . 
  there are n't many countries that really lock things down hard and block trade any more ... i guess north korea . 
  i 'm guessing that you 're not enthusiastic about north korea 's model ? 
  there was a point in time where countries thought it was a good idea to try to use policy to force a positive balance of trade and stockpile money . 
  [ that approach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) is pretty dead now . 
   that money would have never gone to those areas without the eu . 
  hmm . 
  why not ? 
   and expects a part in formulating policy for a union they nearly threw away . 
  would n't that be a very reasonable expectation ? 
  i mean , surely you 're not proposing that it would be sensible to take away authority because of a near vote ? 
   in america , i believe it is customary to burn down your city after a team wins super bowl . 
  ehhh ... http://www.mandatory.com/2016/02/01/the-10-drunkest-super-bowl-fan-riots/  the costliest super bowl riot of all time came courtesy of drunk broncos fans who apparently lit fires and then ran through them and somehow considered that a form of celebration after denver won their second consecutive super bowl on january 31 , 1999 . 
    roughly 1,000 drunk fans left downtown bars to rip shit up with their comrades in the streets . 
  there they collected early editions of local newspapers , but instead of saving them as souvenirs , they used them to start bonfires . 
  they also overturned cars , broke windows and ripped down street signs . 
  by the time police broke it up with tear gas , the riot had caused more than $ 160,000 worth of damages . 
  i mean , i 'm not saying that that 's something to ignore , but that does n't even begin to compare with the over $ 1,000,000,000 in property damages from the [ 1992 los angeles non-sports riot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_los_angeles_riots ) -- i would n't call it `` burning down a city '' . 
  note that the people being polled were germans ( which i 'd guessed but wanted to check the original source to confirm ) . 
  in summary , support for cooperation with every country asked about other than france and the netherlands dropped between 2013 and 2016 . 
   note : if the `` leave '' campaign wins later this month all of this will be up in the air , and most likely the freedom of movement will disappear . 
  well , the bit about needing to go through passport control probably wo n't be up in the air then , but everything else will ... 
   why is everyone an idiot except lithuania ? 
  well , lithuania would be the one affected by it . 
  seems like people would tend to be concerned extra-specially about impact on them relative to others . 
  i mean , for example , you listed germany in your list of `` not idiot '' countries ... but germany just decided to kill off its nuclear industry in germany because of post-fukushima concerns for germans . 
  there , it was proximity of germans to reactors at question . 
  [ it 's a dramatic improvement over what we used to call precision bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/precision_bombing ) :  bombing was coordinated through a lead aircraft but although still nominally precision bombing ( as opposed to the area bombing carried out by raf bomber command ) the result of bombing from high level was still spread over an area . 
  before the war on practice ranges , some usaaf crews were able to produce very accurate results , but over europe with weather and german fighters and anti-aircraft guns and the limited training for new crews this level of accuracy was impossible to reproduce . 
  the us defined the target area as being a 1,000 ft ( 300 m ) radius circle around the target point - for the majority of usaaf attacks only about 20 % of the bombs dropped struck in this area . 
  wait , they are n't protesting the [ world war i trench boot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trench_boot ) ? 
  well , maybe the cost is n't high-enough . 
  but if you asked people `` will you take part in corruption , if there 's essentially no chance of being caught '' and then asked them `` will you take a multi-year-prison sentence and hope that your funds wo n't be recovered by the state in the hopes that you can get away with it '' , i bet that the `` yes '' numbers for each are different . 
  it 's certainly open for debate whether the difference is large enough , but i 'm confident that there is a difference . 
  and you 'll never get to zero corruption in total . 
  we gave [ this corrupt mayor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kwame_kilpatrick ) thirty years in federal prison and [ have rulings that any assets that we can find are fair game for seizure ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/10/kwame-kilpatrick-detroit-restitution/3967279/ ) ... but it still happened . 
  there are no countries with zero corruption . 
  you 're going to be choosing a slot somewhere on a gradient . 
  < shrug  i mean , i do n't think that the question is * prima facie * absurd . 
  the way the bulk of our systems of governments are structured * does * permit for the interest of the majority to be the deciding factor in most situations . 
  furthermore , if the numbers of people disadvantaged and the harm caused them is low-enough , there 's a utilitarian argument , and some will find that convincing . 
  we obviously do do things where some people are disadvantaged for the benefit of the whole . 
  regulations hamper people who * would * like to do the `` right thing '' in the name of blocking people who do n't . 
  we accept drafting people to go to war -- and greater risk for those individuals -- because the whole benefits ( and because most male citizens at least have a chance of being sent , whether they wind up being sent or not ) . 
  we make tradeoffs that benefit the whole all the time , like driving cars , where a few people will be killed , but the whole will have a higher standard of living . 
  and we do have categories where we reflect the actions of some individuals on the group as a whole -- for example , normally , in at least the us ( and i 'd assume elsewhere ) , young men are significantly more-dangerous drivers than young women , so they are charged more in auto insurance premiums . 
  employers ( at least in the us ; not sure what policies are elsewhere ) may choose to avoid hiring people who have committed a crime even if * that one person * may never commit a crime again , because they know that there is a non-zero recidivism rate and a correlation between committing different types of crimes . . 
  i 'm pointing out that there are factors where the society as a whole may be worse off via the use of racial profiling that i think that / u/hold _ my_ground missed . 
  but i 'm not arguing weight -- it might be that it * is * an acceptable tradeoff . 
  i think that there are cases where it would be and where most people would agree , were the expected benefit of profiling high enough and the drawbacks low enough . 
  i 'd guess that the drawbacks probably outweigh the benefits here , but , hey , the question 's a real one . 
  you could take a social scientist and try to come up with some sort of measurement of the drawbacks of profiling and the benefits and an idea of what it would cost . 
  i 'm not that person -- i 'm just pointing out that there * are * drawbacks to racial profiling . 
   sweden : this os has no transgender otherkin support !, 
  we should probably stop with calling out sweden on that , because if it were n't sweden catching shit for this , it 'd be us . 
   most people do not want to use command lines to install/update software you can use the command line on ubuntu to manage software packages , just as you can on windows . 
  the windows utility is less-capable , but it 's doable . 
  you can also manage packages on both with a graphical utility . 
  i 've been using linux as a desktop since the late 1990s , and let me assure you , it 's * vastly * more widely-used and approachable as a desktop today than when i started . 
   the f-35 is the most beautiful plane currently around though . 
  i suppose that aesthetics are subjective , but it looks kinda like a flying brick to me . 
   it 's the third time researchers at washington state -- lois james , stephen m. james and bryan j. vila -- have set up simulations to monitor the differing reactions of police when confronted by white or black suspects . 
  and all three times , they found that officers took significantly more time to fire their weapons if the subject was black , according to their latest report , `` the reverse racism effect , '' to be published in the journal criminology & public policy . 
  the result is interesting , but the term `` reverse racism '' is godawful . 
  pakistan 's government is n't objecting . 
  somalia did n't have much by way of a government . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're referring to in iran . 
  i agree that the us is clearly involved in syria against the government 's desires , though . 
  i 'm not saying that there are n't cases where an aircraft ca n't be shot down by something on the ground , but that in the real world , it 's probably going to be easier to just fly away than to shoot whatever it is before it shoots at the aircraft . 
   because the moroccan government does n't allow anyone to reject it i was n't aware that there were countries in the world that prohibited renunciation of citizenship . 
  hmm ... < goes looking  http://www.multiplecitizenship.com/wscl/ws_morocco.html  loss of citizenship :   voluntary : voluntary renunciation of moroccan citizenship is permitted by law . 
  renunciation is not automatic and must be approved by the ministry of justice . 
  contact the embassy for details and required paperwork . 
  my * guess * is that dual morocco-dutch citizens have the ability to renounce their moroccan citizenship , but that the dutch government has no fantastic lever here to force them to do so -- it looks like the dutch typically require renouncing a second citizenship when someone applies for and is granted dutch citizenship and revoke dutch citizenship if someone gets citizenship of another country , but they ca n't exactly stop someone from being born . 
  https://www.government.nl/topics/dutch-nationality/contents/dual-nationality  the dutch government wants to limit dual nationality as much as possible . 
  if you have only one nationality , it will be clear what your rights are . 
  that is why people who want to acquire dutch nationality through naturalisation are , as a rule , required to give up their other nationality if possible . 
  this is called the renunciation requirement . 
  [ snip ]  you might automatically lose your dutch nationality if you acquire another nationality . 
  also , realistically , there would be some fundamental problems with asking even a four-year-old to choose a nationality from their dual pair . 
  i guess you could theoretically require it of someone when they reach majority , since it looks like the netherlands has a lower bar than the us for stripping citizenship ( e.g. 
  it 's okay to remove citizenship in the event of terrorism in the netherlands ) . 
   if a group sees it 's members committing crimes and then sees police implementing measures to stop those crimes and decides the police are the problem , that group has no place in that society . 
  hmm . 
  < thinks  i think that if i were n't committing crimes , but that i was part of , oh , say , five percent of society that was classified as being at a higher risk of committing crimes , and if i had to put up with a bunch of inconvenience as a result of that , i think that i could likely object to the policy . 
  heck , i was n't even happy with policies that inconvenienced me that applied to * all * of society , like post-9 / 11 tsa screening , and saw those polices as problematic . 
  now , you could say `` well , i 'd like you to respond differently '' , but i do think that there 's a human tendency to take issue with the policy -- and given that we 're humans , that 's what you 've got to work with . 
   integration of that group is impossible and members need to be removed until those that remaining members are all integrated or working toward integration . 
  i think that that 's probably an unrealistically-high bar . 
  it could be an aspirational target , but unless you 're dealing with some very small group , like , ten or twenty people , that simply wo n't ever be met . 
  some people are going to always take some sort of position opposed to that . 
  for example , the [ nation of islam in the us promotes black separatism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_of_islam#separatism ) . 
  the vast majority of black people and of muslims in the united states are n't off trying to split off a separate state .
