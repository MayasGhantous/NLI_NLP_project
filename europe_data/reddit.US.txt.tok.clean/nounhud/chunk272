  however , you 'll never wind up with zero people that are opposed to some form of secession -- there are people of any race and of any substantial religious group that will want secession -- so if you set the standard that high , it 's simply doomed to fail . 
   how is yemen 's government stance on drone strike any relevant ? 
  because the post being responded to was :   they are against the us doing drone strikes in neutral countries `` neutral '' does n't make much sense here in that there is n't a war , * per se * , but the implication that i understand / u/frankonia to have been making was that the us was attacking things in other countries without either being at war with them or with the involvement of the government there . 
  i also do n't think that the collateral damage is high as conflicts have historically gone , but i suppose that 's a subjective question -- after all , it 's entirely-possible to adopt a standard where zero collateral damage would be acceptable . 
  you 're right , thanks -- i saw someone mention the gripens , went to look for them , and went looking for the [ canard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canard_\\ ( aeronautics \\ ) ) , which i knew that the gripen had and could n't see -- actually , still ca n't make out even now -- on any other planes . 
   the us navy and marine corps has the second largest air force in the world . 
  the us navy is the second-largest air force without combining it with the marines . 
  edit : and before you ask , no , russia has a larger air force ( by aircraft count ) than the marines do . 
  all that being said , ( a ) russia obviously is n't threatening war and ( b ) if such a war happened , russia would n't be expecting to be trying to match aircraft numbers anyway . 
  well , in all fairness , he said `` measures '' , not `` military measures '' . 
  russia can certainly do things to make the us 's life less pleasant if she wants to do so . 
   a russian foreign official says the presence of the us destroyer in the black sea does not meet with `` our approval '' . 
  us ships in the black sea , other than aircraft carriers , do n't need to meet with russian approval any more than [ russian ships in the carribean need us approval ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/11358732/russian-spy-ship-docks-in-havana-on-eve-of-historic-cuba-us-talks.html ) . 
  maybe so , but on a more serious note , it 's a big deal -- it demonstrates that those politicians are not in a position of effective immunity from the law . 
   she said she wants turkish president recep tayyip erdogan to be prevented from entering germany this sort of thing does n't really solve anything and does tend to antagonize people . 
  let 's recap : what is at issue ? 
  a german law was being used to block insulting a head of state . 
  german legislators ( like this one here , i might point out ) are the ones responsible for having german law on the books and are the people most-able to resolve the situation . 
  does it make more sense to yell at erdogan for simply playing by the rules that the german legislators put in place , or to amend the law ? 
  maybe it was bad diplomacy on erdogan 's part to do this . 
  but , frankly , if * that 's * the objection the legislator has , it seems like the legislator is merely compounding the same error in being undiplomatic . 
   ... splits the very concept of a united europe . 
  i mean , america had a similar sort of deal with this sort of thing when the south decided it wanted to leave . 
  it was going to secede and keep its slaves , which is what , of course , led to the civil war , a war which killed more americans than any other war in history . 
  i do n't think i agree with the american civil war analogy . 
  the us , at the time , did n't specifically-define whether exit was possible and the federal leadership had stated that it was n't , and thus the use of force . 
  the eu has explicitly stated that withdrawal * is * an option -- this is part of the guarantees that make the eu more-appealing to potential members -- and has * not * threatened to use force to keep the uk in . 
  i very , very strongly doubt that whatever the costs of brexit , that it would result in a civil war of reunification . 
  that actually looks a lot less severe than the headlines had led me to believe . 
   it 's american newspaper , they do n't understand futbal  the terminology seems in line with that of other news sources referring to the russian team as `` russia '' and the english team as `` england '' . 
  bbc : [ euro 2016 : england and russia given disqualification warning ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36510550 ), 
   with much more extensive ordinance and systems to protect a pilot . 
  okay , i 'm with you on agreeing that protesting drones does n't make sense . 
  however ... i do n't think that i buy into that portion of your counter-argument either . 
  i could see that on * ground * forces -- e.g. 
  the [ battle of mogadishu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_mogadishu_\\ ( 1993 \\ ) ) turned into a bloodbath in significant part because the us chose to use unarmored vehicles , and the only defense the soldiers had in the city was to open up with their weapons -- that creates a dangerous situation . 
  but unless you 're dealing with fighter jets on the other side , it 's unlikely for an aircraft to need to attack a target in self-defense . 
  yeah , wait a minute . 
  if we 're talking about yemen , yemen 's government has been onboard with this . 
  this is n't the same thing as sailing into a random country and whomping people . 
  if you 're asking for reasons why it might not be a good idea , it could be that it would create social tensions . 
  if a line is drawn somewhere , even if it 's effective at helping catch criminals , it may also cause people on the other side of the line to identify with those criminals and not identify as part of the society as a whole . 
  that was n't the impression i got from `` and be made an example of leaving '' , but if that 's all that you meant , certainly i agree -- the uk ca n't expect that . 
   the americans do that and they let the uninsured bleed to death in front of a hospital hospitals in the us ca n't refuse emergency care , regardless of ability to pay . 
  i 'm no expert in european politics . 
  maybe that would make sense , and maybe it would n't . 
  but i 'd point out that the ussr , which took a hard line , was pretty unsuccessful about convincing countries to stay . 
  taking a hard-line approach may not be the an effective way to ensure future eu integrity . 
  further , remember that part of the selling point of the eu is that countries can leave if they do n't think they 're better off with it . 
  maybe that 's a good idea , maybe it 's a bad idea , and maybe it will change at some point . 
  but if you start saying that the right is n't a * real * one in that members will be severely-punished for doing so , it kinda undermines that right . 
   in is in , out is out . 
  there is nothing in between . 
  of all the places in the world , [ europe is perhaps the one where that is least true ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:supranational_european_bodies-en.png ) . 
   a country that left your organization on bad terms you consider this `` bad terms '' ? 
  sure , i can understand feeling spurned , but if brexit happens , this is probably one of the most easy-going splits between unions in history . 
  would n't really be comparable -- ireland has a fourteenth the population of the uk , and the us has five times the population of the uk . 
  edit : not sure why the downvote . 
  what i 'm saying is that a reunion between the us and the uk would , in political , demographic , and so forth terms , probably produce more change from the standpoint of a citizen of the uk than from the standpoint of a us citizen . 
  there 's been some discussion on this forum from brits who are interested with some form of association with canada and australia , but with the exception of one who wanted the uk to become a couple us states and some who mentioned trade agreements , most were interested in associating with countries that had smaller populations than the uk -- i assume because it would n't produce the kinds of rapid changes that eu membership has . 
  a union between the us and the uk from the us standpoint is n't comparable to a union between ireland and the uk from the irish standpoint , because it would simply produce less change in the us . 
  that is , / u/tinder123456 could say `` sure , i 'd be okay with that '' , and the bar would be lower than for ireland . 
  it would shift us politics and views and so forth ... but it would be a fractional shift rather than a seismic change . 
   if trump wins we all die . 
  humanity will die . 
  imagine mussolini with nuclear codes . 
  whether-or-not trump would be a good president , the image he 's been projecting has n't been a particularly militarily-aggressive one . 
  i think that the most-notable thing that trump has said wrt nuclear weapons was to oppose non-proliferation .

   betting markets still give the odds of uk remaining at 75 % ~ . 
  do n't the bookmakers balance the odds of bets against the pool created by all prior bets ? 
  if so , you 'd expect the best current estimates of something to be set not by the odds , but by the direction the odds are moving . 
  do you think that a cap on external immigration into the eu would qualify , or is the primary concern among british voters over internal immigration within the eu ? 
   it seems to me that strikes can only reasonably occur in situation where there is a monopoly or monopsony , as those two situation are arguably not governed by market forces as we usually understand them . 
  well , i 'd agree that for a strike across an industry to be meaningful , the collection of striking workers would have to comprise such a thing . 
  that being said , a strike at one company might be only over a monopoly of labor at that company . 
  it would be possible for that company to not have a monopoly in its market . 
  though , frankly , i think that a much better answer for such a situation is to just quit and go work for a competitor than to strike . 
  i 'm all for privatizing waste disposal , but even a [ moderate-libertarian group like cato ] ( http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/time-trash-government-intervention-garbage-service ) will point out that natural monopolies are a part of waste disposal ( even if they consider that it 's advantageous for waste disposal to be in the private sector ) . 
  government regulation , if not ownership , is one way that people try to deal with natural monopolies . 
  that being said , i 'm also pretty confident that the people protesting are n't concerned about the potential presence of a natural monopoly so much as having to work in a competitive labor market , so ...

  i suppose that burning cars might be seen as a protest against those well-to-do enough to own a car . 
  i could understand someone expecting to get away with attacking a police cars when police are away from them , but smashing in a police car 's windows and throwing a firebomb in with the officer in the car ? 
  the officer gets out of his burning squad car , the guy who just set the car on fire starts hitting him in the head with that thing .
