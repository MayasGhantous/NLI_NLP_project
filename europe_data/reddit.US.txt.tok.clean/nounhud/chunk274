  previous regimes , which have been lifted , involved angola , haiti and libya . 
  and , of course , there are [ the ukraine sanctions ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-sanctions-against-russia-information-for-exporters ) . 
   again , that is not necessarily a bad thing and i dont judge it so much , but its the behavior of a regional power at best a [ regional power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regional_power ) is somewhat-inconsistently defined by wikipedia : in one place , as typically being countries not being great powers , but elsewhere defines it as not mutually-exclusive with being a great power -- it includes france , germany , italy , and the uk as all being regional powers in europe . 
  it lists all of the powerful countries in the world , including the us and china and russia as also being regional powers . 
  to the extent that a country would be a regional power without being a great power , though , it would need to simply not have substantial influence outside of a geographic region , and that does n't seem to be the case with the uk by the criteria that i gave in the above comments . 
    there are no set or defined characteristics of a great power . 
  these characteristics have often been treated as empirical , self-evident to the assessor . 
  [ 16 ]   we can discuss that forever , but i appreciate your input ) this is true , and the debate over what a `` great power '' should * mean * is n't really an interesting debate , but insofar as we agree on what it means , it 's possible to decide whether the uk would count . 
  the reason i referenced a number of definitions was to show that while there were a variety of * lists * of great powers , the uk has been very consistently listed there by many different sources . 
  regarding the prospect of present-day decline , wikipedia 's also [ got a list of modern great powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_great_powers ) according to a bunch of different sources , and again , the uk shows up ( along with china , france , germany , japan , russia , and the us ) . 
  and i agree that it 's an interesting discussion , and that fuzzy definitions certainly are a factor to consider here . 
  so you 're saying that in the eu , estonia , finland , sweden , germany , austria , belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg have some interests that conflict with those of france , italy , the uk , spain , poland , etc and that germany is blamed for this for what i assume is political reasons ? 
  can you expand on what those interests are ? 
  that seems to say that it does result in inflationary pressure , but that other factors can counteract it ( pulling money out of the economy ) . 
   when germany is strong someone always suffers . 
  well , first , historically , i 'm guessing that `` strong '' amounts to `` controlling land '' and since that 's a zero-sum game , i guess so ... but that kind of applies to everyone . 
  but are you saying that this is some function that has to hold and is unique to germany today ? 
  that seems unlikely to me -- the same sort of zero-sum factors from then does n't seem to really exist today . 
   southern europe in poverty now . 
  germany stronger than ever you 're referring to greece , right ? 
  germany lost ( and probably will lose ) a bunch of money on greece . 
  if that was intentional , it does n't seem like a very good plan for germany ...  of course they love the eu . 
  look what it 's done for them . 
  well , it 's provided more market opportunities . 
  the same has happened for the uk though , right ? 
  it may be unrealistic to measure in full , but you can certainly gather non-subjective corruption data . 
  here are some example non-subjective corruption questions : * in the last twelve months , have you offered a bribe to a public official ? 
  * < conduct construction inspection  in a random sampling of construction projects in the last five years , were materials in category x , y , and z up to claimed standard actually used ? 
  * what percentage of legislators have an income increase of more than n % for the five years following leaving the legislature ? 
  those might not capture all the useful data that goes into what people think when they 're saying `` corruption '' , but they are n't subjective , certainly not to any great extent . 
  okay , i got ta ask -- what is you guys ' deal with germany ? 
  i constantly read comments from people on this forum concerned about the dominance of germany in the eu . 
  let 's say that there 's some sort of hypothetical scheme that germany was involved in that was advantageous to germany and disadvantageous to other eu members . 
  why would n't the uk and france just do the same thing and disadvantage germany , say ? 
   qe by itself does n't increase inflation i do n't understand what you 're saying . 
  you 're saying that it does n't create inflationary pressure or that the inflationary pressure it creates might be outweighed by other factors ? 
  i will grant that at least that is n't perception-based , though it may be a horrible metric for judging `` e-citizenship '' , whatever that is . 
  but some of these absolutely * are * perception based , which i thought the entire point of the index was to avoid . 
   an index developed by an anti-corruption research group measures corruption through objective variables rather than the public 's perception good . 
  it was an ongoing pet peeve of mine that the only major index relied on perception . 
  edit : ** goddammit , this is bullshit . 
  ** the source data that this thing uses is from data points derived from perception . 
  look at the [ methodology page ] ( http://integrity-index.org/methodology/ ) :  judicial independence   based on the `` judicial independence '' indicator from the executive opinion survey of the world economic forum global competitiveness dataset 2015-2016 that asks the question `` to what extent is the judiciary in your country independent from influences of members of government , citizens , or firms ? 
  [ 1 = heavily influenced ; 7 = entirely independent ] . the indicator has been standardized and transformed to be in range between 1 and 10 with 10 implying the highest judicial independence . 
  that is * absolutely * perception-based . 
  you ca n't mingle subjective metrics and then say that the resulting output is non-subjective . 
  edit2 : to be fair , i 'll grant that i 'd have a really difficult time coming up with good metrics . 
  but some thoughts on this one : * judicial independence would be great to measure , but this is terribly-subjective . 
  much , much better would be to ask judges some sort of measurable , anonymized question . 
  * i 've seen the `` cost of doing business '' data elsewhere . 
  it seems potentially reasonable , though i am not digging into * their * methodology . 
  * trade openness . 
  i do n't know how this is conventionally measured by economists , but neither of the things measured ( number of documents required and time to process those documents ) seems to be likely to be a huge barrier to trade . 
  i 'd think that tariffs and ntbs would be more important . 
  * budget transparency . 
  the open budget survey * might * be measurable , but they do n't put their full methodology online -- they do n't list the questions that they ask . 
  * e-citizenship . 
  well , these numbers ( facebook users , broadband penetration , internet use ) are solidly non-subjective ... but i 'm having a hard time thinking of any of these as being strongly-tied to what i think of as public integrity . 
  * press freedom : much of [ this methodology ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/fotp2014_methodology.pdf ) also seems subjective . 
  for example , `` is truth a defense to libel ? '', 
  is a good criterion , and something that probably translates to most legal systems -- you could argue that it might not be perfect in some way , but it 's not subjective . 
  however , `` are excessive monetary fines routinely imposed on journalists or media outlets in civil libel cases in a partisan or prejudicial manner , with the intention of bankrupting the media outlet or deterring future criticism ? '', 
  requires judging intent and clearly is subjective . 
  there 's a lot of words like `` excessive '' , `` important '' , `` improper '' and so forth that make the questions subjective . 
  fantastic idea on this index , but the implementation just is n't what i was wanting . 
   since 21st century economy involves a lot of `` convincing people that you are doing well '' he managed to make the impression that the economy is actually going well . 
  in reality however , he funded this mirage by selling all profitable government businesses and land . 
  so ... he privatized industry ? 
  that sounds like a good idea to me . 
  hmm . 
  that seems more like you 're measuring the degree of involvement within the eu ... that 's not really a metric of global influence . 
  i mean , sure , involvement in the eu is a factor in that -- if the uk does n't do anything in the eu , it 's not actively exerting itself in that area -- but it 's also only one of many areas . 
  i 'm not sure how one would measure global political involvement ... i guess embassy count , where the uk is tied with russia at 148 , after germany at 151 , france at 161 , china at 166 , and the us at 174 . 
  certainly i 'd say that political power would derive from economic and military power , and it would be difficult to describe the uk as not a great power on either count . 
  [ the uk ranks as # 5 globally on this measurement ] ( http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/power-rankings ) , as [ # 6 on this measurement of military power ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) as [ # 2 on this measurement of global presence ] ( http://explora.globalpresence.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/country/iepg/global/gb/gb/2014 ) . 
  treaties and agreements also matter -- an isolated country is obviously less-influential than one not , but the uk is a member of the g7 , has a permanent unsc seat , is in nato , the eu , and the commonwealth . 
  the uk is a nuclear power with second-strike capability . 
  the uk is a global finance center . 
  the uk is not a superpower , as the british empire was , that is true . 
  the uk is certainly smaller than the eu taken as a whole ( though in many ways , as the wikipedia article on great powers points out , the eu does n't operate as a unit today ) , and in many ways less-influential than china . 
  but i 'll stand by my assertion that any ranking of countries that does n't classify the uk as a great power is using a different definition of the word than the one that wikipedia is using and one that is not in line with those sources listed . 
   if your island nation has a reasonable economic and military dependency on shipping , you need to ensure you can pitch in to keep those shipping lanes open in both peace time and open warfare . 
  it 's not just the ocean itself that 's interesting in terms of maintaining a navy . 
  barring some sort of technological shift , naval power is presently how a country is able to project a substantial amount of conventional force around the world . 
  it 's what makes a country militarily a factor other than to neighbors and countries through which there is an allied path . 
  ireland has no reason to care in the least about north korean hard power , because north korea has no ability to do anything with her military in ireland . 
  on the other hand , france or the uk or the us , which have navies capable of landing on a coastline , can move their militaries into [ essentially ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landlocked_country ) any country in the world with or without the cooperation of any neighboring countries . 
  their hard power becomes a factor for decision-making for those countries . 
  this is the ability to [ project power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/power_projection ) . 
  without this , a country could spend tremendous resources on a military , but the country is limited in what it can use the military for -- it can not aid an ally that might be overrun across the ocean , can not defend overseas territories that might be taken , and can use the military offensively against only a few countries . 
   why is eveyone like russia was ussr ?

  what are you alluding to with the `` tumbling down walls '' bit ?
