  [ 81 ] [ snip ]  in 2008 , the uk was the sixth-largest manufacturer in the world measured by value of output . 
  [ 89 ] [ snip ]  the aerospace industry of the uk is the second - or third-largest aerospace industry in the world , depending upon the method of measurement . 
  [ 28 ] [ snip ]  london is a major centre for international business and commerce and is one of the three `` command centres '' of the global economy ( alongside new york city and tokyo ) . 
  [ snip ]  tourism is very important to the british economy .

  your biggest current political crisis is that people want so badly to live and work in your country that they 'll try any means to get in . 
  if the uk is in bad shape , most of the world is deep , deep trouble . 
  you guys should rate-limit independence referendums or something . 
  if the snp schedules another scottish independence referendum and you count the brexit independence referendum and the * last * scottish independence referendum , you 'll be at , what , three fundamental independence referendums in two or three years ? 
  to be fair , the brits in part traded spending on other ships to establish a supercarrier fleet . 
   the uk is no longer a great power . 
  it is not even a medium power . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_power  a great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale . 
  great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength , as well as diplomatic and soft power influence , which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers ' opinions before taking actions of their own . 
  international relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities , spatial aspects , and status dimensions . 
    while some nations are widely considered to be great powers , there is no definitive list of them . 
  sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the congress of vienna [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] or an international structure such as the united nations security council ( china , france , russia , the ** united kingdom ** and the united states serve as the body 's five permanent members ) . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 6 ] at the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the g7 which consists of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the ** united kingdom ** and the united states . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ snip ]  of the five original great powers recognised at the congress of vienna , only france and the ** united kingdom ** have maintained that status continuously to the present day , although france was defeated in the franco-prussian war and occupied during world war ii . 
  [ snip ]  the conclusion of the great war and the resulting treaties of versailles , st-germain , neuilly , trianon and s\u00e8vres witnessed the ** united kingdom ** , france , italy , japan and the united states as the chief arbiters of the new world order . 
  [ 35 ] [ snip ]  during the paris peace conference , the `` big four '' -- france , italy , ** united kingdom ** and the united states -- held noticeably more power and influence on the proceedings and outcome of the treaties than japan . 
  [ snip ]  the victorious great powers also gained an acknowledgement of their status through permanent seats at the league of nations council , where they acted as a type of executive body directing the assembly of the league . 
  however , the council began with only four permanent members -- the ** united kingdom ** , france , italy , and japan -- because the united states , meant to be the fifth permanent member , left because the us senate voted on 19 march 1920 against the ratification of the treaty of versailles , thus preventing american participation in the league . 
  [ snip ]  during world war ii , the united states , ** united kingdom ** , and soviet union controlled allied policy and emerged as the `` big three '' . 
  [ snip ]  during the cold war , the asian power of japan and the european powers of the united kingdom , france , and west germany rebuilt their economies . 
  france and the ** united kingdom ** maintained technologically advanced armed forces with power projection capabilities and maintain large defence budgets to this day . 
  [ snip ]  another important factor is the apparent consensus among western great powers that military force is no longer an effective tool of resolving disputes among their peers . 
  [ 48 ] this `` subset '' of great powers -- france , germany , japan , the ** united kingdom ** and the united states -- consider maintaining a `` state of peace '' as desirable . 
  [ snip ]  great powers with un p5 membership and recognized nuclear weapons status : china , france , russia , the ** united kingdom ** and the united states . 
  [ snip ]  china , france , russia , the ** united kingdom ** and the united states are often referred to as great powers by academics due to `` their political and economic dominance of the global arena '' . 
  [ 49 ] these five nations are the only states to have permanent seats with veto power on the un security council . 
  they are also the only recognized `` nuclear weapons states '' under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and maintain military expenditures which are among the largest in the world . 
  [ 50 ] however , there is no unanimous agreement among authorities as to the current status of these powers or what precisely defines a great power . 
  for example , sources have at times referred to china , [ 51 ] france , [ 52 ] russia [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] and the ** united kingdom ** [ 52 ] as middle powers . 
  [ snip ]  in his 2014 publication great power peace and american primacy , joshua baron considers china , france , russia , germany , japan , the ** united kingdom ** and the united states as the current great powers . 
  [ 48 ] [ snip ]  the european union is a supranational union and not a sovereign state , and has limited scope in the areas of foreign affairs and defence policy . 
  these remain largely with the member states of the european union , which include the three great powers of france , germany and the ** united kingdom ** ( referred to as the `` eu three '' ) . 
  [ 85 ] if there is a meaningful definition of `` great power '' , it would be difficult for it not to include the uk , as she can can project her power globally and her opinion impacts most countries in the world . 
  the only real opposed text in that article mentioned that she had been occasionally described as a middle power , and then only in the narrow sense of mentioning that every country other than the us * also * had at some point been described as a `` middle power '' . 
  i think that your claim that she is not even a middle power would be using definitions that are not in line with the rest of the world 's . 
  i would definitely consider the uk a great power if using wikipedia 's definition of the term . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_and_the_united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea  the united states objected to part xi of the convention on several grounds , arguing that the treaty was unfavorable to american economic and security interests . 
  the u.s. claimed that the provisions of the treaty were not free-market friendly and were designed to favor the economic systems of the communist states . 
  the u.s. also argued that the international seabed authority established by the convention might become a bloated and expensive bureaucracy , due to a combination of large revenues and insufficient control over what the revenues could be used for . 
    the united states accepted all but part xi as customary international law . 
  [ snip ]  thus , modifications to that provision were negotiated , and an amending agreement was finalized in july 1994 . 
  the u.s. signed the agreement in 1994 and now recognizes the convention as general international law , but has not ratified it at this time . 
  unclos entered into force in november 1994 with the requisite sixty ratifications . 
  [ 1 ] [ snip ]  in the united states there has been vigorous debate over the ratification of the treaty , with criticism coming mainly from political conservatives who consider involvement in some international organizations and treaties as detrimental to u.s. national interests . 
  a group of republican senators , led by jim inhofe of oklahoma , blocked american ratification of the convention , claiming that it would impinge on u.s. sovereignty . 
  yeah , the uk had hdp dominant , though . 
  someone was explaining to me that germany 's result was because a big whack of turks in germany were lower-education workers that germany had brought in for factory work , and low education correlated positively with akp support . 
  < shrug  this was n't the page that i was thinking of , but it looks like [ wikipedia put the data online as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_june_2015#overseas_results ) . 
   the iraq isnt safe more than 10 years after the us liberated it and we havent even started to do anything in syria . 
  well , to be fair , iraq was a lot more stable before we left and civil war broke out . 
  if there 's an argument from that , it seems more like `` it 's hard to create self-sustaining stability in the middle east '' -- which may well support your point as well , of course -- than the time since we first rolled in . 
  somalia has improved a bit , but it 's [ had a civil war ongoing since the 1980s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somali_civil_war ) . 
  i think that that might be a more-concerning data point . 
  also , there 's a question about what the critical factor is . 
  is it whether-or-not a country is safe as large-scale violence goes -- providing a legal basis to deport people -- or whether the economy is appealing enough that people wo n't * want * to leave , because people keep trying to leave countries like nigeria or pakistan in hopes of a better life in europe . 
  what i 'm getting at is that if it becomes tied to an absolute number , then there 's a large incentive for a country to have people leave as quickly as possible -- if they 're deported , great , it 's just a payout . 
  one risk to consider would be the possibility of a positive feedback loop . 
  if the money coming in being removed makes the country even * less * desirable , it might result in an accelerated rate of leaving the country . 
  also ... i 'm not convinced that this will be long-term effective . 
  foreign aid can amount to a bribe to officials in question . 
  all right , so maybe accepting the deportations is worth it in the short run . 
  but the people who wanted to leave are n't going to stop wanting to leave . 
  the people in various countries choosing whether-or-not to accept the deportation and the people who are trying to illegally immigrate are n't the same people , and their interests are not aligned on this matter . 
  i would suggest that any aid not be tied to the number of deportations accepted , though , or suddenly interests would become rather-more aligned . 
   nickle * [ nickle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sonny_nickle ) * [ nickel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nickel_\\ ( united_states_coin \\ ) ), 
   i wonder why poland are so favorable for the eu , is it because they get back 4 times what they put in ? 
  hmm . 
  * would you come to a similar conclusion for , say , london and [ northern ireland ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/northern-ireland-is-officially-one-of-uks-costliest-regions-as-fiscal-deficit-hits-9bn-30152040.html ) , which is subsidized by london ? 
  * monaco is quite well-to-do , but small . 
  would you prefer to be a monaco over a united kingdom ? 
  * should delaware ( a well-to-do us state ) form its own independent country ? 
  if the answer to those are no , what is the line that you use to separate these from the uk-poland situation ? 
   look at the us if you do n't believe me , we have n't sent refugees home ever even when you include conflicts as recent as the bosnian civil war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haitian_refugees_held_at_the_guantanamo_bay_naval_base  over the years the united states has interned a varying number of refugees held at the guantanamo bay naval base . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] in 1991 a coup in haiti overthrew the first democratically elected president of haiti , jean-bertrand aristide , triggering a flood of refugees . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]   within six months the usa had interned over 30,000 haitian refugees in guantanamo , while another 30,000 fled to the dominican republic . 
  [ 3 ] eventually the usa would admit 10,747 of the haitians to refugee status in the united states . 
  hmm . 
  that seems really low to me , actually . 
  http://paa2006.princeton.edu/papers/61643  this value refers to the total number of family members who were admitted to the u.s. via the sponsorship by principal immigrants ( including both direct and indirect sponsorship ) . 
  these net ium values show that the chain migration process has a significant unification multiplier effect . 
  on average , each principal immigrant would bring 2.1 family members to the united states as part of the unification process . 
  so the us sees a reunification rate where each immigrant averages an additional 2.1 people per initial immigrant rather than the 1 additional person being projected here for germany . 
  this is despite the fact that these days , legal immigrants [ mostly come from india and china ] ( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states ) , where fertility rates ( and thus , i would expect , family sizes ) are lower than from countries feeding europe , and one would expect smaller family sizes . 
  that could be due to different german family reunification laws -- reunification laws are * not * internationally-standardized . 
  i 'd be curious to see what historic german reunification multiplier averages are . 
  [ isis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant ) has somewhere between 52,000 and 300,000 people . 
  there are [ 1,600,000,000 muslims in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_religious_groups ) . 
  the overwhelming majority of isis members , whether-or-not their ideals are something that i 'd agree with , are not terrorists . 
  heck , each person you 're referring to above who left europe to go to north africa is someone who preferred to go fight in a war there rather than simply commit acts of terrorism in europe . 
  i can understand objecting to ideas in islam , or to say that isis is something to oppose , or to oppose immigration from africa , or any number of other things ... but it 's just not reasonable to equate muslims with terrorists . 
  they may be * correlated * with terrorism , but it 's still a vanishingly small percentage . 
  france averages * two * showers a week * and * does n't do air conditioning ? 
  wow , til ... edit : to be fair , i do n't know whether , say , saunas are included there , which might cut the average for some sauna-loving countries . 
  edit2 : oh , wait , never mind !, 
  i was misreading the chart -- they 're plotting * shampoos * on the x axis .
