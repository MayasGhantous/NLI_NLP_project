  french people only wash their * hair * twice a week . 
  the shower rate is a titch south of 7 , where most of europe is . 
  in fact , the uk is at the low end , at ~ 5.5 showers per week . 
   we 're the most obvious example with 3 mos of 100f + weather a year ( convert that you frenchie ) where even as late as 10pm at night it 's still 90f + . 
  100f is 38c 90f is 32c the us and world peak is 134f ( 56.6 c ) in death valley . 
   what differs between europe and the us is having them at home . 
  i rarely see that in europe since we build with bricks , concrete and isolators . 
  why would that block use of window units ? 
   many turks living in foreign countries are really nationalistic . 
  just check how high their vote percentage for akp is . 
  i was looking at statistics a while back , and that * radically * depends upon the country . 
  turks voting abroad from germany favored akp . 
  turks voting abroad from the us favored chp . 
  that 's for the [ us chamber of commerce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_chamber_of_commerce#lobbying_expenditures ) , which is a private organization that acts as a unit when it lobbies for things . 
  true , there are a number of companies involved ... 
   the top 5 most liked european countries in the us dont even have negative stereotypes well ... i can think of some bad stereotypes . 
  * ireland : drinking . 
  well ... maybe it 's not really so much a negative * today * ( long , long after the immigration-of-a-lot-of-desperately-poor-people-fleeing-famine time when it was ) as a fun saint patrick 's day thing today , but ... * italy : organized crime . 
  * uk : bad teeth , maybe ? 
  i mean , you ca n't mount a gun rack on a horse . 
  on the flip side , i think that there are some european misconceptions about the us , going from this forum : * a number of people here seem to have an wildly-unrealistic , dystopian view about us healthcare , probably driven in significant part because they form their views by reading us political advocacy material . 
  would be kind of the same situation if i decided to form my image of the uk via reading ukip or green campaign literature -- whether-or-not you agree with the party , i think that you 'd agree that it 'd involve a lot of cherry-picked material and would create a misleading view . 
  * ditto for us product and food safety . 
  the us does n't have epidemics of deaths and maimed people , and i 'd compare us food safety pretty favorably to some substantial chunks of europe . 
  certainly the track record is solid . 
  * ditto for police oppression . 
  * a huge chunk of the anti-ttip stuff is ridiculous . 
  if someone says `` i think that ttip will disadvantage me , personally '' , sure , that 'd make sense , and i could believe that . 
  it 's a fair criticism . 
  but there are some people on here that think ( or at least claim to think ) that ttip is some vast plan driven unilaterally by the us just to us advantage , where european trade negotiators are either incompetent or blind or bribed or something , and signing off on something that would be disadvantageous to europe . 
  that seems really silly to me . 
  * ditto for people who think that the us has some sort of long-term secret plans in europe to try and shift it from the status quo , via nato or what-have-you . 
  the us already had the opportunity to poke its fingers into western europe with few limits after world war ii . 
  that 's a position of peak us influence in western europe , and post-war western europe is what things wound up looking like . 
  if you wanted to object to how things looked at that time , sure , that 'd be a fair objection . 
  but there 's no reason to believe that there 's some other shoe waiting to drop in , say , 2024 , which some people seem astonishingly convinced of . 
   seriously . 
  i had a woman tell me that germans all want to have their weddings at `` hitler 's castle . '', 
  i do n't think that that is very representative of american views of europe at all . 
  the negatives that i think would be more representative : * a lot of people just wo n't much about europe outside of something like the major countries and the countries that have seen a lot of immigration to the us . 
  the uk , france , italy , germany , ireland , russia , possibly spain or poland . 
  basically , countries that have a presence in us news or have been tourism destinations . 
  i 'm not sure whether , if you asked someone , they 'd know whether slovakia is in europe . 
  * i suspect that nazism probably looms larger in the american consciousness of germany than , in say , portugal 's consciousness , just because movies and older mass media is a larger chunk of the image ( though i suspect that there 's also less bitterness -- nazi germany did n't cause harm to the us on anything like the scale that it did to a lot of europe ) . 
  after reading this forum for a while , i get the impression that the european impression of germany is often something closer to being dippy hippies , which is utterly at odds with the us image . 
  i once worked with a german guy who was speaking quietly on the phone . 
  i asked him why he was speaking french -- i thought that he was german . 
  he looked confused and said `` i was speaking german '' . 
  does n't sound at all like world war ii movies with people shouting . 
  * the popular opinion of european militaries ( france in particular probably getting a worse reputation than she actually deserves ) is not good . 
  * i suspect that a lot of people on the right are unimpressed with the degree to which europe is fiscally left . 
  * i think that recent political advocacy in the us , driven by us political currents , has tended to create an image of europe 's social policies as looking something more like sweden . 
  * i think that a lot of economic ideas and laws in the us that really derive from the brits would be thought of as american ; the brits probably deserve substantially-more credit than they get . 
  i remember being quite surprised when i first started doing some reading ... * the us has n't had to adopt as many things originating from the outside as a number of countries in europe , and i suspect that that produces more of a not-invented-here symptom . 
  i know some people who really do n't like metric because to them it would represent losing somehow . 
  * i think that in a lot of cases , people in the us simply are n't aware of actions that have been taken by other countries . 
  i have what i 'd call a higher-than-typical interest in international relations and military matters , and i was oblivious to the fact that poland considered entering iraq to be a big deal until many polish users here repeated it as something notable . 
   all our stereotypes of europeans are about 70 years out of date . 
  could update them , but really , easier to just propagate them via mass media so that we do n't have to do so . 
   housing prices are incredible high so remove restrictions on construction and let the market solve it . 
  the thing is , france and the uk seem to have had a pretty decent relationship since 1900 . 
  * [ established the entente cordiale in 1904 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/entente_cordiale ) * [ fought alongside each other in world war i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i ) * [ fought alongside each other in world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii ) , even [ briefly considering merging the two countries into one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-british_union#world_war_ii_.281940.29 ) . 
  * [ the uk gave france part of its occupation zone of germany in the post-war era so that france would also have an occupation zone ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_occupation_zone ) * the [ suez crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) had france and the uk working together to secure their control of strategic points in europe 's neighborhood . 
  * france has [ recently been doing economic reforms ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20150616-france-force-through-controversial-economic-reforms-macron-valls ) that i would think that the brits would greatly agree with . 
  * the two established a land border in the form of the [ channel tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel ) just a few decades ago . 
  * both countries have the other country 's language as their primary second language . 
  aside from the french veto of british membership in the eu , what major differences have the countries had within living memory ? 
  i 'm not saying that [ those do n't look good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbcmy8pmuju ) , though you 've got ta admit that that 's a fairly fat-heavy set of dishes and some people might not go for that . 
  well , assuming that the views do n't shift as people get older . 
  i suspect that that 's not the dominant factor , but it 's not safe to just assume that , either . 
   28.3 percent were property or forgery offences i mean , i 'd think that having forged identity documentation would be a big chunk of this and is kinda inherently-associated with a lot of illegal immigration anyway . 
   does it add up to the millions ?

  i 'm not sure what you 're referring to when you say `` rewrite '' . 
  * the bible was [ made canonical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biblical_canon ) quite some time back , so i 'm assuming that you 're not referring to the canonicalization process . 
  * there have been new translations made , and while i 'm not saying that to a devout christian , there are n't some important decisions made there , i do n't think that anything there could remotely be called `` rewriting '' . 
  * there has been reinterpretation . 
  to my non-theologian 's eyes , this is the area where the greatest changes have happened , since changes that * amount * to rewriting have occurred without the text being invalidated . 
  theologians have tried to reconcile self-conflicting elements and elements that do n't mesh well with society .

  it is certainly not at all the case that anything like the majority of muslims would agree with isis 's intepretation , for example . 
  i think that you 'd find that a typical albanian on this forum would have quite different views from , say , [ those of a nation of islam member in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_of_islam#teachings_on_race ) , which would differ from those of isis .

  additionally , a lot of things that we 'd probably casually call `` islam '' would be considered by many muslims to be more political/nationalist issues -- conflicts in the middle east today might be more-comparable to , say , the [ troubles in ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) .
