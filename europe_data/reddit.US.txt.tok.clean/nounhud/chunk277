  that seems measurable . 
   ~ 13 % of elected politicians oppose immigration and multiculturalism that seems a lot more ill-defined . 
  what criteria are you using to place people in buckets ? 
   what is the e.u. 
  good for ? 
  well , let 's see . 
  it looks like that would be [ about 800k people for spain to deport ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/beware-of-immigration-say-the-british-expats-enjoying-sunny-spain-10167638.html ) . 
  * spain avoids clobbering the housing market in spain . 
  * spain wo n't kill all of the businesses that are providing services to those retirees . 
  * it 's probably necessary for reciprocity . 
  regardless of which way this is decided , if the vote is close enough that this decision may have been what tipped the balance , i bet that it will generate a lot of controversy . 
  i meant that things like an automatic transition to a long-term work visa or permanent residency for people who can prove their positions . 
  if the uk did a brexit and then simply deported everyone , it would be looking at booting out two million people to the eu and the eu booting 1.3 million people to the uk . 
  that 'd be quite disruptive for both sides . 
  lack of disruption , same as it would be for the uk . 
  it 's mutually advantageous to not render a ton of people unemployed , close businesses , or turn people out of their residences . 
  there are already work visas and legal-residence permits outside of just eu agreements . 
  it seems like a no-brainer to directly shift people who can prove residence or employment into those categories or into similar new ones . 
  other than on firearm law , yes . 
  i bet you that there 'd be at * least * some degree of grandfathering . 
  i would be surprised if brexit would result in gobs of british retirees living in other eu members being booted out and all the people from other eu members who have residences and businesses and jobs in the uk being booted out . 
   the uk is already one of the least regulated countries in the world , according to the oecd . 
  the netherlands is even less so . 
  we 're less regulated than canada and the us , both out with the eu . 
  huh . 
  what oecd metric are you referring to ? 
   because the eu only has ` the ' power that your government / or parliament gave away is n't that true of all members in all unions that were willingly-entered ? 
   half the time radical changes are not good i 'm not certain that that 's the case -- it 's not as if the radical nature of a change could n't be correlated with the change being good or bad . 
   gerrymandering also plays a huge part in republicans overrepresenting the us gerrymandering is an activity on both sides of the aisle -- in fact , [ the term itself is an allusion to an infamous incident of the democratic party redrawing the borders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerrymandering#etymology ) . 
   actually you do n't even need to have it on you at all times , i drive without it every single day and the only time i ever needed it i was told to take it to the nearest police station with my documents . 
  wow , really ? 
  if that 's legal , you guys beat us on privacy there , then . 
  in the us states where i 've checked , driving without a driver 's license is typically something that can be punished ( e.g. 
  a low-level misdemeanor or infraction ) but if you can show your license in court , the process ends there ... kind of a `` half-crime '' in that there 's an automatic defense that would get you off . 
  you 'd have to show up in court , though ... 
   i simply do not understand this obsession with privacy in the west . 
  deep aversion to anything that [ gets closer to things like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propiska_in_the_soviet_union ) . 
   but how does the police check your identety on the street ? 
  in the us , it 's [ not constitutional for police to require you to show identity unless they 've reasonable grounds for suspecting you of a crime -- violates the fourth amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_v._texas ) . 
  the us is similar , but more-so -- we do n't go in for this `` your [ papers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kennkarte ) , fraulein ! '', 
  business . 
  or [ fixed names ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_change#united_states ) :  usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason . 
  as of 2009 , 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone , with no paperwork , but a court order may be required for many institutions ( such as banks or government institutions ) to officially accept the change . 
  [ 2 ] we do n't even , technically , have a national identity number , though in practice if you do n't have a social security number or one of various compatible numbers , you 're going to have a difficult time doing certain things , like opening a bank account . 
  and only [ about a third of us have passports ] ( https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports.html ) . 
  a driver 's license is the most-common workaround , but there are fifty different constantly-changing variants , and they certainly are n't mandatory ( e.g. 
  in new york city , a lot of people do n't have a car ) , and those do n't conform to a cross-state standard . 
  most places that will take a driver 's license will take various other forms of identity that have a photograph . 
  if you 've a criminal record , there will be fingerprints , but outside of that ... 
  as far as i know , mengele 's results are publicly-available . 
  strictly-speaking , the minister in question , [ axelle lemaire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axelle_lemaire ) , is from quebec . 
   with its energy reserves of which europe will depend upon [ european council on foreign relations : europe 's alternatives to russian gas ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_europes_alternatives_to_russian_gas311666 ) :  to sum up , europe 's goal of significantly diversifying away from russian gas is challenging but not impossible in the short to medium term ( through 2020-2025 ) . 
  among the many challenges are the uncertainties regarding some of the most promising non-russian gas supply options , such those from the middle east and caspian regions . 
  the resolution of these uncertainties depends on the actions and political will of others ( such as the us , russia , and china ) as well as europe 's ability to speak in its own voice . 
  this latter would be significantly boosted by the introduction of a special envoy . 
  i think i 'm with you .

  forget france and california -- i 'm willing to bet that double-blind testers can not identify the country of origin of wine . 
  both state-funded international broadcasters , but i 'd put the dw bullshit level far lower . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you -- was just adding that they 're uncommon . 
   you are out of your mind if you think there will ever be a war between nuclear powers . 
  * [ korean war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ) : at the opening of the war , the soviet union and the us were both nuclear powers . 
  before the end of the war , the uk also became a nuclear power . 
  while the soviet union was primarily-involved with air fighting , its aircraft were directly fighting us aircraft . 
  * the [ kargil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kargil_war ) had a nuclear pakistan and india both involved . 
  granted , both of these remained limited -- but that would be one way in which such a war would evolve , with neither side willing to escalate to nuclear weapons , and keeping the scope limited . 
  you 're referring to the [ phony war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war ) ? 
   57 soldiers gave their lifes for our allies . 
  thank you , germany . 
   we could n't count on western europe for support , it would probably be just us , the poles , the americans and the brits . 
  the brits are part of western europe though , yes ? 
  [ already has the forty-third highest population density in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_territories_by_population_density ) . 
  [ gambia has a population of 1.8 m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_gambia ) . 
  gambia might take a few people , but millions are not practical . 
  gambia has a population density higher than that of cyprus , the czech republic , denmark , poland , and france . 
  gambia has a per-capita nominal gdp of $ 371 , which does not compare favorably to germany 's $ 41,267 . 
  `` lie back and think of turkey ! '', 
   they make up a much larger number of people under 30 . 
  the same  thing is happening in the us with hispanics : hispanics are only 17 % of the population , but makeup a much larger portion of young people , compared to the much older white population who is slowly dying off . 
  hmm . 
  the fertility rate [ tends to converge somewhat over time in the us ] ( http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/09/28/modern-immigration-wave-brings-59-million-to-u-s-driving-population-growth-and-change-through-2065/9-26-2015-1-30-23-pm-2/ ) . 
  while the hispanic rate is comparatively high , by just the second generation , even the hispanic fertility rate has fallen to a non-sustainable level -- the us only maintains population because of immigration ( though us levels are still substantially-higher than those in europe ) . 
  i do n't believe that western society has yet figured out how to establish a modern , highly-educated , two-income-family society that is capable of maintaining its numbers . 
  that society has been around for less than a hundred years , though , so there 's time to try to find a combination that works . 
  what was the objection to his opponent ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_turkey has the legend for that image . 
   the eu budget is too small to handle migration , jean-claude juncker warned if the eu is to handle this at the level of the confederacy , i agree with juncker . 
  [ frontex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex ) is the current reality for immigration control and processing in the eu . 
  it has a current annual budget of $ 142.6 m. 
  its approximate us counterpart is the [ dhs ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._immigration_and_customs_enforcement ) , which has an annual budget of $ 5.34 b , or about 37 times as much -- and ice is n't facing an ongoing crisis . 
  frontex 's budget is set up with the idea that member nations should contribute immigration resources from their own national pools and then be coordinated by frontex . 
  as far as i know , places like portugal are n't putting their immigration-processing resources into the pool , so that assumption does n't seem to hold . 
  the eu 's fix was to establish confederacy-level organizations :  a new european border and coast guard to intercept migrant boats and man checkpoints will cost # 945 million over the next four years , including # 219 million next year . 
    and a single eu asylum system will cost # 1.4 billion over the same period , covering accommodation centres , transporting refugees to new homes around the bloc and major it networks . 
  if those are accurate , even the new budget for these is something like a tenth what the us is spending . 
  i would assume that what he wants is for countries to cut their own immigration budgets and shift to spending on the eu system , which could be revenue-neutral . 
  i 'd note that if this is done , it might make more sense to contribute with the mandate that the spending involve using existing immigration officials , else a lot of people are going to be suddenly unemployed . 
   this extreme kind of socialism does n't work in the real world . 
  it 's really not socialism unless the government is paying people to do something and effectively taking over industry .
