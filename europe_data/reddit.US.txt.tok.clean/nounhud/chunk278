  the scheme may well harm industry by creating an incentive to idle a lot of switzerland 's productive capacity , and it 's true that socialist systems crashed into the same problem ... but it does n't create public ownership of industry , so it [ really is n't socialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism ) . 
   we absolutely can not , the state does not have the funds to pay every swiss citizen the amount that was proposed . 
  i mean , i think that basic income probably is n't a good idea , but i would vaguely-assume that had it passed , there would have been tax increases , right ? 
  my objections to basic income center around it creating [ perverse incentives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perverse_incentive ) -- the amount involved does n't seem like it would be much of an issue . 
  i 'd think that it 'd be possible to make any such scheme revenue-neutral . 
  iirc this really is n't a surprise -- it was generally-accepted that there was n't much buy in for quite a while back . 
  ehhh ... 
  the eu already has to solve the problem of `` who pays for it '' with all budgetary and spending decisions it makes . 
  ditto for countries like the uk or switzerland with substantial divisions below the country level . 
  does n't seem specific to this issue . 
   major oil country there was a / r/polandball comic a while back talking about all the expensive green things that norway was doing and about how it was such a green country .

  if you 're talking about the hardware , not familiar with the history of anything going over , but apparently [ these are being phased out for ah-64s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkuqc9a7hpo ) , and [ half of them are going to croatia ] ( https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/zagreb-in-line-for-donated-oh-58d-kiowas-410069/ ) . 
  the [ civil air patrol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_air_patrol ) is one of the [ military auxiliaries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reserve_components_of_the_united_states_armed_forces#civilian_auxiliaries_distinguished ) . 
  this is civilian , but affiliated with the us air force . 
  while it is mostly not directly-involved in combat , back in world war ii , wikipedia says that it did bomb and sink a couple of u-boats . 
  there are also [ independent armed and uniformed militia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/militia_organizations_in_the_united_states ) , which are groups of ( mostly right-wing ) civilians not specially-affiliated with any level of government -- that 's what / u/bobdole3 -2 was rather-unenthusiastically referring to . 
   to be fair , the us national guard is a militia . 
  according to your link , that 's not correct . 
   today , the term militia is used to describe a number of groups within the united states . 
  primarily , these are :   * the organized militia defined by the militia act of 1903 , which repealed section two hundred thirty-two and sections 1625 - 1660 of title sixteen of the revised statutes , consists of state militia forces , notably the national guard and the naval militia . 
  [ 2 ] the national guard , however , is not to be confused with the national guard of the united states , which is a federally recognized reserve military force of the u.s. army and the u.s. air force , although the two are linked . 
    * the reserve militia [ 3 ] are part of the unorganized militia defined by the militia act of 1903 as consisting of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the national guard or naval militia . 
    former members of the armed forces are also considered part of the `` unorganized militia '' per sec 313 title 32 of the us code . 
  [ 2 ] https://www.quora.com/what-is-the-difference-between-the-state-militia-and-the-national-guard the united states national guard is a reserve force , but not a militia . 
  the us states also have their own national guards [ as well as their own independent state defense forces ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_defense_force ) , which is what your militia page was discussing , and which are considered militia , since they 're under state command . 
  edit : that being said , the federal and state national guards operate in close conjunction now , and in practice , if land and air forces were activated in a war , the state national guards would be attached to the us military -- for example , the [ texas air national guard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfcobby3zx4 ) would be operating under the united states air force . 
  a few states ( [ like new york ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_naval_militia ) ) still maintain a naval militia as well . 
  [ naval air station keflavik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naval_air_station_keflavik ) actually is n't old any more -- looks like the us military left a decade ago , but if you remember from recent news , there was an announcement four months ago that [ it 's being renovated for new anti-submarine patrol planes ] ( http://icelandreview.com/news/2016/02/12/icelands-pm-welcomes-us-project-keflavik?language=en ) . 
  [ choose that stance with care ] ( http://dogbrothers.gr/images/thomas/thomas_pmantis_1.jpg ) !, 
  i think that you and i are talking about two different things . 
  when you have a casino , the casino * knows * the odds . 
  it will provide payouts that will over time favor the casino . 
  with many other systems ( like the one here ) , the bookmaker does n't know the odds , so after an initial starting point that they must guess at , the odds simply reflect what past bets have been . 
  that 's the only way that they can ensure that they do n't lose money . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parimutuel_betting some people on here were talking about this , and it appears to be the correct term for what i 'm referring to . 
  the odds that you are seeing on brexit is a function of how many people have bet for and against in the past -- the odds are set such that at any point ( after the first few bets ) , the bookmaker wo n't lose money , since he can cover the loss with the losing bets of all the people who have bet in the other direction . 
  that is , the bookmaker does n't claim to have special insight into whether-or-not britain will exit or not -- he 's simply putting up odds reflecting what bettors have thus far thought in aggregate . 
  my point in the top post here is that people are using the absolute odds -- which currently favor remain -- to state that it 's more likely that remain will win . 
  doing so is n't correct , because the odds reflects earlier bets * and * current bets -- both affect the pool used to pay out in the event of a win . 
  if you look at the odds , you 're seeing positions taken by people who had both earlier information and information now . 
  instead , what 's important if you want to know what people think * now * , with up-to-date information , is the direction that the odds are traveling . 
  and right now , the odds are swinging such that the payout on remain is getting larger than it was before , which means that current bettors are overall betting for leave . 
  thus , if you believe that there is useful information in their bets -- and certainly they are putting their money where their mouth is -- the most-up-to-date information there is that the vote will be for brexit . 
  `` as a result , for a limited time , we offering 14 % off sub construction contracts ! '', 
  my understanding is that the odds are set based on previous bets -- this ensures that the bookmakers are not exposed to risk , and will always come out ahead . 
  that is , the odds are such that the payout will always be somewhat less than the total take , regardless of what the outcome is . 
  the balkans are confusing . 
  realistically , though , they are the people in the position to make that assessment , at least on the military side . 
   or american why would americans be expected to do so ? 
  it 's not our speech or laws at issue ... 
  well , in the not-as-interesting-in-the-modern-era physical sense ... 
  repeating an [ earlier post of mine ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4lvktl/uk_voters_leaning_towards_brexit_guardian_poll/d3rwrw5 ) on using absolute odds :  i 'm not familiar with the mechanics of bookmaking , but someone ca n't `` cancel '' or `` sell '' their bet back to the bookmaker , right ? 
  it 's not a futures market . 
  that means that odds given by bookmakers reflect already-placed bets , right ? 
  so if i put $ 1m down that the uk remains and then new information shows up and everyone starts putting money down that the uk leaves , the odds would reflect my earlier bet . 
    so i 'd think that odds given by bookmakers will tend to be a relatively-sluggish indicator , if i understand correctly -- the only way for the absolute odds to track new information closely is if the amount of money bet kept greatly increasing over time -- it 'd have to be exponential growth in the betting pool over time , in fact , were current information even to have equal weight with old information . 
    i 'd think that if one were to look at bookmaking , the interesting question would be the * direction * that the odds are going rather than in their absolute value , since that reflects the best current information rather than stale information . 
    it looks like [ bookmakers are indeed shortening their odds on leave ] ( http://www.cityam.com/242321/eu-referendum-odds-bookmakers-cut-odds-on-brexit-again-as-leave-rally-continues ) , and rapidly so :    william hill is now offering 10/3 on a leave vote , down from 4/1 within two days . 
  meanwhile , betway has cut its odds from 4/1 to 3/1 , while remain has drifted to 2/9 , from 1/8 . 
    that would mean that present bets are on leave . 
    ... as an interesting tidbit , that seems to me to make a powerful argument that there is a strong incentive to bet at the last minute , since you can make bets with more information against people who had less information . 
   russian subs waging cold war-style bit of an exaggeration . 
   ` battle of the atlantic ' [ a * lot * of an exaggeration . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_atlantic )  `` combined with extensive and frequent submarine patrols throughout the north atlantic and the norwegian sea , and forward-deployed forces in syria , russia has the capability to hold nearly all nato maritime forces at risk , '' he wrote . 
  any * one * nato element could be put at risk , yes -- russia could strike first and would have its pick of targets . 
  however , in terms of an overall nato-versus-russian-navy naval clash , the russian navy is simply not a match . 
   plus , the government is well-aware that your attitude of `` just let it rip '' has allowed many countries to lose control and end up with housing bubbles due to oversupply ( see spain ) seems like an explosion in price would be due to over-borrowing eating up available housing supply , not over-construction . 
  if investors want to over-build and subsidize the nation 's housing to their own loss , why complain ? 
  soooo ... uncap rent ? 
  if that 's not politically-viable , uncap rent on new construction ? 
  establish a legislative committee which has the goal of reducing average new construction time to below n days and average cost to below m . they decide what needs to change and put up a package of legislation for a vote . 
  i mean , if the majority of people * do * want an easier process for construction , it does n't seem like the problem is insurmountable . 
   you ca n't just hand over the house keys to the bank and tell them to suck it . 
  that debt stays with you . 
  that might avoid the * banks * collapsing via people just walking -- generally-speaking , the us has policies generous to those in debt compared to europe -- but that does n't mean that : * if enough people get upset/desperate , laws ca n't change . 
  * that siphoning off a huge chunk of income to banks is n't going to have a major long-term economic impact . 
   it ca n't really `` pop '' . 
  i bet that it can if current prices rely on people thinking that the value of their housing is n't going to fall and they re-evaluate things .

   the monuments formed a key part of urban planning in the ussr , and their removal has left gaping holes in the city 's appearance ... no one knows what will replace them this seems like a glorious opportunity for guerrilla artists to put statues in place ... 
   underlining that he could talk as an expert , and not as a spokesman for nato , sarts said ... that 's really awkwardly-phrased . 
  i do n't understand whether he 's saying `` i personally have the expertise to come to this conclusion independently of nato '' or `` i have no authority from nato to say this and am just making the statement as a private citizen '' . 
  why would dw only do a russian-language release of this ? 
  that 's kind of annoying .
