  ehhh ... [ wikipedia : doom book ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doom_book ) :  the ** doom book ** , code of alfred or legal code of \u00c6lfred the great was the code of laws ( `` dooms , '' laws or judgments ) compiled by alfred the great ( c. 893 ad ) from three prior saxon codes , to which he prefixed the ten commandments of moses and incorporated rules of life from the [ mosaic code ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments ) and the christian code of ethics . 
    the title `` doom book '' ( originally `` dom-boc '' or `` dom-boke '' ) comes from d\u014dm ( pronounced `` dome '' ) which is the anglo-saxon word meaning `` judgment '' or `` law '' -- for instance , see alfred 's admonishment : * doom very evenly !, 
  do not doom one doom to the rich ; another to the poor !, 
  nor doom one doom to your friend ; another to your foe !, 
  * [ 1 ] the following reflects mosaic law : `` you shall do no injustice in judgment !, 
  you shall not be partial to the poor ; nor defer to the great !, 
  but you are to judge your neighbour fairly ! '', 
    f. n. lee extensively documents alfred the great 's work of collecting the law codes from the three christian saxon kingdoms and compiling them into his doom book . 
  [ 2 ] ** lee details how alfred incorporated the principles of the mosaic law into his code . 
  he then examines how this code of alfred became the foundation for the common law .

   india with its over the roof fertility rates india is actually 2.5 . 
  it 's growing ( and because india has a very large population , that 's influential at a world level ) , but it 's not one of the really rapidly-expanding countries . 
  nigeria has a fertility rate of 5.7 , for example . 
  here 's a world map [ showing fertility rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:countriesbyfertilityrate.svg ) . 
  sub-saharan africa is exploding . 
  the band running from mena and along the indian ocean is growing , but not nearly as rapidly . 
  the eu , china , russia , us , australia , japan , and canada are all dwindling , with japan and some european countries collapsing the fastest . 
  http://portuguese-american-journal.com/report-portuguese-lost-20-of-active-population-to-migration-portugal/  portugal is today the european union country with the highest emigration as a proportion of its population . 
  there are more than two million portuguese emigrants , meaning more than 20 % of the portuguese population lives outside the country of their birth . 
  over recent decades , the growth in the number of portuguese emigrants has been greater than the growth of the resident population in portugal . 
  around 110,000 portuguese left the country in 2013 alone . 
    the data , according the `` portuguese emigration factbook '' , a report issued by observatorioemigracao.pt , reveals that in 2013 alone over 110,000 portuguese citizens left the country to settle in 16 different countries , the majority of them to 10 in european countries , the most to them settling in the united kingdom ( 30,121 ) , switzerland ( 20,039 ) , france ( 18,000 ) and germany ( 11,401 ) . 
  in africa , angola received 4,651 portuguese migrants and mozambique 3,759 . 
    the countries with the largest portuguese born migrants were france ( 592,281 ) followed by switzerland ( 211,451 ) , united states ( 158,002 ) , canada ( 140,310 ) , and brazil ( 137,973 ) . 
   turns out governing the country in order to please the old generation while fking with the young has its problems on the long run . 
  hmm . 
  hypothetically , if you were going to try to govern a country in a way that would make it appealing to the young , what would you do ? 
  sure you can .

  they are n't inverted pentagrams . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentagram inverted pentagram :  based on renaissance-era occultism , the pentagram found its way into the symbolism of modern occultists . 
    following anton lavey , and ultimately based on a drawing by french nobleman and occultist stanislas de guaita ( la clef de la magie noire , 1897 ) , the sigil of baphomet , a pentagram with two points up inscribed in a double circle with the head of a goat inside the pentagram is the copyrighted logo of the church of satan . 
    aleister crowley made use of the pentagram in his thelemic system of magick : an adverse or inverted pentagram represents the descent of spirit into matter , according to the interpretation of lon milo duquette . 
  [ 16 ] crowley contradicted his old comrades in the hermetic order of the golden dawn , who , following levi , considered this orientation of the symbol evil and associated it with the triumph of matter over spirit . 
  the pentagram in normal form , as here , has been a christian symbol :  the pentagram was used in ancient times as a christian symbol for the five senses , [ 11 ] or of the five wounds of christ . 
  a christian use of the pentangle occurs in the 14th-century english poem sir gawain and the green knight , in which the symbol decorates the shield of the hero , gawain . 
  the unnamed poet credits the symbol 's origin to king solomon , and says the symbol is key to understanding the work . 
  the poet explains that each of the five interconnected points represents a virtue tied to a group of five . 
  gawain is keen in his five senses , dextrous in his five fingers , faithful to the salvation provided through the five wounds of christ , takes courage from the five joys that mary had of jesus , and exemplifies the five virtues of knighthood . 
   it is a full english , it has always been a full english . 
  wikipedia english has [ rendered it generic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_breakfast ) :  a ** full breakfast ** is a breakfast meal , usually including bacon , sausages , eggs , and a variety of other cooked foods , with a beverage such as coffee or tea . 
  it is especially popular in the uk and ireland , to the extent that many caf\u00e9s and pubs offer the meal at any time of day as an `` all-day breakfast '' . 
  it is also popular in other english-speaking countries . 
  ca n't be worse than switzerland not being in the eu or kaliningrad .

   high speed trains are already too expensive and the time saving does not justify the increased cost when it was raised in california ( what drove the discussion ) , it did make sense . 
  the problem was that the traditional hsr proposal was comparable in cost to airline tickets , but substantially-slower . 
  the hyperloop proposal could legitimately compete with the airline . 
  traditional trains did n't play well to the corridor , as there were no real intermediate stops that would play to a train 's strengths , and the distance was long enough ( ~ 380mi ( 611km ) ) from los angeles to san francisco that traditional hsr 's time was pretty long . 
  that does n't mean that just throwing hyperloop proposals everywhere works either -- just as traditional hsr did n't make much sense in california , so hyperloop would require a particular environment that plays to its strengths . 
  demand for enough long-distance travel , no intermediate stops , possible to build rail without many curves between the two points ... i do n't know if that exists on vienna-bratislava or bratislava-budapest . 
  it looks like vienna-bratislava is under 70km , which i suspect is probably too short to play to hyperloop 's * raison de etre * , though i 've no idea where the dividing line is . 
  on google maps , it does n't look like there 's anything significant between the two , so that 's a plus for hyperloop , i guess . 
  depends on how pretty the architecture was , really .

      lets just say i avoid talking about women with them . 
    then they arent completely norwegian are they https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman, 
  that 's because indian-americans were those people who made it through a skill-based immigration system -- they 're the kind of people that you 'd want to live alongside . 
  i do n't see how that justifies a claim that bombings are n't deadlier than shootings . 
  hmm . 
  i 'd say that * some * kind of mechanism would be useful , even if information has to be processed before being handed out . 
  if people do n't feel like the police are capable of protecting them , my guess is that far-right groups will aim to fill the gap , and that way lies trouble . 
  my guess is that compared to , say , the ussr , counterintelligence efforts on the part of islamic radicals are n't going to be as comprehensive -- you are n't going to have people trying to do effective organized efforts to sniff out leaks by selectively having disinformation float around . 
  if the limits on intelligence-sharing today are still geared towards the ussr , it might be more-appropriate to make them laxer .

  http://www.ibtimes.com/nyc-islamic-state-plot-italian-mafia-warns-isis-stay-away-new-york-2196169  the italian mafia in new york has issued a warning to the islamic state group : if you come to the five boroughs , you 're going to find yourself in a fight with the mob . 
  a man claiming to represent the italian crime organization said it will do its part to protect new yorkers from terrorist attacks and that it is better-positioned to provide security than federal agencies like the fbi and department of homeland security . 
    `` they often act too late or fail to see a complete picture of what 's happening due to a lack of ` human intelligence , ' '' giovanni gambino , the son of a new york mob boss , told nbc news . 
  `` the mafia has a bad reputation , but much of that 's undeserved . 
  as with everything in life , there are good , bad and ugly parts -- the rise of global terrorism gives the mafia a chance to show its good side . '' < shrug ,

  ... that she 's probably at the anarchist end of [ libertarianism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarianism ) . 
  while i think that you could find people who would be willing to debate the merits of the extent or type of force in conflicts on a case-by-case basis , i am also pretty dubious that there are a lot of people onboard with the broader idea that eliminating states is a good approach .
