   what if i say that about ... < examines text   with regard to these offences listed , eu countries must ensure that they are punishable by :   * effective , proportionate and dissuasive penalties ;   * a term of imprisonment of a maximum of at least one year . 
  hmm . 
   instigating , aiding or abetting in the commission of the above offences is also punishable . 
  i hope nobody voted up any nasty comments about americans , russians , germans , romanians , or islamic immigrants . 
   some of us are european who live in americs precisely because we ca n't take the breakdown of political freedom or the increasingly authoritarian culture of the continent .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil_shale_reserves  the biggest oil shale reserves in europe are located in russia ( equal to 35.47 billion metric tons of shale oil ) . 
  major deposits are located in the volga-petchyorsk province and in the baltic oil shale basin . 
  however , both the us and the eu have banned export of oil extraction equipment and technology to russia since early in the crisis . 
  http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/embassy-faq#subcat150  the august 6 rule added new \u00a7 746.5 of the ear , imposing licensing requirements on eight export control classification numbers ( eccn ) ( two of which were newly added in the august 6 rule ) and fifty three schedule b numbers if a person knows ( or is informed by bis ) that the item will be used directly or indirectly in exploration for , or production of , oil or gas in :   a. russian deepwater ( greater than 500 feet ) ;   b. arctic offshore locations ;   c. shale formations in russia ; or   d. is unable to determine whether the item will be used in the aforementioned projects . 
    a licensing policy of presumption of denial applies for exports , reexports , or transfer ( in-country ) for the aforementioned projects that have the potential to produce oil . 
  a licensing policy of case-by-case review applies for such projects that have the potential to produce gas . 
  http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/sanctions-on-technology-imports-leave-russia-playing-catch-up/504484.html  the impact of the eu 's latest and harshest sanctions on russia will be felt most keenly in the country 's economic sectors that are largely dependent on state-of-the-art western technology , ranging from the extraction of hydrocarbons to civil aircraft production , analysts said . 
  [ snip ]  of the various measures imposed by the eu , the most significant are the restrictions on russian imports of equipment and technology related to the oil industry , said david cadier , a fellow at international strategy and diplomacy at the department of international relations of the london school of economics and political science . 
  russia winds up in a position where she has to compete at a technological disadvantage in international competition to access her own primary source of export revenue . 
  the us already put in place a legal mechanism after the ukraine stuff kicked off to automatically add more us sanctions to russia if gazprom withholds gas from nato members or ukraine . 
  https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/s2828/bills-113s2828es.pdf  ( 3 ) contingent sanction relating to gazprom   . -- if the president determines that gazprom is withholding significant natural gas supplies from member countries of the north atlantic treaty organization , or further withholds significant natural gas supplies from countries such as ukraine , georgia , or moldova , the president shall , not later than 45 days after making that determination , impose the sanction described in subsection ( c ) ( 7 ) and at least one additional sanction described in subsection ( c ) with respect to gazprom . 
  probably a good idea in general in cases where there 's clearly political pressure being applied via pricing from a monopoly . 
   it 's enough that different prices for each country are politicially motivated .

  you guys * are * the eu . 
  how about you just fix the eu 's laws ? 
  you could blame them for agreeing to cooperate . 
  i mean , i think that it 's hard to place as much blame on them -- they are n't organizations designed to engage in political advocacy -- as it is the government in question , but ... 
  how about a significant chunk of the eu being a developed economy , where growth requires developing new technology rather than adopting already-developed technology ?

   if i say that `` according to minnesota transracial adoption study , black adopted children have a far lower iq than white adopted children '' , it gets already now sometimes censored in reddit . 
  that 's different -- i do n't know of any place in the world that prohibits people from building private communities and restricting speech in one way or another there . 
  if you want to have a club that people voluntarily join where nobody can use adverbs or be kicked out , that 's your affair . 
  but that 's different from having * laws * restricting speech .

  the spanish inquisition came first , mind . 
   they are n't targeting discussion , just blind hate . 
  i do n't understand this distinction . 
  i do n't even see how the restrictions as phrased have anything to do with `` discussion '' or `` blind hate '' , assuming that by `` blind '' you mean `` essentially meaning-free '' . 
  all of these restrictions are on * public * speech , right ?

  the way i like to put it : if the only argument for your policy that people hear is that you happen to be the one in power at the moment and can prohibit the other guy 's speech ... you 've got a terribly unconvincing argument . 
  there 's always a suspicion in my mind that if your argument is * right * , then why exactly would you * ban * the other guy 's argument ? 
  why ca n't your argument stand up on its own merits ? 
  what kind of terrible hole exists in your argument that you ca n't permit to be seen ? 
  and what happens when the * wrong * crowd gets power -- as must inevitably happen from time to time -- and abruptly gets the ability to ban * your * speech ? 
  or what if the general population is just wrong on some point , be it on theism ( blasphemy bans ) , politics ( bans on criticism of an active monarchy ) , or what-have-you ?

  i 'm not familiar with the mechanics of bookmaking , but someone ca n't `` cancel '' or `` sell '' their bet back to the bookmaker , right ? 
  it 's not a futures market . 
  that means that odds given by bookmakers reflect already-placed bets , right ? 
  so if i put $ 1m down that the uk remains and then new information shows up and everyone starts putting money down that the uk leaves , the odds would reflect my earlier bet . 
  so i 'd think that odds given by bookmakers will tend to be a relatively-sluggish indicator , if i understand correctly -- the only way for the absolute odds to track new information closely is if the amount of money bet kept greatly increasing over time -- it 'd have to be exponential growth in the betting pool over time , in fact , were current information even to have equal weight with old information . 
  i 'd think that if one were to look at bookmaking , the interesting question would be the * direction * that the odds are going rather than in their absolute value , since that reflects the best current information rather than stale information . 
  it looks like [ bookmakers are indeed shortening their odds on leave ] ( http://www.cityam.com/242321/eu-referendum-odds-bookmakers-cut-odds-on-brexit-again-as-leave-rally-continues ) , and rapidly so :  william hill is now offering 10/3 on a leave vote , down from 4/1 within two days . 
  meanwhile , betway has cut its odds from 4/1 to 3/1 , while remain has drifted to 2/9 , from 1/8 . 
  that would mean that present bets are on leave . 
  ... as an interesting tidbit , that seems to me to make a powerful argument that there is a strong incentive to bet at the last minute , since you can make bets with more information against people who had less information . 
  i would be very surprised if the people involved in negotiating the deal were not intimately-familiar with both nafta and the eu 's prior free trade agreements in crafting ttip ( particularly since ttip would need to be compatible with them ) .

  i 'd be thinking that people voting from abroad * would * overwhelmingly favor remain , since probably most of those are voting from other eu members , right ?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_in_the_united_kingdom  to date , only two referendums have been held which have covered the whole of the united kingdom : the first on membership of the european economic community in 1975 , and the second on adopting the alternative vote system in parliamentary elections in 2011 . 
    the current conservative government has legislated to hold a second referendum on british membership of the european union , which will be held on thursday 23 june 2016 , forty-one years after the 1975 eec referendum , with active campaigning now underway .

  sorry , it looks like it was my error -- i found two pages that made the same use . 
  all of my initial hits for `` aggravating circumstances '' and `` three strikes '' turned up only pages that used the term in an unrelated way , which seemed terribly-unlikely . 
  it might just be that `` three strikes '' is an informal , popular term and `` aggravating circumstances '' is a formal legal one and so they do n't normally show up in the same context . 
  i 've never heard `` aggravating circumstances '' used to refer to `` three strikes and you 're out '' laws over here -- just to things that in some way connect to the actual crime in question . 
  i do n't think that the term translates to quite the same thing .
