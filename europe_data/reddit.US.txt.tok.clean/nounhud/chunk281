  http://yle.fi/uutiset/helsinki-tallinn_ferry_traffic_at_record_high/6250274  helsinki-tallinn ferry traffic at record high   over 70 percent of passenger traffic at the port of helsinki during the first six months of the year was on the route to and from the estonian capital tallinn . 
  july passenger figures hit a new all-time high of more than 950,000 . 
  that 's actually not far off usage on the existing ferry system relative to what the channel tunnel gets -- more than half of it , and it 's not inconceivable that usage would increase if the commute was faster ( would be interesting to see what happened with traffic after the channel tunnel was added ) . 
  now , i 'll grant , i do n't know how price-sensitive those users are . 
  but the numbers of people alone do n't seem to rule it out . 
   however , she went to the press with her story , saying she felt offended that she is n't allowed to wear her hijab to work . 
  just buy some [ scrubs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scrubs_\\ ( clothing \\ ) ) that have a hijab .

  it looks like the british eu referendum will be on a thursday . 
  i ca n't help but think that cameron would have been better-off as regards staying in the eu if he had chosen a sunday . 
   this is only happening because the tory party would have gone up in flames if cameron had tried to renege . 
  christ , they 're doing a pretty good job of that anyway . 
  everything i 've heard is that labour is in a pretty poor state . 
  the concern would be over the liberal democrats seizing control of everything from behind ? 
  i mean , sure , a lot of people here are politics or international affairs junkies , but this is maybe the most-influential vote that has ever been held in the uk -- it may direct the course of the uk for hundreds of years , if it 's on par with what uk member nations have done in the past . 
  for comparison , [ puerto rico held a * non-binding * referendum on us statehood in 2012 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rican_status_referendum,_2012 ) , ( on a weekday and the us does n't have voting holidays ) , and it still managed 78.19 % turnout . 
  i realize that membership in a federation and in a confederation are a bit different in the immediate sense , but ... gah , i could see being strongly opposed or strongly for , but it seems so hard to be simply indifferent about it . 
  edit : ah , this referendum is n't binding either . 
  i was not aware of that . 
  in the us , voting does not have a holiday allocated to it , and so it 's more-convenient for retirees , though i believe that voting days * are * often holidays in europe . 
  no dispute there . 
  i also would point out that afaik , none of those polls try to capture likely turnout , which historically has not been even across ages and political positions . 
  if turnout is on par with historical votes , it will probably tend to give advantage to leave relative to unweighted polls . 
  [ remain at a 1 % lead averaged across recent polls ] ( http://whatukthinks.org/eu/opinion-polls/poll-of-polls/ ) . 
   a federal europe , all of it , would be impossible anyway . 
  getting belarus , ukraine , moldova , kosovo , russia and so on in on a federal europe seems impossible currently . 
  the us used to have states [ like vermont ] ( http://slavenorth.com/vermont.htm ) :  the newly formed state , which broke away from new york , abolished slavery outright in its constitution , dated july 8 , 1777 . 
    the relevant section is chapter i , subtitled `` a declaration of the rights of the inhabitants of the state of vermont ''    i. 
  that all men are born equally free and independent , and have certain natural , inherent and unalienable rights , amongst which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty ; acquiring , possessing and protecting property , and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety . 
  therefore , no male person , born in this country , or brought from over sea , ought to be holden by law , to serve any person , as a servant , slave or apprentice , after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years , nor female , in like manner , after she arrives to the age of eighteen years , unless they are bound by their own consent , after they arrive to such age , or bound by law , for the payment of debts , damages , fines , costs , or the like . 
  ... which saw slavery as being at fundamental odds with the very existence of the state and its ideals , as well as [ georgia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_slavery_in_georgia_\\ ( u.s. _ state \\ ) ) , where the economy was tied up and dependent upon slavery . 
  now , i 'll certainly concede that ultimately , those differences were n't worked out very well , but certainly both states were able to co-exist in a federal union despite those . 
  and i think that those sorts of differences are greater than those that exist between , say , poland and france . 
  a large , europe-wide federal union is certainly not the only way to go . 
  it may very well not be the * best * way to go . 
  but unless someone simply rejects the idea that the us is a functioning union ( which i suppose that someone might ) , i have a hard time with the idea that member countries are just * so * different that union is not possible . 
  i think that more-interesting questions are : * does one want to be part of a larger country or a smaller country ? 
  * does one want ones borders to be where they would be in the event of a federation ? 
  * does one want more-unified laws and labor mobility within a larger area ? 
  * is one willing to accept a blending of cultures and religions ? 
  * does a lack of federalization just become an annoyance once people have moved around enough between countries ? 
  after all , at a certain point , with freedom of movement and labor , europe becomes so blended that the lines seem to divide things that are increasingly-similar on each side . 
  * does one want to avoid the possible alternate outcomes that federalization forestalls ? 
  for example , i can think of at least two possible scenarios that happen if europe fragments that may be of concern to the netherlands : one , two roughly-equal countries wind up splitting europe , possibly not on the best of terms down the road . 
  two , something like the soviet union winds up being reconstituted . 
  * are things like a common military and a common passport and a common arsenal of value ? 
  what are your deep concerns about federalization ? 
  some of the largest concerns about a union seem to have already been passed : * freedom of labor and movement mean that competition for jobs already exists . 
  to me , that seems like one of the greatest worries that people would have . 
  * language or culture is already spread all over anyway -- we 're speaking in english on this forum , after all . 
  i certainly do n't think that federalization is a no-brainer . 
  i think that many people in the us preferred a confederation at one point in time ... but i also think that few people today want to return to a confederation . 
  and if that 's the case , it seems like an argument against eu federalization entails either saying that they are misguided or that fundamental differences exist between the us and the eu that make their situations different . 
   i am anti-democratic . 
  most people do n't even have an advanced college degree . 
  and out of those who actually have , only a small fraction actually has proper academic education about the relevant topics . 
  certainly i think that the criticism is a fair one in some ways , but i think that you 're missing an important bit . 
  for a society to be stable , to avoid popular discontent ( and even , ultimately , revolutions ) one needs to * actually * sell the public on it . 
  if you fail to sell the public on yourself and your ideas , you do n't get to get into power in a democracy . 
  that makes for a more-stable system . 
  additionally , joe on the street does n't * have * to be expert in everything . 
  if it turns out that a leader is doing something wrong , and as long as there 's a free press and meaningful political opposition in that democracy , all i have to do is be able to identify the problem , write it up in a way that is approachable to joe , and then hand it to the opposition , which has every incentive to publicize it . 
  democracy * is n't * perfect . 
  it 's relatively-young compared to , say , monarchy -- i do not think that `` democracy as seen today '' is the end-all-be-all of political systems . 
  but i think that it * is * the best system that we 've yet produced . 
  from your comments , it sounds like you want some set of more-capable people to be identified and placed in power . 
  let 's say that you take an aristocracy ( initially `` rule by the best '' ) or more-modern terms of a meritocracy or technocracy . 
  how do you keep the criteria for `` best '' from being subverted by the system ? 
  how do you avoid the interests of the rulers from diverging from those of the public ? 
  how do you let off pressure before a real civil war shows up ? 
  i think that those issues are , in the real world , more-severe than those that modern democracy has to deal with . 
  so ... i do think that there is room for improvement . 
  i am sure that there are incremental improvements available . 
  it may even be ( probably is ) that we find a new form of government that is * radically * different from a democracy and really is generally-better . 
  but i do n't think that there 's another form of government that people know about today that works better , and i think that there are a lot of seductive traps to fall into in choosing from existing alternatives . 
  i think that some of this is because people want to do data-driven assessment of their articles , rather than having an editor make the call as to what people want to read . 
  that 's fine -- great , in fact -- but the problem is that one of the easiest things to measure is view count . 
  if you measure view count , then what * really * matters is how much the title draws someone in . 
  to try to address that , editors can split articles into two or more parts and force you to click through to another part ( the reason that you get those annoying multi-part articles -- it 's just so that they can measure whether people are actually reading past the initial bit ) . 
  however , if people tend to * keep * reading once they 've jumped the hoop of having been drawn into the article , it 's still not a great measurement . 
  the missing metric is what the article does to people 's view of the publication 's brand . 
  do i walk away thinking `` that publication is full of sensationalist dreck '' or `` wow , that article was really interesting '' ? 
  the former damages the publication 's brand ... and because that 's hard to measure , i think that people * are n't * measuring it . 
  because sacrificing a journal 's reputation can be used to get view counts , people will optimize in a way that harms that journal 's reputation . 
  so , i think that it 's really a common ( and important ) methodology error made in a wholeheartedly-positive move . 
  i do n't agree with you that * all * news websites are doing this . 
  i can name at least two that i think do a fairly good job of keeping headlines mostly non-sensationalist : * [ * the economist * ] ( http://www.economist.com/ ) * [ * the christian science monitor * ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/ ) my guess is that however they internally measure articles differs and creates different incentives . 
  note that * the economist * is unusual in that all articles it runs are anonymous . 
  i 'd have * thought * that this would tend to exacerbate things ( i do n't need to worry about damaging my * own * reputation for sensationalist articles ) , but either that 's not the case or it 's not a dominant factor . 
  how are you measuring `` illegal but often unenforced '' relative to `` confirmed illegal '' ? 
  i mean , do n't get me wrong , i think that that 's a very meaningful and important separation , but unless there are some hard criteria backing up that categorization , it seems likely that it 's kind of arbitrary . 
  had that alliance not existed , each would have been individually-vulnerable , and [ germany had an interest in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/septemberprogramm ) . 
   for example , if i see a bunch of asian tourists doing something strange , since i do n't know if they 're chinese , japanese , korean , etc. 
  i 'd point them out not as asian but as yellow . 
  < shrug  it 'd be generally considered offensive and probably old-fashioned in the us . 
  i do n't really know enough about croatian society to have something that i could use as a comparable example . 
   although i 'm curious now , how many races would you say exist , how do you divide and classify races ? 
  like continents racial classification depends on culture . 
  i do n't think that it 's really an interesting question , nor one that really has a clearly `` right '' answer . '', 
  you can draw the lines however you want -- it 's like [ asking whether blue and green should be separate colors or not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue%e2%80%93green_distinction_in_language ) .
