  i want unbiased data , and they want to influence me . 
  * there 's comparatively-little downside to incorrect things being said , or a good filter for separating opinion and fact . 
  * there 's a selection bias . 
  the people who populate a political forum are inherently going to be people who are particularly worked up about a particular view , moreso than people in the general population . 
  * there 's often limited expertise involved compared to the first option . 
  i do n't think that political advocacy forums in general are good places to try to get an accurate picture of a country . 
  how sure are you that that is n't just a product of environment that could change quickly in a different environment ? 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2783332/make-way-for-the-trophy-toy-boy-as-rich-older-women-turn-the-tables.html  to even qualify for the ranking process , women have to be over 35 , and have a salary of more than $ 500,000 or assets of more than $ 4m . 
  men , however , simply have to be under 35 and submit five pictures for vetting by a `` celebrity matchmaker '' . 
  the majority purport to be models , but those men looking to be wooed include a 26-year-old derivatives trader and a citigroup banker . 
    pocket change rather boldly refers to this novel form of match-making as `` the fourth wave of feminism '' . 
  in fact , it just looks like a role-reversal of what has happened on wall street and in the city of london for years - albeit now it is rich old women preying on attractive young men , rather than the other way around . 
  granted , the financial differences there might be more-significant -- these are women well-to-do by western standards . 
  however , that 's a rather quick change when money is in the other wallet . 
   not only does that go against innate biology i 'm not following . 
  i mean , i would agree that there must have been biological causes for polyandry to be so rare around the world , across so many different cultures , but surely you 'd agree that such an environment has also shifted dramatically in very recent times , and an environment with poorer working men and wealthier working women was not representative of any environment in the past ? 
   it strongly goes against their culture granted . 
  still , i think that * most * cultures have had at least somewhat of a taboo for a woman to be the primary breadwinner . 
   more likely these guys are going to try to bring over brides from the middle east ( legally or illegally ) . 
  i will agree with that ... certainly , a gender imbalance means that there 's going to be pressure to pull in women to sweden from * somewhere * . 
   i have a feeling that this problem is stemming from the american unwillingness to call people yellows i think that `` black '' or `` african-american '' is used for primarily three reasons : * at the time of the slave trading happening , current african nation-states did n't really exist as such , so people did n't really have recognizable surnames and identities that dated back to the time the way the english or the irish or the germans or chinese or japanese did . 
  * most blacks in the us today are descended from some generations of slavery . 
  slavery did n't necessarily attach records , at least in some states ( if not all ? ), 
  prohibited education , slave families could be split up at a young age , and i strongly suspect that most slaves did n't retain written records or knowledge of where * precisely * their ancestors came from . 
  looking at wikipedia , it [ looks like we mostly need to use genetic analysis to try to get an idea of where in africa someone came from ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cameroonian_americans ) if their ancestors were brought over during the slavery era . 
  * slaves were n't permitted to go where they want and join whatever neighborhoods they wanted -- they had to go where they were sold . 
  so even if people from , say , what would be the democratic republic of the congo today * wanted * to all live together , they did n't really have that option . 
  instead , you had a lot of people whose common characteristic was just that they were from africa being placed together . 
  the lack of those issues for east asia kind of kill construction of a common identity . 
  i would bet that modern , post-slavery african immigrants to the us * do * have that sense of attached-to-a-nation-state identity -- for example , everyone knows that obama 's dad is from kenya -- but there 's already a fairly generic identity of `` black '' built up , with culture and so forth in place . 
  those two above factors do n't are n't really the case for immigrants to the us from east asia -- people know from where they came , and i do n't think that people ever intentionally chose to adopt `` yellow '' as a generic identifier . 
  finally , the us had comparatively-little immigration from east asia until quite recently . 
  there was little immigration early on , and then the [ chinese exclusion act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_exclusion_act ) and related legislation strongly limited it . 
  as a result , i suspect that you 'd find that immigrants to the us from east asia are comparatively-recent newcomers -- less time to lose track across generations of precisely where someone came from . 
  edit : though i 'll concede that `` asian '' in the us really is used more in the sense of a racial term -- that is , someone might well say `` he looks asian '' , so i guess i 'd buy into your argument on that point . 
  they translate `` occupant '' as `` invader '' in the opening bit . 
  is that the best translation ? 
  i 'd have used `` occupier '' , and they translate it as `` occupier '' elsewhere in the thing . 
   if we look from any historical perspective , a union with russia always benefited one country only : russia itself !, 
  i do n't know about `` union '' , but france benefited in world war i from the military alliance with russia . 
  music ? 
  i 'm not sure how much i like the idea of including an entire msa in the idea of a `` city '' -- that includes half of new jersey . 
  how many people ( including new jerseyians themselves ) think of themselves as new yorkers ? 
  [ the largest msa ] ( http://www.city-data.com/forum/general-u-s/1228217-area-square-miles-all-metropolitan-statistical.html ) is about two-and-a-half times the size of belgium ( 27,259 square miles/70 ,600 square kilometers compared to 11,787 square miles/30 ,528 square kilometers ) , and i think that most people would have a hard time thinking of belgium as one city . 
   sweden will probably cope but they might want to review their policy of taking in tens of thousands of `` teenage boys '' every year before it really gets out of hand . 
  that [ appears to be hard to address ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428644-300-with-no-paper-trail-can-science-determine-age/ ) . 
  it 's surprising , given all that we 've accomplished in forensics in areas like fingerprinting and genetics , but apparently nobody has yet invented an absolutely-reliable method for giving someone 's age based on physically-measuring a person and analyzing that data . 
  we can provide useful data , but a country would have to say `` are we willing to accept the false positive rate of x % '' if they start doing medical age-measuring . 
  according to that article , the us does do this . 
  sweden apparently does not do so at the moment . 
  sweden may-or-may-not view the benefits of doing so as outweighing the drawbacks . 
  i disagree . 
  / u/lucky13r is very much pro-russia . 
  he 's made some statements about the us being behind things that i think are pretty ridiculous . 
  i certainly strongly disagree with many of his posts . 
  but ... if he 's a paid troll , i 'll eat my hat . 
  it 's not cost-effective to pay people to engage in extended arguments on the spot . 
  look at what people who were known to be paid trolls were doing -- mass-spamming major media comment sections with low-effort copy-paste things . 
  throughput was a goal , [ creating the perception that the masses felt way x ] ( http://changingminds.org/techniques/propaganda/bandwagon.htm ) . 
  he 's a guy who does n't like the west and likes russia and buys into a lot of sources that i 'd consider pretty dubious . 
  there are people who do the same thing for the us or for whatever country you could name . 
  and while identifying propaganda is a real interest , and finding attempts to try to subvert the press in some way is a legitimate concern , there 's also a risk of simply automatically flagging anything that anyone says as being paid and bogus . 
  dialog breaks down in that situation . 
  and i do n't think that it makes a country stronger or better-off to have dialog break down . 
  at the end of the day , paid trolls may be prolific in their output , but they 're going to be vastly outnumbered by people who are , whatever their feelings one way or another , not being paid . 
   1.25 to 1 m/f when or if family reunification happens this new immigrant group will account for 25 % of this age group of swedes . 
  it 's probably a reasonably safe assumption to make that a substantial chunk of people claiming that they are under eighteen are doing so fraudulently for legal reasons during asylum so that they can be classified as unaccompanied minors -- that is , you * do * have a male-female imbalance in that age rage , but it 's not 1.25-to-1 . 
  that 's just among the men * claiming * to be in that age range . 
  as far as i know , there are no similar benefits for family reunification , so i 'd assume that women coming later would claim their actual age , and you 'd have a wider spread . 
  hmm . 
  sweden 's government is center-left , not left , right ? 
  i 'd thought that under european terminology , left would be , oh , the communist party of the soviet union or something like that . 
  / u/strl is just giving you a hard time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_return  the law of return ( hebrew : \u05d7\u05b9\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea , \u1e25ok ha-shv\u016bt ) is israeli legislation , passed on 5 july 1950 , that gives jews the right of return and the right to live in israel and to gain israeli citizenship . 
  [ 1 ] ** in 1970 , the right of entry and settlement was extended to people with one jewish grandparent ** or people married to a jew , although they were not considered jewish under jewish law . 
  [ 2 ] looks like a green light to me !, 
  realistically , if sweden wanted to block immigration , i really think that it will happen now , not during family reunification after someone has citizenship . 
  blocking family reunification seems to me to be far more politically-difficult than blocking someone from initially entering . 
  are you going to be the politician to stand up on a stage with some tearful guy and his wife and tell them that they ca n't be together ? 
  maybe if abuse is severe , it might be * capped * ( e.g. 
  marriages of convenience , depending upon how sweden deals with people breaking up after being reunified , or via many people claiming that they have `` adopted '' children ) . 
  but i ca n't realistically imagine sweden ending family reunification . 
  it 's simply considered a norm to be able to bring family into a country where you have citizenship . 
  in the us , family reunification ( for certain family relationships ) is the only unlimited route to legally immigrate -- it 's seen by the immigration authorities as more-essential than anything else . 
  yeah , but i can understand wanting a concise term that also implies that the thing is online and maybe a more-specific body of behavior . 
  i just wish it were something other than `` troll '' . 
  it 's similar-enough to the other usage that the two ca n't always be distinguished from context , but different enough that it matters which the speaker is referring to . 
   women 's groups and opposition politicians have criticized erdogan , a devout muslim for telling women how many children to have and dismissing the western idea of gender equality . 
  he has previously equated birth control with treason . 
  hard to argue with him , given that turkey is still the only country in europe that 's managed to get a 2.1 tfr ( though ireland is so close that it can effectively be considered there ) . 
  argh , this new use of `` troll '' for someone shilling is overtaking the traditional use , which i think had been a useful definition : - / https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/troll#english  8 : ( intransitive , internet slang ) ( to post inflammatory material so as ) to attempt to lure others into combative argument for purposes of personal entertainment and/or gratuitous disruption , especially in an online community or discussion now [ this use of the term ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/03/news/russia-troll-factory-putin/ ) is taking over . 
  :-(  a former employee of the internet research agency , lyudmila savchuk , has offered a rare glimpse inside the propaganda machine where young people were paid to praise president vladimir putin and his government . 
  i really wish that some journalist had coined a new term for the new thing . 
   yet , the u.s. and nato spent just as much time trying to control the western block hmm . 
  could you be more explicit about what you are referring to when you say `` control '' ? 
  looking at / r/sandersforpresident or / r/politics to try to get an objective picture of the us is kind of like looking at / r/unitedkingdom to try to get an objective picture of the uk . 
  more so , honestly ... 
   the irish blend in , like chameleons . 
  [ snip ]  abroad at least , irish villains tend to be better behaved . 
  [ snip ]  affability , reliability are good attributes for an international drug dealer .
