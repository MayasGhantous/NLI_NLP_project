  so many quotable quotes . 
  just like old times controlling drugs into china . 
  a broader question -- why is n't logging happening in wallonia ? 
   and of course , many of them ca n't be bothered to do small deals ( e.g. 
  for small countries ) honestly , creating a common copyright bloc with identical laws across a larger area would probably help that . 
  if i 'm a copyright holder and going to make $ n from a country on some content , but i 'm going to have to blow more than that on legal fees , it 's just not worth it . 
  on the other hand , if my overhead goes to zero , i 'd be a fool not to license it : i 'd just be turning down any potential sales . 
  delaware and mississippi do n't see different licensing models , for example ... 
   there already are millions of russians in germany , and their loyalty lies solely with russia < shrug  maybe . 
  see how their kids feel , though . 
  remember [ this article from the reddit submission three weeks ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ia1ff/the_day_we_discovered_our_parents_were_russian/ ) , `` the day we discovered our parents were russian spies '' . 
   the brothers ' battle to regain canadian citizenship is not just about logistics . 
  moscow is not a city that embraces newcomers , and neither of them feels particularly russian . 
  `` i feel like i have been stripped of my own identity for something i had nothing to do with , '' alex tells me . 
  both are keen to work in asia for the time being , but want to move to canada when they feel ready to start families . 
  more than anything , their canadian identity is the last straw they have left to grasp on to , after so much of the rest of their previous reality fell away . 
    `` i lived for 20 years believing that i was canadian and i still believe i am canadian , nothing can change that , '' tim wrote in his affidavit to the toronto court . 
  `` i do not have any attachment to russia , i do not speak the language , i do not know many friends there , i have not lived there for any extended periods of time and i do not want to live there . '' unless you 're going to have people not go through public schools , not consume mass media , not learn the language , not interact with other people ... it seems hard to stop people from developing a loyalty to the country that they grew up in . 
  i 'm not saying that there are n't concerns associated with immigration in general , but i think that it 's far different from the [ kind of situation in the baltics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) , where the goal was explicitly to try to permanently stamp out the borders and expand russia . 
  i assume that that 's the parallel you 're drawing , and i doubt that it 's terribly applicable . 
  i think that there 's also a selection bias that relates to parents as well -- generally-speaking , the people who leave country a for country b are the people who are more-enthusiastic about country b than a. 
  few people want to immigrate somewhere where they think that the system is working * worse * -- you do n't see huge population outflows from france to , say , eritrea . 
  i think a bigger concern would be for russia -- russia 's got her own fertility rate problems , and is losing people to the rest of the world . 
  [ wikipedia : polyandry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyandry ) according to wikipedia , not common in human history , but has happened in very poor areas where one guy ca n't reliably support one woman . 
  situations where one woman would support multiple men would be a new mechanism ... 
  i do n't know what people in the uk would say , but in the us , one would n't use the term at all in common use to refer to someone in iraq -- you 'd just say `` iraqi '' , and there would n't be an adjective out there that refers to all people from the middle east , the indian subcontinent , pakistan , mongolia , north korea , etc. 
  you could say `` person born in asia '' , and people would understand what you mean . 
  however , if you said `` asian '' , as a single word , and then brought out someone from india or turkey , someone from the us would say `` i thought that you said that he was asian . '', 
  `` middle easterner '' would be the broadest adjective available for the iraqi area . 
  if you want a comparable use that 's probably present in albania , same sort of way that `` american '' gets used to refer to people in the us , even though the us is only a portion of the land in north america and south america . 
  or , for an example closer to home , how `` british '' ( currently ) refers to only a portion of the people living in the british isles . 
  there are definitely some people on this forum who want to use `` european '' to refer * only * to people in the eu ( which definitely is at odds with common use of `` european '' in the us ) . 
  there are also some people here who feel very strongly about calling people from turkey not european . 
  i had n't initially realized how bound up with identity a lot of all this is , because my own country 's world view was simply the only one i 'd run into for a while . 
  gotcha , was n't sure what the term `` asian '' meant in albania . 
  related : in albania , is europe classified as a continent ? 
  http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/asian  asian   * in the us , canada , australia , and new zealand : belonging to or relating to china , japan , or countries near them   * in the uk : belonging to or relating to india , pakistan , or countries near them i do n't know what the norm is in europe outside of that , whether someone would call someone from russia or mongolia `` asian '' or not . 
  i 'm guessing that people that have a [ different number of continents in their model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent#number_of_continents ) may also use different terminology . 
   migrants do n't feel any particular bonds to sweden , and i 'd bet that within a few years , a lot of them will flock to neighbouring countries and beyond . 
  unless the eu negotiates freedom of movement and labor within the eu for temporary and permanent residents , not just citizens ( and i would be very surprised if this arrangement is made ) , you 'd have to have some eu member granting citizenship first . ', 
  edit : unless you 're talking about illegal movement when you say `` flock '' . 
   most people do n't date outside of their social circles . 
  so educated date educated , swedish date swedes , similar incomes date similar incomes etc. 
  that was n't always the case , though . 
  women used to marry up more in the 1930s marriage model , where they were typically part of a one-income household . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/upshot/marriages-of-power-couples-reinforce-income-inequality.html?_r=0  these days , an investment banker may marry another investment banker rather than a high school sweetheart , or a lawyer will marry another lawyer , or a prestigious client , rather than a secretary . 
  whether measured in terms of income or education , there are more so-called power couples today than in the past , one manifestation of a phenomenon known as assortative mating , or more generally the pairing of like with like . 
    these matches are great for those individuals who can build prosperous and happy family alliances , but they also propagate inequality across the generations . 
  of all the causes behind growing income inequality , in the longer run this development may prove one of the most significant and also one of the hardest to counter . 
  [ snip ]  but there are also serious economic costs . 
  as it becomes harder for many people to `` marry up '' as a path for income mobility for themselves or their children , families that are not well connected may feel disengaged , and the significant , family-based advantages for some children may discourage others from even trying . 
  if there are lots of poor , unskilled male immigrants , i imagine that they might effectively take on the woman 's historic role , where marrying upward is very important to income mobility . 
  that being said , i 'd assume that family reunification will be pulling in more people ( including women ) later from the third world and even some of that out -- the above would only be the case if immigration persists in being heavily male . 
  it 's worth noting that every treaty limits sovereignty to the extent that the sovereign nation agrees to conform to it unless it chooses to withdraw -- the free trade agreements out there fall into this category . 
   it 's just a pity that most of the opposition to trade agreements and liberalized trade is so juvenile . 
  perhaps the organizations involved with creating such free trade agreements have done a poor job of explaining their rationale to the public ? 
   ah , lovely . 
  labour union and left/far-left think tanks . 
  note , for anyone other than me who has been confused by the name , that cepr at cepr.net is a left-wing political advocacy organization ( `` center for economic and policy research '' ) in the us . 
  it is * not * associated with cepr at cepr.org , which is a more-objective european economic organization that often gets referenced on this subreddit ( `` centre for economic policy research '' ) . 
  what publications do you consider reputable ? 
   http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-deadly-impacts-of-anti-russian-sanctions-on-the-eu-economy-2-5-million-jobs-threatened-study/5457122?print=1   the report is rt , but the primary data is from western , european institutions . 
  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/globalresearch  globalresearch is an anti- `` western '' website that ca n't distinguish between serious analysis and discreditable junk -- and so publishes both . 
  it 's basically the moonbat equivalent to infowars or wnd . 
    while some of globalresearch 's articles discuss legitimate humanitarian concerns , its view of science , economics , and geopolitics is conspiracist -- if something goes wrong , the ~ ~ jews ~ ~ west didit !, 
  the site has long been a crank magnet : if you disagree with `` western '' sources on 9/11 , or haarp , or vaccines , or h1n1 , or climate change , or anything published by the `` mainstream '' media , then globalresearch is guaranteed to have a page you will love . 
    the website ( under the domain names globalresearch.ca ( link ) , . org ( link ) , and . com ( link ) ) is run by the montreal-based non-profit the centre for research on globalisation ( crg ) founded by michel chossudovsky , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] a tenured professor at the university of ottawa . 
  [ 4 ] weep for the future . 
    whenever someone makes a remarkable claim and cites globalresearch , they are almost certainly wrong . 
  * individual eu governments might run into borrowing issues , but the eu as a whole is borrowing in euros , and the us is borrowing in dollars . 
  so at the end of the day , creditors and those holding assets linked to the currency might lose money in inflation , but that does n't mean that the bonds would n't be paid off in nominal terms or that the economy would collapse . 
  * frankly , while a bond default is n't * good * , it still does n't result in the collapse of an economy . 
  the only reason that greece has n't just said `` yup , you are n't getting paid back '' is because of pressures from other eu members . 
  europe as a whole would simply default on bad debt . 
  a couple of us states have defaulted on their obligations , and it certainly did n't collapse their economies . 
   low growth means someone who bet there would be more growth - that someone is a gigantic multi-trillion dollar market , will lose money on failed expectations . 
  sure , people will make bad bets on growth -- happens every time someone purchases an equity that falls in value . 
  but someone losing money does n't mean that the economy collapses . 
  the link you provided does n't support an assertion that the economy is going to collapse . 
  i 'd initially assumed that you might have been referencing marx or something . 
   europe and america 's economies must continuously grow or they will collapse , that is the nature of their economic system ... what ? 
   alcohol does n't have the same taboo as smoking does . 
  smoking did n't either , at one point . 
  it took similar campaigns to create that negative stigma . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  remember anti-tobacco campaigns -- the us introduced the mandatory [ `` nasty counter-advertising that you have to look at every time you go for a cigarette '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobacco_packaging_warning_messages#united_states_of_america ) . 
  that was fairly successful -- tobacco use fell off in the us . 
  what ireland is proposing would , it sounds like , be more-comparable to the us anti-tobacco effort than the us anti-alcohol effort . 
  the real question , it seems to me , is whether society can and will get behind anti-alcohol efforts . 
  alcohol has a really , really long history with human society -- i remember reading about how easy it was to get alcohol illicitly in pakistan , a place where it is much-more-broadly banned . 
  it [ failed in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobacco_packaging_warning_messages#united_states_of_america ) , but that might just be how it was structured there . 
  according to wikipedia -- i did not know this -- canada and russia had their own brief , also-failed periods of alcohol prohibition . 
  same idea -- a ban rather than requiring the product to contain advertising against itself . 
   merkel and bruxelles want these people in europe and will do everything in their power to get them in . 
  i do n't believe that this is true . 
  if germany wanted more immigration , she could have simply lifted her immigration limits . 
   language is a better point , although ` euro-english ' makes ground every year . 
   mr tsipras told reporters : `` we have repeatedly said that the vicious circle of militarisation , of cold war rhetoric and of sanctions is not productive . 
  ** the solution is dialogue . 
  ** ''   mr putin said : `` as far as crimea is concerned , we consider this question is closed forever .
