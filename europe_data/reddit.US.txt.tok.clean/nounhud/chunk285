  ** russia will not conduct any discussions with anyone on this subject . 
  ** '' the bbc is certainly having fun with the quotes they use on this one ... 
   if that is n't a statement of fact about the utter decrepit state of eu cohesion over competition harmonisation and economic laws then i do n't know what is . 
  would you say that things are better than they were 30 years ago ? 
   let 's just all conclude that guns are not good < triggered  ( no pun intended . ), 
  iirc you 're from nyc , so you probably do n't get this as much , but in some areas in the us , there are people concerned about the spread of spanish ( which is , in practice , converting huge numbers of people to english ) , and i 've run into a few people who have a [ not invented here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/not_invented_here ) attitude towards metric . 
  now imagine that you 're france and have the us , which spews media like there 's no tomorrow over everything . 
  that 's a different language . 
  there are economic differences . 
  imagine how much * larger * you 'd expect that effect to be . 
  * some * of it might be because the us is more tolerant of it . 
  maybe . 
  but i think a big fat chunk of it is because the us does n't * have * the kind of pressures that france is looking at . 
  while i 'm not saying that the fact that they were foreign * was n't * a factor , the article author seems to simply * assume * that this was the driving factor . 
   this week , american tech giants alphabet ( goog ) , amazon ( amzn ) and netflix ( nflx ) have had their omnipotence seriously challenged -- in europe . 
  as the american market becomes increasingly saturated with so many players in the space , it 's not shocking these tech giants would encroach on european territory . 
  but regulators are pushing back . 
   friday , russian news agency sputnik published a story under the headline , `` are nato 's massive war games on russia 's border a pretext to world war iii ? '', 
  [ business insider : russia 's military exercises are way bigger than nato 's ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russias-military-exercises-are-way-bigger-than-natos-2015-2 ) edit : note that the article is a year old , but i do n't believe that the relative size of the exercises has been inverted since then . 
   estonian prime minister taavi roivas has called for one nato battalion to be permanently stationed in each baltic nation in an interview with the german newspaper die welt has , published thursday . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battalion  typically a battalion consists of 300 to 800 soldiers ... just to make that a bit more concrete . 
  i like how an italian-american immigrant was caricatured by the japanese , who then re-exported him to europe where a german is now using it to portray italians on a european forum ... and everyone knows what it means . 
  that 's globalization . 
   even in the us actually , the us has much-more-friendly-to-debtors bankruptcy law compared to europe ... even compared to the uk , which is relatively-friendly as europe goes . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bankruptcy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bankruptcy_in_the_united_states some countries in europe ( e.g. 
  latvia ) do n't have a mechanism for debt discharge at all . 
  the uk was n't immune to mercantilism , though ... 
   mechanically it 's pretty similar to a human massage but you would never chose the artificial massage . 
  i 'll agree that the current norm may not be on par , but * never * is a long time . 
  i remember reading someone commenting about early automobiles and how unlikely it was that they 'd ever go anywhere . 
  they were very unreliable . 
  they were very noisy . 
  they were slow . 
  the road system was designed for traffic at something like maybe a maximum of 15 miles an hour . 
  they required fuel , which was n't available everywhere . 
  how would one see if one were traveling quickly at night ? 
  one had to wear goggles just to keep the wind from being too strong to keep one 's eyes open , after all . 
  how would one not be killed if the car hit something -- there were n't seatbelts , airbags , safety glass , crumple zones , crash test dummies , etc then . 
  humans may be better at massage today , but they were also better at chess once . 
  yes , assuming that production output remains the same . 
  however , to date , people have chosen to increase their standard of living . 
  so all those people associated with the robotic factory spend money , and this produces new jobs . 
   that 's what progress is about kinda abstract -- i 'd say that 's what wealth is about . 
  that 's how standards of living rise -- developing more-efficient processes .
