  ** [ united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_star-spangled_banner ) ( about the fact that the british night shelling of fort mchenry did n't cause it to surrender ) :  o say can you see , by the dawn 's early light ,   what so proudly we hailed at the twilight 's last gleaming ,   ** whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight , **   ** o'er the ramparts we watched , were so gallantly streaming ?

   part of his mission as president , obama explained , is to spur other countries to take action for themselves , rather than wait for the u.s. to lead . 
  ** the defense of the liberal international order against jihadist terror , russian adventurism , and chinese bullying depends in part , he believes , on the willingness of other nations to share the burden with the u.s. ** this is why the controversy surrounding the assertion -- made by an anonymous administration official to the new yorker during the libya crisis of 2011 -- that his policy consisted of `` leading from behind '' perturbed him . 
  `` we do n't have to always be the ones who are up front , '' he told me . 
  `` sometimes we 're going to get what we want precisely because we are sharing in the agenda . 
  the irony is that it was precisely in order to prevent the europeans and the arab states from holding our coats while we did all the fighting that we , by design , insisted '' that they lead during the mission to remove muammar qaddafi from power in libya . 
  `` it was part of the anti -- free rider campaign . '' i assume that this is what you 're referring to . 
  the statement that european countries should take the lead for security issues in europe 's neighborhood and take a larger international role does n't seem to me to be jingoistic .

   baltic female snipers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_tights  `` white tights '' ( also `` white pantyhose '' or white stockings ; [ 1 ] the beliye kolgotki , russian : \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 ; latvian : balt\u0101s ze\u0137bikses ; estonian : valged sukkp\u00fcksid ) is a russian urban myth surrounding the alleged participation of female sniper mercenaries in combat against russian forces in various armed conflicts from late 1980s . 
  [ 2 ] the myth describes these women as blond amazon-like nationalistic biathletes turned anti-russian mercenaries . 
  they come predominantly from the baltic states , but subsequent variations of the myth have diversified the ethnic composition of the snipers , including ukrainian , russian women in their midst . 
  the name `` white tights '' originates from the white-coloured winter sports attire these snipers were wearing and was first coined during the nagorno-karabakh war .

   savchenko was n't a soldier . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nadiya_savchenko  at 16 , savchenko was already determined to become a pilot . 
  she joined the ukrainian army , working as a radio operator with the country 's railway forces before training as a paratrooper . 
  [ 18 ] she was then the only ukrainian female soldier in the ( 2004 -- 2008 ) ukrainian peacekeeping troops in iraq .
