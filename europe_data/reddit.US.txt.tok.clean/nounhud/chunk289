  upon returning , she successfully petitioned the defense ministry for the right to attend the prestigious air force university in kharkiv , which until then had been open only to men ; she graduated in 2009 . 
  [ 19 ]   in 2010 , she was posted to the 3rd army aviation regiment in brody , lviv oblast . 
  in 2011 , the ukraine defense forces published a 20-minute documentary about savchenko and her military career . 
  [ 20 ] she also featured in a united nations development program as part of a drive to promote equality in the ukrainian military . 
  [ 21 ] in 2014 , she volunteered as an instructor in the aidar battalion . 
  [ 22 ] it looks like she was a soldier , even if aidar was not , at the time , part of the ukranian military . 
  and while it looks like you 're right that aidar was disbanded and some of the people booted out , it was reconstituted as part of the ukranian military :  aidar was formally disbanded on 2 march 2015 `` to prevent illegal actions of some representatives of volunteer units '' ( according to the general staff of the ukrainian armed forces ) . 
  [ 1 ] after a `` careful selection of soldiers `` it was then reorganized as the 24th separate assault battalion of the ukrainian army . 
  [ 1 ] lieutenant colonel yevhen ptashnik was appointed as commander of the battalion . 
   putin happily meeting people who had fake identities in america to conduct espionage looked pretty terrible . 
  did it ? 
  i mean , i do n't think that russia feels pressure to claim that they do n't spy on the us . 
   our government denies that those are soldiers . 
  let 's see how the tune will change once they arrive to the motherland . 
  i will bet against you on that , that russia will not . 
  russia has n't made a big deal out of soldiers sent in earlier . 
  i do n't see a prisoner exchange now as being a cause to start . 
  has he made different statements about whether he would have sent russia 's military into ukraine before , though ? 
  i mean , you can certainly * object * to it -- i do -- but that does n't mean that he 's inconsistent on the point . 
  your english is fine -- i 'm not complaining about that . 
  it 's just that if you 're expecting to make an argument based on standard-of-living ( which i assume you are ) , that chart is instead talking about inequality . 
  it , regrettably , uses the unfortunately-rather-confusing term `` relative poverty '' to do so . 
  all right , polonium intake might increase , but / u/ajuc probably wo n't be seeing jail time . 
  * some places have the [ initiative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/initiative ) and [ referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendum ) to initiate direct votes . 
  aside from maybe some very basic questions of values , it kind of rules out the ability to make use of specialist knowledge . 
  i think that most voters tend to vote on these based on a rather gut reaction from the description . 
  i 'd rather have a less-democratic , more republican system for most situations . 
  california voted , a while back , to fund a [ rail system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/california_proposition_1a_\\ ( 2008 \\ ) ) that i 'd say makes little sense given california 's population layout , because the idea of rail was popular at the time . 
  i 'd really view the question of transportation planning as something that requires specialist knowledge . 
  i pulled some numbers up a while back that showed that current eu estimates were that all eu members * except * malta would be expected to see a gdp increase from ttip passing . 
  germany would be a major beneficiary . 
  however , in a poll , the maltese were the most-strongly in favor of ttip in the eu and the germans were among some of the most-opposed . 
  while it 's possible that there are other reasons than just economic concerns , i 'm suspicious that there 's simply a lack of specialist knowledge available . 
  * democracy is inherently somewhat slower-moving : any time you need to gather input from many people , it can not happen overnight . 
  modern governments do n't deal with decisions that need to be made quickly with democracy : you have your executive ( a governor , a president , or what-have-you ) . 
  he may himself be elected , but his actions have been a step removed from democracy so that democracy has only general input . 
  that makes it very quick to get a quorum if a decision must be made . 
  * democracy creates pressures on immigration , since if one has a democracy , immigration inherently means granting political power . 
  after job competition and possibly cultural shift , one of the concerns i hear about immigration is how immigrants might vote . 
  * there are some costs associated with democracy -- we have officials who need to re-sell themselves every few years , and need to devote their time to this , and citizens need to ( theoretically ) acquire some degree of understanding of the issues at vote , which eats up their time . 
  * because describing actual issues at stake is often boring , complicated , misleading-if-described-very-briefly and/or not appealing to 50 % +1 of the population , simplified stories ( `` we know how the public * should * vote ... how are we going to craft a story to sell this ? '' ), 
  wind up warping the public 's world view . 
  * in one-person-one-vote democratic systems , [ tyranny of the majority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyranny_of_the_majority ) means that even slight preferences of the majority overwhelm strong preferences of the minority . 
  * i believe that there 's a human tendency to want to impose one 's own social values on others -- that is , people tend to have difficulty separating * what i think i should do * from * what i think we need laws to make other people do * . 
  there seems to be more concern from the public over the possibility of social values shifting and willingness to try to pass laws to prevent this than from , say , the executive : i do n't often see the president trying to put policies in place to try to control the country 's morality , but the public often likes that sort of thing . 
  the more-democratic elements of a country seem to run into this issue more-heavily . 
  actually , i 'm surprised you did n't call it a `` rug '' . 
  when i hear the word `` carpet '' , i think of [ this ] ( http://www.remodernranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/livingroomentrance1.jpg ) -- a wall-to-wall covering . 
  when i hear `` rug '' , i think of [ this ] ( http://www.countrylivingprimitives.com/images/detailed/1/c-81_oval_braided_rug.jpg ) -- a small , relatively-easily-movable thing . 
  as far as i know , russia does n't claim [ universal jurisdiction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universal_jurisdiction ) , so no . 
  [ so you want to build a coral reef ? 
  ] ( http://www.seacommunities.com/blogs/so-you-want-build-coral-reef )  historically , in the us , artificial reefs were built from `` materials of opportunity '' . 
  a euphemism for conscientious dumping . 
  there is a fascinating government booklet `` * guidelines for marine artificial reef materials * '' jointly written by various us fisheries commissions . 
  it delves into the various materials that us artificial reefs are built from . 
  concrete culverts , warships , oil rigs , planes , trains , turn of century rail box cars , new york subway carriages , military hardware , cars , tires , municipal incineration ash residue ... . true . 
  it 's all in the booklet . 
  this is a bit of an oversimplification , but the general thinking went something like this : it 's too costly to break down the thing into salvage , we ca n't sell the thing for security reasons , it 's too bulky for landfill , we need a reef , ergo . 
  the us federal government used to give the warships for free to the states for reef building , but on the condition that the ships be taken `` as-is '' . 
  it ended up subsidising the states in preparing the ships as artificial reefs because this would cost less to the navy than scrapping the ship . 
   ukraine de facto gave up crimea and its military failed to restore order in a part of donbas , there 's no political solution either so , ukraine stays dependant and isolated because nobody wants to mess with russia . 
  just out of curiosity , is your opinion the same on the annexation of poland by the soviet union after the [ warsaw uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising ) failed ? 
  is it the same on how other countries reacted when poland was initially-invaded and partly annexed by nazi germany after the polish military failed to beat off the invaders ? 
   as the eu parliament will take a look at the eu commissions proposal to fine each member state 250k euros for each refugee they refuse ( if the threshold of what is considered ` normal ' inflows is breached ) . 
  i still think that this is a bad way to deal with the issue of allocation . 
  assuming , for a moment , that n people are to be and can be allocated ... the only real reason to put people in , say , latvia is via a sort of sense of fairness or the idea that if eu policies can be avoided by someone looking like they 're rolling around and throwing a tantrum , then the eu will simply devolve into a lot of countries throwing tantrums and gridlock . 
  imposing the same policies on everyone is an approach that * can * work and has a lot of benefits -- nobody feels that they got clobbered more than their neighbor , more-or-less . 
  but it 's also not the only one out there . 
  and it does have some disadvantages -- it 's legitimate for one country to really dislike something more than another . 
  if you pretend that they * all * dislike something equally , your policies are n't fitting the situation well . 
  i still like the idea of auctioning refugee slots for any refugees that must be taken . 
  low bidder for a block of refugee slots gets them , and the eu as a whole is responsible for the bill ( with whatever the normal mechanism for determining financial responsibility in the eu used to extract the money ) . 
  that way , refugees wind up efficiently-placed with whoever objects the least , and if a country wants no more than a certain amount , they raise their bid on additional blocks . 
  edit : i should note that i would assume that collusion between bidders might be an issue with a limited pool of bidders like that -- wind up with the [ economic surplus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_surplus ) going to the bidders rather than the people doing the auctioning . 
  still more economically-efficient than just handing out fixed proportions to everyone . 
   raiding the local office of a tech company is about as productive as when the british police raided the guardian to try and destroy the snowden files . 
  `` they 've seized and labeled the espresso machine ! '', 
   us tax law is crazy . 
  it may well be , but remember that any form of tax is going to be gameable or have undesirable effects . 
  my guess is that business tax benefits in that it 's probably less subject to outright tax fraud ( finding loopholes , maybe , but not outright falsely-claiming data ) . 
  * high income tax ? 
  employers use non-income-based incentives to `` pay '' workers . 
  probably also pressure to operate under the taable . 
  * high inheritance tax ? 
  trusts and a million other routes to transfer money away from someone 's personal possession . 
  * high capital gains tax ? 
  your oh-so-mobile wealthy head overseas to a new location . 
  * high consumption tax ( popular in europe ) ? 
  this hits the relatively-poor hard , and for small businesses , creates a lot of incentive to do under-the-counter deals . 
  * high import/export tariffs ? 
  lose the ability to take advantage of [ competitive advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/competitive_advantage ) . 
  * high business tax ( popular in the us ) ? 
  that probably means that there 's incentive to try and establish overseas business offices , and benefits large companies which can afford to spend a lot of money trying to find holes in the tax code . 
  ah , gotcha -- makes the costs more volatile . 
  i 'd think that a reasonable way of handling that would be via employers purchasing `` employee insurance '' , though : your employee has a kid , the insurer covers the cost of the missing employee . 
  typically , insurance is how one spreads risk around ... 
  reducing living spaces in existing housing would be another option , but ... is it possible that brits might also * want * larger living spaces , given an less-restricted market ? 
  the uk has , by western standards , very low average per-capita living space , and some of that is almost certainly going to be because of a limited stock of housing causing high housing prices . 
  i realize that that probably sounds less-interesting than putting someone who does n't have housing into housing , but having some extra space to work with might also make people happier . 
   that would help reduce the consequences of the poor being pushed out into formerly middle-class suburbs as the better-off return to the inner cities .
