  i mean , i can understand someone saying `` whoah , i 've got a better approach here and everyone but germany wants it , but germany is forcing through * their * approach '' , but i have n't seen that alternate approach yet . 
  you want an alternative route , that 's fine -- but you have to actually have that alternative available . 
  realistically , what percentage of people entering illegally are doing so at the border points ? 
  i mean , that 's not to say that maybe the logging is an effort to deal with people crossing at non-border points , but if someone explicitly does n't want to be fingerprinted in a particular country , it seems like it makes far more sense for them to travel across the border somewhere other than a border point . 
  and while i understand that estonia can cut a clear border ... a three or six meter swathe alone is n't going to stop people who want to cross from crossing or be wide enough to grab people who are . 
  the us [ has a 100,000 square mile desert -- flat , sparse scrub , barren -- that people regularly die in trying to cross when illegally immigrating ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/3/11/death-in-the-desertthedangeroustrekbetweenmexicoandarizona.html ) and that has n't stopped people . 
  the gap , at least alone , seems like orban 's razor wire fence -- i can understand that it 's a symbol and all that , hey , politician is opposed to illegal immigration , but you can just lift the silly thing up and pass under . 
  maybe it 's possible to have a sensor network capable of tracking people running around in the woods , have a restricted area around the border that 's wide enough to let people be picked up in , and just have the border guards run out and pick 'em up , but short of that , i 'm do n't think that these means alone would stop passage . 
  that 's kind of a pat answer -- there are conflicting concerns , after all . 
  * deport everyone discovered illegally in the eu to syria ( even if not claiming to * be * syrian ) , forcibly if need be . 
  * find housing for everyone and grant citizenship . 
  each of these actions would be seen as solutions by one group and as greatly-exacerbating the issue by another group . 
  both of these would require quite a bit of political will . 
  but neither is going to make everyone happy , and at the end of the day , some group of people is going to say that the problem is not solved . 
  finding a solution that winds up with everyone ( or a large proportion of everyone ) saying that the problem is solved is , i think , a hard problem . 
  one option for issues like this is to arrange for a collective agreement not to do something that only takes force if a quorum sign on . 
   i 'm afraid to go there myself . 
  you 're afraid to read a forum ? 
  i mean , nobody 's going to electronically hit you over the head ... 
   considering the role of the unsc is to partially be an ` world police ' eh . 
  i 'd say it 's more to ensure that nothing happens that winds up conflicting with of the major world military powers . 
  avoids the un starting conflicts between those countries and ensures buy-in from those powers . 
   while the biggest parties in it are not part of a lot of important international treaties regarding ` forbidden ' weapons etc. 
  they are n't forbidden [ other than to signatories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:cluster_munitions_convention.svg ) . 
  just as us , chinese , and russian law and treaties do not extend to the netherlands , so netherlands law and treaties do not extend to the us , china , or russia . 
  i would n't support the us signing the treaty unless one of the following is true : ( a ) cluster munitions are obsoleted by something as-effective or we can otherwise be pretty confident that there will be no utility to making use of them in the future . 
  ( b ) the advantages from other parties conforming to the treaties ( e.g. 
  reciprocity or getting some other parties to sign on ) clearly outweighs the disadvantages and will probably continue to do so in the future . 
  at the moment , cluster munitions are militarily-useful . 
  their presence in the world is not particularly disadvantageous to the us ( or , presumably , russia or china ) . 
  that might change in the future , but for the moment , i personally think that it would probably be a bad idea for major air powers to sign the treaty , as it renders their aircraft less-effective against unarmored targets . 
   among those agreements is the ban on cluster bombs , because they pretty much only target civilians and are still deadly decades after the war ends . 
  they are a long term risk to civilians , because of failures . 
  they do not target civilians -- they are n't some sort of booby trap . 
  they are also a much-more-efficient use of explosive power against an unarmored area , because instead of putting far-more-kinetic energy-than-is-necessary-to-produce-a-kill in one area and far-less-kinetic-energy-than-is-necessary-to-produce-a-kill in another area , they spread things out evenly . 
  well , the uk is n't selling them today and even if they were and stopped , the saudis would just buy them from us . 
  yes , good point , thanks . 
  i will still place austria in the `` not a grudge '' category . 
   to better understand the issue , it should be remembered that nato retains in europe of us nuclear weapons from b61 type , the pentagon decided modernization last year . 
  these bombs dropped from planes , are among about 180 spread over six bases in five countries ( germany , belgium , netherlands , italy and turkey ) . 
  placed under guard of the us air force , they could be `` delivered '' by devices belonging to the host nations , after the green light from the united states . 
  this would see the german or belgian tornado f16 dropping american atomic bombs . 
  this is a device that poland seems to want to participate with its air force , even if in a fit of realism , it does not demand that the b61 bombs were previously stored at home . 
  hmm . 
  asking for nuclear sharing does n't seem crazy to me . 
  is poland in some way substantially-more-risky than any of the existing countries with nuclear sharing agreements ? 
  the main argument against it seems to me to be that the initial agreements were made during the cold war with both sides seriously prepared for conflict , and that despite recent rises in tension , things are less-serious now than [ they have been ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_crisis_of_1961 ) at [ various points in time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_blockade ) in the past . 
   but the polish government now goes beyond the issue of us b61 bombs when he talks about `` cooperation of technical possibilities '' with `` three nuclear powers '' of the atlantic alliance . 
  france is , in this respect , directly concerned . 
  indeed , since 1998 , the british have no airborne component of its deterrent and it is unclear how the polish navy could `` cooperate '' in the implementation of nuclear submarine launchers machinery in us trident ii missiles . 
  besides the united states , remains france . 
  well , a couple thoughts . 
  * if the eu federalizes , poland will wind up being a member of a country -- the european union -- which will almost certainly ( barring corbyn-alikes coming to power in the uk and france ) have its own nuclear arsenal . 
  if france is committed to that possibility , this is simply accelerating that process . 
  * france may trust poland , but poland having nuclear weapons decreases what france brings to the table in the eu ( greatly so in the event of a brexit ) . 
  * if poland wants an independent nuclear program , that 's probably an non-proliferation treaty violation , and [ most countries have signed on ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_parties_to_the_treaty_on_the_non-proliferation_of_nuclear_weapons ) . 
  the us is definitely pushing the limits of the npt with the existing nuclear sharing programs , and it 's not-incredibly-surprising that russia complains about it . 
  to be entirely-honest , i suspect that the us would complain at least as bitterly if russia started doing something similar with , say , north korea or cuba . 
  * more countries with their own program is disadvantageous to other countries ( including non-nuclear powers ) . 
  that 's not necessarily in the form of poland herself posing a threat , but the possibility of further spread , as happened with pakistan assisting north korea in arming itself . 
  additionally , each country that has nuclear weapons further increases pressure on non-nuclear countries that might potentially be in a conflict with them to get nuclear weapons -- this creates something of a positive feedback loop . 
  i 'd guess that poland has one of several possible concerns : * ** concerns over long-term viability of nato and/or the eu ** : members are permitted to withdraw from both nato and the eu . 
  it is theoretically possible for the uk and france to withdraw from the eu ( and in fact , the uk is quite close to doing so at the moment ) and for the us , the uk , and france to withdraw from nato ( trump is off complaining about the us having to spend on defense spending overseas ) . 
  i do n't think that that 's a near-term threat , but certainly i 'd consider it a real concern over the long term . 
  * ** concerns about eu and/or nato willingness to act ** . 
  here , everyone remains in the eu and/or nato , but simply does n't * do * anything . 
  given that poland wound up pretty screwed over last time around when treaty obligations that were more-explicit were n't carried out , and given that there * have * been certain cases where countries have made somewhat-dubious promises of military involvement ( e.g. 
  france and the uk to finland in the winter war ) , i would imagine that this is a real concern for poland . 
  poland having militarily-significant nuclear weapons * based * in poland might act as a greater deterrent to giving up poland , and an independent nuclear weapons program and arsenal would act as a plan b in case of refusal to act . 
  it 's been talked about , but i do n't know how seriously this is taken as a concern by poland 's leadership and military . 
  what guarantees could be taken to ensure that eu and/or nato would act beyond simply the reputation of the two ? 
  * ** concerns about polish membership in the eu and/or nato ** . 
  poland * herself * may want to ensure that she 's an option to exit the eu and/or nato and still have defense arrangements involving nuclear weapons . 
  here , poland 's interests would probably be at odds with france/uk/us -- poland would want to be breaking ties and wants to first set up a nuclear program before doing so . 
  * ** concerns about existing major military powers in defense arrangements using defense access as a lever against poland ** . 
  trump is a good example : poland does not want to put up with someone randomly trying to get her to foot an unexpected bill at any time . 
  [ this uk-poland deal ] ( https://euobserver.com/justice/131697 ) in the news recently made me deeply cringe -- while maybe the leadership of each country wanted to show that they could accomplish something that their voters were unhappy about , horse-trading at all on security seems risky , since it 's implying that nato membership alone does n't imply a sufficiently credible security guarantee ( either to a country , her public , or to the possible enemies of that country ) . 
  if that 's the case , it seems to me that nato is doing a bad job , since it has every reason to want those guarantees to be credible . 
  those kinds of deals seem to me to be corrosive , at the very least , to public perception . 
  * ** concerns about credibility of eu and/or nato guarantees to potential opponents ** . 
  at the end of the day , it 's not primarily whether-or-not eu and/or nato nuclear weapons would actually be used that would be necessary for poland to win , since in the event of a nuclear war , people are all probably going to be worse off . 
  it 's whether russia believes they are . 
  i personally would find a polish arsenal a more-credible deterrent in some ways than merely an eu-and-nato arsenal ; the question is whether the gap between these is significant-enough to worry about . 
  i could see nuclear sharing happening , though it would most-assuredly irritate the hell out of russia and i 'm not sure that it would happen without the security situation in europe being significantly-worse than it is . 
  i have a much-harder time with the idea of of france , the uk , or the us signing on to an independent arsenal -- there seem to be substantial downsides and few upsides to the other nuclear and non-nuclear members of nato and the eu . 
  i think i 'd use a more-neutral color choice than red in the graph -- it 's not as if it 's a symbolic color for the parties involved . 
  hmm . 
  * is * there a relative disillusion with the democratic process relative to some point earlier in history ? 
   nobody holds a grudge like the us . 
  that sounds tough and all that , and i 've got nothing against indulging in a bit of bravado -- hey , it 's fun -- but frankly , as countries go , the us really has n't maintained consistent enemies at all . 
  * in 1776 and 1812 we fought the uk . 
  we 've been involved in most of the other 's conflicts ( on the same side ) for a long time , and they 're pretty closely-associated with the us . 
  * in 1812 , we fought canada . 
  they 're probably the single country closest to the us today . 
  * in 1846 , we fought mexico . 
  while we may be building a `` huge wall '' , relations definitely are n't hostile and they 're a major trade partner . 
  * in 1898 , we fought spain [ though i 'll grant that this was rather opportunistic on our part -- it 'd be pretty hard to hold a grudge for losing that ] . 
  spain 's in nato today . 
  * in 1899 , we fought a war against filipino revolutionaries . 
  the phillippines and the us have pretty good relations today .
