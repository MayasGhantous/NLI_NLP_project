  * in 1917 , we fought a big chunk of central and eastern europe ( germany , austria , hungary , turkey , bulgaria ) . 
  they 're in nato . 
  * in 1941 , we fought italy , germany , and japan , all of whom are similarly on good terms today ( in germany 's case in particular , there was a rapid shift towards making common cause against the ussr ) . 
  * we went into vietnam , and today , the us is more popular in vietnam than just about anywhere else in the world ( to be fair , so is russia -- probably because both are military powers that are n't china that can stop vietnam from being knocked around ) . 
  really , the only clashes that i can think of that exist after a long time are : * north korea , since the korean war in the 1950s . 
  * cuba : the us leased guantanamo bay as a naval base as a treaty signed under duress at the end of the spanish-american war , so if you use that as your starting point , a bit over a century of opposition . 
  if not , probably from castro in 1958 . 
  * iran : since the us and the uk [ overthrew the iranian government in 1953 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d'\u00e9tat ) . 
  * ... and apparently now russia again for cold war ii . 
  if you ignore the warmed period for the twenty-five years after the iron curtain went away and consider the us intervention on behalf of the white russian forces and against the reds the beginning of hostility there and ignore world war ii -- all fairly-generous assumptions -- about a hundred years . 
  turkey and greece have maintained a grudge that dates to what , the early 1800s ? 
  if you count the periodic wars and uprisings between the two , you could probably take it all the way back to the bronze age . 
  * that * is a grudge . 
  if getting into a conflict with the us is unusually disadvantageous , i 'd say that it 's because of the us 's significant resources , alliances , and and ability to wage war , not because of concern over a long-term grudge . 
  note that the us is n't unique here : the map of europe is hardly a map of fixed enmities either . 
  germany and france and the uk are on awfully good terms compared to the number of times that one or the other has been trying to beat up on the other through history . 
  also , frankly ... the guy 's comment is probably not unusual . 
  if we 'd had the internet a hundred years ago , i bet that you 'd have seen similar statements for plenty of other conflicts around the world , through history . 
  i doubt very much that any government in the world could be fairly-termed `` anti-science '' . 
  at that point in time ( 1901 ) , the democratic party was the more-conservative one , and would remain so [ until political strategies shifted over the civil rights act of 1964 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_strategy ) ; that 's a relatively-recent change . 
  actually , i find environmentalists to be one of the most conservative political groups , at least in the traditional sense of `` the status quo must be maintained '' . 
  there 's a tendency to see any change in the environment -- warming , cooling , introducing species , logging , etc -- as a negative . 
  at times , it 's a bit amusing to see the status quo change and then demands be made to retain the new status quo : in california , an engineering error resulted in [ creating an inland sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salton_sea ) ; there are now calls from environmental advocacy groups to do major works to retain the sea in its present form rather than let it slowly dry up . 
   you are also dead right that there 's just simply no similarity to the post ww1 era and today , the economic conditions for germans alone were unthinkable by today 's standards . 
  [ 29.9 % unemployment ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/de-drittes-reich-economy.htm ), 
  i 'm sure that i 'm happy with the idea of a gradient : that corruption , harassing political opposition , wars , and genocides are all related . 
   we did n't have many ... welfare laws before ww2 i dunno ... even for the us , the great depression produced the creation of some welfare laws , and i 'm pretty sure that at least parts of europe goes back further . 
  it looks like the [ uk started providing an early form of state-funded pensions in 1908 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old-age_pensions_act_1908 ) . 
  france apparently started in 1956 , [ after world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_security_in_france ) . 
  can a recount be requested ? 
  if it 's really close in the us , a candidate would probably request a vote recount . 
  if austria does the same , the `` final final '' results would n't be in even tomorrow in austria if that were the case . 
   in what 's probably the strangest instance of a single vote making all the difference , a 2013 state legislature election in the austrian state of carinthia was decided by a ballot that featured a drawing of a penis . 
  each ballot had one column for ranking your choices , and the other column was for your vote . 
  the voter made two markings : a drawing of a penis in the ranking column , and a check mark was in the choices column . 
  it was decided that the ranking took precedence , and that penis-checked ballot ended up giving a legislative seat to the green party , and preventing a tie with the alliance for the future of austria party . 
  if that one involved judgment , i 'm assuming that there is a recount mechanism where people look at ballots again in at least some levels of austria . 
  i was responding to `` i would have said monaco because i do n't see any good counterpart to lv in europe '' . 
  good grief . 
  i tried reading through [ wikipedia 's list of royal navy ship names ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ship_names_of_the_royal_navy ) . 
  even with duplicates , that 's insanely-long . 
  the metaphor does n't really hold up -- a heart surgeon 's job would be to tell other people about the location of the aortic valve . 
  a hospital administrator does n't need to know that and can be briefed on it . 
  heck , i would guess that a substantial part of important us strategic military information ( x could beat y , etc ) is n't public knowledge anyway . 
  edit : or if you 're still not happy with that , consider [ this list of us presidential occupations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_presidents_of_the_united_states_by_occupation ) . 
  fdr and nixon were lawyers -- some relevance to the presidency , no doubt , but hardly familiarity on par with the bureaucracy and probably little special knowledge of , say , fighting wars or energy policy . 
  jfk was a writer and a sailor . 
  andrew johnson was a soldier and a tailor . 
  carter was a sailor , peanut farmer , and a writer . 
  reagan was an actor and a union leader . 
  none of these people walk into the office with all the knowledge of the us bureaucracy , nor are they expected to . 
  even if we elected the brightest , most-knowledgeable person in the us for president , he could not compete with all of the specialists involved . 
  that 's * why * we , as in all modern countries , have a system where information is extracted from specialists and then processed and handed up . 
   it 's always going to be those opposed strongly to the government if economic pressure becomes sufficient , people will . 
  the criteria you gave was `` escaping a collapsing economy '' . 
   having experienced firsthand what the consequences are i think that the collapse will be a pretty good argument against a perfect repeat , but it 's not hard for someone to claim that they 've got the right answer * this * time with some modifications . 
  if you look at , say , / r/socialism , they need to provide some sort of rationale for why things did n't work last time around and why this time they could work . 
  that 's an extreme example , but certainly i think that that mechanism is there . 
  the reason that it 's not a huge concern for the us is that the numbers , even with illegal immigration , simply are n't * that * large ( and that illegal immigration does n't grant political power directly ) . 
  but suppose that there were , say , 640m people , twice the us 's existing population , who were to immigrate to the us from your not-doing-too-well region of choice and that they were to receive citizenship in the first generation . 
  i 'd be plenty concerned about the us being radically-politically-reshaped by that . 
  edit : and just to be clear :  ` ethnically ' judging from your use of the quotes , i suspect that you 're misreading me -- i 'm not using the term as a euphemism for race , but for people with a given culture and set of ideas . 
  there are different political ideas in , say , france than in the us -- i would think that if 600m hypothetical frenchmen stormed into the us , we 'd be very likely to be seeing a lot more union conflict than we do today , for example . 
  and france is n't that different from the us in most ways -- there 's a larger division between the us and the developing world . 
   do you think the many cubans fleeing castro have made the us more prone to communism and authoritarianism ? 
  without looking at the numbers , i doubt the former -- many people , especially early-on , fled because they were political opponents of the regime , and i suspect that if anything there 's likely an anti-communist leaning . 
  but it was also hard to flee : castro did n't want to let people out , and the us did n't want to let people in , and the trip generally had to be made via water . 
  i do think that political preferences present in one country certainly transmit over to the new one , yes : there are clear statistical ethnic preferences in voting . 
  it 's not as if people simply discard their personality and world views at the border . 
  were the full population of venezuela to be shifted to the us , i certainly expect that there would be increased political pressure for the us to operate like venezuela . 
  your point about a filter bias from willingness to immigrate is probably real , but i also think that the idea of dropping political ideas simply because of immigration is unrealistic . 
   do you really think a unilateral decision to preemptively invade a country wouldve happened if gore had been president ? 
  could very well be not , but i do n't think that it was due to lack of ability to answer trivia questions -- it 's not a great metric . 
   he 's incredibly clueless , unbelievably vain , narcissistic , and thin skinned . 
  < shrug  you must know him well , then . 
  i do n't think that i could make much of a prediction about the specifics of what any past president would have done beyond their concrete policy promises ( [ and sometimes not even then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/read_my_lips:_no_new_taxes ) ) . 
  they 're in the business of establishing an image , mind . 
   the death of ideologies is exactly the reason of the current crisis of democracy all over the western world ? 
  specifically : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literacy_test, 
  someone needs to put a web frontend on r and make stuff like this more-broadly-accessible . 
  by that standard , austria should have only one remotely-appealing candidate and have total disasters for all other candidates so that almost everyone is happy . 
   another example is that many people think that human rights are more than just a bunch of very vague rules some guys agreed upon a fairly long time ago . 
  they think of it as some holy dogma . 
  well , on the flip side , it 's been somewhat time-tested -- it was n't * just * whatever someone arbitrarily-said at one point in time . 
  that being said , it 's [ also true that there are clear differences from country to country on what meets the bar of importance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights#right_to_keep_and_bear_arms ) and what does n't . 
  i 'm not sure that that 's the best metric for judging who would be an effective president . 
  i 'm not sure that * i * have a good metric either , but honestly , the president has the largest collection of foreign affairs and intelligence people in the world advising him running most things . 
  the us 's foreign policy does n't rely on the personal expertise of any one person : no us president would be remotely-competent to single-handedly handle all us foreign policy today , no matter how-well-versed . 
  [ hell , a us president can put a race in concentration camps via executive order . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executive_order_9066 ) i think the more-relevant fact is n't bounds on influence ( because arguments that trump as president would n't have influence seem pretty dubious to me ) and more that i suspect that a lot of trump is campaign rhetoric . 
   such as trump saying he 'll move to the middle as he goes forward , implying that his extreme statements are just a strategy . 
  all realistic candidates do this to some degree , due to the us primary system . 
  first they have to sell themselves to voters affiliated with their party ( which is only part of the us electorate and has interests that obviously differ from average joe ) , and then they have to sell themselves in the general election to average joe . 
  obviously , that favors shifting to have a more-centrist image in the general elections . 
  i 'm not familiar with * the economist * 's gfs , but it 's worth noting that * the economist * does have their own political ideals and goals -- generally-speaking , it likes things that are good for the uk and favor liberalism ( in the international sense ) and international involvement . 
  trump is kind of the opposite of that . 
   the ones that are able to enter the usa ( and it 's arduous immigration policies ) are going to be some of the most grateful and adaptable immigrant populations . 
  that only applies to legal immigration , and that 's really not where the bulk of migration from south of the border is from , though . 
  the quotas available are nowhere remotely near high enough for everyone in venezuela to legally go to the us , which is what / u/luigivargasllosa is proposing : people who want to get out of venezuela because the country 's economy is in a terrible state . 
  in venezuela 's case , the leadership that put the economy there was also pretty anti-us , so there 's * some * degree of similarity .
