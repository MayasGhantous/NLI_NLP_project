  whether-or-not venezuelan immigration is a good idea , i think that it 's reasonably safe to say that the sample of venezuelans you 've interacted with probably is not a representative sample . 
  the question / u/debaser14 is asking is this : if there is correlation between the population of a country and its government ( and that seems at least * plausible * ) , then why would the `` collapsing economy and an increasingly authoritarian government '' not show up as well ? 
  i think that there are probably some reasonable responses , but i do n't think that your comment is what he 's looking for . 
  more-likely to stay in , but i do n't at all think that it 's as clear as that . 
  one major incident in the near future could reasonably tip the scales . 
   because they keep scaremongering the voters in to thinking 30.000.000 romanians are going to apply for benefits in the uk can just establish phased introduction with caps , if that 's the real concern . 
   what if the french mobilize support for a french-canadian secession that sort of thing does n't usually go over very well in the targeted country . 
  yeah , though technically that is incidental : neither country is bound to accept the other 's sovereign . 
   that said , disparities between germany and the rest of europe are increasing , which is completely against the idea of european economic convergence . 
  < thinks  does this count citizens of one eu member working in other countries for the host country or the home country ? 
  that seems like it might make a large difference . 
  first , i bet that this was an issue in the past , too . 
  second , i suspect that some of the problem with a lack of unified political terms is really that there 's an insistence on terms that are loaded . 
  few people are going to identify themselves as `` far right '' or `` far left '' . 
  they 're going to say that they 're maybe `` right '' or `` left '' , and i bet that in their normal speech , they would n't really bother classifying themselves and just think of people they disagree with as being `` right '' or `` left '' . 
  much of politics , is , after all , framing the image of a party or politicians , and word choice matters there . 
  the pro-life/pro-choice terminology compromise is admittedly awkward in that it consists of two slogans , but it 's at least descriptive . 
  it has the property that each group can feel that the universal term is not out-of-line with the term that they 'd use to describe themselves , so they 're willing to accept being called this and in turn using another party 's favored term . 
  i think that this property might be necessary to get a universal set of terms . 
  might be interesting to see how each of the parties describes itself .

  hmm . 
  i am very open to the idea that there 's nuance that i 'm not picking up , but what i 'm getting at is that if i understand correctly , they 're talking about the government of the occupational authority , the local government that was put in place . 
  it 's supported and exists only because of russia , but that alone does n't mean that everyone that works for it is a member of russia 's armed forces . 
  vichy france was occupied by nazi germany , would not exist or remain without nazi germany being involved , and certainly it was a puppet of nazi germany , but not all people working for vichy france were german soldiers , either . 
  note that while i 'm not saying that the killers are not russian soldiers ( and perhaps this is implied by the text in some way or perhaps the spoken bit of the video says that they are ) , the article text does not seem to explicitly say this .

   relative poverty is a pretty stupid measure , frankly . 
  i do n't have a problem with the idea of measuring something like it , but the term used should be something like `` inequality from median '' , not `` poverty '' , which is quite misleading for the public .

  that generated discussion . 
   not knowing if you can afford rent you can adjust for buying power via ppp or within a country use a cost-of-living adjustment . 
  that 's different from using relative poverty instead of absolute poverty . 
  hmm . 
  could you expand on this ? 
  i do n't understand how an individual would have public debt ... when i hear `` public debt '' , i think of debt that the state has to some party , rather than debt that an individual has to some party . 
  is [ this what you 're talking about ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/controlling-russians-through-travel-bans/500914.html ) :  at the same time , the federal bailiff service imposed a travel ban on citizens who owe money to the government and those who have been taken to court for outstanding debt . 
  as a result , anyone who has not paid back taxes , bank loans , alimony , fines and so on can not leave the country . 
  if that 's the case , i assume that you are talking about debt owed to the state ( though it looks like it 's broader than that , if court rulings are included ) . 
  well , the definition here was listed in the article :  relative poverty , defined as household income below 60 percent of the national median income i 'd also note that this is * household * income . 
  if you have a man and a woman living together , even if everyone in your society makes exactly the same amount of money , they double household income . 
  by that standard , if 10 % of the people in your society are single and live alone instead of two-to-a-household , they suffer from relative poverty . 
  why would relative poverty be particularly-interesting to worse health or quality of life ? 
  if every other citizen of luxembourg suddenly had 100 times the buying power they did before , but joe smith only has 30 times , he may be relatively-poor , but in terms of concrete * things * , he seems to be doing pretty well . 
  north korea probably has very little relative poverty , and i think that most people would agree that absolute standard of living is rather-more important . 
  an immigrant moving to somewhere with more opportunities may very likely decrease their relative wealth in society when they migrate , but increase their absolute wealth ... hardly something that people seem unhappy about doing . 
  honestly , the only reason i can think of that there 's much focus on relative poverty is because it it 's always an available source of things to complain about for advocates -- there 's almost assuredly always going to be some degree of relative poverty . 
  i fail to understand what `` admitting '' entails .
