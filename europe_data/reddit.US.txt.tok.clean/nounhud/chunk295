  i would n't call iq `` intelligence '' , though i also would n't agree with people who simply dismiss it without providing a comparable-but-better alternative . 
  that 's not correct -- at that point in time , you could . 
  the restrictions you 're talking about did n't show up until later , [ starting in 1882 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_exclusion_act ) with the chinese . 
  hmm . 
  there have been stricter times , but certainly now is not the strictest in the us 's history . 
  before the 1870s , [ there was n't much by way of restrictions ] ( http://immigration.procon.org/view.timeline.php?timelineid=000023#1850-1899 ) -- you could just show up . 
  here 's the [ available ways someone can get us citizenship today ] ( http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/how-united-states-immigration-system-works-fact-sheet ) : * family reunification : this is your best bet as the numbers go , since up towards half-a-million per year get on via this . 
  * 40k/year : `` persons of extraordinary ability '' in the arts , science , education , business , or athletics ; outstanding professors and researchers , some multinational executives . 
  * 40k/year : members of the professions holding advanced degrees , or persons of exceptional abilities in the arts , science , or business . 
  * 40k/year : skilled workers with at least two years of training or experience , professionals with college degrees , or `` other '' workers for unskilled labor that is not temporary or seasonal . 
  * 10k/year : certain `` special immigrants '' including religious workers , employees of u.s. foreign service posts , former u.s. government employees and other classes of aliens . 
  * 10k/year : persons who will invest $ 500,000 to $ 1 million in a job-creating enterprise that employs at least 10 full time u.s. workers . 
  * 70k/year refugees , with restrictions internal to that based on geographic area of origin . 
  * 55k/year : green card lottery . 
  requires high school education and at least two years of experience in a skilled field . 
  now , granted , there 's also substantial illegal immigration , and if someone has a kid on us soil , the child is automatically a us citizen , but i assume that that 's not what you 're referring to . 
   did you even bothered to read the article ? 
  nothing there is in conflict with my comment ... 
   where does he live [ apparently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_tusk#personal_life ) in [ sopot , poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sopot ) . 
   how about all those years when crimea was ukraine ` s ? 
  if you 're asserting a legal transfer , only 17 countries in the world have recognized a russian annexation or opposed the un 's asserting ukraine 's territorial integrity : the overwhelming majority have not . 
  huh , i did n't know that they were finnish . 
   well why then in america there is a clear difference in that east asians score highest , then whites and then african americans in iq tests ? 
  asians are also `` immigrants '' who came from worse background to u.s.a than whites . 
  this does n't deal with iq between countries , but specifically for the us and on immigration ... one factor that i suspect is significant : due to restrictions put in place between ~ 1870 and ~ world war i and present until ~ world war ii , when the us started moving towards a heavily skill-based immigration system , comparatively-few people from east asia immigrated relative to people from africa ( mostly brought in via slavery ) or europe ( heavily came in without filters at all ) or up from mexico or central america ( effectively came in without filters ) this means that east asians in the us have disproportionately immigrated via being very well-to-do and able to start a business or meeting one of the high-skill areas ; this is something of a selection bias , as we wound up with a very successful group of folks from east asia . 
  probably would apply even more to india , which historically saw even less immigration before the skill-based era . 
  yeah , but testing skill in an area is n't equivalent to using level of education . 
  depends on whether you mean `` war '' in the strict sense -- the us has n't technically declared war since world war ii . 
  [ panama got a mcdonalds in 1971 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_with_mcdonald's_restaurants ) [ we invaded in 1989 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_invasion_of_panama ) . 
  i thought that the [ flynn effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flynn_effect ) was exhibited globally . 
  why would it be more present in western europe than eastern europe ? 
  edit : [ and the wikipedia article says that it may even have ended in some developed countries , like the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flynn_effect#possible_end_of_progression ) . 
  i 'm not sure that this is much of a win . 
  i think that you 'd get more good out of actually testing people on skill-based things ( i.e. 
  what can you do * now * ) than trying to evaluate iq ( what can we predict you might be able to do ten years down the road ? ), 
   in spoken contexts they are distinguished by context and by the tone , but when written , the only way to distinguish them is that they use different characters . 
  sure , but you can express tonality in a written system . 
   tbh i do n't think the system is a big disadvantage for the chinese people themselves - they manage to learn it as children yeah , but to what degree ? 
  if i hear someone say a word , or if i read a word , i can leverage that knowledge in the other format : if i can speak about something , i can also read about it and visa versa . 
  and while i 'm no expert on chinese or literacy in chinese , it sounds like [ there are other issues ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/12/news/12iht-rchina.t.html ) :  another difficulty is the rather subjective notion of what counts as `` literate '' in china 's character-based writing system . 
  measurement is more straightforward in an alphabet-based system , where readers need only master a limited set of letters , and a limited set of rules governing how they go together . 
  chinese readers , by contrast , must learn thousands of characters . 
  literacy at the most basic level requires knowledge of about 500 characters , while a typical college graduate knows about 4,000 characters . 
  learning these requires schoolchildren to spend hours each day copying and memorizing new characters . 
    the characters are also easier than alphabetic script to forget if reading and writing are not practiced continually . 
  mr. wang estimates that 10 percent of those who learn to read as adults end up relapsing into illiteracy within one year . 
  the main benefit that i 'm aware of in the written/spoken split in chinese is that written systems tend to change more-slowly than spoken ones . 
  a friend commented once that he could read 2500-year-old chinese writings ; i would have difficulty with 600-year-old english . 
  but , still , i do n't think i 'd take the tradeoff . 
   stuff like rape and murder are universally seen as `` bad '' in every culture on the planet . 
  all or nearly all of the cases were sexual assault or some german equivalent , not rape or murder . 
   these men know exactly what is and is n't allowed i do n't know ... maybe formally , yes , but people do all kinds of things that break the law and rely on knowledge of how likely something is to be enforced . 
  people break the speed limit on the highway , use recreational drugs , and do all kinds of things that are legally-prohibited -- because in practice , there 's a degree of being able to get away with something . 
  now , i agree that people were certainly trying to bend rules ... but that does n't mean that everyone has a practical idea of where they can get away with bending the rules when walking into a society , either . 
  that does n't necessarily mean that a manual makes sense , either , but i 'm not sure that i 'd say that people * do * have a fantastic idea for sexual norms in a society immediately upon walking in . 
  hell , it 's tough enough when growing up as a kid * in * that society to figure things out . 
   no-one listens to chinese music , watches their films etc. 
  and this wo n't change because the bottom line is their modern cultural output just plain sucks , for the most part . 
  that may change . 
  i suspect that the same could have been said of japan in the 1970s , and now anime and manga are pretty well-known and they 've been a significant source of video games for some time . 
   it 's a retardedly difficult language to learn because of the writing system . 
  i do n't know mandarin myself , but i strongly agree here on the `` split writing and spoken language is just too much overhead '' issue . 
  * maybe * people could make a written form of mandarin , but i think that the separate systems are actually a serious disadvantage for china . 
   it 's too late . 
  nothing can stop english now . 
  i agree on the idea that english is only pulling forward , but i would n't go quite as far as `` nothing '' . 
  i would wager that a nuclear world war iii involving russia , europe , and the us would put mandarin in a pretty strong position . 
   possibly millions of speakers of various skill well , wikipedia says two million . 
  that seems a bit optimistic to me , but , hey , let 's go with it . 
  it 's still just 2 % the number that do english or mandarin and 4 % the number that do hindustani or spanish or arabic . 
  if the major selling point is political correctness , it seems like a high price to pay . 
  if the goal is a language that came from an eu member , i 'd think spanish would make the most sense . 
  i do n't . 
  at one point , i was enthusiastic about esperanto , but ... * the appeal is partly in being simple and logical . 
  i listened to a lecture series on linguistics that pointed out that languages tend to become more complex if people use them for anything complex . 
  you could use a sort of [ pidgin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pidgin ) for many things and it would be simpler to learn . 
  that was sufficient for people who just needed to engage in limited trade . 
  but make it a day-to-day language and people start bringing euphemisms and slang and attaching connotations to things , and it all becomes much-more-complicated . 
  * i 'm suspicious that people already tend to optimize language pretty well , better than a synthetic language . 
  after all , you can always go come up with new terms , drop tenses , etc if they 're a problem . 
  * there 's a significant ( if one-off ) cost to trying to teach the world a new language , even if the world chose to accept it . 
  i think that it would be easier to do incremental reforms to english ( or another widely-spoken language , though i 'm not sure if anything other than maybe spanish or a standardized mandarin would fit ) . 
  * synthetic languages simply have n't been very successful in the past , and i 'm suspicious that making a good one is harder than it seems . 
   the only place i ever hear that is on this sub . 
  i also hear it on polandball , so i guess two subs . 
  going for all countries , not just turkey : i am not at all convinced that the presence of twitter has improved the quality of discourse between countries . 
  it seems like an excellent tool for broadcasting low-content , knee-jerk reactions to very large numbers of people . 
  sure , it may have had an impact at the time , but this seems the critical bit :  since then , there has hardly been any change to the borders of the arab countries , except for the 1990 unification of the northern and southern yemeni parts . 
  the british and the french are n't preventing various governments from collectively-deciding to join states or to divide differently -- it seems to me that the countries in question have not wanted to do so . 
   `` napoleon , hitler , various people tried this out , and it ends tragically . 
  the eu is an attempt to do this by different methods , '' johnson said . 
  what if it turned out that the means and specific implementation that they chose -- attempting to establish an empire , with themselves in a dominant position -- was the problematic element , rather than simply the fact that a particular geographic region was unified ? 
   information released by russian human rights group agora claims that the russian supreme court received some 4,659,325 applications to monitor and record telephone communications between 2007 and 2015 . 
  the court approved almost 97 percent of these , or 4,517,515 . 
    assuming that each wiretap target was in conversation with at least one other person , activists calculate that six percent of the russian population , or 8.5 million people , have been monitored by the state at some time . 
    `` if we assume that each of the wiretaps lasted for roughly a month , that means that over the course of nine years at least six percent of the population have had their communications monitored at some point , '' said report co-author pavel chikov . 
  coming to this conclusion seems to miss the possibility that multiple wiretap requests might be issued for one person . 
  the uk is n't doing phenomenally-well either , though ... 
  fwiw , one of the co-authors is matthias doepke .
