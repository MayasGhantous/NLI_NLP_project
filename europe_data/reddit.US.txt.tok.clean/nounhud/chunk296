  * in * the toilet , not * using * the toilet ?

  now you 've got me curious .

  * [ washroom ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/washroom ) is a us and canadian english euphemism for the room with the toilet , according to wiktionary , but if so it 's extremely rare -- i do n't think i 've ever heard this spoken in the us . 
  * [ john ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/john ) : wiktionary lists this as current us english , but i 'd say that it 's really getting kind of out-of-date . 
  * [ privy ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/privy ) : wiktionary lists this as being current and having a meaning not restricted to outhouses , but i have a hard time imagining someone using this word to refer to an indoor bathroom today .

  i 'd call it out-of-date . 
  * [ crapper/shitter ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crapper ) : vulgar term . 
  * [ comfort station ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comfort_station ) : wiktionary says that this is a real term and specific to us english , but i 've never heard it used . 
  * [ little boys ' room/little girls ' room ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/little_boys_room ) specific to british english : * [ water closet ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/water_closet ) ( i suspect that this was also in us english long ago , as i saw the term used in [ * little house on the prairie * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/little_house_on_the_prairie ) ) , * [ loo ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loo ) * [ toilet ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/toilet ) . 
  wiktionary does n't limmit this to british english , but using it to refer to the room as a whole is something that i have not heard in the us -- you would n't say `` she 's in the toilet '' , just `` i need to use your toilet '' , to refer to the actual item . 
  * [ cloakroom ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cloakroom ) * [ convenience ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/convenience ) : i guess this is comparable to where i 'd use `` restroom '' , though i 've never seen this , even in written material , and i 'm suspicious that it is outdated .

  sampling permits for error -- it just relies on it being unlikely . 
  you 're making a common ( and easy-to-make ) error -- tying the sample size to the population size . 
  sampling ( well , sampling of the sort that we 're talking about in polls like this -- my terminology may be off a bit ) does n't work with the intent of choosing such a large chunk of the population that it is * impossible * for there to be error ( e.g. 
  i poll 99,999,999 people of a 100m person population , and it 's impossible for me to have more than one off piece of data ) . 
  sampling works on the principle that if you take a random subset of a population , then it it is unlikely that you wind up with a sample that is wildly unrepresentative of the population as a whole . 
  as your sample size grows , it becomes ever-more-unlikely . 
  but the sample is normally * not * a substantial portion of the population , and studies like this do n't rely on them being same . 
  so , let 's say i have 7 billion people on earth . 
  i choose someone randomly and check their eye color . 
  it 's blue . 
  [ about 8 % of the people in the world have blue eyes ] ( http://www.aclens.com/most-common-eye-color-c323.html ) , so that 's unlikely -- about a 1/12 chance . 
  if i stopped here , with a sample size of 1 , i 'd guess that everyone on earth has blue eyes . 
  that 'd be wrong . 
  now , let 's say that i pick another person randomly . 
  they have blue eyes too . 
  that 's even less likely -- about a 1 / ( 12 x 12 ) chance , or 1/144 chance . 
  let 's say i do this a total of ten times , and every time , i wind up with someone with blue eyes . 
  it * is * possible for this to happen , but it would be very unlikely -- about a 1/61 ,917,364,224 chance . 
  my sample is still not an appreciable portion of the actual population , but now my result would be * extremely * unlikely if only 8 % of the people in the world have blue eyes . 
  it 's common for large studies to have 1,000 people . 
  if i did this 1000 times and got blue eyes every time , the chance of this happening in a world where only 8 % of the people have blue eyes is 1/237 ,376,313,799,769,806,328,950,291,431,424 . 
  that 's really , really unlikely . 
  so someone can come out and say `` my study found that 100 % of people on earth have blue eyes '' . 
  their study will always have a chance of being wrong , and one possibility is that their study is wrong and only 8 % of people have blue eyes . 
  but it 's vanishingly unlikely . 
  that 's what studies with sample sets rely upon -- the fact that they are * unlikely * to be terribly wrong in their results , not that it is impossible . 
  you 'll notice an interesting point -- in computing the chance of this happening , i used a simplified formula that is a pretty close approximation of the actual chance . 
  the population size was n't a factor in my above equation -- the above numbers never had the population size come in . 
  in practice , if someone is sampling without replacement , the size of the population when the population is large has a tiny , tiny effect , but it 's not very important . 
  but that is n't even necessary -- you could sample * with * replacement , just taking a new person to examine each time , and forgetting about their name , and replacing them back into the pool of people that you 're picking from . 
  you could even choose the exact same person all 1,000 times -- it would be vanishingly unlikely that that would happen , but it 's a possibility . 
  but that does n't break sampling methodology -- it continues to work in this case . 
  that shows why you do n't need to increase your sample size as your population increases -- you still get just about same kind of confidence in your result whether there is 7 billion people on earth or 70 billion people on earth . 
  now , i * did * admit that there 's a chance of error . 
  if i could look only at my my result , it 's most-likely that everyone or almost everyone on earth has blue eyes . 
  maybe only 8 % do . 
  maybe -- and this is more-probable than 8 % , given my result -- 99 % have blue eyes . 
  when you put out a study like this , you give a [ margin of error ] ( https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat100/node/16 ) . 
  for 1000 people , the 95 % margin of error is 3 % . 
  you can say : `` if i really , honestly , randomly chose 1000 people and got all blue eyes , and if i ran my test an infinite number of times , i 'd expect to be within 3 % of the correct number 95 % of the time . '', 
  so you 're right in your idea that the poll 's numbers might be off !, 
  but you 're not correct in assuming that the population size ( assuming it 's larger than a certain amount ) plays a very important role in how far off they are . 
  for practical purposes , most studies on large numbers of people simply do n't care how many people there actually are in the population , and that 's all right -- they can still give useful results that are unlikely to be wrong . 
  and that way , they do n't have to undergo the incredible cost of polling a substantial chunk of people on the planet -- they can take a relatively-tiny sample and still get results that are very probably very close to the real numbers . 
  why ?
