  it 's not * common * , and so there would be more risks ( in that it 's less-risky to do something that is known to work ) , but i do n't see how you could say that it * ca n't * work . 
  hell , the eu itself is already extremely unusual as an organization in many ways -- it is a willing set of members who chose to create and stay in the organization : nobody created the thing by conquering anything . 
  it has disparate and overlapping sets and relationships with eu and non-eu countries that are very abnormal as the world goes . 
  switzerland and norway are n't in the eu , but have a strong relationship with it . 
  there 's freedom of movement and of labor , but a number of different legal systems . 
  the us , canada , turkey , and a couple of non-eu european countries are tied at the hip to the eu ( even more-complicated : * most * of the eu ) on security policy . 
  the de-facto * lingua franca * is an official language in only a tiny chunk of the union . 
  some eu members are n't bound to defend others ( that was a surprise to me ) . 
  countries are ( presently , at any rate ) permitted to leave the union . 
  there 's a concept of opt-outs . 
  only part of the union uses one currency . 
  there is the non-eu enclave of switzerland -- very rare around the world .

  that 's not how sampling works -- the sample size is n't ( in any way relevant to this sort of poll ) connected to the percentage of the population in providing likelihood of being representative . 
  doubling the population size does n't mean that you need to double the sample size . 
  assuming that they 're a random sample , 1000 people is fine . 
  most ( good ) nationwide polls in the us are of ~ 1000 people . 
  http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/166/how-do-you-decide-the-sample-size-when-polling-a-large-population up vote 10 down vote  sample size does n't much depend on the population size , which is counter-intuitive to many . 
    most polling companies use 400 or 1000 people in their samples . 
    there is a reason for this :   a sample size of 400 will give you a confidence interval of + / -5 % 19 times out of 20 ( 95 % )   a sample size of 1000 will give you a confidence interval of + / -3 % 19 times out of 20 ( 95 % ),

   the soviet union never had a first strike doctrine [ the only countries with a no-first-use declaration on nuclear weapons are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_first_use#united_states ) : * china * india * north korea the us has declared that it will only use nuclear weapons against other nuclear powers , but does not declare no-first-use . 
  [ today , russia has a more-permissive nuclear doctrine than the us does , to help counteract the fact that russia has a weaker conventional military ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ) . 
  finally , i 'll add that realistically , it 's not clear how binding such a declaration would be -- in any situation where one of the above states would likely use nuclear weapons at all , the consequences of a violation of that guarantee would probably be outweighed by other pressures . 
  and a bilateral agreement to cut that chunk of the country off .

  only sub-saharan africa is substantially below , and there are only so many people there .

  obviously , genocide and a huge , catastrophic war loom pretty large , but ... ( a ) [ nazi germany was n't the only party involved in eugenics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_eugenics#united_states ) , though the scope expanded well beyond anyone else 's . 
  ( b ) several early moves in the war were pretty successful . 
  not * technically * part of world war ii , but the rhineland , austria and czechoslovakia * could * have touched off war and were successful for him in that they did not . 
  poland kicked things off , but france did n't did n't move in . 
  when germany actually fought the battle of france , she was much-more-successful than had been expected . 
  at that point , it 's not unthinkable that germany could have managed to maneuver things back to peace on very favorable terms for germany . 
  now , i 'll grant , if someone just keeps rolling the dice over-and-over and going all in on each roll , sooner or later they 're going to be broke , and it 's hard to call the strategy brilliant ... but certainly hitler did pull things off on the international stage that a lot of people did not see as likely , even as the war went .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_national_missile_defense#current_nmd_program my point about not it being capable of stopping russia from a first strike is simply because every dispute i 've read over the issue has pointed out the disproportionate number of missiles , vehicles , and decoys available . 
  the only way to realistically reduce that number would be managing to greatly reduce russia 's arsenal before russia launched ( obviously , a risky gamble ) or greatly increasing the number of interceptors . 
  when was this ?

  oh , i 'd assume that the fluff is just politics -- i remember mulling over a nice-sounding speech from bill clinton and realizing that despite the long , flowery statements , he 'd actually managed to avoid saying and committing to nothing . 
  i just was n't expecting that many unrelated metaphors . 
  good grief , that man has more metaphors than concrete , factual statements . 
  in two paragraphs :  `` we are faced with ** a constitution which has already turned into a rag bag ** with endless amendments and which has lost its completeness . 
  if so , we should seek a way of greatly increasing our output by supporting ** the powerful hardware we have with software compatible with this ** . 
  we need to approach the issue of a new constitution and presidential system just like that , '' erdo\u011fan said while delivering a speech at a ceremony where `` honorable service certificate and plaques '' were presented to general assembly delegates of the union of chambers and commodity exchanges of turkey ( tobb ) . 
    `` nobody has the right to ** turn turkey into a country of lions that are destined to a vegetarian diet ** . 
  whatever is the desire of our nation and whatever is our country 's need , we should find solutions compatible with that and implement them , '' erdo\u011fan said . 
  edit : actually , the non-metaphorical sentences there are basically zero-content fluff ( `` we should find solutions compatible with our need '' ) , so there 's * definitely * more metaphor than concrete statements . 
   despite u.s. assurances , the kremlin says the missile shield 's real aim is to neutralize moscow 's nuclear arsenal long enough for the united states to make a first strike on russia in the event of war . 
  i mean , maybe in the long term , but it does n't have enough interceptors at the moment . 
  as i understand it , if the system as it exists today were used to facilitate a us first strike against russia , it would have to be to stop the russian second strike that would follow a successful us first strike that wiped out most russian nuclear capability without a counterlaunch making it off . 
  it would n't be capable of simply holding off a russian launch before us missiles hit ( or , for that matter , a russian first strike ) -- too many russian missiles . 
  it would be capable of blocking an iranian first strike if iran were to obtain nuclear weapons , though . 
  a permanent imbalance would n't be viable . 
  i 'm not a macroeconomist , but cato ( us classical liberal organization ) [ has an explanation up of it ] ( http://www.cato.org/publications/trade-policy-analysis/americas-maligned-misunderstood-trade-deficit ) :  ** investment flows drive the deficit **   the most important economic truth to grasp about the u.s. trade deficit is that it has virtually nothing to do with trade policy . 
  a nation 's trade deficit is determined by the flow of investment funds into or out of the country . 
  and those flows are determined by how much the people of a nation save and invest -- two variables that are only marginally affected by trade policy . 
    an understanding of the trade deficit begins with the balance of payments , the broadest accounting of a nation 's international transactions . 
  by definition , the balance of payments always equals zero -- that is , what a country buys or gives away in the global market must equal what it sells or receives -- because of the exchange nature of trade . 
  ( 16 ) people , whether trading across a street or across an ocean , will generally not give up something without receiving something of comparable value in return . 
  the double-entry nature of international bookkeeping means that , for a nation as a whole , the value of what it gives to the rest of the world will be matched by the value of what it receives . 
    the balance of payments accounts capture two sides of an equation : the current account and the capital account . 
  the current account side of the ledger covers the flow of goods , services , investment income , and uncompensated transfers such as foreign aid and remittances across borders by private citizens . 
  within the current account , the trade balance includes goods and services only , and the merchandise trade balance reflects goods only . 
  on the other side , the capital account includes the buying and selling of investment assets such as real estate , stocks , bonds , and government securities . 
    if a country runs a capital account surplus of $ 100 billion , it will run a current account deficit of $ 100 billion to balance its payments . 
  as economist douglas irwin explains , `` if a country is buying more goods and services from the rest of the world than it is selling , the country must also be selling more assets to the rest of the world than it is buying . '' ( 17 )   the necessary balance between the current account and the capital account implies a direct connection between the trade balance on the one hand and the savings and investment balance on the other . 
  that relationship is captured in the simple formula :    savings - investment = exports - imports   thus , a nation that saves more than it invests , such as japan , will export its excess savings in the form of net foreign investment . 
  in other words , it must run a capital account deficit . 
  the money sent abroad as investment will return to the country to purchase exports in excess of what the country imports , creating a corresponding trade surplus .
