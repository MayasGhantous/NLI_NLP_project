   you 'd be surprised how much sovereignty eastern politicians have sold behind people 's back what are you referring to ? 
   or are you telling me any european country on its own can refuse ( or even genuinely negotiate ) a trade deal that the us wants them to sign ? 
  uh ... yes ? 
  what do you think would happen if a country did n't sign a trade agreement ? 
  that the us would withdraw from nato ? 
  attack the country ? 
  and for that matter , why do you believe that a trade agreement is simply advantageous to the us ? 
  yes , more trade will create disruption . 
  it will cause some existing businesses to go under , because it 's changed the parameters of the operating environment . 
  but if germany imports over n units of value in goods , they 're also exporting n units of value in goods back ; if not to the us then transitively through some other chain of countries . 
  and that trade will happen only if people in that country win out by importing that good . 
  [ video in question ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syslezhbpus ) . 
  i saw a lot more upset about nafta , the first big free trade deal that the us did . 
  i 'd say that now it 's just old hat over here . 
  when i search for `` ttip '' on google news , two of the top ten hits are rt.com , and one of them is sputnik ; russian international broadcasters ( both sources obviously opposed ) . 
  to be fair , slavery was a point of contention even in the declaration of independence . 
  people may not have thought that it would turn into * civil war * , but it was obviously going to be an extremely bitter point that neither side would really fully compromise on . 
  i do n't know if there 's a political equivalent to that in the eu today . 
  i 'd guess that it has more potential for being a growth field , as well as permitting you to work in more countries . 
   given that the original purpose of the eu was to prevent ww3 i am surprised that most people do n't argue that germany is engaging in banditry ( obviously any germans reading this will down vote me ! ) . 
  that 's the first time i 've heard someone holding down their wages be called `` banditry '' . 
  [ ah , you 're right !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himmelbjerget ) so the highest point in denmark * is * artificial , though i guess in that sense it 's less-interesting -- anyone can throw a structure on top of a mountain . 
  i see little discussion in the us about either compared to on this forum . 
  is n't seeking the convenience of not learning another language kind of normal ? 
  how many germans have moved to austria versus , say , poland or italy ? 
  tens of thousands seems unrealistic , [ but they appear to exist in smaller numbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:ghost_towns_in_italy ) . 
  there 's a * daily mail * article from last year claiming `` 20,000 '' ghost towns in italy , which i assume is what / u/metalmaniac9999 is referring to . 
  it seems unlikely to me . 
  maybe if you count long-buried ruins and include individual farms or something ... 
  nato ? 
  i would oppose a nato operation here . 
  the problem is not lack of ability to stop illegal immigration , but lack of political will . 
  either there are people with an interest in illegal immigration itself , or there are other political barriers ( to doing things like placing people ) , and so there is no europe-wide decision to stop illegal immigration . 
  nato is a military alliance . 
  it is not , and should not be , a political club to bludgeon members into adopting policy . 
  were it to take on that role , members would no longer want to be members . 
  the eu might be able to take on the role of holding a majority vote on things like this , since that is within its bailiwick , but this would be nato scope creep . 
  the only way i could see a good argument for nato becoming involved would be : * an actual attack on a country and article 5 invocation . 
  * consensus agreement among all nato members to take some sort of military action ( at which point the operation might as well be a nato operation than simply a `` might as well be nato '' operation ) . 
   these men ( no women are allowed ) are all sworn members of a company of professional soldiers that dates back more than five centuries to 1506 making them the oldest military unit that has seen continuous service in history . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_military_units_and_formations_in_continuous_operation ) that the vatican 's swiss guard only gets second place behind the french 1st infantry regiment , continuously-operating since 1479 . 
  the bulk of knives today are stainless steel . 
  not having to worry about keeping knives dry seems to have outweighed any drawbacks of sharpening somewhat-more-often . 
  oh , man ... looking at the [ list of buildings in denmark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_buildings_in_denmark ) , denmark is close to having its highest point be artificial , a building roof . 
  at the moment , the tallest building in denmark is just 25 floors . 
  31 floors would do it . 
  [ this plan to build a real mountain so that the dutch can have one of their own ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/peak-of-insanity-dutch-dream-of-building-artificial-mountain-a-784085.html ) has been linked occasionally . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_dutch_family_names ) , surnames in the netherlands became the norm in 1811 , so i assume that those date to that time . 
  i guess that people would have traveled less then ( you had your feet or maybe a horse or a ship , if you could afford it ) , but it could also be people who came from abroad as well . 
  i guess it depends upon your definition of `` hard left '' , but i 'd normally think of `` hard left '' as being left-anarchist or communist or socialist . 
  i suspect that most labour supporters in the uk would n't fall into that camp , yet there 's dislike for her above-and-beyond `` she 's a leader from that other party '' . 
  david cameron is a tory , but i get a much-stronger negative reaction over thatcher than cameron on almost any reddit forum . 
   the truth is this : what happens in our neighborhood matters to britain . 
    that was true in 1914 , in 1940 and in 1989 .

  i wonder who the audience of the speech was , and how many people know the associated events among the general public , if that is the intended audience . 
   lol sorry you 'll have more luck trying to ban feta than allow any organization to investigate our finances . 
  everyone , from the most antiauthoritarian anarchist to the most hardcore nazi would unite in protest against such an idea . 
  why ? 
  i can understand a government that has members who would get caught with their hands in the cookie jar objecting , but why would the public object ? 
  because of concerns that sensitive data would leak ? 
  it seems to me that one of the most-crippling issues among some new eu members ( and would-be members , like ukraine ) is in public-sector corruption . 
  i 've seen movement towards a less-corrupt environment given as a reason for interest in eu membership . 
  [ estonia is a light green on this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:eu_members_where_more_people_in_favor_of_the_european_federation.png ) , but there 's a lot of dark green there .

  i agree that there were issues in greece . 
  i do not think that it is categorically not possible for greece to function well . 
  i do think that it is worth having creditor ez countries weigh the costs of moral hazard against building solidarity . 
  i think that it 's possible to simultaneously provide a clear path to normalcy for greece and disincentivize the kinds of things that happened . 
  also , note that while greece 's problems were the worst , greece is not alone in not conforming to ez fiscal requirements . 
  there is some degree of similar blame all around in making ez requirements be realistic and be taken seriously . 
  i 'm kind of partial to the idea of having an eu level anti-fraud organization with investigatory powers , but some people here have said that they are sure that this would not pass political muster . 
   `` tsipras is looking to demonstrate to greek voters that he and his government have done their part , and that the ball , namely that of debt relief , now lies squarely with the europeans , '' said rahman . 
  what a strange way of phrasing that . 
  i 'm kind of envious of it . 
  i prefer it to * the west wing * , which i guess is the closest us equivalent -- though i bet that * the west wing * is more popular , and certainly has more glitz and drama . 
  [ same thing with widespread disability fraud happens over here ] ( http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/ ) . 
  posting this because it describes a serious proposal from jordan similar to one that i have raised on this forum -- the idea of special economic zones being used overseas by european firms near migrant camps as a way of reducing pull factor . 
   once in the havens , refugees have the option of living in camps run by the un refugee agency unhcr , where they are housed and fed . 
  few opt for the camps ; most prefer to preserve their autonomy by scratching a living illegally in the cities . 
  this choice should alert us to the inadequacy of the standard unhcr approach : what refugees need is the right to work in these havens , not a life without autonomy in the camps . 
    governments of haven countries are often understandably wary of letting refugees work , because their own workers would object . 
  however , the government of jordan has offered to create 150,000 work permits for syrian refugees as long as european firms create new jobs for them . 
  the idea is to harness globalisation for good : the firms would bring jobs to jordan 's industrial zones , and sell the output in europe . 
  this is not as difficult as it sounds : european firms have been operating in just this way in places such as poland and turkey for years . 
  a remote turkish town now produces half the world 's synthetic carpets . 
  if i lived in eritrea , i absolutely would move to poland . 
  maybe the * first * choice is london ( english-speaking , labor prices ) or berlin ( labor prices ) or stockholm ( less-strict immigration policy , labor prices ) , but you 're making a much stronger statement , saying that a migrant would prefer living in his country of origin over poland . 
  the eu -- anywhere in the eu -- really is a preferable place to be than nigeria , eritrea , syria , libya , etc. 
   and should nations be forced to follow these values forever ? 
  the refugee convention has a well-defined withdrawal process , which requires twelve months . 
  no country has chosen to take part in that yet . 
  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention  article 44 . 
  any contracting state may denounce this convention at any time by a notification addressed to the secretary-general of the united nations . 
  such denunciation shall take effect for the contracting state concerned one year from the date upon which it is received by the secretary-general of the united nations . 
  any state which has made a declaration or notification under article 40 may , at any time thereafter , by a notification to the secretary-general of the united nations , declare that the convention shall cease to extend to such territory one year after the date of receipt of the notification by the secretary-general . 
  http://i.imgur.com/klbex5g.png seriously , though , one effective thing that poland could do in discouraging illegal immigration is to make it explicit that this is not a path to citizenship in poland . 
  part of the draw is that it 's possible to use refugee status to get permanent residency and from permanent residency to citizenship and from citizenship to family reunification . 
  poland can set policy wherever she wants on this .
