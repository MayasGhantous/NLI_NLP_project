  one might add that the reason that those insurgents have all those assault rifles is because the soviet union intended to break imperialism via supplying them . 
  before that , [ the developing world was at a serious technological disadvantage relative to the west ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maxim_gun ) :  the maxim gun was first used by britain 's colonial forces in the 1893 -- 1894 first matabele war in rhodesia . 
  during the battle of the shangani , 700 soldiers fought off 5,000 warriors with just four maxim guns . 
  it played an important role in the swift european colonization of africa in the late 19th century . 
  the extreme lethality was employed to devastating effect against obsolete charging tactics , when native opponents could be lured into pitched battles in open terrain . 
  as it was put by hilaire belloc , in the words of the figure `` blood '' in his poem `` the modern traveller '' :   * whatever happens , we have got *   * the maxim gun , and they have not . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-47#cultural_influence_and_impact  during the cold war , the soviet union and the people 's republic of china , as well as united states and other nato nations supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces around the world . 
  during this time the western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles , such as the fn fal , the hk g3 , the m14 , and the m16 . 
  in contrast , the russians and chinese used the ak-47 ; its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make aks in vast numbers . 
    in the pro-communist states , the ak-47 became a symbol of third-world revolution . 
  during the 1980s , the soviet union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by western nations , including middle eastern nations such as iran , libya , and syria , which welcomed soviet union backing against israel . 
  [ snip ]  the proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers . 
  the ak-47 is included in the flag of mozambique and its emblem , an acknowledgment that the country 's leaders gained power in large part through the effective use of their ak-47s . 
  [ 169 ] it is also found in the coats of arms of east timor and the revolution era burkina faso , as well as in the flags of the hezbollah and new people 's army . 
    some western countries associate the ak-47 with their enemies ; both cold war era and present-day . 
  for example , western movies often portray criminals , gang members and terrorists using ak-47s . 
  for these reasons , in the u.s. and western europe the ak-47 is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents , gangsters and terrorists . 
  conversely , throughout the developing world , the ak-47 can be positively attributed with revolutionaries against foreign occupation , imperialism , or colonialism . 
  dianetics is really an idea in scientology -- should probably use `` scientology '' instead . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_canada  according to canada 's 2011 national household survey , there were 1,053,945 muslims in canada or about 3.2 % [ 1 ] of the population , making them the second largest religion after christianity . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_europe  in the late 20th and early 21st centuries substantial numbers of non-native muslims immigrated to western europe . 
  by 2010 an estimated 44 million muslims were living in europe ( 6 % ) , including an estimated 19 million in the eu ( 3.8 % ) . 
  [ 4 ] canada 's actually not-far-off the eu 's islamic demographic size . 
   `` let 's remember when hitler won his election in 1932 -- his policy then was that jews should be moved to israel , '' [ ken livingstone ] told bbc london . 
  `` he was supporting zionism . 
  this before he went mad and ended up killing 6 million jews . '' hmm . 
  http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/zionism.htm  since the nazis hated the jews , one might at first think they would favor zionism 's campaign to build a jewish state , thus encouraging jews to leave germany . 
  they did in fact encourage jewish emigration to palestine , even ordering newspapers in germany not to print stories about the difficulties jews faced there . 
  however , this article from one of the most widely circulated nazi periodicals rejects the idea . 
  zionism is seen as part of the general jewish plot to control the world . 
  well , conservation of mass and all that . 
  you got ta put the sand you scoop out somewhere , so for every castle you make , you 're also creating a hole with the volume of the castle . 
  well , i agree that the position of the leadership could change . 
  certainly that position is unlikely to be eternal and unchanging ; i 'd be surprised if nato were in existence a thousand years from now . 
  i 'm just referring to the present . 
  i 'd say that the the us ( and since / u/jerzy667 called me on being ambiguous in referring to a country above , specifically , the us leadership ) also wants nato , or the us would withdraw from it ; same data point as germany choosing to be a member . 
  that shows majority support from the public , and i think that the lack of a request to leave is pretty solid evidence for the leadership being in favor . 
   they dont want nato bases on their soild above all i 'm doubtful -- if germany wants nato bases out , it would simply have to tell countries with bases to remove them . 
  would n't even require leaving nato -- france did exactly that with us soldiers for decades . 
  the fact that they 're still there is a pretty safe indicator that germany wants [ them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:nato_installations_in_germany ) there . 
  a lot of different countries have pointed at a lot of outside cultures as being barbaric ( or at least has a concept comparable and translatable to `` barbaric '' ) . 
  the [ ancient greeks thought that everyone else was barbaric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbarian#etymology ) . 
  you 'll find things where chinese describe things as `` barbaric '' . 
  i generally do n't much like the term -- it is emotionally-loaded , invariably attached to value judgments , and it seems to me that many different peoples have made conflicting calls on just who is civilized and who is barbaric . 
  eh , there 's at least a quantitative difference . 
  how much christian terrorism is ongoing today versus how much islamic terrorism ? 
   the ban on foreign mosque funding in particular sounds incredibly sensible to me . 
  it is , and has been , i believe , common for missions to receive funding from non-domestic organizations in christianity . 
  mind , that does n't mean that islam doing it is necessarily desirable -- just that it has been commonly-done in the past by christianity . 
   `` islam is not a religion like catholic or protestant christianity , but rather intellectually always associated with the takeover of the state , '' hmm . 
  christianity has '' [ render unto caesar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/render_unto_caesar ) '' , and it still clearly played a huge role in the secular political history of europe . 
  albania does n't seem to run into islam attempting to seize control of the government . 
  i 'm not particularly-enthusiastic about islam , but i am doubtful of a claim that [ islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam ) is inextricably-linked to [ islamism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamism ) and that this sort of thing is additionally unique to islam . 
  just to save people time posting : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_satirical_magazines i suspect that this list remains incomplete , since the only two i could have thought of in the us would be * the onion * and [ * mad * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mad_\\ ( magazine \\ ) ) , and * mad * is not present in the list . 
  edit : fwiw , satirical magazines appear to be an art form that is more-popular in europe than in the us -- the number of european entries dwarfs the number of us entries . 
  let 's say that i protect the widget industry in the united states from the competing widget industry in europe . 
  all those euro widgets ca n't get into the us without paying a 30 % tariff . 
  that means that us widget manufacturers can potentially charge up to 30 % more . 
  that means that more resources are wasted to produce a required widget than is the case . 
  if the us would have produced something * else * and exchanged it for a europe-originating widget absent the protectionist law , the us should have done so -- like produced a chicken and swapped that to europe for a widget . 
  that would have meant that the us could have obtained the widgets for less . 
  that protectionist law will tend to transfer wealth from the us consumer to the us widget industry . 
  it will ever-so-slightly weaken all other us industries , in that the real pay of everyone in the us will drop ( in terms of ability to purchase widgets ) . 
  there are some times when protectionism is seen as being desirable , and when it might make sense to permit it . 
  normally , it is not , though industries also love having lucrative protectionist laws in place : they transfer wealth from the domestic consumer to them . 
  the problem is that because an industry lobbying for a protectionist law * knows * that there are only limited cases where protectionism makes sense , it is very likely to try and present its particular situation as actually being one of those , even if it is not one such case . 
  some arguments in favor of `` legitimate '' protectionism : there may be certain externalities , benefits not reflected in the product 's price , associated with having a particular industry in place . 
  for example , the us had a very large and efficient automobile-production industry when entering world war ii . 
  because of this , it had a way to rapidly-shift to producing vehicles for military use , which was valuable in terms of war effort . 
  that had a national security benefit , even though it was n't priced into the product and thus the market did n't `` know '' about it . 
  national security is one such common justification . 
  `` dumping '' is a common claim . 
  this is where a company sells product at below the cost of production into a market . 
  this sounds nonsensical -- and in the long term , it would be . 
  however , it might be one route for a large competitor that can afford to lose money for a while to drive smaller competitors out of the market , if it can be maintained in the short term longer than competitors can . 
  i am not an expert in how legitimate it is in international trade disputes , though / u/savannajeff has said that it is a legitimate concern . 
  i have heard claims of dumping when i doubt that this is the case . 
  in this case , i 'm not totally clear what justification is being claimed -- apparently that they would n't be able to enforce safety rules if non-us pilots were being used . 
  that sounds doubtful to me . 
  furthermore , it 's claiming that `` below market rate '' wages are offered , which is pretty silly , at least if one is including thailand in the labor market in question . 
  or , in short -- it 's economically-inefficient . 
  so , now my question is : if norwegian air has n't had any accidents , does that mean that the safety laws in place that they are n't following are unnecessary and just acting as a protectionist way to shift money from consumers to airlines ? 
  or is it just that they 've been lucky so far ? 
  i 'm not enthralled with the idea of paying artificially-high wages to airline pilots , unless there 's a first-rate reason for it ( e.g. 
  addressing an externality , like ensuring a supply of pilots in the event of war ) that ca n't be otherwise internalized ( e.g. 
  [ making more-widespread civil aviation viable ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_aviation_revitalization_act ) ) . 
  oh , god . 
  the [ chicken tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax ) is immortal . 
   `` some people think guns have a will of their own ; that guns kill people , rather than bad people killing people , '' she says . 
  `` removing guns from criminals is all well and good , but the best ` national guard ' would be ordinary people with legal guns ready to defend the motherland . '', 
  in world war i , in another laden-with-glorious-british-intrigue story , [ germany tried unsuccessfully to get mexico to declare war on the us in exchange for germany granting her part of the southern us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zimmermann_telegram ) . 
  this was probably the most-recent situation in which a country seriously considered conducting an thumbs-up-or-thumbs-down invasion of the continental us , as it 's [ only gotten more-difficult over time ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/we-asked-a-military-expert-if-the-whole-world-could-conquer-the-united-states ) . 
  mexico commissioned an internal military study on the viability of accepting the offer . 
  one of the four reasons the study recommended that mexico decline was :  * even if by some chance mexico had the military means to win a conflict against the united states and reclaim the territories in question , mexico would have severe difficulty accommodating a large english-speaking population that was better supplied with arms than most populations . 
  that is , in one of the few times that this was examined by another country 's military , civilian access to arms was considered a serious , high-level obstacle to an annexation . 
  switzerland 's leadership [ relied upon such a strategy in world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_guisan ) :  on 25 july 1940 , general guisan delivered a historic address to the entire swiss officer corps assembled on the r\u00fctli , a location charged with symbolism in swiss romantic nationalism by virtue of being identified as the site of the r\u00fctlischwur of 1291 . 
  guisan became a symbol of resistance to nazism that was widespread amongst the swiss public . 
  [ 5 ]   he made it very clear that switzerland would resist any nazi invasion . 
  if they ran out of bullets they were to resort to the bayonet . 
  he said that switzerland would defend itself against any invader and would never surrender .
