  sweden 's taking out substantial debt housing people . 
  now , it 's possible that the deal will simply be ineffective , fall prey to some of my concerns or other issues . 
  it 's possible that there are other issues . 
  i personally like the pacific solution more , because i think that it avoids some of the risks . 
  but merkel 's approach is not simply immediately non-workable , and it addresses some of the same issues . 
  it avoids some of the pacific solution problems ( is it even * possible * to find a place willing to house that many people ? ) . 
  i 'm certainly in wait-and-see-how-it-works mode . 
  i am not particularly-enthusiastic about the eu-turkey deal -- it seems to me to leave all parties involved with little incentive to act with good faith . 
  turkey does not want gobs of migrants piling up in turkey , and while turkey might take back captured people , it 's hard to quantify effort in stopping them . 
  eu offers of expedited process for visa-free access seem to me to be * particularly * hard to offer in this particular context , and also hard to measure effort in eu progress here . 
  however , it is possible that it will work -- and i do n't see how it has been a `` disaster '' . 
  and it * does * do a fair number of things : * it addresses a major issue preventing the eu from closing the borders on the outside of greece -- the inability to deport people crossing over , even if intercepted . 
  * it does do at least something to address mis-incentives , as long as the cost of trying to get across to the eu remains substantial . 
  * it avoids creating greece-turkey issues . 
  * it can be pursued in conjunction with other measures . 
  * it should n't * exacerbate * things . 
  some approaches , like `` just take everyone who shows up '' , may do that . 
  * it encourages migrants to `` go through the system '' and be recorded , which puts a larger chunk of control of the situation in the eu 's hands . 
  before , there were n't records present of who was showing up , and people were trying to hide fingerprints . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_the_european_union not that new ... look at paris in 1980 , for example . 
   it serves only the totalitarian political ideology of islamism to abuse this term for politics . 
  it 's probably even more accurate to be narrower than just `` islamism '' , since while an islamist would work for an islam-controlled society , that does not mandate the use of terrorism in doing so . 
  but there is n't really a word for that , so in the absence of one ... 
  orban put up a wire fence that could be lifted with a stick . 
  there is plenty of footage of migrants doing precisely that . 
  that kind of weak impediment is going to have some effect as long as people can just be diverted into another country , but it 's not going to stop people . 
  it might sell well politically in hungary , but it is n't going to be the answer to illegal migration . 
  that does n't mean that it 's impossible to block human movement , but it is n't going to be as simple as a razor-wire fence . 
  personally , i 'm still partial to the pacific solution ... 
  gaddafi was driven by the uk and france , and i * think * that france was first on assad . 
  the us certainly was driving saddam . 
  but that 's not the point -- if your border policy relies on `` no conflict in africa or the middle east '' , it 's not going to last -- the eu is going to need the ability to avoid having people enter , even if there 's conflict .

  if the inmate makes no decision , hanging is the standard method . 
  you wan na talk the talk , you got ta walk the walk , russia . 
   i think the core original idea of the eu was `` peace & prosperity '' with the concept that they go hand in hand . 
  the question of what the `` core original idea '' was seems less-interesting than the question of what people today would like the eu to be . 
  that does n't have anything to do with whether-or-not white flour is used -- you can also preserve whole wheat bread . 
  when i go looking at authors , it 's notable the kind of impact the uk has had compared to the also-english-speaking , much-larger us .

   should companies such as german firm dextro energy be allowed to advertise the sugar content of their products in order to promote physical performance-enhancing qualities ? 
  the european court of justice ( ecj ) has said no ... as a well-known producer of products such as energy tablets or ` cubes ' , dextro energy wanted to advertise its wares ' performance-boosting qualities .

   for example , in the us , i 'd be statistically about 8 times more likely to get shot . 
  are you black ? 
  you are n't eight times more likely to get shot , then . 
  if you 're black in the us , you 're about eight times as likely to kill someone as if you were white ( coincidence that the ratio is so similar , i guess ) and a titch under that as many times as likely to be killed by someone .

   i already think it was a huge mistake to expand the eu without having a clear and defined model and working structure with it to begin with . 
  what is the purpose of the eu ? 
  depending on the country you are coming from , the answer to this question will be drastically different . 
  i 'm not convinced that that is n't the norm for confederations . 
  it 's kind of a big deal for the eu . 
  bigger than the present us presidential election is for the us , and that 's been swamping the news for longer . 
   the cost to a free at the point of use health service will break it if a large proportion of its users do n't ( or have never ) supported it . 
  do they use it ? 
  that is , let 's say that i 'm illegally-present in britain . 
  will i have to disclose my identity if i make use of the nhs and if so , does the nhs forward that information to uk immigration control ? 
  if so , i 'd assume that there would n't be use of the nhs . 
   the only thing that could get you kicked out of nato nato has no provision for evicting members . 
  more to the point , doing so would n't make sense . 
   if the death toll is low , it 's because of us and german embassies . 
  they warned about possible terror attacks in following 3 days ( including today ) meanwhile government acted like nothing will happen . 
  thank you , but to be honest -- there 's a limited amount that turkey can do based on that , same as when us intelligence warns the us public . 
  you going to shut the country down for that ? 
  i am sorry to hear about the bombing and the dead . 
   i think its to the point were people ride around , and shoot them with guns when they jump out .

  apparently [ you * can * eat asian carp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asian_carp#as_food ) , and it 's more a matter of consumer preference :  asian carp have been a popular food fish in asia for thousands of years . 
  however , many people in north america associate asian carp with common carp , a bottom-feeding , highly bony species which was introduced from eurasia in the 1800s and is not widely regarded as food . 
  [ 8 ]   the pearly white flesh -- complicated by a series of bones -- is said to taste like cod or described as tasting like a cross between scallops and crabmeat . 
  they are low in mercury because they do not eat other fish . 
  to make the fish more appealing to american consumers , the fish have been renamed silverfin or kentucky tuna . 
  [ 9 ] volunteer efforts to increase the popularity further include making and selling carp-based dishes and using the entrails to make fertilizer . 
  [ 10 ]   some have thought to collect the carp eggs for caviar , since one bighead carp was found with over 2 million eggs . 
  two million eggs from one fish could fill two jars of caviar , which would be quite valuable . 
  this is only true , however , in the case of a fish from which people would eat eggs . 
  as of now , no market for carp eggs exists in america , [ 11 ] though there is a movement that is trying to increase the popularity of carp eggs in europe . 
  [ 12 ]   in april 2015 a company called bareitall petfoods , based out of chicago , created the first commercially available pet food featuring asian carp as a means to reduce the populations in the waterways of the midwest . 
   people buy them as pets we * are * talking about racoons , right ?

  i dunno ... even your article is waxing on on how delectable they are :  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0309_040309_giantcrabs.html has :  yet others welcome the red king crab , saying its delicious taste and size -- the crabs can grow to 22 pounds ( 10 kilograms ) and measure 4.9 feet ( 1.5 meters ) across -- make it an extremely lucrative catch . 
  ... and describing how catches of them were restricted , something you 'd do to grow their population . 
  i was unimpressed by ostrich , and i imagine that they might be like that .
