  while i assume that any economic migrants who got refugee status would n't get to choose where to go under this new plan , they can also choose to return home if their asylum does n't grant them access to their long-term goal . 
  there has been some concern from people on this forum over how people fingerprinted when applying for refugee status in one country were not having those fingerprints being passed on . 
  it may be that material was simply backlogged or that there are other internal restrictions , or that those posters were incorrect . 
   people were even speculating the uk might return to the status of a developing country before its impressive growth period starting from the early 1980s , today the uk is one of the wealthiest countries in europe . 
  thatcher probably deserves more love than she gets . 
   you will never `` catch up '' economically with a banker with borrowed money from that banker ( even if you make good investments ) . 
  well , let 's say that company a floats a corporate bond -- that is `` give me x euros now and i will pay you x+y euros later '' . 
  lending is a competitive market , so that forces down how much a lender can demand . 
  i do n't see any reason why one could n't come out ahead . 
  a lender 's return here is based on how-accurately it can assess risk relative to other lenders . 
  it 's not in the same market as the potentially-rapidly-growing business at all . 
  if you 're talking about investors , the investor gets exposed to risk , whereas employees of a company are not ( at least to the same degree , at any point ) . 
  some companies go under and cause their investors to lose out , but they still had to pay their employees . 
  edit : plus , investors are n't all coming in initially -- it 's the norm to have multiple rounds of funding in silicon valley , and the people who are coming in later are exposed to less risk ( yes , the product clearly works , there are customers , etc ) , but are also paying a higher price for getting in without that risk . 
  a successful company there will benefit the founders more-significantly than investors who enter the final round of funding . 
  so i do n't think that it would be correct to say that closing a gap requires financial isolation . 
  the gap 's been closing . 
  i 'm sure that there are about a zillion papers written on this and investigating this , but my guess is part of it is due to limited labor mobility due to language differences . 
  what i do n't understand is why law enforcement data is n't shared , like migrant/refugee fingerprints . 
  a country may have a hard time finding moles in another country 's intelligence agency -- they 've no ability to investigate it , after all -- and exposing information risks killing their own sources . 
  but sharing fingerprint data seems like a no-brainer . 
  the cia appears to be [ hosting a paper on further european intelligence integration ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/summer00/art07.html ) describing some of the situation and the obstacles to address ; while the paper is now fifteen years old , it 's probably a reasonable starting point for an overview .

  the us [ spends on the order of $ 80b/year on intelligence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_intelligence_budget ) , counting intelligence gathering and processing both for the military and civilian branches of government . 
  the eu has a total gdp comparable to that of the us 's . 
  also , an issue specific to intelligence rather than other government functions -- or obvious reasons , budget transparency is limited and so oversight is more complicated . 
  need to address that issue as well .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalism#history  with the emergence of a national public sphere and an integrated , country-wide economy in 18th-century england , english people began to identify with the country at large , rather than the smaller units of their family , town or province . 
  huh . 
  okay -- so i guess that people had that sense of loyalty to the group and a sort of tribal identification , just to regions that did n't match up with what the leader controlled . 
  then as people moved around more , they started identifying with the larger organization . 
  < considers  i guess that 's really a process that has n't really ended , either , if one considers the eu today . 
   the end goal is always money for both the corrupted politician and the organized crime i 'd imagine that corrupt politicians and organized crime in russia ( or anywhere else ) are in it for the money as well , rather than for the sheer villainy of it -- control of political institutions is simply a mechanism to get at money . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_universalis_iv  in the game , players control a nation during the late middle ages until the early modern period ( 1444 to 1821 ) , [ 7 ] conducting trade , diplomacy , colonization , and warfare . 
  hmm . 
  could you expand ? 
  i would have thought that nationalism existed in europe during that timeframe . 
  the us has state quarters . 
  does each for a couple of years , then switches to a new couple of states . 
  could do the same on bills , i suppose . 
  just depends on whether familiarity with the face on the thing is important for use or anti-counterfeiting efforts . 
  i imagine that it would n't be very disruptive to the uk , but would to some other countries that have borders without the same sort of natural geographic barriers . 
  put differently -- how would you feel about doing the same between northern ireland , scotland , wales , and england ?
