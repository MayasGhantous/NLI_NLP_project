   and yeah their allies totally do n't count as allies at all because they were too useless germany 's two major allies were italy and japan , and both expanded the war in ways that worsened germany 's position on the net . 
  [ italy invaded the rather-smaller greece , got her clock cleaned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-italian_war ) , and greece counterinvaded into italian-controlled territory . 
  italy had to lug germany in to bail her out . 
  japan attacked the much-more-powerful-given-time-to-build-up us ; germany honored the tripartite pact and declared war on the us , the us declared war back . 
  it 's the romani flag sporting romania 's colors .

  doubtful . 
  the us , like almost all modern-day countries , does n't really have classes , so at the end of the day , it depends on your definition , but by most definitions , they are not . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_middle_class the bottom end of the income-based definitions used here mostly places the low end of household income for the middle class starting in the mid - $ 30k range , and [ as per my above comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4hz4pi/us_troops_training_in_moldova/d2u88nq ) , the amish tend to make less money than that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania#etymology  * romania * derives from the latin * romanus * , meaning `` citizen of rome '' . 
  [ 13 ] the first known use of the appellation was attested in the 16th-century by italian humanists travelling in transylvania , moldavia , and wallachia . 
  [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ snip ]  the use of the name * romania * to refer to the common homeland of all romanians -- its modern-day meaning -- is first documented in the early 19th century . 
  [ d ] the name has been officially in use since 11 december 1861 . 
  true , but i bet that he is n't calling himself `` the light armor farmer '' and probably does n't have a [ coat of arms with an armored fighting vehicle on it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_cavalry_regiment_\\ ( united_states \\ ) # / media/file :002 - cavalry-regiment-coa . png ) . 
  if the spanish patrol boat was a small rigid-hull inflatable like the one listed , it would have been to warn the spanish boat of a collision . 
  the submarine is far larger , and would have just gone right over the boat if they actually collided . 
  i suspect that most of the members of 2nd cavalry do n't know how to ride a horse . 
   not really , the us did n't occupy cuba and built their base there , they signed an agreement . 
  the fact that fidel did n't like it , does n't make it the us 's problem . 
  in all fairness , that agreement was signed under cuban duress after the us attacked spanish possessions in 1898 . 
  it 'd violate treaties to create a new agreement like that today . 
  what the us is doing in cuba is n't comparable to what the ussr did to eastern europe , but it 's also definitely not a welcome guest there -- afaik , this is the only case today in the world where the us maintains soldiers permanently in a country against the opposition of that country 's government . 
  realistically , my guess is that the base will wind up being closed as the us-cuban relationship normalizes , but we 'll see ... 
  you know , that wagon looks pretty heavy . 
  not a lot of power to pull the thing , and yet a lot of it is being lost . 
  i wonder what a modern-day wagon would look like -- if you had to use modern materials science to create a first-rate wagon , what-all you 'd do . 
  `` rich '' might be a stretch . 
  but remember ... they 're also avoiding a lot of luxuries that most other people take for granted , so they spend less . 
  https://www.quora.com/what-is-the-annual-income-of-the-average-household-within-the-amish-community  the average household income of an amish family is $ 24,500 for nonfarmers this goes up to $ 37,200 while farming households average 18,300   the average household has a husband , wife ( who does not work outside the home ) and 8.2 children . 
  there is virtually no unemployment in the amish community and public assistance is shunned . 
  though most amish only attend 8 grades of school , illiteracy is less than 3 % . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/household_income_in_the_united_states  overall , the mean household income in the united states , according to the us census bureau 2014 annual social and economic supplement , was $ 72,641 , or $ 20,702 ( 39.86 % ) higher than the median household income ( $ 51,939 ) . 
  [ 25 ] the amish are not statistically-wealthy by us standards , though their communities are egalitarian and you would n't find , say , homeless or people in desperate need among them either . 
  if society collapsed one day , they 're probably the only people who 'd be surviving ... 
  [ used to be in europe , too ] ( http://amishreligiousfreedom.org/origin.htm ) . 
  just a different set of restrictions and weighting of freedom of religion over there , and there are n't any left there , whereas they 've been expanding over here . 
   the amish , called `` the plain people '' or old order amish , originated in switzerland about 1525 . 
  they came from a division of the mennonites or anabaptists ( re-baptizers ) . 
  they opposed the union of church and state and infant baptism . 
  they baptized people only as adults at about age 18 . 
  adult baptism was a crime in the 16th century . 
  therefore , the amish come from an impressive list of martyrs . 
  they were put in sacks and thrown into rivers in europe . 
  there are no amish left in europe ; the amish were saved from extinction by william penn who granted a haven from religious persecution in america . 
  since early colonial days the amish have lived in the united states preserving their distinctive culture , dress , language and religion in peace and prosperity . 
    a few years ago they were again accused of crimes -- failing to have their children attend school with state certified teachers or failure to send them beyond the eighth grade . 
  until the united states supreme court in the case of * wisconsin v. yoder * ruled in 1972 that it was unconstitutional to force amish into high school . 
  the decision was based on the constitutional legal issues of parental rights and religious freedom . 
  since the amish believe in `` turning the other cheek '' and do not defend themselves , the national committee for amish religious freedom and its attorney william b. 
  ball of harrisburg , pennsylvania , defended them in court . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wisconsin_v._yoder  * wisconsin v. yoder * , 406 u.s. 205 ( 1972 ) , is the case in which the united states supreme court found that amish children could not be placed under compulsory education past 8th grade . 
  the parents ' fundamental right to freedom of religion outweighed the state 's interest in educating its children . 
  the case is often cited as a basis for parents ' right to educate their children outside of traditional private or public schools . 
  the wagon driver is completely disregarding the lanes ... 
   i guess it could imply your old surname had something wrong you had to change it . 
  one friend who had his brother change his surname said something to me like `` what , our name is n't good enough for him ? '', 
  so , yeah , there is cultural impetus on the side of the * status quo * , to the extent that it might be seen like rejecting your family in some way . 
  just saying that the legal barriers are radically different . 
  us -- call up your magazine subcriptions and update your name with them . 
  belgium :  in belgian law , a name is in principle considered fixed for life , but under exceptional circumstances , a person may apply to the ministry of justice for a name change . 
  this requires a royal decree ( french : arr\u00eat\u00e9 royal , dutch : koninklijk besluit ) for last names , but only a ministerial decree for first names . 
  so ... i did n't quite understand why this is such a big deal , since i know people who have changed their name -- if you want a different name , you just go and get it changed , and go get it updated with the organizations that you do business with . 
  apparently , this is an interesting split between [ common-law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_law ) countries ( uk/us/australia / nz/ireland/non-quebec canada ) and much of the rest of the world . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_change ** united states ** :  in the united states , state laws regulate name changes . 
  several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes ( changing the name at will ) . 
    usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason . 
  as of 2009 , 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone , with no paperwork , but a court order may be required for many institutions ( such as banks or government institutions ) to officially accept the change . 
  [ 2 ] ** united kingdom ** :  in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease . 
    in theory anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the united kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish . 
  however , over the past hundred years or so , formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments , companies and organizations have evolved , which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their passport , driving licence , tax and national insurance records , bank and credit cards , etc. , provided that `` documentary evidence '' of a change of name is provided . 
  ** new zealand ** :  from september 1995 , new zealanders can change their name by making a statutory declaration and , if approved , the new name is registered with the births , deaths and marriages section of the department of internal affairs ( identity services ) . 
  ** canada ** [ except quebec , which is french and uses civil law -- nounhud ] :  to change a name , a name change application must be submitted to either the ministry of government services , court of justice or registrar of civil status . 
  a document such as a birth certificate must be submitted . 
  a statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious . 
  ** australia ** :  individuals may legally change their names so long as they are not doing so for criminal purposes , such as committing fraud . 
    institutions such as banks , the passport office and transport authorities require proof of identity , so people who change their names need to have proof of the change . 
    adults ( people more than 18 years old ) may register a change of name only once every 12 months unless a magistrate 's court approves the change because of exceptional circumstances . 
  ** other countries ** :  in general , unlike in common law countries , names can not be changed at will in civil law jurisdictions . 
  usually , a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted , though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdicions over the last years . 
  one particular exception was listed in europe , ** norway ** :  although it has always been relatively easy to change ones legal names in norway , it used to require some kind of government approval ... nowadays it is as easy as in common-law countries , as you just write down the names you want ( providing that the surname you choose is not in use , or is used by more than 200 persons ) . 
  you still have to submit your new names to the local authorities for reasons of election rosters and census counts but there is no application process anymore . 
  `` johnson '' is the [ second-most-common last name in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_most_common_surnames_in_north_america ) , and `` richard '' ( aka `` dick '' ) is the [ seventh-most-common male first name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_most_popular_given_names#male_names_2 ) . 
  i come to / r/europe and it 's quoting official ec statements from a brussels press conference that is so-steeped in american pop culture references that i do n't have enough american pop culture knowledge to figure out what they 're saying . 
  this is ... awkward . 
   yeah but they also become brittle as fuck here in 50c degree desert . 
  metal does n't get brittle when it 's hot out . 
  though i think that it 's pretty reasonable to point out that desert has its own problems for agriculture . 
  my point is that even construction workers are mostly machinery operators today . 
  they mostly are n't there for muscle power . 
  how many people on a construction site do you see actually physically hauling things ? 
  you 've got a guy with a crane , another guy guiding him , a guy operating a backhoe , another guy driving a truck that he 's loading ... 
  if one 's upset that turkey has voted for someone who will move away from democracy and you 're unhappy about being in a union with turkey , forcibly putting turkey into union and then letting it vote on what it wants does n't seem too productive . 
   does n't anyone think anymore that some things are better left unsaid ? 
  i think that being obliged to bring up someone else 's kid is a pretty heavy cost .
