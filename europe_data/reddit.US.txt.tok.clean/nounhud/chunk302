  i do n't even care about terms being political . 
  `` pro-life '' and `` pro-choice '' are both political terms , and i 'm fine using both . 
  i care because using `` poverty '' as a metric of inequality is damned misleading and intended to be such , and i have a very low regard for people who intentionally mislead . 
  if an advocate wants to advocate for a more-equal society , that is completely reasonable to have as a goal . 
  i might agree with them , i might not agree with them , but as long as they 're presenting their point honestly and saying `` we need a more-equal society '' , we can talk about it . 
  i am not a fan of definitions of poverty where if suddenly half of your population makes 200 % more in real terms , your society has become poorer . 
  less-egalitarian , perhaps .

  i think that if someone said `` market liberal '' , i 'd get the same idea . 
  the cato institute ( market liberal ) and some other similar sources have tried to shift usage to the unambiguous `` classical liberal '' , without a lot of luck . 
  oh , and just to make things even more-interesting , then there 's `` neoliberalism '' , which tends to mean something akin to `` classical liberalism '' ( i.e. 
  not us-style liberalism ) but has a negative connotation . 
  i do n't know whether that came from the us or europe . 
  there 's also been a attempt on the center-left in the us that 's met with some limited success to shift the standard term for the center-left from `` liberal '' to `` progressive '' . 
  the center-right has n't switched at all , but some people on the center-left have , so you can sometimes identify someone 's political persuasion in the us quickly by seeing whether they use `` liberal '' or `` progressive '' to refer to the `` center-left '' -- if the latter , they 're probably center-left themselves . 
  i 've run into a couple of left-anarchists from europe who get really pissed off if you use `` libertarian '' in the right-libertarian sense . 
  let 's go dig up some left-anarchist material : https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-150-years-of-libertarian  this year , 2008 , marks the 150th anniversary of the use of the word `` libertarian '' by anarchists ... unfortunately , in the united states the term `` libertarian '' has become , since the 1970s , associated with the right-wing , i.e. , supporters of `` free-market '' capitalism ... the first anarchist journal to use the term `` libertarian '' was la libertaire , journal du mouvement social . 
  somewhat ironically , given recent developments in america , it was published in new york between 1858 and 1861 by french communist-anarchist joseph d\u00e9jacque . 
  the next recorded use of the term was in europe , when `` libertarian communism '' was used at a french regional anarchist congress at le havre ( 16 -- 22 november , 1880 ) . 
  january the following year saw a french manifesto issued on `` libertarian or anarchist communism . '' finally , 1895 saw leading anarchists s\u00e9bastien faure and louise michel publish la libertaire in france . 
  [ max nettlau , a short history of anarchism , pp . 
  75 -- 6 , p. 145 and p. 162 ] https://archive.org/details/noamchomskyontheoriginalmeaningoflibertarian  `` remember that the united states is out of the world on this type of thing . 
  britain is to a limited extent , but the united states is on mars . 
  so here , the term ` libertarian ' means the opposite of what it always meant in history . 
  ` libertarian ' throughout european history meant ` socialist-anarchist ... so ` libertarian ' in europe always meant ` socialist . ', 
  here , it means ultra-ayn rand or cato institute or something like that . 
  but that 's a special us usage having to do with the -- there are a lot of things special here . '', 
  it 's possible that at this point , the us use of `` libertarian '' has swamped the original european use . 
  in the us , [ liberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberalism ) started being [ appropriated by big-government types in the 1930s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_liberalism_in_the_united_states ) , and so some of the classical liberals , irate that the left had edged in on their term , headed out to take up `` libertarianism '' as * their * new flag for a right-wing , small-government ideal , which of course pissed off the left-libertarians who had been using * that * word . 
  the net result was the us and europe tending to have each word meaning the opposite direction from center . 
  the us center also tends to be right of europe 's center , which complicates this , and some us usage is floating back as well . 
  * the economist * tends to consistently use `` liberal '' in the european sense , but ... well , that 's politics for you . 
  because you said that he broke the law -- my point is that he did not break the law . 
   oh dear - straight to `` no true scotsman '' . 
  no -- there 's no assertion of `` no true scotsman '' here . 
   trolls are part of the marketplace of ideas . 
  they 're not part of it that you want to look at , because they do n't fit your happy belief that the marketplace produces truth . 
  i did n't say that the marketplace produces truth . 
  i said that it `` tends to produce truth '' . 
  it 's the same as saying that , oh , a market economy is useful because it tends to produce reasonably efficient outcomes -- it does n't need to universally be optimal , and showing that it is n't is not a counterexample . 
   an example from a man who is making himself a dictator , in a country whose history of democracy is very patchy . 
  yes , restricting speech can indeed be a tool to move a democracy towards dictatorship . 
  reposting [ an earlier comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5x9f86/european_parliament_in_sexism_storm_as_lawmaker/degfv5w/ ) : [ consolidated version of the treaty on the functioning of the european union : protocol ( no 7 ) on the privileges and immunities of the european union : chapter iii : article 8 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12012e/pro/07 ) :  members of the european parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry , detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties . 
  he 's free of legal restrictions as to his speech in his role as a legislator . 
   that 's not evidence at all for the assertion , though . 
  some people engage in debate for the pleasure of debate , with no intention of changing their ideas . 
  others `` engage in debate '' to shock , annoy , upset , etc. 
  that 's not a counter-argument -- there 's no expectation that people not troll , nor need for that to tend toward truth . 
   you 've had to use the example of an autocracy to illustrate it , rather than a democratic government , even though democratic governments do have those powers . 
  i chose it because it was an ongoing and particularly-egregious example . 
  there have certainly been past examples of democratic governments restricting speech in a way that sought to discourage or affect their own removal . 
  an example close-to-europe might be turkey 's eight-year-old prohibition of [ insulting turkishness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_301_%28turkish_penal_code%29 ) . 
   unless the restrictions were some kind of bizarre and repeated accidents , they 're clearly part of the intention that the right to free speech enshrined in law is not absolute . 
  hmm . 
  all right , if i can rephrase what you 're saying as `` free speech as implemented has not been absolute '' , i wo n't object .
