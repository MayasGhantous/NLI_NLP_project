  it 's just a statement of faith . 
  i disagree -- it 's why we engage in discussion at * all * on a day-to-day basis , why debates exist , and so forth . 
  all rely on the prospect that people will , in general , tend towards truth . 
   if your belief that truth tends to prevail is correct , the government that gets elected should reflect that . 
  i said that it tends to prevail via discussion . 
  if a government can ban speech that it does not like , then you run a risk of having a positive feedback loop where a government gets into power that does not like some idea , restricts discussion of it , and tends to shift the debate further away . 
  if i can go to jail for criticizing , say , kim jong il , it makes it difficult for me to encourage people to oppose him . 
   freedom of expression was not intended as an absolute right - it is limited in many ways . 
  i do n't think that there 's any more basis for saying this for saying that `` freedom of expression was intended to be an absolute right '' -- * that * is simply an assertion . 
  all right , the ruling coalition in the legislature , if you want it put that way . 
  let 's say that fn winds up in control . 
  i do n't believe that he broke any law . 
  ... are you familiar with rense.com ? 
  like , you ever [ looked at its homepage ] ( http://www.rense.com/ ) ? 
  it 's really not what i 'd want to be using a source ... 
   you do n't simply disagree , you call everything that truthfully supports him communism - which is usual nazis tactics , seriously . 
  that asshat hitler stole our schtick . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_red_scare  duration : 1917 -- 1921 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler#entry_into_politics  hitler was discharged from the army on 31 march 1920 and began working full-time for the nsdap . 
  [ 82 ] the party headquarters was in munich , a hotbed of anti-government german nationalists determined to crush marxism and undermine the weimar republic . 
  [ 83 ] in february 1921 -- already highly effective at speaking to large audiences -- he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000 . 
  because of your initial post 's objection :  why is there a retard in the eu parliament ? 
   what makes you assume that ? 
  well , that he was giving a speech on the floor . 
   i am simply asking for his right to allocated time be reduced since he expressed a belief that goes against the laws of european countries . 
  surely if anyone is to challenge the laws of europe , it should be a legislator ? 
  it would seem very strange to me to try to prevent a legislator from criticizing laws in place . 
   i do not think you want your money to pay for texan schools that preach creationism . 
  well , i do n't live in texas , but if texas wants to blow their federal educational subsidy on teaching creationism , my take is that it 's up to them . 
  hmm . 
  so extremists tend to vote in less-intelligent people ? 
  question : france does not have compulsory voting , as i understand it . 
  would you support compelling french voters to vote ? 
  all right , but what i was really getting at was the root of * that * . 
  since the people who have the power to set the laws are the government in power , that 's effectively entrusting the government that makes it into power . 
  i seem to vaguely-recall that you lean left . 
  if a right-wing party were to form a government and start work in eliminating the promotion of the sort of values in the ep that it considered objectionable or damaging to society , would you welcome those prohibitions ? 
  if , say , le pen somehow wound up controlling france , do you believe that she would make a good moral guide for france , someone who should be determining who should be permitted to promote their ideas and who not ? 
  if you permit free speech , you rely upon the mechanism that in the marketplace of ideas , truth tends to prevail . 
  it seems to me that that works reasonably well . 
  if you disallow that , you have to have some mechanism for determining which ideas are goodthink and which ideas are badthink . 
  presumably your government determines that . 
  my own view is that the government currently in power is not a very reliable mechanism for coming up with what the list of `` correct '' ideas to hold are . 
  [ left-libertarianism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left-libertarianism ) [ right-libertarianism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right-libertarianism ) in the us today , an unadorned `` libertarianism '' tends to refer to right-libertarianism ( which may well be quite left on social values , but is right fiscally ) . 
  my understanding is that historically in europe , an unadorned `` libertarianism '' tended to refer to left-libertarianism . 
   we have banned holocaust denial . 
  not for meps on the floor of the ep : [ consolidated version of the treaty on the functioning of the european union : protocol ( no 7 ) on the privileges and immunities of the european union : chapter iii : article 8 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12012e/pro/07 ) :  members of the european parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry , detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties . 
   honestly this type of speech should be blocked by whomever was controlling the mic . 
  so what does your criteria for acceptable speech derive from ? 
  i am sure that there are things that you 'd support that others would find objectionable . 
  should the president of the european parliament simply block things that he finds objectionable or thinks is an `` idiotic belief '' ? 
   why is there a retard in the eu parliament ? 
  what 's the basis for believing that higher voter turnout in poland would make for more-intelligent legislators ? 
  your take is that people who favor intelligent legislators are uninterested in voting ? 
  are your values so fragile that speech critical of them might shatter them ? 
  do they rest on such a weak foundation that they can not be defended ? 
   honestly this type of speech should be blocked by whomever was controlling the mic . 
  disagree . 
  i 'm assuming that he was n't just randomly rambling , and that this related to some sort of eu initiative on mandating equal pay for different genders . 
  that 's relevant to policy . 
  further , if there 's a single form of speech that is the most-highly-protected , it 's the speech of legislators . 
  france , as well as at least a number of other countries , provides immunity from slander laws to their legislators in the legislature . 
  they are n't , after all , there to say things that you find agreeable . 
  if a legislator is speaking on something , one can assume and hope that it is something worth talking about , something that people disagree on , and if that 's the case , some people will find the ideas objectionable . 
  define `` unintelligent '' . 
  there are some things that men are mentally better at ( 3d mental rotation ) , and some things that women are mentally better at ( arithmetic ) . 
  it 's not at all clear to me that the difference is substantial-enough to be a concern . 
  in terms of pay , i 'd think that things like pregnancy would be a more-significant concern than something relatively-minor like that . 
   small , weak how many men or women are doing manual labor ? 
  i mean , if i see someone digging a ditch these days , they 're using a backhoe , not a shovel . 
   any country could arbitrarily reject all visas for americans and then use that to justify no vwp for americans . 
  sure , if they also used an accept/reject rate . 
  but there 's no reason for the us to arbitrarily reject all visas . 
  the us has every interest in making the accept/reject criteria as accurately reflect an accurate estimate of potential issues as possible . 
  not in a diplomatic sense . 
   spheres of influence : the great powers partition europe , from munich to yalta < checks amazon  that book is covering a time period before nato existed . 
  i do n't believe that the us ever guaranteed that it would extend visa waivers to all eu members . 
  it * does * apply the same criteria to all eu members -- some do not currently pass . 
   and turn it into a casus belli . 
  that 's a term with a very specific meaning , and this is n't that . 
  nato allies are heavily pressured to buy us military equipment . 
  source , please . 
   now you can put woman in war because feminist told you must . 
  you mean me ? 
  no , that 's not why i think that it 's a good idea . 
  i think that it 's a good idea because i want people with the vote to also have exposure to potentially needing to go to war ( or have had to deal with that risk in the past ) . 
  i also would say that that it magnifies military capabilities . 
  in the past , the us chose to use women in war industry , which provided a significant edge in world war ii : http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm  furthermore , the united states was more than willing to utilize american women in the war effort : a tremendous advantage for us , and a concept which the axis powers seem not to have grasped until very late in the conflict . 
  the net effect of all these factors meant that even in the depths of the depression , american war-making potential was still around seven times larger than japan 's , and had the ` slack ' been taken out in 1939 , it was closer to nine or ten times as great !, 
  using women in the military directly is also an option ( which the us did not use , but the ussr did ) ; to specifically avoid doing so is to limit one 's country 's military potential . 
   statistically if you take random 100 woman and random 100 men , woman will never be good as men in combat . 
  possibly true but not particularly significant , as i [ discussed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5x4evc/new_finnish_record_1100_women_apply_for_military/defybvu/ ) in my other comment . 
  in all fairness , my understanding ( and i 'll concede that i 'm a couple of decades out-of-date here ) is that israel has a different set of concerns from that of sweden . 
  israel is worried about internal security . 
  what israel 's doing is mandating that * all * genders serve , but [ excusing arab israelis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conscription_in_israel ) ( or some roughly-equivalent criteria , you could dig up the specifics ) from serving . 
  the net result is that if there 's a replay of [ the arab revolt in the 1930s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%e2%80%9339_arab_revolt_in_palestine ) , jews will statistically be more-frequently militarily-trained and non-jews not . 
  that would place jewish israelis in a stronger position to win any civil war in israel . 
  this has over time been coordinated with other israeli policy efforts to modify demographics in israel ; encouraging jewish immigration and looking into reducing non-jewish birthrates . 
  a civil war does n't necessarily have well-defined battle lines , and thus one does n't really necessarily have the option of keeping women well behind them anyway . 
  any conflict like that be a [ total war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/total_war ) -- jewish israelis would be facing at best ethnic cleansing in the result of a loss , possibly genocide . 
  at that point , it 's not a matter of whether women have their lives on the line , but how effectively they can act to defend those lives .
