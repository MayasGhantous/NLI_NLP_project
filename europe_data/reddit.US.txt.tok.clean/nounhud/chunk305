  but all four are forms of rights . 
  no , that 's not my point -- it 's not even something that would normally have trump or the legislature take action . 
  there 's a pre-existing customs rule that countries that expect visa waivers to the us must in turn extend visa waivers . 
  if france and germany cancel visa waivers for us citizens to france and germany , then the us will also terminate visa waivers for french and german citizens to the us . 
  it wo n't be trump or requiring some sort of vindictive action , but just automatic from us customs . 
  i do n't see why it would be done to send a message -- it 's simply applying the same level of expectations to eu members that exist for all other countries in the world . 
  we do n't break those rules for mexico or anyone else with a unique geographic position , and i do n't see a reason to do so for eu members . 
   there are physical considerations nonetheless . 
  agreed . 
  i [ expand on it more over here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5x4evc/new_finnish_record_1100_women_apply_for_military/defybvu/ ) . 
  as regards the `` same physical standards '' bit ... i 'm not entirely-thrilled with the simply `` put women in the same position , but reduce the requirements by some percent '' approach , which is what the us military has done , but i do think that it is reasonable to dedicate some degree of resources to compensating for differences -- the existing military has tended to be tuned for men . 
  in my eyes , the greater concern is whether vaguely comparable * risk * exists -- i would expect services to be assigned such that wounding and death ratios can be expected to be comparable , such that the costs of war are spread somewhat-equally . 
  for example , in world war ii , the us bomber and submarine services were particularly dangerous , and neither had physical strength being as critical as the infantry . 
  i 'd have no problem with women avoiding front-line infantry combat were they to in turn serve disproportionately a greater percentage on submarines and aircraft . 
  hell , lower female body weight and oxygen use might be advantageous in those roles . 
  i 'd actually disagree -- i think that there are real differences . 
  unlike / u/hrvatski _ pastuh , i do n't see these as fundamental . 
  the major concerns that i 've heard that i 'd agree with : ** women are not as strong as men are . 
  ** * this limits how much gear can be carried by infantry . 
  that 's a real , serious limitation but i 'm not at all convinced that it 's a fundamental one . 
  if you need to have female squads and send them on shorter patrols or have female members carrying lighter weapons , that 's doable . 
  maybe it means that it makes more sense to throw r&d dollars at making gear lighter -- for example , you make an extremely light machine gun with impractically-high recoil , but * require * that it be fired from a bipod to have viable recoil . 
  use [ muzzle brakes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muzzle_brake ) that expend more power on compensating for recoil than on propelling the projectile . 
  develop [ autonomous pack robots ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr-wbpypsfe ) -- something that the us has been throwing a lot of military r&d money at -- that can move with an infantry squad to offset limitations on carrying load . 
  have supplies dropped in via drone or another low-risk air-delivery method rather than packed in . 
  put effort into [ powered exoskeletons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berkeley_lower_extremity_exoskeleton ) . 
  change doctrine to make more use of more-frequent supply caches . 
  * this limits ability of women to drag injured squadmates , especially men . 
  this can be offset by having women serve together ( hell , we could have `` weight classes '' of people serving together , which we do n't do for men today ) . 
  * this limits ability of women to move equipment or vehicles -- setting up sandbags , pulling a vehicle out of mud , etc. 
  reduce sandbag size , provide [ hydraulic assistive tools ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hydraulic_rescue_tools ) to military units . 
  ** women do not have the running speed/endurance that men do ** women have hips that are spread more-widely apart than men do . 
  that 's to let a human baby have a larger skull size still make it out the birth canal , and permits humans to be smarter than they otherwise would ... but it 's less-efficient than having the legs as directly under the center-of-mass as possible . 
  that makes the feminine ( and attractive to guys ) `` swaying hips when walking '' difference in male and female gait -- having to lift weight that otherwise would n't need to be lifted . 
  first , the difference is n't necessarily large enough to change the game that much . 
  the [ world record 10k run time for women is about 11 % longer than that for men ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_metres ) . 
  that does count for something , but it 's not clear to me how often a 11 % difference in movement time is vital . 
  for some combat positions , this is n't a big deal . 
  if you 're [ light infantry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/light_infantry#contemporary_use ) , i 'd guess that it 's a bigger deal than for [ mechanized infantry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mechanized_infantry ) or armor units . 
  better vehicles could permit vehicle use in areas where they are n't currently an option . 
  ** women are more-subject to rape in war ** rules tend to break down in war . 
  you have a lot of scared , hormonally-charged-up people with weapons , not a lot of documentation as to what 's going on , no real rules other than those that people establish via force , and a very good excuse to potentially kill people afterwards to eliminate witnesses . 
  rape has long been associated with war . 
  soldiers get captured , and if the enemy soldiers are women , they 're more-subject to rape than men would be . 
  * prisoners of war get raped . 
  that 's a real concern . 
  i will say that i think that if you 're in a position of trying to kill or be killed , that rape kind of fades in significance a fair bit , but it is an added concern . 
  that being said , if you 're in a truly serious fight for survival ... well , maybe germany not putting women into operation barbarossa meant that german pows on the eastern front would n't have been raped , but when the ussr moved through germany later ... < shrug  * further , rape happens between fellow soldiers . 
  [ `` a 2011 report found that women in the u.s. military are more likely to be raped by fellow soldiers than they are to be killed in combat . '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_assault_in_the_united_states_military ) . 
  while that 's a concern , my take is that this is not a fundamental issue -- this is something that can be addressed via discipline . 
  there are a * lot * of ugly things that come up in war , like [ fragging ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fragging ) , and we do n't say `` humans just ca n't be soldiers '' . 
  we have hard penalties for them and do work on human factors . 
  * the military has a very rigid command hierarchy . 
  it 's created to be rigid so that people can be ordered to do things that risk resulting in their deaths -- it does not permit for a lot of slack . 
  one issue might be a superior officer ordering someone to have sex or similar . 
  i think that this can be addressed via discipline again , and establishing harsh penalties . 
  ** women have less ability to do 3d visualization than men do ** * there are documented mental differences between women and men ( not , i 'd add , all favorable to men ) . 
  one of these is that men are better-able to form 3d scenes and mentally move through them . 
  that might be useful ... but i do n't see this as a fundamental concern . 
  we do n't normally restrict women from entering many jobs where it might be advantageous to mentally-model something , and i do n't see why this would be uniquely-applicable to the military . 
  ** women may get pregnant ** * yeah , but women might get pregnant in any job . 
  it 's a health concern . 
  deal with it the same way you would in any physically-demanding job -- we do n't need a blanket ban on women there . 
  if women become pregnant to avoid deployment , then you can look into ways to deal with that -- men have shot themselves in the foot before , and this is n't unique to women . 
  ** relationships may form ** * women and men tend to form romantic relationships more than men and men or women and women . 
  having those relationships might degrade performance in combat -- for example , being ordered to do something that might result in someone else dying . 
  that 's been cited before as a concern . 
  i 'm not sold that this is a fundamental concern . 
  certainly , worst case , you could have gender-segregated units . 
  i do think that the potential to be obliged to serve in the military in time of war is important . 
  many societies have tied it to the vote -- if you can vote for war , you also must be someone who has before or is now subject to being compelled to fight in the war , putting your life on the line . 
  i think that there are some good reasons for that policy -- i have no problem saying that women 's suffrage should be accompanied by an expectation of potentially being compelled to serve in the military . 
  i 'm not going to say that women are simply men without the dangly bits . 
  yeah , there are differences , and yeah , you may need to compensate for some . 
  but i 'm definitely not willing to say that women ca n't be effective in the military . 
  yup . 
  most people illegally-present in the us are visa overstays , not border jumpers . 
  this is exacerbated by the fact that once you 're in the us , we have limited tracking . 
  people can change their name at will ( literally -- do n't even need to fill out paperwork ) , there 's no standard federal id , there 's no mandatory id or requirement to carry id , there 's no country-wide biometric database , etc. 
  combining that with having a lot of wealth floating around makes the us an appealing place to try to work under-the-table . 
  edit : oh , right , and the us is * jus soli * , so if someone is present illegally and has a kid here , they 'll get citizenship in the us -- also makes it more-appealing than for working illegally in europe . 
   interesting , you seem to know a lot about the subject . 
  it 's been a hot topic on europe-us relations for a while . 
  this is n't our first go-round on / r/europe arguing about the specifics ... 
   this is about schengen wide visa , not country specific ones . 
  no , because bugaria , croatia , cyprus , and romania are not in schengen . 
  only poland has been allowed into schengen , and the eu is asking for visa waivers to the us for all of the above countries . 
   there 's no way this is about us . 
  my guess is that this vote will not pass , but the votes will be coordinated to come fairly-close , which lets a lot of countries present themselves as supporting it , but without having to actually make any policy change . 
  ergo , it 's about political cohesiveness in the eu . 
   this is probably eu 's plan to get more bulgarians to emigrate to the us instead of western europe . 
  * national leadership in the eu leadership does n't want to lose people . 
  human capital is the bottleneck on wealth these days . 
  the people who bitch about immigration are workers in fields who are having to compete with those new workers . 
  france , germany , and so forth would n't have had bulgaria join the eu if they did n't want bulgarians working in the eu . 
  the uk 's leadership was very probably fine with the level of immigration to the uk -- they just fucked up in their estimation of public upset over it and let a referendum out with fantastically unlucky timing , right as the refugee crisis blew up . 
  * while visa waivers * do * affect emigration to * jus soli * countries via people illegally overstaying the allowed period and then having kids on the soil , they 're a slow and shitty way to do it , and require a ton of people to break the law . 
  the eu would be in a much stronger position if it actually wanted to encourage emigration from the eu to the us if it were to negotiate for some sort of bidirectional emigration deal ( or , hell , work visa arrangement ) . 
   im sick and tired of americans who does n't know what scehngen and eu border is . 
  actually , it 's not along schengen .
