  while some of our technological predictions were n't bad ( the growth of wireless communication and automation ) , some were quite wrong ( the universal acceptance of civilian flying vehicles and/or general adoption of space travel ) . 
  in the sense that a country tries something and if it works well , the same thing tends to spread elsewhere , then there is something of a path . 
  but it 's not simply a single straight path . 
  in some ways , there has been a tendency to follow a few -- my guess is because the wealthiest countries adopted things that were suited to their environment , and as other countries became wealthier by emulating the former countries , they also picked up other things . 
  but as the world 's wealth spreads out , i fully expect changes to come from a broader range of countries . 
  furthermore , it 's easy to forget about all the dead ends and bad predictions that showed up in the past . 
  i do n't much like the idea of `` progress '' in the sense that it hints at some sort of predictable forward path that all countries will tend to inevitably tread . 
  your charms have no power here , bene gessert witch !, 
  why is that ? 
   a two-speed eu will be the end of the eu . 
  someone [ failed to inform the eu ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/supranational_european_bodies-en.png ) . 
   never before has the head of the european commission so openly considered returning parts of the acquis to the member states and this is now on the table . 
  you do n't think that presenting that was n't a rhetorical device to frame the debate in favor of further integration ? 
  i mean , that seems sensible if you 're advocating for integration . 
   practically hoping for some miracle that sees them become an island in the middle of the atlantic well , if you can find a job in the uk in the next month or so ... 
   a federation can not happen in the short or medium term ; why not ? 
  the us did n't federalize on any grounds other than ones that already exist in the eu . 
  delegates from all the member states in the us who were supposed to fix minor flaws in the confederation 's structure said `` the hell with it , this confederation thing is n't working '' , and just wrote up a federalization and sent it back for the member state legislatures to ratify . 
  you do n't even need all eu members to sign on -- could work with simply a subset . 
   enforce outer borders the eu does not have authority over the outer borders of eu members . 
  it can coordinate between members , but not set immigration policy eu-wide . 
   solve the euro crisis you 're talking about persistent unemployment in , say , greece because of greece and germany being on the same currency ? 
  that 's an ez issue , not an eu issue . 
  federalization and fiscal transfers would be one way of addressing this . 
  increased labor mobility via letting people simply move even without working somewhere -- also something that would likely be attached to federalization -- would also potentially address it . 
   could that even feasibly happen ? 
  politically ? 
  you tell me . 
  aside from that , sure . 
  how is being an investment banker relevant to whether he is an outsider or not ? 
   we 're living in a visual age , looks and charm absolutely have an impact on voter confidence , and there 's very little we can do about that . 
  you 'd think that , but the same could have been said about musicians once video mass media showed up ... but then , later , along came [ hatsune miku ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatsune_miku ) as well as [ * gorillaz * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorillaz ) . 
   yet people like her because she is a tough old bird in the british tradition ( boudica , elizabeth i , margaret thatcher etc ) . 
  i 'm not convinced that the boudica electorate is a significant factor ... 
   i think neoliberalism is not a well defined term as used in popular speech at all . 
  it seems to be something that is used as a stand-in for `` economic policy i disagree with '' . 
  kind of like `` fascism '' when talking about politics . 
  the german thing was large and recent and germany intends to maintain close association with most of those countries . 
  nobody particularly relevant is running around being upset about the dutch colonizing new york city . 
   it really is n't a popular subject in * any * country that did it i dunno , for the british it was kind of `` world history '' . 
  trump was n't guaranteed a win in the republican primary , though . 
  eh , i think that more upset came from the fact that there was some suspicion that bush had n't won the electoral college either . 
  i believe that she 's actually narrowing the second-round gap . 
  a couple of months ago , iirc she had a 30 % margin to make up with the nearest second-round competitor -- this shows 20 % with fillon and 26 % with macron . 
  well , technically the people who were doing the [ soviet population transfers ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) probably are retired or dead , and the people making the immigration calls now are a new set of people . 
   russia ca n't make everyone born in the other soviet republics their citizens . 
  i dunno , they seem pretty gung ho on it in crimea . 
   after all , russia to some degree is considered as the successor of the ussr . 
  i 'm not sure that being a successor state has legal weight in terms of determining whether a citizen should wind up . 
  if you * did * have a split , it would mean that the successor state would/must take in all the people presently living in the non-successor state . 
  that seems dubious . 
  i can totally understand him being treated as a special case based on him not having anywhere to go , but not based on the fact that russia became the successor state . 
   it you take exception to a religion that encourages the murder of apostates , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apostasy  the torah states :   if thy brother , the son of thy mother , or thy son , or thy daughter , or the wife of thy bosom , or thy friend , which [ is ] as thine own soul , entice thee secretly , saying , let us go and serve other gods , which thou hast not known , thou , nor thy fathers ; [ namely ] , of the gods of the people which [ are ] round about you , nigh unto thee , or far off from thee , from the [ one ] end of the earth even unto the [ other ] end of the earth ; thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him : but thou shalt surely kill him ; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people . 
  and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god , which brought thee out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage . 
    -- deuteronomy 13:6 -- 10 [ 93 ] of course , in this day and age , your typical modernized jew is n't off killing apostates . 
  he subscribes to some liberal interpretation that lets him ignore this . 
  but ... the same is also true of your typical modernized muslim . 
   - ** close all mosques and islamic schools , ban the koran ** [ constitution of the netherlands ] ( http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/nl00000_.html ) . 
  chapter 1 , fundamental rights . 
  article 1 , equality :  all persons in the netherlands are treated equally in equal circumstances . 
  discrimination on the grounds of religion , belief , political opinion , race , or sex or on any other grounds whatsoever is not permitted . 
  article 6 , religion , belief :  everyone has the right to manifest freely his religion or belief , either individually or in community with others , without prejudice to his responsibility under the law . 
  article 23 , education , section 2 :  all persons are free to provide education , without prejudice to the authorities ' right of supervision and , with regard to forms of education designated by law , its right to examine the competence and moral integrity of teachers , to be regulated by act of parliament . 
  how exactly is pvv planning to avoid colliding with that ? 
   for a nazi , which let 's be real , is what you are calling him , he 's awfully fond of jews . 
  [ maybe hitler was n't a nazi because he was a little too chummy with jews ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_maurice ) :  even though maurice had been a party member since 1919 , taken part in the abortive beer hall putsch , for which he was awarded the prestigious blood order , and been a bodyguard for hitler , himmler considered him to be a serious security risk given his `` jewish ancestry '' . 
  [ 2 ] [ 13 ] himmler recommended that maurice be expelled from the ss , along with other members of his family . 
  to himmler 's annoyance , hitler stood by his old friend . 
  [ 11 ] in a secret letter written on 31 august 1935 , hitler compelled himmler to make an exception for maurice and his brothers , who were informally declared `` honorary aryans '' and allowed to stay in the ss . 
   that is maintained by a highly skilled individual < look of doubt , 
  i mean , hitler did n't seem that limited and he did n't screw around with hair dye and contacts . 
   more like the other way around lol . 
  in the us liberal is basically socialist that 's actually not using * socialist * correctly either -- a socialist wants public rather than private ownership of industry . 
  most people who use the term `` socialism '' for anything center-left usually want `` social democrat '' -- something that 's fine with capitalism , just wants to redistribute some of the wealth . 
  there is no serious socialist party in the us , and i think that generally-speaking , the democratic party would be on par with most of what europe would consider a liberal party -- but simply because of the difference in where the center is . 
  violent material is protected free speech under the first amendment . 
  some forms of nudity are not due to the obscenity limitation . 
  god damn , it 's less * muy picante * and more * muy caliente * . 
  :-) the burns just keep on coming !, 
  ah , but they 're * big * sheds !, 
   more people in canada have ~ ~ tried to have sex in a canoe ~ ~ had sex in a canoe than :, 
  though that 's not incompatible with having identities for portions of the whole : take belgium or the uk as examples where there are strong identities for portions of the state . 
  work in the us is so awesome that we do n't want to be stuck away from it for so long !, 
   ours are even better pound for pound . 
  you just * had * to go there , did n't you ? 
  you can have an identity without being a state !, 
   murica 's one looks more fun . 
  and probably is more fun . 
  subscribe to / r/yurop , which is the closest analog to / r/murica . 
  ah , but the indecent ones ... rawr . 
  that 's a specifically-british symbol , right , rather than a european one ? 
  i mean , it 's already got the british flag up . 
  what you want is something like the bull that europe uses . 
  [ think something more like this ] ( https://imgur.com/a/xgg6b ) . 
  seriously , if you change the header again -- not that i see why there 'd ever be a reason to -- you should offer this one to / r/yurop .

  https://canoemuseum.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/bringing-the-canoes-to-life-joy-tub-canoes-for-courting/  in a more recent survey , completed by canada.com , 8 % of canadians admitted to having sex while in a canoe . 
  canadian non-fiction writer pierre burton has been quoted saying `` a canadian is someone who knows how to have sex in a canoe '' . 
  this insightful quote then begs the question of you dear reader , `` are you a ` real ' canadian '' ?
