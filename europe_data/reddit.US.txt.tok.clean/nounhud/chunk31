  it is prized for the female crab roe , which ripen in the ninth lunar month and the males in the tenth . 
  [ 14 ] the crab meat is believed by the chinese to have a `` cooling '' ( yin ) effect on the body . 
    chinese spend hundreds of yuan just to taste a small crab from yangcheng lake which are considered a delicacy . 
  the crabs cost 680 -- 700 yuan , or roughly us$ 105 , per kilogram . 
  [ 15 ] [ wikipedia : alaskan king crab fishing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alaskan_king_crab_fishing#types_of_commercially_valuable_king_crab ) :  in alaska , three species of king crab are caught commercially : the red king crab ( paralithodes camtschaticus , found in bristol bay , norton sound , and the kodiak archipelago ) , blue king crab ( paralithodes platypus , st. matthew island and the pribilof islands ) , and golden king crab ( lithodes aequispinus , aleutian islands ) . 
  the red king crab is the most prized of the three for its meat . 
  a fourth variety of king crab , the scarlet king crab ( lithodes couesi ) , is too small and rare to be commercially viable , even though its meat is considered sweet and tasty . 
  [ 5 ] you 've got it rough , germany , with all these scrumptious plagues . 
  pew has polls ( albeit from early 2015 ) [ and the countries with populations opposed to a us-eu free trade agreement were germany and austria ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/ ) . 
  it 's notable how disconnected [ estimated benefits ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/member-states-with-long-standing-us-trade-ties-to-gain-the-most-from-ttip/ ) are from public popularity . 
  the primary estimated beneficiaries include countries like lithuania and ireland , which are indeed quite enthusiastic ... but also germany and austria , which are the most-opposed . 
  malta is , uniquely , estimated to see a * decline * in net economic activity as a result from ttip , and yet has the most-enthusiastic public support . 
  [ rt says that invasive species in europe are typically the brits ' fault ] ( http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_25-1-2016-15-38-49 ) . 
   green-fingered brits could be criminalized under eu laws banning certain non-native invasive species currently growing in the uk . 
  [ snip ]  the new rules were branded `` extremely disappointing '' by caroline everett of anglo aquatic plants . 
  she told rt her company was `` concerned '' about the effects the legislation would have on business . 
  as rt points out , clearly the eu is depressing free british enterprise . 
  obviously , the only remedy is that the eu should be split up !, 
  i do n't think that it 's even possible to integrate american and european lobsters . 
  they 're just different . 
  sweden should work on approaches that would let them coexist , side-by-side , integrated or not . 
  [ apparently , the europeans brought them in ] ( http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_25-1-2016-15-38-49 ) :  `` grey squirrels are not as crazy invaders as we think -- their spread is far more our own fault . '' the research is published in two papers , in the journals biological conservation and diversity and distributions . 
    dr signorile also discovered that one of the worst offenders at spreading grey squirrels was the 11th duke of bedford , herbrand russell . 
  russell was involved in many successful animal conservation projects , but released and gifted many grey squirrels around the uk from his home at woburn park . 
    russell also released populations in regent 's park , likely creating the london epidemic of greys . 
  `` it was a time when we did n't know invasive species could cause so much damage , '' said dr signorile . 
  certainly tastier , at any rate . 
  that 'd be a long con with some pretty oblivious european leaders for quite some decades .

  [ otto von bismarck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_von_bismarck ) is considered to be one of the greatest politicians of his time . 
  i have a difficult time with this being presented as `` morality versus money '' , at least if it is anything new . 
  * before * the conflicts , which opened doors to claim legal access to live and work in europe , how much european effort and money ( or us , mind ) was being spent to improve the living standard of various groups of people in poor countries ? 
  not a lot , yes ? 
  how much legal immigration was permitted from those poor countries ? 
  not a lot , yes ? 
  the people of the well-to-do countries did not want to expend their resources on nigeria or eritrea , and did not want to let the peoples of those countries in . 
  to me , it seems that a position of not wanting to expend resources and take on risk with that standard-of-living improvement would be quite consistent with all those historic positions , which i see here described as following `` european values '' . 
  the only thing that has changed is that a legal loophole has opened that lets people actively claim to stay in europe . 
  unless those `` european values '' that you 're talking about permit for `` out of sight , out of mind '' , i think that about the same values are being held by the west as were always held . 
  send 'em this way . 
  the us has had slightly-below-replacement-rate fertility for some time . 
  it just has n't been as large a gap as some countries in europe , like germany . 
  the equator is remarkably undemocratic . 
  perhaps i misunderstood your post . 
  i thought that you were saying that russians did n't want to subscribe to the eu 's view of rights and values because they were european slavs , which did n't seem to hold up . 
  hmm . 
  poles and slovenians are european slavs too , yes ? 
  not sure how well that dividing line works . 
  it 's a guy thing . 
  you would n't understand .

   european union is not supposed to be christian union . 
  if turkey manages to become a secular , stable democracy vatican city is boned ... 
  and then there 's albania ... 
   for example 74 % of turks agree or strongly agree that wives must always obey their husbands : hmm . 
  switzerland only gave the vote to women in the 1970s . 
  i assume that switzerland did n't migrate into europe at that point . 
   christian union . 
  paraguay , rwanda , colombia , democratic republic of the congo , mexico , panama , lesotho , namibia , and uganda all have a substantially-more-christian population than almost everywhere in europe , but i 'm skeptical that the eu is going to transform into some sort of union involving them in the near future . 
  those countries could obviously exert a larger all-out effort than the countries in afghanistan , but that does n't mean that they are just because they happen to be involved to some degree .

  the dealership is probably going to lose out , if they are exposed to losses on existing inventory . 
   explosives are crap for causing significant personnel damage in large crowd in comparison to firearms . 
  you get those in immediate vicinity of the bomb , and that 's it , as the rest are shielded from the blast and shrapnel by bodies of those in immediate vicinity . 
  mass shootings have far smaller numbers of people killed than do bombings ( and obviously , mass shootings are kind of a one-off -- you 're probably not going to walk out of them easily ) . 
  the deadliest mass shooting ever in us history was virginia tech , with 32 people killed . 
  the deadliest bombing ever in us history was oklahoma city , with 169 killed ( and 675 wounded ) . 
   machine guns i 'm suspicious that these are assault rifles , not machine guns . 
  most of the time when the media says `` machine gun '' , they mean `` assault rifle '' . 
  one user who is banned from this subreddit followed up with me via pm as he had a low opinion of the site that contained the forum that i ran into via google . 
  i 'm including his comment here :  do n't rely on this shitsite . 
  it is a source of ridiculous lies only targeted to `` true believers '' . 
  it is a site designed to retain . 
  they do n't care about their lies being shown for what they are as they are only working with having the true believers something to believe in and not leave the herd . 
  and  to add a topical response then soviet-empire . com is a really really horrible site . 
  if you are looking to learn about anything other than the psychology of delusional lying then you wo n't find it there . 
  i 've no familiarity with the site , but it seemed worth mentioning . 
  for that to work , you have to build a huge barrier which humans can not bypass and at the sight of which they choose to just turn around . 
  no inflatable boats moved over , no cutting the thing happening . 
  ca n't sink the boats they 're coming in on . 
  have to ignore people who get stranded on the line . 
  those things , assuming that they 're what people were linking to over the past few days , are designed to slow boats racing at a target , not to * stop * humans . 
  now , i 'm not saying it 's impossible to keep someone from landing on a beach . 
  i 'm just saying that you need to have somewhere to put people you stop , unless you 're prepared to kill them . 
  thus far , europe is n't really thrilled about the idea of concentration camps , i have n't seen much interest in the pacific solution ( which i like ) , and it remains to be seen whether this merkel-turkey plan is going to work . 
   they are going to all this effort , just for the slight chance that germany might suddenly completely close their whole borders instantaneously when they hear the migrants have entered austria . 
  no , it wo n't be `` when they hear the migrants have entered austria '' . 
  it 's that * at some point * germany is likely to close up , and then all the people in austria at least will be in austria even if austria closes up shop successfully . 
  people further south who have already committed to the trip will probably also try to keep getting in .
