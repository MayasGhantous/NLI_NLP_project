  that should be juncker or tusk or someone along those lines . 
  even if the decision must be made * by * national leaders in the ec , i do not think that they should be the public face of the matter . 
  i occasionally hear people here calling the eu `` dominated by germany `` or `` not democratic '' , and i suspect that some of the issue is that it looks like someone who people in most of the eu are not electing are setting the eu 's direction . 
  the us is the bulk of the military behind nato , and there are a few other countries that represent the bulk of the remainder ( the uk , france , turkey , etc ) but if there 's a nato decision being made , jens stoltenberg or a successor will be the one talking about it . 
  that 's his job . 
  i think that it 's a very bad idea politically to be going over the head of the leader of the organization . 
  * i think that the eu needs to do a better job of understanding the political impact of internal migration . 
  internal migration may not be seen as a negative by those in favor of a strong eu in that it helps mix people in the eu . 
  however , internal migration clearly creates very real and serious political pressures . 
  i do not know whether progressive release freedom-of-movement or whether policies to encourage that industries move to another country rather than workers or whether sunsetting subsidies for native workers should be permitted or whether simply trying to modify society to better sell immigration is the answer . 
  however , the * status quo * is clearly one of the greater concerns for the eu : the uk is leaving in significant part because of this , and the netherlands referendum on ukraine is another . 
  the eu is one of , perhaps the only organization in the world that has tried linking up so many people of such great differences in wealth . 
  it is intentionally creating the conditions for mass migrations , and because it is doing so , it * must * be able to model at least as well as anyone else in the world how much people will accept . 
  it should have people familiar with past large-scale migrations in europe and elsewhere and familiar with the best way to deal with them . 
  brexit could only happen because of a number of miscalculations that people ( cameron and merkel both being notable , but also those who determined accession and those who designed the process of adding a member ) made because they did not understand the degree of political resistance that existed , and gambled incorrectly . 
  i continue to believe that brexit was not necessary , and was not an inevitable consequence of a european union , and i think given the importance of the matter , that the eu should be the best-in-the-world at understanding and making mass migrations acceptable and function smoothly . 
  this is n't over yet -- future accessions will happen and as children learn english ( or , who knows , german or french or spanish or some other * lingua franca * ) , population mobility will shift and there will be more mass movements down the line . 
  [ continued in child ], 
  or just one of each . 
  as far as i can tell , about a quarter of british domestic politics consists of arguing whether london is screwing over the rest of the uk or being screwed over by the rest of the uk . 
   different etiquette this is some meaning of `` etiquette '' with which i am not familiar -- it sounds like it means `` brand '' . 
  in world war ii , when germany 's main naval hobby was trying to starve the uk by cutting off her shipping , germany had [ 1,250 submarines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u-boats_of_germany ) ( granted , not all at one time ) . 
   ok ... but when are they gon na get around to putting that bitch in jail for having russian rubles in her bank account . 
  it 's not illegal to borrow money from a russian bank , even if no french bank is willing to lend to you . 
  it would probably be hard to prove that it was a bribe rather than simply an unwise loan . 
  wow . 
  that 's very different than what we have in the us , and i was completely unaware of it . 
  [ in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_immunity#france ) :  members of the parliament may not be sought , prosecuted , judged or imprisoned for actions that they have accomplished within their duties as parliamentarians ... there is no way to lift this irresponsibility clause , and the parliamentarian himself or herself can not renounce it . 
  the termination of the parliamentary term does not allow the prosecution of former parliamentarians for actions committed within their parliamentarian duties . 
  [ in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_immunity#united_states )  members of the united states congress enjoy a similar parliamentary privilege as members of the british parliament ; that is , they can not be prosecuted for anything they say on the floor of the house or senate . 
  they also enjoy the right to be present in congress : that is , they may be in prison or jail the rest of the time , but they have the right to attend congressional sessions , speak on the floor , vote , etc. 
  these rights are specified in the constitution and have been fairly uncontroversial in u.s. history . 
  courts have consistently interpreted them very narrowly . 
  so in the us , as an explicit guarantee by the us constitution , a legislator may not be prevented from attending the legislature so , for example , the president could not prevent them from going to a critical vote by having them arrested , but that 's about it . 
  you also ca n't go after them for libel or similar for something they say on the floor . 
  but in france , a legislator is literally untouchable for their actions as a legislator -- it sounds like even if it 's known that they committed a crime , like taking bribes to do something , they may not be arrested or prosecuted for it , even after they leave office . 
  that 's ... amazing -- i was unaware that countries offered such broad immunity . 
  based on the wikipedia page , germany and the uk both limit immunity to something more like the us . 
  [ * the economist * : why politicians are granted immunity from prosecution ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/05/economist-explains-21 ) apparently , [ meps have the immunity that their own legislature extends in their home country ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/idan/2014/509981/ipol_ida%282014%29509981_en.pdf ) , and have immunity while traveling to and from legislative meetings -- so basically , the ep is a hybrid of all of the member systems . 
   he advocates pragmatic policies combining social justice with business-friendly policies to build strong innovative industries . 
  the heck with that . 
  i demand impractical solutions from my politicians aimed at creating weak , stagnant industries . 
  well , the mayflower traveled over in 1620 with 102 people . 
  and [ we 've got an average of about 5.5 surviving children per family in the colonies ] ( https://www.asdk12.org/staff/bivins_rick/homework/230028_coloniallife.pdf ) . 
  assume a 25-year generation . 
  102 people times ( a 5.5 child generation raised to ( ( 2017-1620 ) / 25 ) ) generations and you wind up with an population of 58 trillion that the original mayflowerians could have propagated their genes to . 
  that 's well above the current us population of ~ 320 million , so it at least passes the smell test . 
   that 's a pretty stupid assumption though it 's a pretty common one to make , and it 's not one that 's generally held to be unreasonable . 
   and acting in your personal benefit is n't always best for society well , `` always '' is a strong word , but [ it 's got a remarkable tendency to do so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invisible_hand ) . 
   e.g. 
  throwing my garbage in the river is ideal for me but not ideal for people that live further down the river ... sorry , but immigration creates a ton of negative externalities and e.g. 
  new infrastructure cost . 
  if a romanian moves to the uk to get a job at starbucks then he wo n't even be paying enough taxes that go towards new infrastructure and never paid for the existing one . 
  it 's true that any externalities would need to be taken into account . 
  it 's not true that immigrants to the uk , even ones working in unskilled fields , are not supporting the infrastructure that they use -- they produced a net positive , and you can find plenty of material online going well back discussing this . 
  [ one example ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21631076-rather-lot-according-new-piece-research-what-have-immigrants-ever-done-us ) from * the economist * :  by calculating european immigrants ' share of the cost of government spending and their contribution to government revenues , the scholars estimate that between 1995 and 2011 the migrants made a positive contribution of more than # 4 billion ( $ 6.4 billion ) to britain , compared with an overall negative contribution of # 591 billion for native britons . 
  between 2001 and 2011 , the net fiscal contribution of recent arrivals from the eastern european countries that have joined the eu since 2004 has amounted to almost # 5 billion . 
  even during the worst years of the financial crisis , in 2007-11 , they made a net contribution of almost # 2 billion to british public finances . 
  migrants from other european countries chipped in # 8.6 billion . 
  --   that does n't mean that it 's in the interest of some random british worker or workers in some sector   so what are you arguing about then ? 
  the economy in the west is n't profiting from poor immigrants . 
  `` some random british worker '' is n't `` the economy in the west '' . 
  the economy in the west * is * better-off from that immigration . 
  it is possible that some workers , though , like farm workers in the uk , do wind up worse-off because of it , but that alone does not make the country as a whole worse off . 
   there is no economic reason for unlimited immigration . 
  assuming that that any immigrations can be roughly approximated by some ideal immigrant who is rational , self-interested , fully-informed , and so forth -- any immigration in the eu will increase economic efficiency in the eu as a whole . 
  someone will migrate from where they are making $ n per hour -- that is , that 's how much they 're contributing to the eu economy there -- to somewhere where they are making a larger amount $ m per hour . 
  they 're filling a need that was more-seriously-unmet than the one that they were previously filling . 
  that does n't mean that it 's in the interest of some random british worker or workers in some sector ( who might have been making an even larger $ p per hour ) . 
  since article 50 is initiated by the uk rather than a vote by the eu as a whole , and since the british worker is the one with the say there , that does n't mean that it ca n't lead to brexit , though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanks_in_world_war_ii#germany  germany 's armored force was not especially impressive from a technical standpoint at the start of the war . 
  as noted above , it was their advanced combined arms doctrine and unrivaled command-and-control capability that gave german mechanized forces their advantage on the battlefield . 
  i suspect that the major driving factor in being opposed to immigration is being a low-skill worker in a wealthy country , because at the moment you 're personally benefiting from other people in that country having to go to you and a relatively-limited labor pool for services that do n't outsource well . 
  immigration means that you 're exposed to competition , and the market rate for wages can be expected to fall -- maybe you wo n't be able to afford that mortgage you bought into in a few years back , for example . 
  the fact that it tends to split along country lines seems to me somewhat incidental . 
  i know that opposition to particular immigrant groups in the us tends to be tied more to `` who happens to be immigrating in large numbers at the moment '' . 
  go back to the us a hundred and seventy years ago when the irish were immigrating in large numbers , and [ local workers resented immigration just as much ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-irish_sentiment#19th_century ) :  during the 1830s in the u.s. , riots for control of job sites broke out in rural areas among rival labour teams from different parts of ireland , and between irish and local american work teams competing for construction jobs . 
  [ 25 ] ... and the irish are certainly european ( and , at the moment , rather well-to-do as europe goes ) . 
  or take anti-italian sentiment . 
  probably the same with every wave that came through . 
  that is , i think that where racism emerges it tends to be more of a * symptom * of concern over that competition for wages and housing having that upset seeping up in various forms , not a cause . 
  during historic periods of upset over immigration from various places , you can find the immigrant group being dehumanized . 
  http://www.victoriana.com/history/irish-political-cartoons.html people get really upset about the prospect of men from overseas having sex with local women and raise the issue of potential rape or sexual assault very readily . 
  i 've watched with some interest various posts on this sub upset about the prospect of immigration from mena to , say , germany raise alarm over similar issues ( e.g. 
  the new year 's day sexual assaults in cologne ) , and noted the parallels with earlier unhappiness during incidents of immigration friction in the us : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yellow_peril  culturally , the asian-invasion novels expressed the white man 's sexual fear of voracious asian sexuality with scenes of a white woman in sexual peril , usually rape or seduction , aided by the sensual and moral release of opium . 
  [ 55 ] a white woman who was raped or seduced by a chinese man had suffered `` a fate worse than death '' ; thus defiled , the woman is a sexual untouchable to other white men . 
  [ 55 ] in that moralistic vein , during the 1890s , the labour activist and feminist rose summerfield voiced white-female sexual fear of the yellow peril , by warning society of the unnatural lust in the eyes of chinese men when they looked upon the pulchritude of the white women of australia . 
  [ 34 ] :24 that dehumanization also fades once the period of increased immigration goes away , which in my eyes really supports the `` racism is a symptom of concern over competition , not a cause '' explanation . 
  similar upset happened even for within-the-us mass migration of poor people looking for work -- i 've given the example of [ okies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okie ) or [ blacks in the great migration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_migration_%28african_american%29#discrimination_and_working_conditions ) . 
  the people already in that desirable-to-work environment invariably resent the newcomers bringing down the market rate for labor ... 
   what other english-speaking countries are there in the eu other than uk and ireland ? 
   it 's at very minimum very offensive to single out those 2 countries and assume they would all want to leave their respective countries for the uk . 
  i can understand it being objectionable , but if you assume that people intend to jump at a closing door and that working in the uk was that much more valuable than working somewhere else in the eu , bulgaria and romania have the two lowest per-capita gdps in the eu and thus workers in those two countries have the largest incentive in the eu to work elsewhere -- they are n't arbitrarily-chosen . 
  it 's economically-sensible for workers to move to where jobs are , just as it makes sense for jobs to move to where workers are . 
  i mean , i think that the assumption is pretty silly for a number of reasons , though i would imagine that it 'd still resonate to an anti-immigration type in the uk : * there are other well-to-do countries in the eu . 
  the uk 's per-capita gdp ranking is n't presently all that high in the eu-28 . 
  it 's actually about the middle of the pack , with the [ order being ] ( http://statisticstimes.com/economy/european-countries-by-gdp-per-capita.php ) luxembourg , ireland , denmark , sweden , netherlands , austria , finland , germany , belgium , and only then the uk -- 10th in the eu-28 * the uk does speak english , which might make it more-approachable , but so does ireland ... * brexit itself carries economic uncertainties for the uk . 
  for the eu as a whole , of course , but moreso for the uk . 
   that boat was a bit of a slut you 're more right than you know . 
  by design , it was apparently a dutch [ fluyt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fluyt ) .
