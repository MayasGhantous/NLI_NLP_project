  in the british-american english of the time , [ when a lower-case letter `` s '' started a word , it was written differently , and can be indistinguishable from an `` f '' ] ( http://dohistory.org/on_your_own/toolkit/writing.html ) , so it 'd basically be `` sluyt '' versus `` slut '' . 
  furthermore , also at the time , spelling in the language was n't standardized , so it was the norm for people to use various spellings of words ...

  a special feature is the greenhouse , where fresh vegetables are grown . 
   right now , us has utter junk for icebreakers and their ability to build new ones is at least two generations of technology behind ours and by extension what russians have , while paying something around 6-8 times more per ship . 
  best icebreaker is going under ice with nuclear submarine plus waiting for global warming to open sea passages where you want to go .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/captured_german_equipment_in_soviet_use_on_the_eastern_front  the drawbacks to using enemy equipment are significant . 
  first , the captured vehicles are very often mistaken as enemy and thus are subject to friendly fire . 
  second , it is difficult to repair or maintain them ; the simple act of obtaining ammunition or minor engine parts can be insurmountable . 
  third , equipment such as radios may not be compatible with other friendly equipment . 
  fourth , troops may not understand the maintenance requirements of the unfamiliar enemy equipment . 
    with the exception of the panzer iii tank , most of the vehicles listed below were captured in very small numbers and never contributed significantly to red army strength in any operation . 
   german will get the engineering & ground force ( famas to hk416 ) . 
  france will get anything aeronautics / naval related . 
  i 'm actually not sure that that 's a good place to put the line , because it means that it locks military doctrine to domestic interests -- that is , france has an economic reason to advocate for , say , cruise missiles being used from ships , and germany for land operations , and both retain independent foreign policy . 
   you wo n't find anywhere where murder is allowed while i agree with your general point , if you performed capital punishment in the eu , it 'd be murder , unlike in the us .

  the [ f-35 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_f-35_lightning_ii ) is arguably three very similar jets with a lot of parts overlap . 
   to keep development , production , and operating costs down , a common design was planned in three variants that share 80 percent of their parts :   * f-35a , conventional take off and landing ( ctol ) variant . 
   * f-35b , short-take off and vertical-landing ( stovl ) variant . 
   * f-35c , carrier-based catobar ( cv ) variant . 
  i wonder what would happen if europe tried to increase the rate of parts standardization . 
  supposing , for example , that all the commonly-needed-to-be-replaced main battle tank parts were standardized between france and germany . 
  that might be a lower bar ( n % parts standardization ) than having to use exactly the same piece of hardware . 
  it might also be worth considering how much is already standardized . 
  for example , denmark 's mbt is the leopard 2a5dk . 
  that 's not a vanilla leopard 2a5 , but it 'll have a lot in common with it already , and leverage that commonality . 
   land cut off by artifical waterways does n't count as an island .

  russia is party to the [ united nations convention on the law of the sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea ) . 
  i would think that that would mean that [ innocent passage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/innocent_passage ) would apply and thus require that poland have the right to pass through : http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm  section 3 . 
  innocent passage in the territorial sea   subsection a. 
  rules applicable to all ships   article 17   right of innocent passage   subject to this convention , ships of all states , whether coastal or land-locked , enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea . 
    article 18   meaning of passage   1 . 
  passage means navigation through the territorial sea for the purpose of :   ( a ) traversing that sea without entering internal waters or calling at a roadstead or port facility outside internal waters ; or   ( b ) proceeding to or from internal waters or a call at such roadstead or port facility . 
  i see some restrictions that might be an issue for poland ( e.g. 
  submarines must travel on the surface ) , but for most purposes , i 'd think that that 'd be acceptable . 
  the roleplay here is somewhat sub-par . 
   either way , the move would turn a long-simmering conflict into a full-blown constitutional crisis . 
  because that 's just what the eu needs right about now . 
   the website also says obama could be an antidote to the popularity of right-wing parties in the country . 
  i 'm not exactly sure that obama is left by french standards . 
  [ i am not a financial analyst ] probably because they 're going to have to make predictions for their businesses about what will happen . 
  let 's say that there is an assessment of a 20 % chance of a le pen win . 
  that means that that outcome 's gon na determine 20 % of the expected outcome for the french economy . 
  they have to know what france would actually * do * if that happens , preferably without all the political rhetoric , if they want to come up with some sort of accurate expected outcome . 
  and if le pen does win , they probably want to have as clear-as-possible a picture of what would happen then so that they can make the appropriate moves . 
   mr farage also did not rule out becoming prime minister mmmhmm . 
   the knowledge economy does not create mass manual employment no . 
  it will require a more-extensive skillset for a larger portion of the workforce . 
  that shift away from manual labor is also a long-running one -- there 's little call for someone wielding a shovel to manually dig ditches , for example -- you 'd get someone to operate machinery . 
  so would it be safe to say that you 're worried about people who are worried about people being too worried about too many refugees ? 
  seems like that would warrant a third category . 
  that being said , labor force participation rate might be more-interesting , given that disability fraud does n't , as i understand it , show up in u3 or u6 . 
   you ca n't depopulate all of idaho and ship them off to caltech sure you can .

   if all your innovation happens in universities and large urban centres you will leave at least 50 % of your country behind . 
  [ 75 % of germany 's population is urban ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/urban-population-percent-of-total-wb-data.html ) . 
  that percentage is only increasing . 
  have eu members that have joined the eu been exempt from paying for commitments that people who joined before them made ? 
  it seems to me that there 's a good argument for symmetry -- if you were exempt from paying for the commitments of others on the way in , you should be exempt from paying for your commitments on the way out . 
  if you had to pay for the commitments of others , then others should pay for your commitments on the way out . 
  i 'm dubious . 
  i mean , i 'm not saying that having farage running around acting like an asshat is a good thing for the uk , but i do not believe that eu members are making major policy decisions based on whether-or-not farage is being particularly offensive . 
   it is n't really matter of height restrictions though . 
  people in the uk are just obsessed with living in houses . 
  even people that want to live in a house , though , benefit from increased heights , because it eliminates competition that they have to purchase single-family housing . 
  some people are fine with living in multi-unit housing , and those people wo n't be fighting them for available single-unit housing . 
   these flats also tend to be sold to investors to rent out as well , still bound by the constraint of the number of people who actually want housing . 
  if you keep building housing and investors continue purchasing it beyond the point where it 's a sensible investment , rents will simply keep heading on towards zero -- the investors wind up paying to subsidize housing for renters . 
  metrics are useful , but current metrics do n't take into account reputation gain/loss of the publication in question , and that reputation does have value . 
  could you clarify what your beef with them is ? 
  i 'm not clear on whether associate membership is better than being a regular member or not . 
  i think that this definitely needs clarification . 
   mr trump , whose mother is scottish and a royalist , has also expressed his enthusiasm for building his connections with the royal family . 
  that 'd be one for the tabloids , no doubt . 
  eliminate height restrictions on construction and there 's more room for larger living spaces . 
  if your point is `` russia is n't as friendly with germany as the us is with britain '' , fine , i 'm not disputing that . 
  but my point is that you also ca n't reasonably work with a heavy presumption that anything done is with the goal of building up to an attack , or else you are going to wind up reacting to a lot of things that are non-issues -- and that * wo n't * help you , since you blow resources on things that are n't issues . 
  taking the reichstag was , i imagine , the peak of the `` great patriotic war '' for russia . 
  i 'd imagine that it 's something that was a big deal for 'em . 
  i 'd * expect * people to try to use that -- it 's probably got all sorts of nationalistic fervor bound up with it , has emotional value . 
  but just because they 're doing that does n't mean that they 're training people for take the reichstag 2.0 , and i think that a lot of people * are * unreasonably jumping to that conclusion .
