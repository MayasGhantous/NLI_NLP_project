  russia has some justification to want the eu to break up in that it 's a competitor next door for territory . 
  okay . 
  if someone was saying `` rt is writing a lot of articles about how unpleasant being in the eu is , and we think that that 's to discourage countries from joining or to encourage them to leave '' , * that 's * a plausible claim to me . 
  but you ca n't transition from saying that to saying that russia wants to invade berlin simply on the grounds that both are things that the eu would n't like : there is simply no reasonable scenario in which that happens . 
  just because russia might do * some * things that are undesirable for the eu does not mean that * all * things that russia is doing are undesirable for the eu . 
   then why are so many us partners purposefully forcing it ? 
  they are n't !, 
   i would rather be in a country with a surplus and excess jobs than one flooded with cheap products that i may not be able to buy you ca n't create a persistent surplus . 
  if you try to block a country from importing things temporarily , they * will * continue to export for a while , at least until their products become too expensive for exports to be viable . 
  what your long-term effect is is to force people out of export industries and into less-efficient industries to serve the domestic market . 
  if your concern is that there is a lot of low-skill labor out there and you want to subsidize low-skill workers in the us , because you want 'em to have a higher standard of living than the market rate for their labor warrants , there 's a simple way to do that -- just subsidize 'em . 
  say `` if you have less than x amount of education '' or `` if you make less than y per year '' , `` here 's some money '' . 
  * that * can be sustained in the long term . 
  it may-or-may-not be a good idea -- it 's got costs to it -- but at least it works . 
  endorsing the eu is n't a crime . 
  impeachment is a response to a crime , not a recall vote . 
  no , that was always the normal . 
  but expecting him to obtain competent advisors and talking to them before saying things is part of the job . 
  is n't that sort of the point of having an intelligence agency ? 
  oh , come on . 
  * close combat iii * has a `` storm the reichstag '' map , and i 've played that both as the russians and the germans . 
  this is just the real-world equivalent . 
  we have american civil war games . 
  i mean , if the british made a game with a level modeling the assault on washington , dc and the burning of the white house , i 'm not gon na take it as some deep indication of the current country 's goals . 
  i really think that this is being blown out of proportion . 
  trump 's an expert in marriages -- he 's had so many of them . 
  it 's not illegal to nuke a country . 
  stop him ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
  the president has undergone the full democratic vetting process to choose the person in the country best-suited for the job . 
  at some point , presumably he 's going to stop saying that we can cancel the f-35 and just make a better f-18 , so that 's at least one . 
  three years , eleven months . 
   are there non-lethal fighter jets https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/active_denial_system  the active denial system ( ads ) is a non-lethal , directed-energy weapon developed by the u.s. military , [ 2 ] designed for area denial , perimeter security and crowd control . 
  [ 3 ] informally , the weapon is also called the heat ray [ 4 ] since it works by heating the surface of targets , such as the skin of targeted human subjects . 
  --  ads was developed under the sponsorship of the dod non-lethal weapons program with the air force research laboratory as the lead agency . 
  --  in 2011 , the ads was redesigned to make it smaller , more reliable , and able to be used on the move . 
  ads ii is being designed to operate from moving aircraft , as well as moving ground vehicles . 
  why would it be part of the brexit deal ? 
  i mean , nothing in brexit really seems to deal with it -- it 's just the eu extending a guarantee to ni in the future . 
  and to this day , [ like us ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/cheap-eats-how-america-spends-money-on-food/273811/ ) , you tend to spend rather little of your income on home-cooked food . 
  eh , i think it 's more that he 's exploiting a `` fits with my personal views '' thing among those manufacturing workers . 
  yeah , i agree that the statement is bullshit , and i guess that him saying it does give it some degree of weight with his supporters that i regret , but that 's also different from the actual people making decisions holding that view . 
  would be interesting to see this on a population-density weighted projection . 
  i guess that the size of the administrative units kind of acts as a very rough guide , but still does n't quite give the intuitive sense that area being tied to population does . 
  yeah , but [ europe as a whole also tends towards that quirk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_%28grammar%29#variation_among_languages ) :  articles are found in many indo-european especially romance languages , semitic ( only definite article ) , and polynesian languages , but are formally absent from many of the world 's major languages , such as chinese , indonesian , japanese , hindi , punjabi , urdu , russian , the majority of slavic and baltic languages , yoruba , and bantu languages . 
  who , trump implying that he 's going to magic up some protectionist policy ? 
  trump 's saying that because it appeals to manufacturing workers that he 's trying to sell on himself . 
  * those * can individually benefit or be harmed by protectionist trade policy . 
  the only guarantee is that the country as a whole benefits from trade . 
   why ? 
  ( genuine question ) because a trade surplus does n't inherently benefit a country -- that 's not why you want to trade with other countries . 
  humans need to build assets during their working lives to fund their retirement , so * they * need to build up assets in a form that will let them purchase the services of others in their retirement , but a country does n't `` retire '' . 
  if a country runs a surplus , it 's giving away things that it produces without getting something in return , the idea being that it can get something down the line that is * better * than what it could have used the resources on now . 
  that time when it ca n't use those resources costs it something . 
  block import of steel and you discourage the construction of capital goods , like factories . 
  block import of beer , and you 're less-able to attract workers ; your pay buys them less utility . 
  ah , but maybe you decide that you 'll go invest in industry in some country overseas ? 
  sure , and then you dump funds into paying its workers and letting its industry develop instead of your own . 
  maybe that 's a good idea , though ? 
  if so , the an efficient market would have been able to identify that itself , without you needing to try and coerce it into doing that . 
    in , say , greece , you wind up with companies going under and then people forming new ones or re-hiring at lower pay , and people then being unable to afford importing german goods and instead buying things produced domestically . 
    but after the financial crash , that 's not what happened . 
  after the crash , i see [ greek wages dropping ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/wages ) and the [ greek balance of trade heading towards zero ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/balance-of-trade ) . 
  looks like it 's happening to me . 
  people are n't instantly re-hired , true -- that 's why countries would prefer to have floating currencies , less disruptive . 
  it 's not perfectly fluid . 
  but let 's take a look -- the [ greek unemployment rate is high ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate ) , but it 's been falling since 2013 , which is what we 'd expect . 
   look at any metric you want . 
    interest rates : http://i.imgur.com/1euin.png interest rates rose . 
  that 's not in conflict with what i was saying -- greece being a greater default risk is n't incompatible with that . 
   exports : https://europeansnapshot.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/real-exports-12.png exports fell . 
  but what matters is the shift in balance of trade -- you 're forgetting that imports fell as well . 
  and as i point out with the graph above , that headed towards zero . 
   greece is the most expensive country in the euro , by productivity , and germany is the cheapest : https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/dialogue-what-europe-taught-us-about-boundaries not incompatible with what i said . 
  in your chart , labor costs in greece start heading down and germany starts heading up post-crash , which is compatible with my statement . 
  here 's extended charts running up to the current time : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/labour-costs http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/labour-costs greece 's labor costs are falling from ~ 2009 ( with a ton of seasonal variation that i assume is due to tourism ) and germany is rising . 
  good times for companies making automated agricultural equipment . 
  neither roi nor ni have any particular interest in locking the border up tight . 
  i predict a booming smuggling business . 
   nuclear - in big trouble after fukushima political problem , not technical . 
   solar - does not work at night or while overcast store it . 
   wind - does not work when there is no wind store it . 
   4 % is dirt cheap as well . 
  take a bloody look at historical interest rates . 
  is that in * real * terms or in terms of portugal 's currency at the time ? 
  it 's not `` good '' for germany to run an artificially-high surplus . 
  and even without different currencies , you 'll still see trade imbalances resolve themselves . 
  in , say , greece , you wind up with companies going under and then people forming new ones or re-hiring at lower pay , and people then being unable to afford importing german goods and instead buying things produced domestically . 
  in germany , you wind up with markets drying up in your trade partners and a flood of cheap goods from those new greek companies that it 's simply not possible to compete with . 
  it just means more firing and hiring than if the currencies floated relative to each other . 
  it does n't mean that trade equilibrium ca n't be reached . 
   would be worth for our economy as well . 
  if so , then why is n't the market funding expansion ? 
  that is , where 's the positive externality coming from ? 
  trying to run persistent trade surpluses is n't a positive . 
  is n't france also exposed to the greek losses ? 
  i mean , it 's not as if the german state is the only party that can eat the losses . 
  france could as easily engage in debt forgiveness . 
  hell , any country in the world could , if it wanted to pay off some of the creditors . 
  i think that the focus on germany is a bit unreasonable .
