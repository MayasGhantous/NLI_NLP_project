  the story only goes downhill from this point . 
  in the public critique that pasteur was soon to issue against toussaint 's work , his central theoretical concern was precisely the question of `` live vs. dead '' vaccines . 
  someone at that time hearing someone advocating to inoculate children with live rabies would have been correct to be skeptical .

  it 's a riff on a slogan < checks wikipedia  -- [ patrick peyton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patrick_peyton ) 's `` the family that prays together stays together '' . 
  i 'm assuming that keeping it as similar-as-possible to make the original phrase recognizable and thus the joke work was more-important than being grammatically-correct to the author . 
  it is true that [ get laid ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/get_laid#english ) is an intransitive verb that 's slang for `` having sex '' , but it 's not really grammatically-correct for that sense either -- you 'd need `` get '' to be paired with `` laid '' . 
  the phrase `` lay with '' is also used in the biblical sense in the king james bible as a euphemism for `` had sex with '' , if that 's what you 're thinking of : [ genesis 19:33 , kjv ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+19:33&amp;version=kjv ) :  and they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose . 
  but in that euphemistic sense , it 's just like the modern `` lay '' as an intransitive past tense for `` lie '' , and alpha_letitgo was n't using the verb where the past tense would be required -- it 'd need the present tense . 
  you can swap in a different verb to make it more-obvious : * `` i was hoping for a law proposal to separate what is not meant to swam together . '', 
  * `` i was hoping for a law proposal to separate what is not meant to swim together . '', 
  the past tense is clearly wrong there -- you 'd want the present tense . 
  i do n't think that there 's a grammatically-correct way to use `` lay '' in the great-grandparent post .

   lay together `` lie together '' . 
  `` lay '' is a transitive verb in english . 
  `` lie '' is an intransitive verb . 
  you only use `` lay '' when you 're laying something down . 
  if you were to lie down , if you 're not acting on something else , then you use `` lie '' . 
  * `` bob , lay the ball down . '', 
  * `` bob , lie down . '', 
  this is slightly complicated by the fact that the past tense of `` lie '' is also `` lay '' ... * `` yesterday , bob lay down . '',

  well , if you 're merging with puerto rico . 
  i was thinking of puerto rico doing its thing , but at that point you 're talking about just half a million in total remaining, 
  they 're just little dinky islands with very few people on them . 
  [ combining all of them gives you about four million people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territories_of_the_united_states ) , about 7/8ths of which is puerto rico .

  i 'm pretty sure that sputnik has a far smaller budget .

  `` many billions '' seems high . 
   i think a lot of people are willing to recognize the hypocrisy of being saudi allies while shitting on russia . 
  saudi arabia has n't been annexing bits of countries in europe . 
  whether-or-not they or russia are social conservatives is more-or-less irrelevant to the question of whether to work with them . 
  inserted lenin on a [ sealed train ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sealed_train ) into russia to screw over russia during world war i and then kept sending funds to his faction with the idea that he 'd do a number on russia . 
  it succeeded far beyond the intentions or expectations of the people who set it up . 
  http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14608/did-the-germans-purposefully-arrange-to-send-lenin-to-russia-to-start-a-revoluti  the historian richard pipes writes in his book the russian revolution that based on disclosed german papers made available after wwii the german foreign secretary at the time of lenin 's passage richard von k\u00fchlmann was either the person that came up with the idea , or at the bare minimum signed off on the idea of letting lenin pass through german lands to return to russia . 
  lenin was even decried as a `` german agent '' when he finally returned . 
  --  according to pipes , relying on numbers from eduard bernstein , the german government sent `` more than 50 million deutsche marks in gold '' from 1917 to 1918 to help the bolsheviks establish and hold power . 
   africa in general is having like a 10 % a year growth , 10 % is pretty high . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_real_gdp_growth_rate i see one country that made it above 10 % ( ethiopia , which is in africa and very poor ) . 
  the next african country is ivory coast at 8.5 % . 
  after that , tanzania at 7 % . 
  also , keep in mind that ethiopia is seeing a population that increases by about 2.5 % per year . 
  i 'm not sure how important raw personnel count alone as a military goes today , though ( or north korea would be the fourth-greatest military power in the world and the gulf war would have been a much more balanced conflict ) . 
  the more-interesting question is what they 're equipped to do . 
  of all the major countries involved in this , i 'd say that germany is acting the least far-right .

  http://www.epilepsy.com/article/2014/3/fireworks-flags-video-games-and-driving-seizure-risks-and-prevention  flags : according to dr. erba , `` if one is close enough and is staring at the white and red stripes of the american flag such that the stripes occupy the whole eye field and with a high level of luminosity , some people may start [ experiencing symptoms of a seizure ] . 
  only about 30 to 40 percent of people sensitive to lights are also photosensitive to patterns , '' he said . 
  `` if a flag is constructed with a low number of alternating stripes that are widely spaced then you must consider that 2 or 3 stripes will act like the strobes flickering at 2 or 3 per second , which is safe . 
  but if you have 13 stripes , then it is like a light that flickers 13 times per second , which carries more risk for photosensitive individuals . 
  however , you would need to be very close and fixate on the stripes in full bright light for there to be any danger . '',
