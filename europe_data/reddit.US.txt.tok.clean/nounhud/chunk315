  the uk is one of the few countries in the world with the force projection capability to independently fight in just about any country in the world . 
  i mean , i guess if you 're going to draw a `` relevance '' line somewhere , it has to be placed at some arbitrary point , but if the uk does n't meet that arbitrary point , few countries do .

     the first time in ww2 in 1940 was so close that even a constitution had been created , i think it literally came down to churchill changing his mind on it that prevented it from actually happening . 
  other way around . 
  it was ultimately the french who dropped it . 
   america owns puerto rico and wo n't allow it to be a state ... uh , no ? 
  the first referendum in puerto rico that went in favor of statehood by any measurement ( and that was only a two-round vote ) was in 2012 , less than five years ago . 
  in the past , preference has been to maintain the * status quo * . 
  it asked `` do you want to retain current status ? '', 
  ( change won a narrow victory ) and `` if you change current status , which would you prefer ? '', 
  ( where statehood won easily ) . 
  however , the two-round thing will obviously tip things towards statehood . 
  there has n't been democratic party control in place since then -- the republicans have controlled the house since 2011 and the senate as well since 2015 ( and now have the presidency as well ) . 
  puerto rico will vote democrat , and [ immense battles have been fought over adding states to tilt the balance of power in the senate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/missouri_compromise ) in the past . 
  in the middle of this year , puerto rico is scheduled to hold a `` do you want to become a state '' vote -- none of this two-round business . 
  if that winds up being in favor of statehood , my guess is that it 'll probably happen next time the democrats have enough control to do so , since it 'll give them another two senate votes . 
  not going to happen while the republicans are running things , though . 
  will also wind up being the only state in the us that has an official language other than english . 
  http://www.worldstandards.eu/cars/driving-on-the-left/  in the past , almost everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal , violent societies . 
  since most people are right-handed , swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him . 
  moreover , it reduced the chance of the scabbard ( worn on the left ) hitting other people . 
    furthermore , a right-handed person finds it easier to mount a horse from the left side of the horse , and it would be very difficult to do otherwise if wearing a sword ( which would be worn on the left ) . 
  it is safer to mount and dismount towards the side of the road , rather than in the middle of traffic , so if one mounts on the left , then the horse should be ridden on the left side of the road . 
    in the late 1700s , however , teamsters in france and the united states began hauling farm products in big wagons pulled by several pairs of horses . 
  these wagons had no driver 's seat ; instead the driver sat on the left rear horse , so he could keep his right arm free to lash the team . 
  since he was sitting on the left , he naturally wanted everybody to pass on the left so he could look down and make sure he kept clear of the oncoming wagon 's wheels . 
  therefore he kept to the right side of the road . 
  i doubt that there 's much argument today for one or the other other than infrastructure-switching and familiarity-retraining cost . 
  it may be that self-driving cars will wind up obsoleting this , if 100 years from now about 2 % of the population knows how to drive .

   blood sausage one of the cultural splits between the us and europe is over this [ whole eating blood thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_as_food#europe ) , particularly as [ blood sausage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_sausage ) . 
  you have [ black pudding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_pudding ) , * blutwurst * , * boudin * , and a million other variants , to say nothing of the romanian thirst . 
  in the us , most people would say `` eew '' if you offered them a sausage made from blood . 
   their language has almost no connection between the spelling and the pronounciation .

   they entered ww1 because germany violated belgium neutrality for reasons of military strategy ... meh . 
  that was just the point where the brits had a clear * causus belli * to avoid having germany chew up europe piece-by-piece . 
  france would have been what mattered from the british standpoint , but waiting until french territory was violated would have resulted in france falling . 
  the uk made the right call there .

   industrial revolution ? 
  oh , that 's a good point , particularly given the context of this forum -- the uk was really the country that kicked off the [ great divergence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) that put european culture , wealth , and influence as dominant in the world .

  aside from two early fights ( 1776 and 1812 ) and one later political contest ( 1956 ) , they 've mostly taken the same position as us internationally , and we 've done a bunch of things together ( couple world wars , overthrow governments , spy on stuff , etc ) .

   i 'm not going to pretend i 'm a clever enough person to know what would work , there 's more intelligent and educated people who are paid to think of that .

  but if you just fix things that do n't work as you go and have people interested in making it work ... < shrug  when the us created the us consitution , thus establishing a federation , [ this was the speech ] ( http://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/pop_finalspeech.html ) , given by benjamin franklin , that immediately-preceded the decision by the framers to sign off on it . 
  those people had their own doubts and concerns :  mr. president :   i confess that i do not entirely approve of this constitution at present , but sir , i am not sure i shall never approve it : for having lived long , i have experienced many instances of being oblig 'd , by better information or fuller consideration , to change opinions even on important subjects , which i once thought right , but found to be otherwise . 
  it is therefore that the older i grow the more apt i am to doubt my own judgment , and to pay more respect to the judgment of others . 
  most men indeed as well as most sects in religion , think themselves in possession of all truth , and that wherever others differ from them it is so far error . 
  steele , a protestant in a dedication tells the pope , that the only difference between our two churches in their opinions of the certainty of their doctrine , is , the romish church is infallible , and the church of england is never in the wrong . 
  but tho ' many private persons think almost as highly of their own infallibility , as of that of their sect , few express it so naturally as a certain french lady , who in a little dispute with her sister , said , i do n't know how it happens , sister , but i meet with no body but myself that 's always in the right . 
    in these sentiments , sir , i agree to this constitution , with all its faults , if they are such ; because i think a general government necessary for us , and there is no form of government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered ; and i believe farther that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years , and can only end in despotism as other forms have done before it , when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government , being incapable of any other . 
    i doubt too whether any other convention we can obtain , may be able to make a better constitution : for when you assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom , you inevitably assemble with those men all their prejudices , their passions , their errors of opinion , their local interests , and their selfish views . 
  from such an assembly can a perfect production be expected ? 
  it therefore astonishes me , sir , to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does ; and i think it will astonish our enemies , who are waiting with confidence to hear that our councils are confounded , like those of the builders of babel , and that our states are on the point of separation , only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting one another 's throats . 
  thus i consent , sir , to this constitution because i expect no better , and because i am not sure that it is not the best . 
    the opinions i have had of its errors , i sacrifice to the public good . 
  i have never whispered a syllable of them abroad . 
  within these walls they were born , and here they shall die . 
  if every one of us in returning to our constituents were to report the objections he has had to it , and use his influence to gain partisan in support of them , we might prevent its being generally received , and thereby lose all the salutary effects and great advantages resulting naturally in our favour among foreign nations , as well as among ourselves , from our real or apparent unanimity . 
  much of the strength and efficiency of any government , in procuring and securing happiness to the people depends on opinion , on the general opinion of the goodness of that government as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its governors . 
  i hope therefore that for our own sakes , as a part of the people , and for the sake of our posterity , we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending this constitution , wherever our influence may extend , and turn our future thoughts and endeavours to the means of having it well administered . 
  most modern-day nation-states in europe are composed of what was once fragmented , smaller nation-states .
