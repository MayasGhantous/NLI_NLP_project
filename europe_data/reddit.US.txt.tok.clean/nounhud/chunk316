  you 'll always have a split , because first-past-the-post , winner-take-all favors a two-party , regional system , but the regions involved shift over time . 
  you 're thinking of the [ fourth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_party_system ) . 
  we 're in the [ sixth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) now . 
  very broadly-speaking , you have the rural areas and the urban areas in conflict , but i suspect that that 's a division that most countries see , albeit perhaps not in the form of a two-party , winner-take-all system .

  i mean , even a completely new , made-up nonsense word would at least be distinctive . 
  i suspect that the electoral college in the us is more an artifact of having the bicameral legislature rather than visa versa . 
  ... why is europe inherently geopolitically split ? 
  aside from land contact with asia , i 'd think that many of the same factors apply . 
  hell , germany and france spent so much time fighting * because * the two countries were tied up with each other . 
  i think that it would be a good move for europe .

   apple pizza ? 
  [ done sometimes on dessert pizzas ] ( http://www.melskitchencafe.com/apple-cinnamon-streusel-dessert-pizza/ ) . 
  well , ananas sounds similar to `` bananas '' , and it looks like most of the european continent did n't come up with a word that differs much from `` bananas '' for bananas . 
  spain uses a word like `` plantains '' , which is n't great in that `` bananas '' and `` plantains '' mean different ( though at least not-very-different ) things here . 
   now , dutch uses ananas and portuguese uses ananas , the two empires that reached japan first ... guess which fucking word they choose for the fruit ... 
  the dutch and the portuguese set up trade arrangements with very-limited-by-the-rulers outside contact and , i suspect , had limited cultural imact . 
  the us speaks english , and the [ us was the first western country to show up in japan in a way that opened the country to a greater degree ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5ly4mz15o&amp;t=4m45s ) . 
  also , the uk was a japanese ally for some time in the early 1900s . 
  also , interchange between the us and japan would have increased as a result of occupation and just due to trade across the pacific . 
  my guess is that one of those factors was significant . 
  [ wikipedia : english-language spelling reform : obstacles and criticisms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english-language_spelling_reform#obstacles_and_criticisms ) :  * public resistance to spelling reform has been consistently strong , at least since the early 19th century , when spelling was codified by the influential english dictionaries of samuel johnson ( 1755 ) and noah webster ( 1806 ) . 
  [ johnson being the brit , webster being the yank ]   * english vocabulary is mostly a melding of germanic , french , latin and greek words , which have very different phonemes and approaches to spelling . 
  some reform proposals tend to favour one approach over the other , resulting in a large percentage of words that must change spelling to fit the new scheme . 
  [ note : i 'm not sure that this is a minus from the standpoint of language standardization . 
  i am somewhat suspicious that the french would enjoy a language battle . ], 
    * some inflections are pronounced differently in different words . 
  for example , plural - s and possessive - 's are both pronounced differently in cat ( ' ) s ( / s / ) and dog ( ' ) s ( / z / ) . 
  the handling of this particular difficulty distinguishes morphemic proposals , which tend to spell such inflectional endings the same , from phonemic proposals that spell the endings according to their pronunciation . 
    * english is the only one of the top ten major languages that lacks a worldwide regulatory body with the power to promulgate spelling changes . 
  [ that being said , that might be an argument for the eu to be particularly influential in standardization . ], 
    * the spellings of some words -- such as tongue and stomach -- are so unindicative of their pronunciation that changing the spelling would noticeably change the shape of the word . 
  likewise , the irregular spelling of very common words , such as is , are , have , done and of makes it difficult to fix them without introducing a noticeable change to the appearance of english text . 
  this would create acceptance issues . 
    * phonetic spelling reform could result in a multitude of different versions of written english , largely unintelligible across different accent-groups . 
  scottish writers might not be read by indians . 
  americans would write whut and british wot for the same word . 
    * spelling reform may make pre-reform writings harder to understand and read in their original form , often necessitating transcription and republication . 
  however , even today few people choose to read old literature in the original spellings as most of it has been republished in modern spellings . 
  [ 30 ] [ also , i suspect that unlike some forms of language change , this could be done pretty automatically . ],

  [ wikipedia confirms it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hawaiian_pizza ) :  pineapple as a pizza topping divides opinion : hawaiian was the most popular pizza in australia in 1999 , accounting for 15 % of pizza sales , [ 1 ] and a 2015 review of independent uk takeaways operating through just eat found the hawaiian pizza to be the most commonly available . 
  [ 2 ] a 2016 survey of us adults however had pineapple in the top three least favourite pizza toppings , behind anchovies and mushrooms , [ 3 ] and the president of iceland once suggested light heartedly that pineapple as a pizza topping should be banned by law . 
  i 'm assuming that you 've got some ham in there . 
  not proper hawaiian pizza without both ham and pineapple . 
  well , i 'm feeling much better about trump already . 
  apparently other countries have voted their own lunatics into power as well . 
  another significant factor : sweden was chosen because it scores highly on these , so it 's the us as a whole needing to compare to one of the top-ranked portions in the eu . 
  were one to select a high-scoring us state or were one to combine the entire eu-28 ... 
  yes , but you are going to have to spend money to support them as well . 
  you 'd have to treat your kids pretty badly to have them be net income via benefits . 
  well , at least here , and i assume elsewhere . 
   that 's like sayin `` i vote for swimming , i never voted to get wet in the process '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dry_suit, 
  i 'm comfortable with malaysia taking the blame . 
  donald trump is an extremely talented actor playing an idiot .

  right , sorry ` bout that there , poland . 
  well , they did have `` nato : '' before it ; that 's equivalent to saying `` nato said this '' rather than `` it happened '' . 
  now , arguably that 's not correct either , because `` some random official at nato '' ca n't really speak for nato -- i can just go calling people until i find * someone * who is willing to state that they believe this to be the case -- and it does not sound like jens stoltenberg made that assertion . 
  furthermore , it sounds like the statement was `` likely '' , and it 's not clear what information they used to come to that conclusion . 
  could be anything from a `` it sounds like them '' to `` this ip has done other things in the past '' . 
  dw 's an interest in maintaining a high bar and a solid reputation ; if i were them , i 'd say something like `` nato official : russia likely targeted german army with fake news campaign in lithuania '' . 
  but `` nato : foo '' in a headline is not the same thing as `` foo '' . 
  the german army must have the weirdest haircut rules . 
  i mean , they look like they have military-specific haircuts , but they 're all over the place . 
   the us really is only interested in selling more equipment to smaller countries without their own defence industries , that 's all . 
  if those countries do n't have defense industry , is that because there 's no budget to support them ? 
  is there more benefit and less divergence of viewpoints on domestic matters than on international matters ? 
  that seems kind of like saying `` germany has n't acted internationally before , so it should not do so in the future '' . 
   because his views on every topic of domestic importance have been ghastly . 
  well , there are probably people in your country whose views you consider ghastly too , right ? 
  i mean , you still get together and produce some sort of action at the end of the day . 
  good point , hungary . 
   the council should switch completely to qualified majority voting , wherever this is possible under the treaties , to avoid blocking important draft laws and speed up the legislative process . 
  i 'm pretty sure that this is by far the most-important item . 
  i think that ballot initiatives have led to a flood of horrible decisions in california . 
  basically , the only real time i can think of that they 'd make sense is if you think that it 's * impossible * to elect a representative who can actually support your interests . 
  most people are going to take a quick skim of something , because it 's not viable to have the whole country look into something as deeply as a set of people delegated to specifically do so , and so how it 's presented can sell a wide range of policies . 
   its just frustrating to hear americans talk of nato as if the military capasity you contribute with to nato is some sort of charity for the rest of us . 
  it is n't a charity , but the benefit to the us is substantially-smaller than that to europe . 
   `` if nato is n't outward looking , it 's got nothing to do , '' he said . 
  `` it ca n't go back to managing a threat from russia , because it 's not a real threat . '' so nato should be wrapped up , because there are no security concerns in europe ? 
  someone should probably inform ukraine . 
   the enthusiasm for running the world has greatly subsided in europe since world war 2 , and especially after the collapse of the soviet union . 
  only france and england seem remotely interested today . 
  maintaining a capability beyond bare territorial defense is hardly `` running the world '' . 
  europe benefits from having a stable world . 
  let 's say some country in the middle east decides that it is interested in taking over a large chunk of the middle east 's oil supply . 
  will the response from europe , be `` let 's wipe out military budgets ... soft power alone can probably solve the issue '' or `` oh , surely that 's not a real concern '' ? 
  as far as i can tell , you 'd have to buy into one of two things to argue that european military capability should keep declining : * matters of concern to europe will just work themselves out without any hard power becoming involved or necessary . 
  * the us will probably take actions close enough to europe 's interests even if europe refuses to maintain a significant military capability such that it 's not worth it to europe to maintain that capability . 
  first of all , both seem dubious to me , but even if they * are * the case , i * definitely * think that that should be an explicit and clear decision made with buy-in from all parties involved .
