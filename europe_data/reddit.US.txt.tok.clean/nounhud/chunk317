  it 's that reduction that has driven calls for other nato members to move up towards 2 % . 
   all these facilities are not justified in 2017 looking online , it looks like the rationale is that italy is where most us facilities for operating in africa and the middle east are located due to location , plus italy is cheaper to have bases in than germany , so us bases are generally migrating from germany -- the most-important place for the cold war -- to italy , more-important for africa and the near east . 
  it does appear that obama apparently signed some sort of base deal with tunesia in 2015 and also over the past few years is signed another deal for new facilities in niger and expanding dual french-us facilities there . 
  i 'm betting that tunesia is less-expensive than italy and niger even less-expensive , so the trend toward africa command moving south may continue ... 
  * having bases is n't a condition of nato membership . 
  nobody has told italy that they have to keep those bases . 
  france closed theirs . 
  * i do n't see why italy ca n't have geopolitical influence ... * you 're going to have to be specific about what political influence you 're talking about . 
  realistically , the us is going to have influence in italy to some degree no matter what -- it 's large , is the third-largest import and export partner , swaps intelligence , globally has clout , etc. 
   if italy had two or more bases ( even nuclear depots with 90 nukes ) in the usa 's territory probably you wound have the same impression . 
  well , is italy going to pay to operate a base here ? 
  germany has facilities at nas pensacola and holloman afb in the us . 
  i do n't think that any other countries in europe operate facilities here , but there 's also not a lot of reason to -- militarily , there 's not * that * much that would be of concern in north america . 
  other than open space for aviation training , which is what germany does , the chance of military issues coming up or needing to stage out of the us is pretty low . 
  finally , a number of european countries already have territory or other political affiliations over here , so they just operate from that territory -- france has bases on their territory in french guiana and martinique , and the uk has bases on bermuda and in canada . 
  edit : apparently germany [ also has facilities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holloman_air_force_base#german_air_force_flying_training_center ) at fort bliss here that they were going to close , but the german military had their budget unexpectedly cut ( * cough * , * cough * ) and so could n't construct replacement facilities in greece and so will be using it for some years yet . 
  in what way is europe not independent that you would like it to be ? 
   fearing an impeachment might come he 's in rough waters politically over it , but that 's different from being near impeachment . 
   it 's frightening because they suddenly feel the need to legislate something in order to ostracize transgender people . 
  but they are n't . 
  the link says that they 're removing a law that mandated that transgender bathrooms be available , not that they 're banning them .

   the thirty years war when 40 % of the german population died http://www.history.com/topics/thirty-years-war  perhaps 20 percent of germany 's total population perished during the war ... that 's still incredibly high , but it 's not 40 % .

   merkel handing over the keys to schulz would n't be that big of a difference , to be fair . 
  merkel is a centrist politican , schulz a mild centre-left . 
  both a pro-european , both have open views on immigration supposing , for a moment , that one cared about any policies other than eu membership and immigration ... 
  i am pretty dubious that 4chan was particularly influential in helping donald trump win . 
  the us has two pretty similar parties too , you know ... 
   schulz and merkel are literally the same , both pro-eu democrats , one is just slightly worse than the other . 
  well , supposing that you like being in the eu and you like living in a democracy but differ on , say , other policy things ... 
  [ in english it is !, 
  well , * one * possible outcome is that we wind up with a high degree of rigor across the board . 
  i 'm not holding my breath , but , hey ... 
  nope , but it 's a pretty safe bet that military leaders are n't stupid and would n't allocate budget that way . 
  similarly , any military is useless if the first orders they are given in an emergency is to destroy all their equipment , but nobody feels the need to make rules about not doing that kind of thing . 
  and kaliningrad should n't be part of russia . 
  < shrug  and law is a formal approximation of the ability to exert power . 
  does n't invalidate law . 
  weeellll ... that * is * what we did . 
  in a hypothetical world where russia actually collapsed , things would suck for the eu . 
  kind of like if mexico imploded into anarchy it 'd be godawful for us . 
  imagine europe having an 8869km border with somalia . 
  in the contemporary sense of the word , russia is a first-world country , or a developed economy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developed_country  developed countries have post-industrial economies , meaning the service sector provides more wealth than the industrial sector . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_sector_composition russian agricultural sector : 3.9 % of gdp russian industrial sector : 36 % of gdp russian service sector : 60.1 % of gdp . 
  complaining about having part of their country being annexed ? 
  actually , it should have been 3 destroyers -- i mis-read the class name as the name of a single ship when recording that . 
  but , okay , fine , we can count them as frigates . 
  :-p france + uk + italy still make 22 without any other countries ... 
   there is no way that there is a political will to get the spending to 2 % in germany at the moment . 
  well , then it seems like it 's incumbent on germany to make a case at nato for setting the bar somewhere lower . 
  because there 's no way that members are going to be enthusiastic about having different floors , and if you * do n't * have a bar with a public good like defense , you 're going to hit tragedy-of-the-commons , where each individual member says `` oh , it does n't make sense for * me * to spend '' , and so nobody winds up doing it . 
  the global median for 2014 was 1.47 % . 
  2 % is higher than that , but not radically-so . 
  realistically , if it dropped to median and a quarter of the committed budget is going to vanish , my guess is that the us at least is going to want to limit its commitments in some way too . 
   trump is also seen as really negative here , that makes spending arguments like for example to fight the ` war against terror ' even less likely to succeed . 
  okay , but this is n't a new issue . 
  it 's been going back for a long time , and it 's not like it was happening under obama either . 
   nato 's demands that countries buy us military equipment is not good enough . 
  nato does n't demand that : it 's a measurement of the total amount that each country is spending on its military . 
  includes how much is being spent on salaries , paying companies to do r&d , whatever . 
  european countries primarily do use equipment sourced in europe . 
  looking at army equipment , the uk is probably the one that uses the [ most us-sourced stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_equipment_of_the_british_army ) , and even there the strong bulk is uk-sourced . 
  france [ is similar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_equipment_of_the_french_army ) -- a lot of french stuff , with a scattering of other european countries and a scattering of us stuff . 
  well , the number there is a measurement of how much each country is spending on its military . 
  so you can make a european army , but it 's just going to place the eu ( or if it 's not an eu institution , some similar group of countries ) in the same position as nato is in needing to push countries to meet a spending bar . 
  national defense is a public good , public goods run into tragedy of the commons . 
  no , i do n't . 
  nato does n't have a mechanism for kicking countries out . 
   or , you could lower the bullshit % 2 mark . 
  that was a nato consensus agreement , not some number that the us made up . 
  well , my source was using `` active '' ships . 
  mothballed ships have been inactivated and would n't be `` active '' . 
  though i will grant that it 's possible that some navies treat ships as active but in practice are n't usable ... still , that 's not normally what you 'd say when you say `` there are n ships '' -- if anything , i 'm probably being conservative by only counting `` active '' ships . 
  i think that it 's really more likely that / u/propjoe123 is just in error on the destroyer count . 
  well before that . 
  i 'd have to go back to find the year , but it was at least around in 2008 or so , if not significantly earlier ... it 's just that it was being ignored , in part due tongue financial crisis . 
  i 'll believe that climate might limit crops or some areas might be more-fertile than others , but i 'd be very surprised if latvia 's agricultural land is less than a tenth as productive as the horrendously-expensive dutch or danish farmland , though that 's what the listed agricultural pricing would indicate . 
   they do not want to reduce military presence in europe , the us has been pulling troops out of europe for decades . 
  http://index.heritage.org/military/2015/chapter/op-environment/europe/  at its peak in 1953 , the u.s. had approximately 450,000 troops in europe operating across 1,200 sites due to the soviet threat to western europe . 
  during the early 1990s , as part of the so-called peace dividend following the end of the cold war , u.s. troop numbers in europe were slashed . 
  between 1990 and 1993 , the number of u.s. soldiers in europe decreased from 213,000 to 122,000 , but their use actually increased . 
  during that same period , from 1990 to 1993 , the u.s. army in europe supported 42 deployments that required 95,579 personnel . 
    until 2013 , the u.s. army had two heavy bcts ( brigade combat teams ) in europe , the 170th and 172nd bcts in germany ; one airborne infantry bct , the 173rd airborne brigade in italy ; and , one stryker bct , the 2nd armored calvary regiment in germany , permanently based in europe . 
  the deactivation of the 170th bct took place in october 2012 -- slightly earlier than the planned date of 2013 -- marking the end of 50 years of having u.s. combat soldiers in baumholder , germany . 
  the deactivation of the 172nd bct took place in october of 2013 . 
  in all , this meant that more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from europe . 
  these two heavy brigades constituted europe 's primary armored force . 
  their deactivation left a significant capability gap not only in the u.s. ground forces committed to europe but in nato 's capabilities too , a concern noted by the 2005 overseas basing commission , which warned against removing a heavy bct from europe . 
    when the decision was announced in 2012 to bring two brigade combat teams home , the obama administration said that the reduction in capability would be offset with a u.s.-based bct that would , when necessary , rotate forces , normally at the battalion level , to europe for training missions . 
  this decision unsettled america 's allies because a rotational battalion does not offer the same capability as two bcts permanently based in europe . 
  today , only 67,000 u.s. troops remain permanently based in europe .40   the u.s. is on pace to have only 17 main operating bases left on the continent ,41 primarily in germany , italy , the united kingdom , turkey , and spain . 
  the number of u.s. installations in europe has declined steadily since the cold war when , for example , in 1990 , the u.s. army alone had more than 850 sites in europe . 
  --  the `` nagging '' happens mostly for the benefit of domestic audience , or at least it did with previous administrations . 
  ... why the hell would the us want to have resources tied down in europe when europe could be maintaining its own capacity ? 
  let me turn that around -- rather , it 's the promises of increased military spending that have been insincere , and on the other side of the atlantic .
