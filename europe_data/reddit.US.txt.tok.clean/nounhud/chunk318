  also , i assume that france could have used shipping to reach mali and cut an agreement with some country to obtain passage . 
  france used the transports because they were the best option available , not because there was no other way to maintain an expeditionary force . 
   there 's not even 20 destroyers for all of the eu combined that ca n't be right . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_french_navy_ships france has 12 destroyers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_royal_navy_ships the uk has 6 destroyers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_german_navy_ships germany has 1 destroyer . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_italian_navy_ships italy has 4 destroyers . 
  that alone exceeds your 19-or-less limit . 
  that being said , note that nato-in-europe is n't precisely the same thing as the eu , and further that unless somehow brexit gets canceled , the uk leaving will further decrease eu capabilities . 
  this was a reaffirmation of a commitment that was originally made -- and ignored by most nato members -- well back . 
  let 's go back to 2013 , where we 'd already been complaining about missing the 2 % target for years : http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/world/europe/europes-shrinking-military-spending-under-scrutiny.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=4b80fcb7dd5918cd0f155bc30a35ab68&amp;gwt=pay  brussels -- alarmed by years of cuts to military spending , the nato secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , issued a dire public warning to european nations , noting that together they had slashed $ 45 billion , or the equivalent of germany 's entire military budget , endangering the alliance 's viability , its mission and its relationship with the united states . 
    that was two years ago . 
  since then , with the afghan war winding down and pressure from the european union to limit budget deficits , europe has only cut deeper . 
    now , as president obama wrestles with his own huge budget deficit and military costs , the responsibility for keeping nato afloat has fallen disproportionately onto the united states , an especially untenable situation as priorities shift to asia . 
    the united states finances nearly three-quarters of nato 's military spending , up from 63 percent in 2001 . 
  and yet among the alliance 's 28 nations , experts note , only the united states , britain and greece are meeting nato 's own spending guidelines of 2 percent of gross domestic product . 
  even britain and france -- the two leading european nations willing to project military might -- are slipping further . 
  france says that by 2014 it may cut deeper still -- to just 1.3 percent of g.d.p. , down from 1.9 percent this year . 
  by comparison , the united states spent 4.8 percent of its g.d.p. 
  on the military in 2011 . 
  it is not possible any more to scale up military capabilities meaningfully simply on-demand by conscripting a bunch of riflemen -- a country ca n't say `` oh , i 'd like a military now ... i 'll just increase spending so that next year i 'll be at par '' . 
  it 's something that requires maintaining an industry to support a military and to keep a wide range of specialists familiar with complex systems . 
  ignoring for a moment whether-or-not the us has good justification for spending well above 2 % , / u/jtalin claimed that the us was `` very much fine with until now '' . 
  / u/cirquedufuder 's point was that this was clearly not the case -- it 's been a point that the us has been complaining for many years , and been ignored on , with spending heading down and way from 2 % rather than up and towards it . 
  national defense is a public good . 
  that means that it 's subject to falling prey to tragedy of the commons due to any one individual failing to put forth effort , which expands to members cutting their own spending across the board unless there 's some sort of constraint that compels people to maintain a level -- that 's what the 2 % level is about . 
  such a level both needs to exist and there has to be some way to get people to conform to the level . 
  in your country , it 's why you pay taxes for a military , rather than contributing to a volunteer fund . 
  in the absence of any sort of pressure , each european country has an interest in cannibalizing their military budget for other things `` because one country 's spending does n't matter all that much and i sure would like to go spend * my * military budget on something else '' . 
  the net result is that capabilities collapse across the board . 
  the eu * could * compel military spending , but it has n't acquired taxation as a competency , and in any event , the issue would span non-eu members as well . 
  the us benefits from being in a military alliance with europe -- it makes both militarily better-off -- but it does not want to be responsible for handling all of europe 's military affairs . 
  the us did n't object to supporting france and the uk in libya , and to contribute its capabilities , but it did expect europe to be driving efforts that europe wants done , not to just lug in the us and then expect the us to handle things , and i think that that is a more-than-fair expectation . 
  europe should reasonably have the ability to do things like provide air defense and be able to stage military operations in its neighborhood . 
  it is not reasonable for france and the uk and a couple of countries in eastern europe to be the only ones contributing to europe 's military capabilities at par . 
  this is not simply a change on paper , a `` we will totally gain efficiency by reorganizing people and calling them the eu army '' . 
  if europe wants to do reorganization , fine , but a `` we have this amazing reorganization thing planned '' is n't a response to `` we agreed to commit to 2 % and you are n't doing so '' . 
  finally , yes , the us could fight a war in europe . 
  but it ca n't do that * and * maintain the ability to simultaneously fight elsewhere at the same level ... as as you recall from world war ii , countries opportunistically wage war when other countries are tied up on the other side of the world . 
  the us is scaling down from the ability to single-handedly fight a two-front global war . 
  the us is no longer half of the world 's economy -- like the eu , it 's about a quarter of the global economy . 
  the us already has commitments elsewhere , and military spending is n't purely fungible -- whether you spend on ships or sam installations is n't interchangeable . 
  the us used to provide a lot of resources ... but that was also in an era where europe was cut in half by the cold war and the remainder was economically much smaller than the us . 
   you never , never , respond positively to public ultimatums if you want to keep an equal footing in the relationship . 
  well , the `` let 's make an agreement '' approach and the `` let 's spend a decade nagging about people reducing spending instead of increasing it after making that agreement '' approach has n't been working . 
  i do n't think that there 's a reason to believe that `` go spend another decade nagging '' is a better strategy than it was over the last decade . 
   you figuratively voted for a person who wants to remove your right to exist . 
  your above link says that they removed a guarantee of transgender bathrooms in public schools . 
  which i 'm sure is irritating , but not quite a `` let 's round up the homos and send 'em to the gas chambers like in 1939 '' type affair . 
  [ continued from parent ] and let me add a bigger and more-straightforward argument against this being a realistic concern . 
  nato has no reason to `` go conquer russia '' . 
  aside from russia 's -- i would argue ill-advised -- screwing around with its neighbors recently , major powers have shown no interest in wars of conquest for quite a while . 
  the us has overwhelming military dominance in the world today . 
  it could certainly go out and annex land pretty much anywhere in the world . 
  does it do so ? 
  in fact , during the [ * pax americana * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pax_americana ) period , the us has * given up * substantial amounts of territory , like the philippines and the [ ttpi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trust_territory_of_the_pacific_islands ) . 
  is that because the us is some sort of angelic paragon of virtue who refrains from pure selflessness ? 
  no , it 's because wars of conquest in today 's world are idiotic . 
  the bulk of wealth is n't in farmland any more , or even mining , the sorts of things that you can capture in wars where you try grabbing territory . 
  if it were , russia , which controls the most territory of any country on earth , would be top dog among countries . 
  the bottleneck for any advanced economy is skilled human labor . 
  it 's really hard to `` capture '' that : people tend to just leave , as happened when russia invaded and annexed karelia from finland . 
  if you want to keep people from leaving , you need to set up a berlin wall or korean dmz type situation and hold them in bondage , and i think that we 've all pretty clearly had it demonstrated to us over the past century how well that works . 
  germany and the uk and the us and france and canada and all those countries-that-aren ` t-russia who are n't off grabbing territory operate the way they do not because they 're altruistic , but because they 're working with the economic constraints that matter today -- they want to attract and train skilled workers and tax the labor of those workers , not sit on top of a bunch of land somewhere . 
  ... okay , now i 'm really confused by what you 're saying . 
  the [ navigation acts that i know about ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navigation_acts ) were a major way that the uk extracted wealth from the american colonies -- they 'd grant a monopoly on trade with the american colonies to a uk-based company , tax that company , and then the company with the monopoly would charge the colonies more than competing companies . 
  we learn about 'em in our history classes in school , because they were a part of the process that led to the american revolution . 
  i do n't see how that would fit in with crimea and donbas serving as [ buffer states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buffer_state ) , which can be used to extend `` trading space for time '' in a war . 
  so i 'm assuming that you 're proposing two separate things here -- that the seized territory would be useful to russia as both as buffer states and as a place where russian monopolies could be imposed to make money for russian companies . 
  first , i have a hard time buying into any economic argument , just due to scale . 
  russia [ simply does not do enough trade with even ukraine as a whole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_russia ) , much less the part that russia has seized . 
  the conflict has disrupted russia-eu trade , and the eu is much more important to russia as a trading partner -- germany alone is a more-important trading partner to russia than ukraine . 
  second , russia has not , at least in the past , imposed any such economic restrictions on ukraine or parts of ukraine . 
  ukraine was able to trade with other countries . 
  so i 'm assuming that you 're proposing that russia did not want the pre-invasion status quo , and had always intended to change it . 
  it 's true that if ukraine joined the [ eurasian economic union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_economic_union ) -- which russia * does * want ukraine to join -- russia ( and , i assume , the other members of the customs union ... not sure how degree of influence is determined or how internal politics work in the eeu ) would have some degree of control over ukraine 's ability to trade with countries outside the customs union in that members can set external tariffs . 
  but this does n't buy russia the ability to grant monopolies to russian companies , and assuming that it continues to serve as a customs union , anything that russia imposes on ukraine would also be imposed on russia . 
  while i 'm not expert on the eeu , my vague assumption was that russia 's long-term interests with the eeu were very different , more aimed at doing what the eu has done as it transitioned from the eec -- to work towards deeper integration of members , to try to build up a new , post-soviet political bloc . 
   russian goods ca n't compete with western goods , so forcing people to buy your good is vital for them . 
  first , russia 's been seeing a trade surplus , not a trade deficit . 
  second , while i 'm not familiar with russian goods ( which i 'm assuming do n't have a great reputation in austria ? 
  ) , i will assert that they can compete with western goods at some price point . 
  if russia runs a trade deficit continuously , the ruble will inevitably fall and cut into the costs of russian industry 's inputs . 
  it will do so until russian goods become competitive enough for russia to maintain the [ balance of trade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balance_of_trade ) . 
   also russia needs to have control other energy supply corridors to use their gas and oil leverage on europe this does n't make sense to me either . 
  first , control of crimea and donbas does n't provide russia with access to anything . 
  [ here 's an oil pipeline map of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/druzhba_pipeline#/media/file:oil_pipelines_in_europe.png ) . 
  there are n't any pipelines in crimea , and the only thing that control of the eastern bits of ukraine provide is transport to , well , the rest of ukraine . 
  and it looks like russia already has pipeline that runs through belarus , which i 'm assuming could be enlarged . 
  second , russia does n't exert pressure on the eu via controlling * transport * of energy . 
  it does so by controlling * production * of that energy . 
  i assume that russia building alternate pipelines probably has more to do with trying to politically-separate ukraine from the eu than in ensuring that russia can exert pressure on europe . 
  third , if russia were honestly concerned that ukraine might honestly limit its ability to exert pressure on the eu via controlling energy supplies -- maybe ukraine simply issues an ultimatum to russia saying `` if you want us to let * any * energy through , then you need to ship far more and let us stockpile vast amounts of oil and gas so that * we * are the ones with the on-off switch '' -- it 'd be far less-costly for russia to enlarge or construct more pipeline via another route than to start invading pieces of countries . 
  hell , i 'd assume that starting a hot war with ukraine would be a really good way to interfere with russia 's ability to provide energy to the eu . 
   and control prices as much as they can if shit hits fan . 
  i 'm not sure precisely what you 're envisioning in a `` shit hits the fan '' situation , but it seems like being in a hot war with ukraine and an economic war with the eu would be russia simply immediately jumping into a `` shit hits the fan '' case . 
  there 's no sense for russia in throwing shit into the fan to maybe somehow avoid shit hitting the fan . 
   russia can defend itself against conventional western invasion pretty much the same way he defended against german and french invasions and now they have new weapon : thousands of artillery pieces to make life hell for every invader of flat russian western land . 
  so you 're talking about a hypothetical nato-wants-to-invade-and-conquer-russia scenario that does n't go nuclear ? 
  russia dealt with german and french invasions by leveraging the difficulty of logistics through to russia .
