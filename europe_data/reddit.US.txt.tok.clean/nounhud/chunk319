  both of them were invading russia with most logistics carried out via horse , which required bulky horse food as fuel that eventually itself ties up much of the logistics chain . 
  none of that exists today -- transport of goods is far easier . 
  hell , none of that even existed by the end of world war ii , after the us had produced vast amounts of vehicles and shipped them to the soviet union , which was why the soviet union was able to invade germany in the other direction without the same logistics issues . 
  the world is simply a much smaller place today . 
  the us [ regularly wages conflicts with multi-thousand-mile-long supply lines ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/c17_aircraft_alt.jpg ) . 
  if russia winds up in an actual , non-nuclear war with nato -- particularly one of the sort that you 're describing , where nato was actually an aggressor , and thus has the initiative -- and loses the air war , russia 's going to lose the war . 
  it does n't matter how much artillery russia has -- they 're just targets from the air . 
  plus , a country reverts to the 1800s as soon as its power production capacity is knocked out from the air . 
  hell , worse , because industry is tuned to having modern capacity available . 
  you can look at past recent conflicts that the us and coalition forces have been involved in , and it works the same way -- they do n't go send in a bunch of ground soldiers from the get go . 
  the first phase is an air war , which starts off by knocking out air defenses with specialized tools like cruise missiles and stealth aircraft , and then moves into knocking out any remaining military ground targets that can be hit from the air . 
  after that , there 's a ground war , where ground troops move in with air support to hold territory . 
  in the gulf war , the air war [ started jan 17 , the ground war kicked off feb 24 , and ceasefire was complete mar 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_gulf_war ) . 
  in libya , the [ air war started mar 19 , air defenses were wiped out by mar 24 , and then it was a matter of clobbering anything else that was left from the air ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_2011_libyan_civil_war#commencement_of_nato_operations ) -- they never even bothered to send in ground troops at all .

  also , if you do n't , [ hawaii 's state flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_hawaii ) is going to look pretty darn archaic . 
  to say nothing of australia , new zealand ... 
  except for greece , which is spending more than it can afford . 
  probably more-meaningfully , with about a quarter of the eu military budget likely to walk out the door in two years because you guys and the uk wo n't kiss and make up . 
   foreigners ca n't buy land in \u00c5land . 
  [ holy cow , til ] ( https://tranio.com/traniopedia/tips/european_limitations_on_foreign_property_purchases/ ) . 
   in europe , no law prohibits foreign citizens from buying property but certain countries have put limitations on this right , often with regards to residency rights , property type or buyer category . 
  for example , only residents can buy real estate in iceland and liechtenstein . 
  in andorra , hungary , denmark , poland and malta , foreign investors can only buy property after receiving approval from the local authorities . 
    [ big list and table of various restrictions on purchases by foreigners across europe shows up ] damn , latvian farmland is [ cheap as hell , too ] ( http://cibusfarmlandclub.com/farmland-prices-europe ) , like 2000 euros per hectare ... but ca n't buy unless you 're a citizen from an eu or eea member . 
  i do n't know about `` content '' , but i 'd be a lot happier . 
  besides , pence is a social conservative . 
  if he had any major impact , it 'd be on domestic stuff in the us ... why would you object to him ? 
  they presumably thought that it was a ukrainian military aircraft . 
  i mean , they lied about it afterwards , but surely you do n't think that mh-17 was an intentional target ? 
   it 's vital for russian interests to have control over so called ` buffer states ' i do n't particularly see why . 
  if russia were involved in a nuclear war , making `` buffer states '' out of russia 's neighbors would be irrelevant to the outcome : the results would largely be decided in the first half hour or so of the war . 
  if russia were involved in a conventional war with nato , any buffer states would have effectively no bearing on the outcome : that 's not a winnable conflict for russia . 
  the ukrainian public was opposed to nato membership until after russia attacked ukraine . 
  they wanted into the eu , not nato . 
  http://www.gallup.com/poll/167927/crisis-ukrainians-likely-nato-threat.aspx  ukrainians may support their new government 's plans to prohibit the country from joining military alliances , which would effectively end its six-year pursuit of nato membership . 
  residents in may 2009 were more than twice as likely to see nato as a threat ( 40 % ) than as protection ( 17 % ) . 
  one in three said it was neither . 
  https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/13/surprise-ukraine-loves-nato/  a recent poll by the democratic initiatives foundation made headlines in ukraine : 64 percent of respondents said they would vote for nato accession in a hypothetical referendum . 
  ( only 28 percent would oppose . ), 
  this result marks a landslide -- and rapid -- shift in ukrainians ' perception of the european security architecture . 
  in 2009 , only 21 percent of ukrainians said they supported nato accession , while almost 60 percent were against . 
  as recently as the fall of 2013 , before the euromaidan revolution , two-thirds of ukrainians could n't envision ukraine being part of nato . 
  my assumption is that ukrainians saw the prospect of russia attacking them as being implausible until it happened ( hell , i 'd have said that it was implausible too ) . 
  they did n't want * military protection * -- they wanted economic growth , access to eu educational institutions , and access to labor markets in the eu countries .

    53 % join the eu , 28 % against join the eu , 8 % would not vote , 11 % do not know . 
  http://euromaidanpress.com/2016/05/28/why-do-ukrainians-want-to-be-in-europe/  the poll also revealed that more than a half of ukrainians think ukraine will benefit from joining the european union . 
  according to the poll , ukrainians consider the opportunity for visa-free travel to foreign countries , increasing quality of life and free access to eu universities for youth as the main benefits of joining the eu . 
  people here have already dug up most of the trivia that i know , so i 'll go out and find some more interesting tidbits via google to contribute some : * country has constructed sufficient nuclear fallout shelters to handle entire population of country . 
  every swiss citizen is required to have one or access to one . 
  * all new laws subject to cancellation via popular referendum . 
  * i 'm just going to quote this one : `` swiss law prohibits owning ` soclal ' pets unless you have two of them -- this makes it illegal in switzerland to keep just one guinea pig , mouse , ferret , fish , canary , pig or other social creature . 
  with the world 's most stringent animal welfare laws , switzerland judges isolation for such animals as abuse . 
  this has sparked services such as a lawyer who defends animals and a pet-renting service in case one of a pair dies and the owner wants to avoid a pet-buying cycle to abide by the pairing law . '', 
  * the german township of [ b\u00fcsingen am hochrhein ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%bcsingen_am_hochrhein ) is entirely surrounded by switzerland and as a result is not part of the eu customs union . 
  the italian township of [ campione d'italia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/campione_d%27italia ) is another exclave in switzerland . 
  * most swiss electrical generation is hydroelectric . 
   a disgusting system that forced orphans and children from poor families into slavery . 
  < reads link   in a practice that lasted in switzerland until 1981 , tens of thousands of children and teenagers were forcibly removed from their families , who for one reason or another were deemed by the authorities to be incapable of caring for them . 
  i 'm pretty sure that pretty much all developed countries have a similar system . 
  so the issue would be whether farm families adopted children with an aim of getting free work from them ? 
  i mean ... farms have seen children in the family as free labor since time immemorable . 
  that 's not exactly new . 
   `` i have sent those messages to the inner circle and encouraged that they communicate with mr. wilders , '' congressman steve king , an iowa republican , told politico in a phone interview . 
  `` it 's important for the trump administration and for this white house team to be engaged in an effort to restore western civilization . '' `` restore western civilization '' ? 
  unless he 's talking about the fact that the west has secularized , i 'm not sure how western civilization has fallen . 
  if he 's talking about secularization , i 'm dubious that most people feel that it needs to be restored . 
  if they wanted to be more religious , they 'd ... well , they 'd go be religious themselves , on their own . 
  they do n't need steve king to do that for them . 
   at the same time , the eu should get a proper foreign minister , a finance minister and a proper european budget . 
  a vote about verhofstadt 's proposals will take place later this week . 
  that whizzed by in the article , but the foreign minister bit seems like a big deal . 
  so what would this entail ? 
  if you create a foreign minister , i assume that you would also elevate foreign affairs to the eu level , have a common foreign policy . 
  no sense in having a foreign minister with no authority , right ? 
  unlike the eu army stuff ( which i do not think is very practical until a common foreign policy exists ) , having a common foreign policy * would * be a very straightforward move towards federalization . 
   in fact in my opinion nato has enough to blame for , with their aggressive policies towards russia . 
  how exactly is nato being aggressive towards russia ? 
  honestly , having officials encourage parts of the uk to break off is about as offensive as having people like farage enthuse about the eu splintering . 
  and i 'd add that farage has nowhere near the position that this guy does . 
  this is really not kosher . 
  if it happens , then it happens and you do the process then . 
  but you 're not building good relations by driving this . 
   well , do we not give refugees the opportunity to wear/do what they want in the western world ? 
  not anything that they want . 
  they get to do things that do n't violate the law in the western world , though . 
   why would you openly support an anti-feminist , muslim nation ? 
  probably because the world is n't culturally homogenous and international relations are n't primarily-driven by social activism . 
  are you sure ? 
  wikiquote lists it as a real quote along with the primary source . 
  it 's possible that the primary source is incorrect ... https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/mustafa_kemal_atat%c3%bcrk  i have no religion , and at times i wish all religions at the bottom of the sea . 
  he is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government ; it is as if he would catch his people in a trap .

  let them worship as they will ; every man can follow his own conscience , provided it does not interfere with sane reason or bid him against the liberty of his fellow-men . 
  -- quoted in atat\u00fcrk : the biography of the founder of modern turkey , by andrew mango ; `` in a book published in 1928 , grace ellison quotes [ atat\u00fcrk ] , presumably in 1926-27 '' , grace ellison turkey today ( london : hutchinson , 1928 ) grace ellison appears to be an englishwoman , so i assume that you 're not saying that she 's the source . 
  mango was also a brit . 
  hmm . 
  i think that this might be more a matter of how one phrases it .
