   how about protecting eu borders and not having to be dependent on turkey who comes in the eu in the first place ... 
  the eu border is the greek coast . 
  if you intercept someone on the water , you have to do something with them . 
   the whole system russia advocated is now dead and forgotten , except in north korea . 
  cuba , vietnam , and laos all [ have theoretically marxist-leninist systems ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/communism.svg ) , though all have been transitioning to market systems to varying degrees . 
  according to this map ( and my vague memory ) , north korea does n't consider its economy marxist-leninist any more . 
  state-run , yes ... * [ wikipedia : economy of vietnam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_vietnam ) * [ wikipedia : economy of laos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_laos ) * [ wikipedia : economy of cuba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_cuba ) * [ wikipedia : economy of north korea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_north_korea ), 
  hmm . 
  < pokes around for further expansion on the topic  http://www.soviet-empire.com/ussr/viewtopic.php?f=125&amp;t=52665  you could move around freely but not change residence freely , not for any sinister reason , but because there was a housing shortage . 
  and in eastern bloc countries outside ussr , there was no propiska system as far as i know . 
  [ snip ]  i know a fair bit about this topic from studying it at school and talking to people from the eastern bloc . 
  i will give a brief rundown of what i know and what i have heard from various people . 
    in the ussr , one was required to have a residence stamp in their internal passport , which was given based on the city where they had been assigned a job . 
  university students in moscow always feared that they would be sent away from the city to somewhere in the eastern part of the country once job assignment time came around . 
  it was very rare that strings could be pulled for most students and many ended up in siberia or central asia . 
    from what i understand vacation was possible to other cities , but finding work in them was difficult due to the residency stamp issue and the fact that job assignment was centrally controlled . 
  although odd jobs and `` low level '' work , such as sanitation work , could be found for those not wanting to participate in the standard system . 
    with that said , a similar situation existed throughout most of eastern europe , but there were movements of people who just roamed their respective countries . 
  in the csr for example , there was something called the tramp movement , which was comprised of those who did not want to participate with the state . 
  they roamed through the forests of czechoslovakia and worked odd jobs on the side . 
  out in moravia , i know that there were many houses that would feed and house tramps when they came into town . 
  otherwise they remained in the forest , with little to no challenge from the authorities . 
  the tramp movement still exists in the czech republic to this day and is comprised of primarily the same people looking for their nostalgic past . 
  i have stayed at tramp hostels , but never talked to them . 
    movement was also possible depending on what you did for work . 
  i one time spent 3 days on a train with a former engineer , who turned test driver for moskvitch . 
  since he was a test driver , he drove in rally races all over the ussr and rarely went back to his home base in moscow . 
    however , people normally stayed in their city of work , and left only for holidays and time off work . 
   researchers coming to the `` wrong '' conclusion would be jailed or shot , and all of this contributed to soviet science falling behind eventually . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/science_and_technology_in_the_soviet_union https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suppressed_research_in_the_soviet_union some bright spots , but a lot of areas where either ideology or politics involved themselves , and scientists in the ussr were n't able to collaborate with the outside . 
  ` course , i guess you could say the same about ideology in the west to some extent . 
  a lot of ethics restrictions got put into place , people objected to biological experiments on human material ( which is still with us in the form of cloning and stem cell arguments ) ; dunno if the soviet union had the same . 
  i suspect that anti-communism biased history and economics study to some degree . 
  if you hypothetically had a perfect command-economy oracle who could tell everyone just the right , most-appropriate thing to do , then you could have it beat out the market , and at one point , there were a substantial number of people who had high hopes for command economies relative to market economies . 
  if you live in the eu , does n't schengen and freedom of movement/labor make your life more pleasant ? 
  * that 's * not what an actual friend should be doing !, 
   the dude 's wearing a military uniform on the google images that exist of ( what i assume is ) him , so it might have had something to do with him being in the armed forces . 
  the crime was against an active-duty member of the military on a military base . 
   on a february evening in 1995 , he kidnapped a female recruit at a base near here , raped her and bludgeoned her to death with a tire iron . 
  because the crime occurred on a military facility , jones was tried in lubbock federal court . 
   i do n't think there is enough support there to do that . 
  imagine that germany 's economy suffered from levels of corruption on par with that of some other countries , and you were facing some route to reform as the only way to develop the economy . 
  would you accept that as being a particularly-rapid way to achieve it ? 
   the biggest reason a cashless society is interesting to policticans is because its the only way they be able t effectively use negative interest . 
  i 'd think that a lot of data on financial transactions would make it much harder to steal funds . 
  his point was that it 's viable to be internally-displaced in ukraine and be safe , whereas it arguable that it is not viable to be internally-displaced in syria and be safe . 
  this is going to be a new and interesting challenge . 
  how about an emergency move to a cashless society for the next 40 years ? 
  it was something that i was wondering about the possibility of in greece as a jump-start to move the black economy to a white one , but ukraine probably is facing even larger concerns . 
   and calling russia now a democracy is kinda stretch . 
  it is more of an autocracy that masquerades as a democracy , although this is probably the closest russia has gotten to a real democracy . 
  surely russians have more political freedom today than they did in , say , the 1980s ? 
  i mean , corruption , yes , weak economy , yes . 
  while some of the ex-soviet states have dramatically-improved economically relative to their former state , russia has n't . 
  but there are multi-party elections . 
  while there might be some violence or intimidation of the opposition , i do n't hear people saying `` i am * afraid * to support another party '' , but rather `` i see no compelling alternative choices '' . 
  while there might be some level of vote fraud , it 's not the kind of vote-rigging that makes for an absurd election . 
  i could not say that russia is not a democracy . 
  russia has problems , but * not being a democracy * ? 
  according to wikipedia , russia 's gdp is now below the combined gdp of bavaria and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  edit : neither of which are the economically-largest of germany 's states . 
  the british empire saw a far-larger implosion than the soviet one ( albeit a more-or-less planned one ) , and yet / r/unitedkingdom and / r/russia sound very different . 
  edit : well , planned aside from our secession . 
   citizens of contemporary russia blame last soviet leader mikhail gorbachev ( 27 % ) and his team for failure to carry through the people 's free will expressed at the referendum for preserving the soviet union , as well as the supreme authorities in general ( 17 % ) , first russian president boris yeltsin and his close associates ( 13 % ) , the poll results show . 
  regardless of how gorbachev handled things , [ his predecessors had created a pretty screwed-up environment ] ( https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/06/20/everything-you-think-you-know-about-the-collapse-of-the-soviet-union-is-wrong/ ) .

  `` literate-people '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany  the mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a german woman aged 40 to 75 had , was closely linked to her educational achievement . 
  [ 8 ] in western germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless . 
  26 % of those groups stated they were childless , while 16 % of those having an intermediate education , and 11 % of those having compulsory education , stated the same . 
  in eastern germany however , 9 % of the most educated women of that age group and 7 % of those who had an intermediary education were childless , while 12 % of those having only compulsory education were childless . 
    the reason for that east-western difference is that the gdr had an `` educated mother scheme '' and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated . 
  it did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should `` present at least one child to socialism '' and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents . 
  the government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so . 
  in 1986 38 % of all women , who were about to graduate from college , were mothers of at least one child and additional 14 % were pregnant and 43 % of all men , who were about to graduate from college , were fathers of at least one child . 
  there was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the berlin wall . 
  nowadays , [ when ? ], 
  5 % of those about to graduate from college are parents . 
  you mean `` litple '' write like this ? 
  i do n't think that it is . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_trafficking  human trafficking is the trade of humans , most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery , forced labor , or commercial sexual exploitation for the trafficker or others . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] this may encompass providing a spouse in the context of forced marriage , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] or the extraction of organs or tissues , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] including for surrogacy and ova removal . 
  [ 8 ] human trafficking can occur within a country or trans-nationally . 
  human trafficking is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim 's rights of movement through coercion and because of their commercial exploitation . 
  [ snip ]  human trafficking differs from [ people smuggling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people_smuggling ) , which involves a person voluntarily requesting or hiring another individual to covertly transport them across an international border , usually because the smuggled person would be denied entry into a country by legal channels . 
  though illegal , there may be no deception or coercion involved . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accomplice  under the english common law , an accomplice is a person who actively participates in the commission of a crime , even if they take no part in the actual criminal offense . 
  for example , in a bank robbery , the person who points the gun at the teller and asks for the money is guilty of armed robbery . 
  anyone else directly involved in the commission of the crime , such as the lookout or the getaway car driver , is an accomplice , even if in the absence of an underlying offense keeping a lookout or driving a car would not be an offense . 
  in the us , illegally crossing a border is a crime called `` improper entry '' , though european countries might have various different terms for it . 
  there are also apparently [ explicit laws in some countries in europe ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29899231/ ) dealing with assisting in illegal entry . 
  in france :  the associations cite an article in the code governing foreigners ' right to remain in france that forbids anyone from facilitating or trying to facilitate `` the entry , movement or irregular ( illegal ) stay of a foreigner in france . '', 
  doing so is punishable by up to five years in prison and a 30,000-euro fine . 
  china 's at 1.7 as of 2013 . 
  the larger countries with high fertility rates are in sub-saharan africa : ethiopia at 4.5 and 90m population , nigeria at 5.7 and 184m population , the democratic republic of the congo at 6.1 and 77m population , tanzania at 5.2 and 48m , uganda at 5.9 and 35m population .
