  i agree that people do n't normally rally if something is not up for change . 
  but i think that people * do * rally against things changing -- take , say , britons rallying against nhs funding being reduced -- and that 's essentially what this is . 
  you could say something like `` rally against the threat to the eu '' . 
   germans or frenchs in english , the `` german '' [ demonym ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demonym ) is a valid singular ( `` a german '' ) and plural ( `` germans '' ) noun . 
  however , you can not do this for someone from france -- you ca n't have a `` a french '' or `` several frenches '' . 
  `` french '' as a noun may only be used as a [ collective noun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_noun ) . 
  you 're stuck with choosing one of `` a frenchman '' , `` a frenchwoman '' , `` a french person '' to refer to one , `` some frenchmen '' , `` some frenchwomen '' , or `` some french people '' to refer to several people , or `` the french '' to refer to the whole of the french people . 
   we are living in a museum built by long dead giants , none of the roads ahead are bright . 
  be concrete . 
  what do you actually * mean * by this ? 
  it 's got emotional content , but i do n't see any way in which this is the case . 
  heck , the eu is relatively young as organizations go . 
  the us gets poked at a bit for being young ( which ... it actually is n't , if you go by peaceful transitions of power ) , but it 's much older than the eu . 
  if the eu is a museum , then i 'm not sure what countries you consider vibrant and young -- there are precious few countries that are newer than it . 
  south sudan ? 
  i mean , the same would be true of any protest , right ? 
  but surely one would n't throw out all protests because of this . 
  if there are enough people , they wo n't be a significant portion of it . 
  it seems to me that that time , it was a hostile conquest rather than countries merging militaries , and that the rallies were in favor of ethnic division rather than ethnic merging . 
  sort of the opposite of this . 
   europe does n't have open borders , but what it 's been doing the last few years is close enough . 
  i do n't think that it 's close at all . 
  there are a couple things that it 's been doing in the past few years . 
  you 've got : * the right of free movement for citizens of an eu member . 
  * the schengen area * illegal immigration over the med i do n't think that any of these qualify as an open-border policy . 
  the first two do lower borders , but only between a set of participating states . 
  certainly someone in the us would n't say that the us is `` open border '' , though normally people can move freely between states . 
  the third is not open-border -- it just means that an elevated number of people are breaking the law . 
  hell , it 's a fraction of the illegal immigrant population of the us -- the us has about eleven million illegal immigrants , and it [ looks like the eu ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/365637/scandal-of-uk-s-863-000-illegal-immigrants-one-in-four-of-the-eu-s-total ) , with over a time-and-a-half the us 's legal population , has less than half the us 's illegal immigrant population . 
  well , that 's easy to address . 
  essentially nobody -- maybe a few libertarians ? 
  -- is advocating for open borders , so we can pretty firmly establish that we do n't need to worry about globalism in that sense of the word . 
   what right do you have to force everyone to pay for it well , if people vote for it , i expect that that 's where the right comes from , same as anything else they vote to pay for . 
   even those who are firmly opposed to your globalist , regressive-leftist agenda ? 
  people seem to use `` globalism '' to refer to `` free trade '' in a negative sense . 
  i think that free trade 's a pretty good idea , so i guess that i 'm a globalist . 
   `` erdo\u011fanophobia '' has existed in europe for a long time , based on islamophobia and xenophobia , turkey 's european union minister \u00d6mer \u00c7elik said in an article published on feb. 11 . 
  odd that people would bother to * specifically name erdogan * if it 's not specifically erdogan at issue . 
   well we made the game so if we call it football its football . 
  hmm . 
  but we made the game and we call it football !, 
  https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/mustafa_kemal_atat%c3%bcrk  men , i am not ordering you to attack . 
  i am ordering you to die . 
  in the time that it takes us to die , other forces and commanders can come and take our place . 
  -- orders to the 57th infantry regiment , at the battle of gallipoli ( 25 april 1915 ), 
  that 's ... pretty clever actually . 
  they might have gotten six , and that 's [ already in west virginia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/six,_west_virginia ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_dictator  during the film 's production , the british government had announced that it would prohibit its exhibition in the united kingdom , in keeping with its appeasement policy concerning nazi germany . 
  [ 30 ] but by the time the film was released , the uk was at war with germany and the film was welcomed in part for its obvious propaganda value . 
  in 1941 , london 's prince of wales theatre screened its uk premiere . 
  the film had been banned in many parts of europe , and the theatre 's owner , alfred esdaile , was apparently fined for showing it . 
  apparently some things are constant ; global war only changes whether it 's the parodies or the non-parodies that are banned . 
   french presidential frontrunner emmanuel macron is being targeted by russian media and internet attacks from within russia with the goal of helping the election campaigns of his pro-moscow rivals , his party chief said on monday . 
  not the same thing as in the us . 
  * [ the us intelligence community 's assessment was that there was russian state involvement . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-blames-putins-personal-grudge-against-her-for-election-interference/2016/12/16/12f36250-c3be-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html?utm_term=.6eb769ef7cc3 ) that 's * not * the same thing as here , where it 's simply `` from within russia '' . 
  russia has many millions of people . 
  * writing material critical of macron in the media and on social media is different from breaking into computer systems to try to obtain damaging material -- `` internet attacks '' is unfortunately ambiguous , but i 've seen nothing to indicate that this involved breakins . 
  every country has a press and social media that writes material critical of people that they do n't like . 
  there 's no shortage of unhappiness about putin on / r/europe , for example . 
  i doubt that nato would : nato would require consensus to act as a whole and i have a very hard time believing that there would be consensus to become involved in a china/russia conflict . 
  maybe some nato members might do something not under the banner of nato , but ... 
  account is 15 hours old . 
  is water wet when it 's frozen ? 
  i have yet to see germany actually say that it would be spending 2 percent . 
  what i have seen is conversations that head off into claiming that reorganization would save so much money that it would be unnecessary to spend 2 percent . 
  she 's got a people that are the opposite of apathetic . 
   seriously , this is why britain and america should 've adopted 2-round polling . 
  ... on a yes-no referendum like brexit ? 
  i mean , if you want to complaint that the thing should have used ranked choice voting and actually split up the leave uptions , fine by me -- that seems quite legit . 
  but that 's kinda a different matter ... and as for trump being elected , while * any * changes to the structure of the voting system could have changed that , i do n't think that a two-round scheme would be particularly important . 
  trump could have shown up under two-round as well . 
  sharks with [ nuclear-pumped lasers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_pumped_laser ) on their heads are the * real * future . 
   no we 're not . 
  the eu was not meant to be a military based organisation . 
  that 's why you have countries that are either neutral ( ireland ) or independent ( sweden ) in the eu . 
  was the eu meant to be a confederation or ultimately federate ? 
   i 'm tired of the excessive influence of germany and when the relation of power between germany and france was more balanced things worked much better . 
  hmm . 
  could you be more specific ? 
   you ca n't have eu nukes without a common defense and a common foreign policy well , you * can * , but it might end in tears ... 
  if you think about it , it 's really not * us * that got canada 's flag upside-down , but rather canada . 
  [ their flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_canada ) has the [ maple leaf upside-down from the way maple leaves on a tree are ] ( http://cdn-0.itsnature.org/plant_life/images/article-pics/maple-leaves.jpg ) . 
  glad you like it , because we are n't drinking it . 
  americans drink way less wine than anywhere in western europe . 
  germany has [ 243 % the per-capita wine consumption of the us ] ( http://www.wineinstitute.org/files/world_per_capita_consumption_by_country_2011.pdf ) . 
  i figured that that region was just another part of sweden . 
  coming from the man who developed british culture , that 's high praise !, 
  [ link to the source post that was used as material for this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4k27q7/how_to_irritate_a_citizen_of_each_european/ ),

  nonsense . 
  i [ thank god for mississippi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thank_god_for_mississippi ) . 
   americans are often freaked out when they hear our folk song which is older than their anthem . 
   considering it does not take all that much time to find the real text . 
  well , yeah , but if you do n't know german ... 
   think of it if instead of us flags there were confederate flags instead eh . 
  i do n't think that people would get all that excited . 
  hell , mississippi [ still has the confederate battle flag on its state flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_mississippi ) . 
  i guess maybe you could sing `` god save the king '' , but i think that people would probably just think that you screwed up [ my country tis of thee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn2i6vdzgts ) , given that that 's what people here would associate with the music .
