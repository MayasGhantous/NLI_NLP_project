   it 's how the eu is set up , it allows for policy shopping and is a convenient avenue for it . 
  of course the member states are complicit in that , but it 's how it works because of how it is set up . 
  the eu ca n't easily be separated from that . 
  if the eu is vulnerable to this , why ? 
   with respect to modern languages , french , as i have before observed , is indispensible .

  breaking into someone 's computer systems ? 
  well , hell , maybe * someone * would call it that , but they sure would n't refrain from classifying it as hacking . 
  if that 's the case , moving away from the euro wo n't solve it either -- the two are simply different mechanisms to arrive at the same end goal . 
   the former can only happen when greece leaves the eurozone . 
  i disagree . 
  having a floating currency can make it less disruptive to reduce wages , but it 's absolutely possible to do so without a floating currency -- just needs to happen via pay cuts or layoffs and rehirings at a lower rate . 
  particularly since this is a one-off . 
  europe mostly does use weapons produced in europe , same as the us mostly uses weapons produced in the us .

  no , and that 's a good thing . 
  you would n't want involvement in your domestic politics via military hardware . 
  what should matter is whether the country can devalue the currency that the debt is issued in , not in whether it 's in the eurozone . 
  using argentina as an example above : argentina would be in the same boat as greece if argentina 's government borrowed and ran off with too many euros , though argentina is not an ez member . 
   i was simply talking about who has the responsibility to get greece back on its feet after greece defaults hmm . 
  i do n't really see why . 
  i mean , let 's say that romania , which is n't in the ez , somehow wound up with identical problems to greece ( unpayable euro-denominated debt ) tomorrow . 
  surely there would n't be any great difference in any obligations that exist ? 
  and while there may be be issues in the ez , i think that government corruption is a greater issue than trade flows in greece 's case , if i understand the situation aright -- the issues were n't created by greek membership in the ez . 
  i mean , the fact that a country has euro-denominated debt is n't really predicated on it being in the ez . 
  argentina , not an ez member , [ recently took out billions of euros in euro-denominated debt ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-05/argentina-returns-to-euro-bond-market-first-time-since-2010 ) .

  it 's open season on pirates for anyone . 
  [ wikipedia : * hostis humani generis * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hostis_humani_generis )  since the time of the ancient romans , pirates have been held to be individuals waging private warfare , a private campaign of sack and pillage , against not only their victims , but against all nations , and thus , pirates hold the peculiar status of being regarded as '' * hostis humani generis * '' , the enemies of humanity . 
  since piracy anywhere is a peril to every mariner and ship everywhere , it is held to be the universal right and the universal duty of all nations , regardless of whether their ships have been beset by the particular band of pirates in question , to capture , try by a regularly constituted court-martial or admiralty court ( in extreme circumstances , by means of a drumhead court-martial convened by the officers of the capturing ship ) , and , if found guilty , to execute the pirate via means of hanging from the yard-arm of the capturing ship , an authoritative custom of the sea . 
   we 'd lose a lot of international standing if we considered refugee rights optional and the world knew it .

  before you were simply utilizing the `` it was n't direct travel from the region in question '' loophole , as we are . 
  that was `` no evidence of an effort to influence german elections '' . 
  the quote as a whole is even better :  `` no matter what they say , i 'm still worried about the possibility of an artificial earthquake , '' he wrote on twitter , adding that the `` gulenist terrorist organisation '' ( feto ) had planned an earthquake before . 
  where did the eu come in ? 
  i mean , the eu did n't go for eurobonds , but the real issue was creditors vs greece . 
  dude , the typical american probably could n't tell you what continent serbia was on . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but in the us , serbia is not normally on the news , and i 'm extremely dubious that the typical american has any awareness of or like or dislike of serbia . 
   russia 's not georgia , for example -- it 's just too big ( and uncontrolled ) for efficient reforms . 
  * i do n't understand what the basis is for saying scale is a fundamental limitation . 
  * the bolsheviks sure seemed to reform things . 
  how come russia could change then but not now ? 
   ... i lived in greece , i speak greek ( do n't write it though ) , and i can assure you greeks in general are short sighted . 
  well , that sounds authoritative . 
   if greece stays in the euro , this is the eurozone 's problem . 
  i do n't see why leaving the euro -- after having already taken up euro-denominated debt -- would buy greece a fix for the debt . 
  if greece is going to default , might as well be in the ez as outside of it . 
  i do n't see why greece leaving the ez would eliminate the problem for the ez . 
  major creditors in the ez still have to eat the loss one way or another . 
   this is partly because european integration is seen as a political good in-and-of-itself that can not be questioned by right-thinking people . 
  one entirely-valid response is that the correct solution to the current halfway-integration would be further integration instead of pulling back . 
   ... what the last us imf director has said last year , if obama guys were backing away from giving greece us taxpayers money , trumps will be full on running . 
  i doubt that it 's a question of giving greece money . 
  greece is n't going to pay back its creditors in full . 
  this would be giving money to creditors like germany and france and so forth . 
  i 'd guess that the question would be whether the us should eat german losses . 
  my layman 's take is that it should not . 
  a greek default no longer poses the risks that it did . 
  this is n't the sort of thing that the imf was built to handle . 
  even if the us wanted to give money to germany/france/etc , does it make sense to abuse the imf to do so ? 
  not breaking into voting machines , but breaking into computer system 's to obtain damaging material to leak ? 
  that 's real . 
  i suppose calling it `` hacking '' is ambiguous or even misleading , but ... 
  eh , you see a similar phenomenon with english . 
  i think that it 's more that there 's a selection bias among multilingual people who would be speaking french as a second language : they 're probably well-educated and also have the knowledge to view the language constructs in the abstract , whereas looking at first-language speakers just gives you a cross-section of society . 
  that seems more like an issue with the state subsidy structure than with baptism . 
   pretty sure no one thinks that since neither site produces news at all .

  one thing that you can not plausibly do is insist to everyone that all major media outlets ca n't be trusted .

  propaganda [ is not some sort of new threat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_propaganda ) . 
   primitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists . 
  the behistun inscription ( c. 515 bc ) detailing the rise of darius i to the persian throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda . 
  [ 1 ] the arthashastra written by chanakya ( c. 350 -- 283 bc ) , a professor of political science at takshashila university and a prime minister of the maurya empire in ancient india , discusses propaganda in detail , such as how to spread propaganda and how to apply it in warfare . 
  his student chandragupta maurya ( c. 340 -- 293 bc ) , founder of the maurya empire , employed these methods during his rise to power .
