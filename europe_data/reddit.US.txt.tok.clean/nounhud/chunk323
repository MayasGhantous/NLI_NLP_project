  she sees no gain by entering into a series of assassinations , where she is unable to leverage those strengths .

  congrats again , romania !, 
  had n't seen the bit saying that it was repealed . 
  i 'm not claiming that it * was n't * putin , but why on earth would someone trying to covertly assassinate someone do so on his birthday ? 
  he was under the uk 's protection and on british soil . 
  we 've had spies flee to russia too , but we do n't assassinate people on russian soil because we do n't like them .

  he said . 
  if that 's the strongest criticism that the opposition can summon up -- bogus claims of a gay affair -- that 's a pretty potent endorsement of him . 
  you expect the opposition to turn up flaws , and that 's the worst of what 's come up ? 
  i think that europe can probably learn from our mistakes without having to make similar mistakes herself . 
  the uk is wealthy , english-speaking , and thus has been a popular destination for intra-eu migration . 
  i do not think that britons are unusually intolerant of migration as europe goes . 
  they simply were a popular destination . 
  the architects of the eu misjudged future resistance to population movement and constructed an environment ( no fiscal transfers or political union , with free population movement the main way to produce economic convergence ) that tended to encourage more migration than it turned out that there was political support for within eu members . 
  the us , even in a more-homogeneous environment , had people object to large-scale population movements within the us as well , like [ okies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okies ) moving from the great plains to california , [ carpetbaggers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpetbagger ) moving from the north to the south , or the [ great migration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_migration_\\ ( african_american \\ ) ) of blacks from the south to the north . 
  there were far more violent reactions in the us than the eu has seen . 
  but us states also did n't have the ability to simply leave the union , so it was possible to withstand more pressure . 
  albania ? 
  well , le pen promises breaking up the eu . 
  so if someone supports her , that 's what they 're voting for . 
  i 'm not zuckerberg or merkel , but i think that that would be an unwise move for france . 
  the us has done well as a large union , and i think that it would be to france 's disadvantage to isolate herself . 
  eh , i 'm assuming that it was necessary to buy them off to purchase political support for trade between eu members from people who would likely otherwise advocate for protectionism . 
  ideally a transitional program , as small-scale farming becomes less-common . 
  `` globalists '' in this context meaning people who do n't want to break the eu up ? 
  eh ... arguably that 's just paralleling the word-of-mouth that they used before facebook . 
  not sure that facebook is worse . 
  compared to those run by other colonizers , they did relatively-well .

  what killed off the overwhelming bulk of the native american population was disease : a cocktail of diseases that evolved over 30k years all being set free in the americas at once . 
  the * us * could be said to have engaged in ethnic cleansing in the 1800s with renovations to reservations , but not genocide . 
  nz , au , and ca did n't leave via force . 
  there are certainly poorer countries that were once controlled by the british , like nigeria . 
  that being said , in general ex-british colonies have done fairly well compared to colonies of other colonizers .

   the normal treatment is skewed to favour france and germany .

  https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/conversation-english-eurobarometer.jpg though spain and portugal are even further down , and given the population size and english fluency differences , i think i see a disproportionately-high number of flairs from those countries . 
  also , the baltics are n't * that * high , have few people , and there are plenty users from the baltics . 
   democratic , secular and rich turkey well , it did n't explicitly say `` democratic , secular , and rich '' . 
  i 'd actually like to see a breakdown of why . 
  i can imagine several major points of objection . 
  * the greece-turkey fight . 
  * borders . 
  right now , the eu enjoys a natural border ( obviously not impermeable ) along the mediterranean . 
  turkey does n't enjoy the same degree of isolation . 
  extending the eu into asia minor invariably means dealing more with illegal immigration and other issues in the area . 
  similarly , the us was pretty happy stopping at the pacific and atlantic -- makes for nice moats . 
  * population . 
  given the dutch referendum , i think that there 's more opposition to large ( especially large and poorer ) countries joining , since it obviously produces a much-larger effect in terms of subsidy and population movement . 
  turkey has about the per-capita gdp of romania , but has four times the population . 
  so there 's overwhelming support for more eu-us trade , but very , very vocal opposition from people opposed to ttip . 
  hmm . 
   do you think a subreddit meetup will ever happen ? 
  missing the option of `` should do two , one in strasbourg and one in brussels '' . 
   estimates suggest that upwards of 15 percent are illiterate . 
  there are different estimates of illiteracy , but that seems like an optimistic way of putting it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_literacy_rate here 's a table of the top ten sources of eu asylum requests , ranked by [ number of asylum applications in the eu from q3 2015 to q3 2016 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_time_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu-28_by_citizenship,_q3_2015_%e2%80%93_q3_2016.png ) : | rank | country | literacy rate | | - | - | - | | 1 | syria | 86.4 % | | 2 | afghanistan | 38.2 % | | 3 | iraq | 79.7 % | | 4 | nigeria | 59.6 % | | 5 | pakistan | 56.4 % | | 6 | iran | 86.8 % | | 7 | eritrea | 73.8 % | | 8 | albania | 97.6 % | | 9 | russia | 99.7 % | | 10 | somalia | no data available | excluding albania and russia , which are your typical european countries and have nearly all the population literate , there 's a big reduction in literacy from what people in the eu are used to . 
  also , excluding those two european countries , only nigeria has a major european language as their primary language in use ( english ) . 
  so while it 's true that at least written material in that language could be made * available * , at best you 're going to have a big whack of people who are n't going to be able to easily drop into a workplace or read package labels or whatever that 's structured around a different language . 
   most immigrants at the bad hersfeld school , said director dirk beulshausen , `` see it as a gift that they 're allowed to learn . 
  many germans see it as a duty , and duty is always bad . '' there 's a limit , however , to what even a great willingness to work can achieve . 
  one social worker there , joanna metz , guessed that nearly half the immigrants in the program might fail to earn a diploma . 
  `` the problem is they have an unbelievable amount to catch up , '' she said . 
  `` basically they need 48-hour days . ''   the refugees who are young enough to adapt quickly , like ahmad 's children , are likely to be a net economic plus for germany . 
  for the refugee population as a whole , it 's too early to say . 
  the federal labor agency estimates that half the refugees will still be unemployed after five years , a quarter after 12 . 
  yes , some will be young , which helps -- easier to learn material when young , easier to fit in . 
  and many of these countries have a young population due to a high birthrate , so that helps increase the portion that are young . 
  but a pretty big chunk of asylum applications will be past the age where they 'd have normally completed secondary school . 
  [ here 's an age distribution for first-time asylum applications in the eu in 2015 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:distribution_by_age_of_\\ ( non-eu \\ ) _ first_time_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states , _ 2015 _ \\ ( % c2 % b9 \\ ) _ \\ ( % 25 \\ ) _ yb16.png ) . 
  for the eu-28 , ~ 19 % are 0-13 years old . 
  ~ 10 % are 14-17 years old .
