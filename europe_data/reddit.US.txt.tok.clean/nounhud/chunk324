  ~ 53 % are 18-34 . 
  ~ 18 % are 35 or above . 
  ( and keep in mind , this is probably skewed by some portion of `` am under 18 '' claims for asylum purposes . ), 
  so the bulk of people are past primary and secondary schooling age . 
  sure , adults can receive adult education ... but it 's slower , and the returns are lower ( since there 's a smaller number of working years using that education for each year of education ) . 
   in a word : parallelgesellschaften , or `` parallel societies . '' `` the parts of cities where you would n't know you were in germany , '' as h\u00f6cke puts it . 
  the term is a bogeyman even among moderate germans . 
  to an american , it may evoke a more benign image -- of a chinatown or a little italy or even one of the hundreds of little germanys that once existed in the u.s. why ca n't germans take in immigrants now , in the same spirit ? 
  i put the question to erika steinbach , who , in spite of being a former refugee herself , has been a controversial critic of merkel 's policy from the right flank of the cdu . 
  well ... * now * it 's seen as quaint and cultural and a tourist attraction . 
  at the time they were forming in the us , i 'm not sure that people were as delighted by the ethnic ghettoes as they are today . 
  it does n't * hurt * , i guess , but i have a really hard time believing that many people would take it -- the math just does n't seem to work out for me . 
  for a single person , welfare in germany [ seems to be ~ $ 391/mo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hartz_concept#hartz_iv ) . 
  that 's the absolute minimum that someone will pull in , even without a job , and even if they 're not working under the table . 
  german minimum wage is $ 8.84 / hr , so if someone is legally working 44 hours per month at anything , they 're already at the welfare level . 
  if they work at minimum wage full-time , 160 hours per month , they should make $ 1,414.40 / mo. 
  going back home voluntarily gives up the possibility of working in germany . 
  even the prospect of working for one month at minimum wage full-time is worth more than the offer . 
  [ dw is estimating that maybe a third of the refugees at most will work illegally ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-job-growth-shrinks-shadow-economy/a-19020108 ) . 
   in the face of an influx of more than a million refugees to germany last year , the researchers estimate that up to 300,000 migrants might end up being employed illegally in 2016 , for example , as cleaners or in the construction sector . 
  the us does n't have any restrictions on people with multiple citizenships from being president . 
  ( the uk and some other countries do . ), 
  people do need to be '' [ natural-born citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural-born-citizen_clause ) '' to be president . 
  this came up a while back when mccain was running for president -- he was born in the [ panama canal zone ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/us/politics/11mccain.html ) , which was generally considered to be not an incorporated territory of the us . 
  from a skim , it looks like any real legal question was over whether it was an incorporated territory or unincorporated territory , and that if it was incorporated , he 'd be fine . 
  thus it does n't look like it would strip trump of his natural-born citizen status , so he 'd still remain a valid president . 
  [ this quora question ] ( https://www.quora.com/what-is-the-greatest-number-of-citizenships-ever-held-by-one-person ) said that there was a us citizen who got eight other citizenships ( cape verde , belize , dominica , grenada , saint kitts and nevis , ireland , canada , and uk ) . 
  if he was natural-born and had n't renounced his us citizenship ( which he did so to avoid taxes ) , he presumably could have been president without issues . 
  though i imagine that it 'd be awkward if he had tried availing himself of irish consular services somewhere as us president . 
   if anything we should start spending in eu defense and defending nato . 
  little spending is specific to nato -- the 2 % - of-gdp dispute is overall military spending . 
  does this mean an increase in overall spending ? 
   what would you think if a moscow based ngo started advocating for political change in poland ( for example ) ? 
  [ weeelll ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yes_california )  the yes california independence campaign promotes the secession of the state of california from the united states . 
  [ 6 ] it proposes including a measure for a referendum in 2019 on the state 's 2018 gubernatorial election ballot . 
  [ 7 ]   the campaign president is louis j. marinelli , a new yorker who lives in russia [ 8 ] and has received significant assistance from the russian government to promote his efforts . 
  so ... it 's populated by ukrainian people ? 
   oh , look the equivalent of the whole norwegian army 's armored divisions casually passing by in poland . 
  i do n't know how many mbts went by at the beginning , since you only see the back part of the train , but ignoring the light armor , i only saw 9 abrams . 
  wikipedia says that norway has a total of [ 52 leopard 2 mbts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_equipment_of_the_norwegian_land_forces#main_battle_tank_.28mbt.29 ) . 
  the dutch never controlled the bulk of the us . 
  just [ an area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:new_netherland.png ) that roughly corresponds to the modern-day [ new york metro area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ny_metropolitan_area.png ) .

  also , pitcairn island keeps going , even with less than 50 people and a gdp of < checks  $ 158,822.30 . 
  i bet that ceuta and malilla do . 
  well , i certainly agree on the motivation . 
  that being said , the complaint is not a new one , and i think that it 's one worthy of discussion . 
   after the united states gobbled up california and half of mexico , and we were stripped down to nothing , territorial expansion suddenly becomes a crime . 
  it 's been going on for centuries , and it will still go on . 
  -- hermann g\u00f6ring , at lunch during the nuremberg war crimes tribunal ( 11 december 1945 ) ; nuremberg diary p. 66 , 1947 edition . 
  * the obvious response is that unless one is to have a continuous and ongoing set of wars of expansion , one has to draw a line at some point and say `` no more wars of conquest '' . 
  people are invariably going to think `` well , if we extended it for longer , maybe we could grab a bit * more * land '' . 
  so unless you put up with an arbitrary line , you will have no line . 
  * the european union has seen expansion , but has done so via peaceful means . 
  certainly there is competition here , but it is competition based on trade and economics . 
  i do n't think that armed conflict has to be the only way to compete . 
  * russia stated that it gave up all territorial claims to ukraine . 
  if you choose to ignore dropping claims , to turn the world into a free-for-all for whoever can grab territory , i think that you 're looking at a much poorer , less-pleasant place . 
  * even the nazis had a stronger argument along goering 's position . 
  russia is [ the fourth-least-densely-populated country in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_territories_by_population_density ) . 
  it seems like a very difficult argument for russia in particular that there is a unjust shortage of * leibensraum * . 
  the uk is in for a fun time . 
  she 's the us voice at the un , not a cabinet member . 
  but you can look at splits with plenty of cabinet appointees if you want . 
  [ mattis ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/23/mattis-support-nato/96971878/ ) is a particularly notable example . 
  trump appointed one of the few nato ex-supreme allied commanders available for his secdef -- it would be difficult to find a more nato-aligned appointee -- then continued regularly calling nato obsolete , with mattis regularly following up with a statement in conflict . 
  news media has been commenting on the [ split between what trump 's appointees say and what trump says ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-cabinet-nominees-keep-contradicting-him/2017/01/12/dec8cccc-d8f3-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html?utm_term=.96a4dae7036b ) . 
  as i see it , there 's a limited set of possibilities : * ** trump is oblivious . 
  ** that 's a pretty tough sell to me . 
  the man may be bad at a lot of things , but he 's done nothing but market himself to people for much of his life . 
  he 's got one of the highest-budget marketing-of-a-person efforts in the world backing him -- a billion dollars spent on shaping and selling his image in his year on the campaign trail , with gobs of communications specialists for every demographic fine-tuning and tweaking his image to twiddle the numbers . 
  * ** trump is playing to domestic politics and simply ignoring any impact on foreign policy in his statements . 
  ** the `` kim jong un '' model : kim makes wild threats all the time for the benefit of domestic consumption . 
  i do n't buy it . 
  his statements do n't make political sense at the moment -- he needs to expand his appeal with his current approval rating , not deepen it among people who voted for him , and a number of his public positions , like on the f-35 / f-18 or putin , are either of very limited appeal or are unlikely to build popularity . 
  * ** trump 's using a madman theory approach . 
  ** a lot of compelling arguments for this one : explains a lot of his highly-public and very unorthodox positions , the split between hard-to-counterfeit signs of intention ( appointees who actually have to make policy ) and easy-to-counterfeit signs of intention ( public statements ) . 
  it 's compatible with reversals and fairly wild statements . 
  it 's one of the few ways to explain trump being willing to have all of his subordinates making publicly-conflicting statements immediately after his own . 
  trump 's been quoted in the past saying that it 's important for a president to be unpredictable for negotiation reasons -- `` we 're totally predictable . 
  and predictable is bad . 
  sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if i do become president , i have these views that are down for the other side to look at , you know . 
  i hate being so open . '', 
  the only decent argument i have against this interpretation is that i 'd have expected him to wait until after the election to start on this . 
  also , a number of foreign policy and news sources have since begun bringing up the prospect that this is what he 's up to . 
  i started talking about it late last year , and more-recently , there have been media increasingly-considering the prospect that this is the explanation .

  he 's got nation-state-resource-level intelligence agencies around the world that will always be trying to figure out what he 's up to , and i 'm very doubtful that he can reasonably sell people who are expert in and working full time on assessing his actual positions .

  i 'd take that bet . 
  trump 's appointees regularly contradict him immediately after he says something . 
  he has n't shown any degree of interest in it ( though he has had over-the-top rants if people in the political opposition conflict with him ) .
