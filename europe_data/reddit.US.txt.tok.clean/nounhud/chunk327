  2016 part ii : 2017, 
  i can understand the need for emergency powers -- speed might demand immediate action -- but what rationale is there for blocking parliament from overturning emergency actions ? 
  < nods sagely  the only reasonable thing to do after china joins the eu . 
   like soviet union ? 
  do you want to be ruled by germany ? 
  i do n't but this is exactly what will happen in case of the `` real union '' . 
  germany is a federation . 
  the united states is a federation . 
  switzerland is a federation . 
  austria is a federation . 
  australia is a federation . 
  mexico is a federation . 
  canada is a federation . 
  india is a federation . 
  belgium is a federation . 
  [ here 's a list of more federations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation#contemporary ) . 
  if none of those federations are `` ruled '' by one member of the federation , i do n't understand why this would happen if the eu federated . 
  do you view europeans as less-capable of forming a functioning government than every one of the above groups ? 
  in fact , large countries are somewhat-weaker on a per-capita political basis in the eu ( the same , i might add , as in the us ) . 
   i do n't want to be ruled by some officials in eu hq , officials that i did n't even elect . 
  so set the rules to have your eu representatives directly-elected if that 's what you want . 
  ffs . 
  hell , are n't they already directly-elected ? 
  does italy not directly-elect meps to the ep , and the president of italy to the european council ? 
   like in this interview , chief brexit negotiator for the european parliament , guy verhofstadt is talking about how awful it is that the eu requires consensus of all its members to do anything instead of just acting without asking anyone . 
  sure , so kill off the veto-based votes and switch to majority or supermajority votes . 
  that 's totally compatible with having a federation : you get input without a heavy default of inaction . 
  in fact , i strongly suspect that pretty much anyone in favor of federation would also be expecting to lower the bar for decision-making . 
  the highest bar that exists in the us is a three-quarters approval of all states to amend the us constitution . 
  darn straight , china !, 
   at a time when trump attempts to recreate the us as an autocrat-run petro-state like putin 's russia , ... * petro-state * ? 
  as in , an economy dominated by petroleum extraction ? 
  no , he 's not . 
  by waiting until the week that trump was in office ? 
   russia does n't have anything to gain from it and doing that would just be a huge strain on its struggling economy . 
  sanctions would presumably be more-important to russia 's economy , and attacking ukraine probably is n't shortening them . 
   but do n't you read people 's comments on rt news ' facebook posts ? 
  the americans are literally the biggest evil on the world ... 
  damn , even with trump running things we 're * still * catching fat jokes , eh ? 
  just ca n't win . 
  so , if i understand correctly , you 'd want an eu with oversight ability , to be reliably-liberal ( i vaugely thought that juncker was , but ... ) , and for subsidy not to be based on borrowing . 
  fair enough -- it 's probably more-or-less what i 'd want too in germany 's position . 
  that being said , i am not sure that simply waiting for countries to pull themselves up by their bootstraps , to address any internal issues will be fruitful . 
  i understand that eu infrastructure grants and loans already had some form of greater oversight than was the case for non-eu activity . 
  would you support , say , ongoing subsidy of highways or schools if those particular areas were subject to eu oversight and accounting and standards , even if the government as a whole is not ? 
  that might be more palatable to people on both sides of the equation . 
  can you expand on why ? 
  is it specifically because germans do n't want to be subsidizing other countries more than is presently the case or because the specific route of using eurobonds is a bad idea ? 
   but our polling institutes are mainly financed by the major globalist merkel party . 
  it seems to me that to make credible claims of bias , you should probably at * least * be able to describe said party by name ... 
  why are eurobonds a good idea ? 
  my understanding is that the goal is to transfer risk from other countries that are borrowing to germany . 
  but is that desirable ? 
  that is , does one * want * more borrowing ? 
  does the eu need more risk ? 
  if it 's a way for germany to subsidize countries , should n't it be a simple grant ? 
  that 'd reduce risk in the system , give germany more ability to determine how the funds are used , and help isolate any defaults . 
  or is the goal of eurobonds to attach them to greater eu control of how member 's engage in spending ? 
  hmm . 
  i think that free trade is a very good thing indeed , and that seems to be what people mean when they refer to `` globalism '' . 
  so i should be enthusiastic about mr. schulz ? 
   right now most republicans seem to be in self-preservation mode , with trump firing people who as much as dare to disagree , by tweet . 
  trump does n't fire the legislative branch . 
  he can fire people in the executive branch . 
   it claims to be anti-establishment whilst its own creator is a millionaire and tax dodger . 
  so ... exactly like breitbart , then ? 
  might be using [ hdr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-dynamic-range_imaging ) , which makes it look a bit fake . 
  a lot of shadow detail there to be unmodified . 
  tell the mods you want sidebar filters !, 
   i always assumed that nude meant no clothes on . 
  < appalled look  you 're telling me that in lithuania , all of your nudes are * naked * ? 
  in all fairness , this is part of an / r/europe tradition . 
  the last time this showed up was when you put mexico in the sidebar map of europe . 
  two days of mexico-related images and posts and comments later , some hapless user ( a swede ? ), 
  decided to see what was going with europe and posted a nearly identical gandalf image and title with `` mexico ? '',

   cattle ? 
  nostalgic pictures that nobody 's expecting to be around anymore , given the european vegetarianism directive passed friday in brussels to establish self-reliance in agriculture . 
  people have already accepted the mandatory vegetarianism , but it 's hard to accept that the much-loved beef cow will vanish from europe . 
  they 're sharing some pictures of the last batch that will be alive . 
  you ... were following the european vegetarianism directive 's progress , right ? 
  hmm . 
  okay , this is definitely not what i expected . 
  i went and read over [ wikipedia : president of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_france ) , which i probably should have done earlier ...
