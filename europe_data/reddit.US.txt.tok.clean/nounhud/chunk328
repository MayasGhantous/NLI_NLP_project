  looking at it and at [ this reference ] ( http://www.gouvernement.fr/en/how-government-works ) , some differences and similarities : ** similar ** * both serve up to two terms ( though in france the term is five years versus the us four ) . 
  * both act as the military leader of the country . 
  * the french president names members of the constitutional council , which * sounds * somewhat analogous to the us supreme court , whose members are nominated by the president and approved by the senate . 
  * both the french and the us president may pardon criminals and/or commute their sentences . 
  * both the french and the us president may be impeached . 
  * both the french and us president are immune to prosecution until after leaving office ( or being removed via impeachment ) . 
  * both the french and us president appoint ambassadors ( though i do n't understand how that translates into the foreign policy power of the french president that wikipedia says is present ) . 
  ** different ** * it sounds like the president in france does n't have much direct ability to block the passing of laws : merely to delay them . 
  the president in the us can veto laws unless overiden by two-thirds supermajority in both houses of congress . 
  * the us president and congress have no direct ability to limit each others ' time in office ( well , i suppose barring impeachment and removal of a president ) . 
  the french president can dissolve the national assembly at will . 
  * the french president may send some laws and treaties up for a popular referendum with the agreement of * either * the pm or the na . 
  i 'm assuming that there 's some way in france for * either * the pm or the na to initiate a treaty or law and that thus either can block the other * if * they can also sell the president and the public on blocking it . 
  the us has no federal-level popular referendums . 
  * the french pm nominates ( some ? ), 
  government positions and the president may block them . 
  in the us , the president nominates a number of positions , and the senate may block a small set of the important ones . 
  * the pm has to approve almost everything the french president does . 
  almost no individual decisions that the us president makes is subject to approval by anyone else . 
  * the french succession order has the president of the french senate becoming the new president of france . 
  in the us , the vice president succeeds a dead president . 
  * the french pm is not a superior of the french ministers . 
  in the us , the president is the superior of the cabinet secretaries and can direct them and fire them ( though it is uncommon for the latter to happen ) . 
  ah , thanks . 
  what happens if the president and the national assembly deadlock over choosing a pm ? 
  that is , the president keeps nominating pms and the national assembly keeps rejecting them ? 
  i see that visitors from / r/the _ donald are in abundance these days . 
  [ it was later judged to be a poor decision . 
  it has never been held to be illegal . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internment_of_japanese_americans )  the united states census bureau assisted the internment efforts by providing confidential neighborhood information on japanese americans . 
  the bureau denied its role for decades , but this was finally documented in 2007 . 
  [ 15 ] [ 16 ] in 1944 , the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the removal by ruling against fred korematsu 's appeal for violating an exclusion order . 
  [ 17 ] the court limited its decision to the validity of the exclusion orders , avoiding the issue of the incarceration of u.s. citizens with no due process . 
  [ 18 ]   in 1980 , under mounting pressure from the japanese american citizens league and redress organizations , [ 19 ] president jimmy carter opened an investigation to determine whether the decision to put japanese americans into internment camps had been justified by the government . 
  he appointed the commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians ( cwric ) to investigate the camps . 
  the commission 's report , titled personal justice denied , found little evidence of japanese disloyalty at the time and , concluding the incarceration had been the product of racism , recommended that the government pay reparations to the survivors . 
  in 1988 , president ronald reagan signed into law the civil liberties act , which apologized for the internment on behalf of the u.s. government and authorized a payment of $ 20,000 to each individual camp survivor . 
  the legislation admitted that government actions were based on `` race prejudice , war hysteria , and a failure of political leadership . 
  '' [ 20 ] the u.s. government eventually disbursed more than $ 1.6 billion in reparations to 82,219 japanese americans who had been interned and their heirs . 
  there 's a russia-based california secession movement , [ yes california ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yes_california ) :  yes california formed in august 2015 , succeeding the sovereign california campaign . 
  [ 1 ] the campaign adopted its name and logo from yes scotland , a campaign group from the 2014 independence referendum in scotland . 
  [ 2 ] the campaign has earned the nicknames caleavefornia , califrexit , [ 3 ] and calexit , after brexit , the united kingdom 's withdrawal from the european union . 
  [ 4 ]   the yes california independence campaign promotes the secession of the state of california from the united states . 
  [ 5 ] it proposes including a measure for a referendum in 2019 on the state 's 2018 gubernatorial election ballot . 
  [ 6 ]   the campaign president is louis j. marinelli , a new yorker who lives in russia [ 7 ] and has received significant assistance from the russian government to promote his efforts . 
  [ 8 ] the vice president is marcus ruiz evans . 
  [ 9 ] both men are former republicans [ 10 ] and marinelli says he voted for donald trump . 
  < glances at the current us president  i do n't think that getting `` anti-establishment '' politicians is the issue that we have . 
  yes , and for us it 's hard to tell who will make it through our `` first round '' , the primaries , and to our `` second round '' , the general election . 
  early on , the favorite for the republican candidate was jeb bush -- instead , he lost badly . 
  people in the second round in france have two options , same as in the us in the general election . 
  the field in france is broader in the first round ... as are the us primaries . 
  hell , there were gobs of people campaigning in the republican primaries against trump , and he was n't initially even seen as a very viable competitor . 
  the mistake is to see us parties as comparable to parties in more-than-two-party systems . 
  us parties are something more akin to fairly-stable coalitions of parties in more-than-two-party systems . 
  trump early on took a '' [ the hell with spanish speakers ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trumps-english-only-campaign-228559 ) '' position , for example . 
  die-hard rubio `` create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants from mexico '' supporters were probably not very enthusiastic about trump and that the same was same was true for trump 's supporters about rubio . 
  hell , cruz and rubio , two of trump 's primary opponents , are two of the three latino-american senators . 
  i think that most people in the world would meet with the queen if she asked to do so , if that 's what you mean . 
   and 1 year from now there will be ( partially ) wall between mexico and us . 
  there has been since at * least * bush . 
  not sure when the first bits of border wall went in , but it probably was well before him . 
  it 's 2017 now . 
  whole new fresh year . 
   2 turns usually spare us from the shittiest candidates . 
  yeah , we had primaries * and * general elections too to avoid that . 
  why `` le pon '' rather than `` le pen '' ? 
  is there a different way to write it , or is that some sort of french pun ? 
   1 ) the french system is n't the same as the american system . 
  actually , if you 're talking about the two-round system ... i dunno . 
  seems to me that the two-party system in the us is kinda similar to the two-round system in france . 
  in the us , you have the primaries , select what amounts to in practice two candidates who then run against each other in the general election . 
  that does n't seem that far off france to me , at least insofar as choosing a president goes . 
  in france , how does the presidency interact with the legislature ? 
  it 's funny ... i hear so much about parliamentary systems , but even though the us is presidential , i know essentially nothing about how other presidential systems work , because they 're so rare in countries that i pay attention to outside the americas . 
   considering if she wins it will most likely spell the end of the eu . 
  well , the eu would look different without france -- the franco-german core was a big chunk of it -- but i am not convinced that everyone in all other members would just throw in the towel if le pen won . 
  you 're telling me that * all * eu member states would prefer to not be in the eu if france left ? 
  i mean , sure , it means that a big , well-to-do country is n't there . 
  but all of europe would say `` i 'd be better-off on my own ? '', 
  that either not working together on a supranational basis or starting from * scratch * would make more sense than the status quo ? 
  that you 'd prefer to wipe every international agreement signed across europe going back decades ? 
   fillon : 60 % vs le pen : 40 % i seem to recall multiple french redditors saying that le pen had a 30 % buffer to overcome until her next-closest matchup . 
  this is 20 % against her strongest competitor . 
  did she just significantly-gain strength ( from that fillon scandal that just hit the news ) or was i wrong ? 
   the eu 's instinct over the past decade has been to do the minimum necessary -- a policy that has left it pathetically weak . 
  no , the eu is * structured * in a way that encourages it to only be able to take least-common-denominator actions , where the default is to maintain the * status quo * unless a very high bar is met to change things . 
  every time a member joins , the bar to taking any action rises even higher . 
  if you make a decision and have a veto-based structure , you can only do what all 28 member states agree upon . 
  try convincing 28 randomly-selected * people * selected from around the continent of anything that has even the faintest hint of controversy to it . 
  adding members exacerbates this . 
  the fix there is to migrate to majority vote or some other system that has a lower bar to taking action of some form . 
  even a still-relatively-high-bar of `` 85 % of member states can push through an action over the objection of the other 15 % '' would be a lot better than the current `` 96.4 % of members being in agreement about taking action to move from the status quo is not sufficient and can be blocked by the remaining 3.6 % of the eu membership . 
  100 % is necessary , unanimous agreement is required '' . 
  because at the end of the day -- do you or do you not trust 85 % of the eu membership to do basically what is in the interests of the eu ? 
  i would bet that most people in the eu would be willing to trust the membership that far . 
  you can keep him if you want . 
   that 's because china actually has taken advantage of us i do n't see how . 
   and is an autocratic dictatorship . 
  well , it 's no multiparty democracy .
