  india 's above replacement rate and because of her sheer population ( 1,276 m ) , that 's influential , but she 's not really all that high at 2.5 . 
   estonia ( and latvia ) currently share an unique situation in europe where the locals have higher birth rates than migrants . 
  what are the demographics of people who have immigrated to these two countries ? 
  i 'd think that there 'd be russians , and russia has ( well , had , based on another comment ) an * extraordinarily low * fertility rate . 
  it 's not the only factor , but there is ( negative ) correlation between wealth and fertility . 
   we need to fund anti-aging research so that ` old ' people can be healthier and work for longer . 
  not saying that i 'd object to a fountain of youth , but it 's hard for the same reason that `` making your car get longer mileage '' is hard . 
  there are lots of moving parts and they all start wearing out . 
  plus , you have to spend time trying your new treatments and approaches and seeing what long-term side effects show up . 
  also would be a refugee convention violation , though obviously it 's much easier to change that ( withdrawal with a one-year delay is a well-specified exit path in the convention ) than the constitution . 
  yeah , that 's fair -- that is a pretty large shift . 
  hmm . 
  if i correctly understand how these work , they would just get in the path of the boat . 
  my point is that you can cut through the cable and continue on your way . 
   these sort of things are build to protect docked naval vessels from insurgents , did you really think they would get through that ` without much trouble ' ? 
  yes , because they do n't need to stop boats in that case -- just slow them long enough for some guy with a machine gun or cannon on the deck of the naval ship to shoot them before they get close enough to blow up and do damage . 
  most physical security measures ( safes , physical computers security , etc ) are n't really intended to be impervious to all efforts , but to simply delay someone for a period of time . 
  unless you 're going to , say , mine the aegean , you probably are n't going to be able to have unmanned systems stopping boats . 
   it 's fine to think that but if you put it into law all sorts of practical problems happen . 
  courts and judges would have to decide what people deserve the death penalty in all manner of cases , not just this one . 
  does n't seem like that bit is any different from any other form of sentence . 
   that 's why you can not , right now , decide to imprison someone forever . 
  [ not with that attitude .

  last year , the number rose to 28 percent . 
   we 'll have him amputating his own scrotum in a year . 
  it took powers more than a year to get to the point that he was cutting off his scrotum . 
  and most people in adx florence * have n't * cut off their scrotum ( though i 'm sure that they are n't very happy being there ) . 
  needed when regular prison is n't a sufficient disincentive . 
  it 's a strong incentive to use as a tool . 
  pull a 9/11 or a paris in the us , and unless you manage to kill yourself in the act , you will spend the remainder of your natural life slowly decaying in a very boring concrete tomb .

   i wrote english , because in my understanding those requests come from london . 
  i think that if you refer to positions taken by dublin as `` requests from leinster '' , you 're probably going to be seen as trying to split the country . 
   for karine berger , a socialist mp , the way the uk handled the negotiation process caused serious trust issues .

  < shrug  the factions involved with brexit on each side are just a crazy array which i do n't totally understand . 
  i 'm guessing that some of this is leftists wanting britain out because they think that it would shift the eu left , same as leftists in the uk want the uk in to shift the uk left ? 
  how widespread has air conditioning become in europe ? 
  us electricity usage peaks in summer , not winter . 
  no , but at least some of them [ clearly are n't unconscious of the tie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rome,_georgia ) :  the city [ rome , georgia ] has developed on seven hills with the rivers running between them , a feature that inspired the early european-american settlers to name it for rome , the longtime capital of italy ... in the late 1920s a united states company built a rayon plant in a joint project with an italian company . 
  this project and the american city of rome were honored by italy in 1929 , when its dictator benito mussolini sent a replica of the statue of romulus and remus nursing from a mother wolf , a symbol of the founding myth of the original rome .

  mass killing in syria during war . 
  not saying that it was justifiable , but the west has absolutely let similar war crimes slide before when it was its own soldiers . 
  consider [ the us during world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_war_crimes_during_world_war_ii#united_states ) :  * [ canicatt\u00ec massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canicatt%c3%ac_massacre ) : killing of italian civilians by lieutenant colonel mccaffrey . 
  a confidential inquiry was made , but mccaffrey was never charged with an offense relating to the incident . 
    * in the [ biscari massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biscari_massacre ) , which consists of two instances of mass murders , u.s. troops of the 45th infantry division killed roughly 75 prisoners of war , mostly italian . 
    * [ operation teardrop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_teardrop ) : eight of the surviving , captured crewmen from the sunk german submarine u-546 were tortured by u.s. military personnel . 
  historian philip k. lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of u-546 's survivors was a singular atrocity motivated by the interrogators ' need to quickly get information on what the u.s. believed were potential cruise missile or ballistic missile attacks on the continental u.s. by german submarines . 
    * the [ dachau liberation reprisals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dachau_liberation_reprisals ) : upon the liberation of dachau concentration camp , about a dozen guards in the camp were shot by a machine gunner who was guarding them . 
  other soldiers of the 3rd battalion , 157th infantry regiment , of the u.s. 45th ( thunderbird ) division killed other ss guards who resisted . 
  in all , about 30 were killed , according to the commanding officer felix l. 
  sparks . 
  [ 18 ] [ 19 ] later , colonel howard buechner wrote that more than 500 were killed . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]   * near the french village of audouville-la-hubert , 30 german wehrmacht prisoners ( probably german army soldiers ) were killed by u.s. paratroopers . 
    * in the aftermath of the [ malmedy massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malmedy_massacre ) , a written order from the hq of the 328th u.s. army infantry regiment , dated 21 december 1944 , stated : no ss troops or paratroopers will be taken prisoner but will be shot on sight . 
  [ 23 ] major-general raymond hufft ( u.s. army ) gave instructions to his troops not to take prisoners when they crossed the rhine in 1945 . 
  `` after the war , when he reflected on the war crimes he authorized , he admitted , ` if the germans had won , i would have been on trial at nuremberg instead of them . 
  ' '' [ 24 ] stephen ambrose related : `` i 've interviewed well over 1000 combat veterans . 
  only one of them said he shot a prisoner ... perhaps as many as one-third of the veterans ... however , related incidents in which they saw other gis shooting unarmed german prisoners who had their hands up . 
  '' [ 25 ]   * secret wartime files made public only in 2006 reveal that american gis committed 400 sexual offenses in europe , including 126 rapes in england , between 1942 and 1945 . 
  [ 26 ] a study by robert j. lilly estimates that a total of 14,000 civilian women in england , france and germany were raped by american gis during world war ii . 
  [ 27 ] [ 28 ] it is estimated that there were around 3,500 rapes by american servicemen in france between june 1944 and the end of the war and one historian has claimed that sexual violence against women in liberated france was common . 
  [ 29 ]   * recent studies have increased the estimate of victims of rape to 190,000 women by us gis . 
   it is about helping people . 
  even if most european states do profit from taking in refugees and making them citizens , that should not be the point . 
  i think that there 's a viable self-interest argument above-and-beyond any altruistic argument to be made for asylum in some places , since it can allow defusing conflicts which otherwise would tend to build . 
  in retrospect , for example , had the us accepted all of the the jewish refugees from europe instead of just backing jewish control in palestine ... if you chalk up the cost of things like [ the oil crisis in the 1970s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis#embargo ) to this , it would have been cheaper to have just taken people in ( and that 's not even counting the fact that these were often well-educated-and-skilled , if recently-impoverished folks , who wound up working out really well in the us ) . 
  europe may have scruples about that ( rome appears to be unique in europe ) , but we sure do n't .

  on the other hand , in europe , you did have : * the [ byzantine empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_empire ) , which called itself the roman empire . \u00b9 * [ romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania ) * [ holy roman empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_roman_empire ) probably also others . 
  which * were * arguably attempts to wield the mantle and history of rome , despite not actually including rome-the-city ... and while this is not new and people do n't care now , might have been a point in time where they did . 
  \u00b9 admittedly , this had more of a sense of continuity , and there 's some understandable resistance to renaming an empire . 
  still , people were clearly still aiming for acquiring the history and legitimacy . 
   this is one of the stupidest ( if not the stupidest ) disputes in europe . 
  who cares , what macedonians call themselves ? 
  they can call themselves `` mordor '' or `` seven kingdoms '' , for all i care . 
  they can call the country `` balkan finland '' , and i would n't lose any sleep . 
  while that 's my gut reaction too , i 'd point out that it 's not slovenia at question , and the name * did * make me think that ancient fyrom had conquered greece and much of the mediterranean world two thousand years ago . 
  to me , that seems like not worth this much noise , but apparently it matters to greece , so ... < shrug  i mean , to me , the argument for and against both seem kinda weak , so the same thing applies to asking a different name to be found . 
  there will also probably be new wars started somewhere in africa at least by then , unless we enter some sort of era of perpetual peace . 
  heck , do n't even really need to wait for that . 
  here 's [ wikipedia 's map of ongoing armed conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts ) . 
  the world is rich in conflict . 
     literally every armed conflict in the past 50-70 years resulted in people legally obtaining asylum status in countries around the world , even across oceans , let alone a small distance away from the epicenter of the conflict . 
  the us was n't even willing to let in all * jews * seeking asylum last time ` round , which seems like a much-more-justifiable sale and to a larger country . 
  it was n't until [ a few years after world war ii ended that overall immigration quotas were increased ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?moduleid=10007094 ) , hence israel .
