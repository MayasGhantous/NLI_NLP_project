  can you provide a reputable source talking about it ? 
  it 's `` company x sells crap products so buy domestic y '' glop '' . 
  people do it instinctively when they 're worried about competition . 
  we do n't do it with europe that i 've seen , but i know a bunch of blue-collar people here who do it with china : if it 's chinese , they immediately proclaim that it must be garbage and discourage people from buying it . 
  look at something like hand tools or work boots and you 'll find people furiously insisting that they buy american ( and visibly showing american brands ) , because anything else is low-quality garbage . 
  spending time watching folks in europe do it with us food has been a horizon-broadening experience . 
  you always cook meat before it 's eaten : that 's the `` sterilizing point '' . 
  in some of europe , the milk supply chain is sterile from the bottling plant : it 's super-pasteurized , enough to kill all endospores , and so the milk can sit on a shelf , at the cost of some changed consistency . 
  in the us and some of europe , milk is pasteurized : the active bacteria is killed , but some survives in endospore form . 
  it will , over time , go bad . 
  in india , the milk supply is n't normally sterile . 
  you need to cook the milk , and india has a bunch of cooked foods that use milk . 
  at first , i thought of that as being kind of unclean and gross . 
  but then i realized that fresh vegetables do the same thing in our food supply chain : they 're coming from the non-sterile ground , and you need to cook them to make them sterile . 
  i imagine that some of our food comes off as plasticy , processed , and not-food-like in india . 
  we eat milk chocolate . 
   if it has significant artistic ... value well that sounds like a blank check !, 
  did she rule out invasions from mars happening ? 
  specifically , is there any more reason to believe that today , rather than yesterday , that anyone is purchasing them ? 
  who cares ? 
  pence is just a socially-conservative republican . 
  he 's nothing unusual . 
  i 'd much rather have him in office . 
  i 'd guess that part of it is proximity to the ocean . 
  europe is land with water to the north and south . 
  the surface temperature of land changes way more than the surface temperature of water . 
  water 's constantly seeing convection , so you 're heating or cooling a much-larger mass . 
  on land , only the top bit heats up or freezes . 
  go down a ways , and the temperature in caves is pretty constant . 
  it 's why [ root cellars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/root_cellar ) work . 
  day-night and summer-winter temperature changes on land are much larger than those over water , which is why temperatures on islands or along coasts tend to be much-more-constant . 
  water acts like a giant thermal buffer . 
  [ goes looking for a source ] [ is the gulf stream responsible for europe 's mild winters ? 
  ] ( http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/pubs/seager_etal_qj_2002.pdf )  as suggested by hartmann ( 1994 ) , the contrast between american and west european winters is largely explained by the difference between a continental climate and a maritime climate . 
  most of this is not due to the gulf stream effect . 
  [ world map - average temperature in january ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/world-maps/average-temparature-january-enlarge-map.html ) the average mid-winter temperature in france is comparable to the average mid-winter temperature in texas . 
  so europe is dark and north america is cold . 
  huh . 
  edit : and by the same token , the temperature in the uk , an island , is quite comfortable compared to most of europe at the same latitude , western europe has much-more-comfortable temperatures than eastern europe , and the winter temperature in coastal canada up by vancouver is warmer than that in the far-further-south-but-inland utah . 
  i do n't think that that has been the case in at least the european news that i 've read ( which admittedly only covers english-language news , so i only see a tiny bit of french and german news ... mostly british news ) . 
  the only time that i recall explicit statements being made on here before about significant propaganda actions by russia in europe was [ this pdf that was submitted a while back here ] ( http://www.martenscentre.eu/publications/bear-sheeps-clothing-russias-government-funded-organisations-eu ) , and it looks like it was n't from eu stratcom , but some other eu organization . 
  also , it was n't in direct response to one incident , but covered a range of things and focused on eastern europe . 
  what other incidents are you talking about ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/counterpropaganda  counterpropaganda is a form of communication consisting of methods taken and messages relayed to oppose propaganda which seeks to influence action or perspectives among a targeted audience . 
  it is closely connected to propaganda as the two often employ the same methods to broadcast methods to a targeted audience . 
  counterpropaganda differs from propaganda as it is defensive and responsive to identified propaganda . 
  additionally , counterpropaganda consists of several elements that further distinguish it from propaganda and ensure its effectiveness in opposing propaganda messages . 
  that 's not what the * telegraph * article claimed . 
  but if i understand you aright , you 're saying that the telegraph article is misquoting the eu 's east stratcom and/or * spiegel * ? 
  do you want to expand on that ? 
  are you saying that the * telegraph * is in error , or that the [ eu 's east stratcom group ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ ) is ? 
  europe consumes a lot of alcohol in general compared to the rest of the world . 
  thanks , but while you could catch some common errors , [ natural language processing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_language_processing ) at a human level is probably [ ai-hard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ai-complete ) ... and a lot of analysis you 'd need to do , like determining which use of `` air '' is relevant , probably requires deep understanding of the real world and how the sentence relates to the world . 
  if you solve * that * problem , get in touch with me and we can go take over the world or at least become filthy rich . 
  people also ordinarily do n't correct grammar because it 's seen as a bit of a put-down and most native english-speakers do n't like it , at least publicly . 
  i only started doing it because people here consistently thanked people doing corrections and upvoted them and i assume that a lot of people are here intentionally to practice english . 
  since apparently nobody else is going to do so , and op has not provided a summary , i will . 
  it summarizes the history from about world war i on in ukrainian nationalism , which is about when nationalism gets going . 
  i 'm * assuming * , based on op 's past comments , that what op 's point is is that the paper said that opposition to russian rule was not significant up to world war i. i assume that he 's arguing that ukraine does not have legitimacy as an independent state because it had not been resisting in significant degree before world war i. 
  i 've read some disturbing things about how strict the snp party discipline is . 
  mps apparently are n't permitted , for example , to publicly criticize party leadership or policies . 
   he would be a fresh air for europe `` a breath of fresh air . '', 
  `` air '' can be both a countable noun and a [ mass noun ] ( https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-countable-un.htm ) , depending upon the sense in which the word is used . 
  however , when referring to the atmosphere , it 's a mass noun . 
  if a noun is a mass noun , the thing can not be treated as a unit , and so you ca n't use the indefinite article `` a '' or `` an '' with it -- you ca n't have `` an air '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_noun  in english , mass nouns are characterized by the fact that they can not be directly modified by a numeral without specifying a unit of measurement , and that they can not combine with an indefinite article ( a or an ) . 
  thus , the mass noun `` water '' is quantified as `` 20 litres of water '' while the count noun `` chair '' is quantified as `` 20 chairs '' . 
  however , both mass and count nouns can be quantified in relative terms without unit specification ( e.g. , `` so much water , '' `` so many chairs '' ) . 
   i started reading the quran , but as an atheist it was rather awkward to read every odd page that you should be put to death . 
  leviticus in the bible is pretty similar . 
  leviticus 20:9 -16 :  ``` anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death . 
  because they have cursed their father or mother , their blood will be on their own head . 
    ``` if a man commits adultery with another man 's wife -- with the wife of his neighbor -- both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death . 
    ``` if a man has sexual relations with his father 's wife , he has dishonored his father . 
  both the man and the woman are to be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads . 
    ``` if a man has sexual relations with his daughter-in-law , both of them are to be put to death . 
  what they have done is a perversion ; their blood will be on their own heads . 
    ``` if a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable . 
  they are to be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads . 
    ``` if a man marries both a woman and her mother , it is wicked . 
  both he and they must be burned in the fire , so that no wickedness will be among you . 
    ``` if a man has sexual relations with an animal , he is to be put to death , and you must kill the animal . 
    ``` if a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it , kill both the woman and the animal . 
  they are to be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads . 
  leviticus 20:27 :  a man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death . 
  you are to stone them ; their blood will be on their own heads . 
  leviticus 21:9 :  if a priest 's daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute , she disgraces her father ; she must be burned in the fire . 
  leviticus 24:13 -22 :  take the blasphemer outside the camp . 
  all those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head , and the entire assembly is to stone him . 
  say to the israelites : ` anyone who curses their god will be held responsible ; anyone who blasphemes the name of the lord is to be put to death . 
  the entire assembly must stone them . 
  whether foreigner or native-born , when they blaspheme the name they are to be put to death . 
    ``` anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death . 
  anyone who takes the life of someone 's animal must make restitution -- life for life . 
  anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner : fracture for fracture , eye for eye , tooth for tooth . 
  the one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury . 
  whoever kills an animal must make restitution , but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death . 
  you are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born . 
  i am the lord your god . ''' leviticus 25:44 -46 :  your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you ; from them you may buy slaves . 
  you may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country , and they will become your property .
