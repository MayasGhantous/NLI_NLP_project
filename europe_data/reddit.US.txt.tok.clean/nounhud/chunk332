  so , my own sense is that a lack of lethality does not define the core problem . 
  --  an untrained or uneducated marine ... deployed to the combat zone is a bigger threat to mission accomplishment ... than the enemy . 
  --  a country that armed stalin to defeat hitler can certainly work alongside enemies of al-qaida to defeat al-qaida . 
  --  with respect to the outlines of what 's in the army field manual , there 's no doubt in my mind about the limitations it places not only on the dod , but on the central intelligence agency . 
  and i 'll always comply with the law . 
  also , on russia :  i would consider the principal threats to start with russia , and it would certainly include any nations that are looking to intimidate nations around their periphery , regional nations nearby them , whether it be with weapons of mass destruction or , i would call it , unusual , unorthodox means of intimidating them , that sort of thing .

  oh , and scott pruitt to lead the epa is a pretty embarrassing crowd-pleaser . 
  but on the whole , they are mostly not wildly different from what i 'd expect from any republican administration . 
  his cabinet , as a whole , was the first really reassuring-to-me thing that trump did . 
  ah , thanks !,

  noooo ... but there 's also no law saying that a president 's statements need to reflect what he 's going to do . 
  and the people he 's picked have been off openly saying the opposite thing from what he is . 
  * vice president : [ pence appears to contradict trump 's stance on nato in pbs newshour interview ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/pence-appears-to-contradict-trumps-stance-on-nato-in-pbs-newshour-interview/ ) * secretary of state : [ trump 's nominee for secretary of state breaks with president-elect on defending america 's nato allies ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/tillerson-trump-nato-article-5-2017-1 ) * secretary of defense : [ mattis goes where trump wo n't : us-nato bond ` unshakeable ' ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/politics/mattis-nato-calls-commitment/ ) [ here 's a broader summary ] ( http://time.com/4632952/donald-trump-cabinet-confirmation-hearings-splits/ ) . 
  which leads me to believe that trump thinks that he 's found some sort of clever ploy that has as a goal making himself look unpredictable , though i 've yet to convince myself what it is or even whether it 's for domestic or foreign purposes . 
  my most-plausible guess is a resurrection of [ nixon 's madman theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madman_theory ) , since that 's the only presidential strategy that i 'm aware of that has used this in the past . 
   `` nixon toyed with the idea that he could affect international relations with his madman theory -- the idea he could convince overseas leaders that he was unpredictable and irrational , '' said nicholas eberstadt , the henry wendt chair in political economy at the american enterprise institute . 
  `` donald trump is in a lot better position to leverage the madman theory than nixon was . '' foreign policy people have also started to take this prospect seriously ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-05/trump-s-unpredictable-starting-now-foreign-policy-already-here ) . 
  if this * is * his goal , it could be to specifically try to make pressure on europe to increase her military more-effective ( `` well , we 'd * like * to stay in nato , and our vureaucrats sure would like it , but you know how trump is . . just ca n't do it if you 're not hitting 2 % and pulling your weight . 
  and he 's the big boss , after all . '' . 
  it could also be unrelated and just be one of a number of things that he 's done to appear erratic so that he can buy credible threat ability in other areas , like china , where he may otherwise having a hard time issuing threats of 35 % tariffs credibly . ', 
  what connotations ?

   long ago , great britain even started a war in china for free trade . 
  well , that was objecting to china banning their bringing in opium and using `` free trade '' as a fig leaf , because `` drug dealing '' as a less-inspiring cry . 
  i do n't think that that 's a very good example to use if you 're trying to convince the uk on trade . 
  maybe it 's a subtle verbal swipe at the uk 's history or something . 
  he promptly went out to get a job in the us the moment that the uk bad achieved the economic utopia that he 'd been fighting for . 
  odd , that . 
  if there is one thing that i am quite sure of , it is that international trade is not going anywhere .

  [ never been so much fun !,

  a hypothetical nordic union would not be a superpower as the term is normally used simply by virtue of linking up . 
  it 's possible , of course , that said union could figure out some new way to leverage power/influence/economy / military or something like that ... but then , that 's true for any country . 
  figure out a source of free energy ( tm ) or develop human-level general artificial intelligence or something like that and ... well , the uk was an island that ran a large chunk of the world 's population by leveraging its advanced industry for the time . 
   that would mean she was okay with sacrificing her life for what she believed in no , this is not the normal bar used . 
  most soldiers do not go to war believing that they are on a suicide mission -- just something with risk of death -- but it 's still normal to refer to those who are killed as having given their life for their country . 
   innocent-until-proven-guilty . 
  which is what the justice system was for . 
   other countries in the eu respect similar core values that 's fine . 
  the us does n't try to force france to use the death penalty in its court system . 
  why should france try to pressure the us to not use it in its system ? 
  and this was n't a death penalty objection , anyway -- this was strictly because the guy was french . 
   you do n't threaten an ally with military invasion because they happen be willing to burden the task of hosting an international court of law . 
  did you read the law in question ? 
  the interpretation there was raised by people opposed to it and it is quite unlikely that that would happen . 
  here 's the text : https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/4775/text  ( a ) authority . -- the president is authorized to use all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any person described in subsection ( b ) who is being detained or imprisoned by , on behalf of , or at the request of the international criminal court . 
    ( b ) persons authorized to be freed . -- the authority of subsection ( a ) shall extend to the following persons :    ( 1 ) covered united states persons . 
      ( 2 ) covered allied persons . 
      ( 3 ) individuals detained or imprisoned for official actions taken while the individual was a covered united states person or a covered allied person , and in the case of a covered allied person , upon the request of such government . 
    ( c ) authorization of legal assistance . -- when any person described in subsection ( b ) is arrested , detained , investigated , prosecuted , or imprisoned by , on behalf of , or at the request of the international criminal court , the president is authorized to direct any agency of the united states government to provide --    ( 1 ) legal representation and other legal assistance to that person ( including , in the case of a person entitled to assistance under section 1037 of title 10 , united states code , representation and other assistance in the manner provided in that section ) ;     ( 2 ) exculpatory evidence on behalf of that person ; and     ( 3 ) defense of the interests of the united states through appearance before the international criminal court pursuant to article 18 or 19 of the rome statute , or before the courts or tribunals of any country . 
    ( d ) bribes and other inducements not authorized . -- this section does not authorize the payment of bribes or the provision of other such incentives to induce the release of a person described in subsection ( b ) . 
  now , it is true that `` any and all means '' does technically encompass invasion . 
  however , particularly looking at ( d ) , it 's pretty clear that that 's not what 's intended . 
  additionally , even in a hypothetical world where that would be on the table , the president already would have the ability , irrespective of anything else , to invade a country and occupy it for up to two months without explicit congressional authorization anyway , so even * if * someone took that interpretation , they 'd be treating the text as having no real effect . 
  edit : i 'd also add that unlike the `` invade the netherlands '' thing , the us funding legal defense of a dutch soldier operating in conjunction with the us * is * a plausible outcome . 
  there are * some people in hollywood * . 
  that 's a very different matter . 
   vassals i do n't think that you know what this word means . 
  japan does n't have a lot of people from abroad being naturalized , but they do n't ban it either . 
  i suspect that this has more to do with the different resolution on the reported data . 
  france looks like nuts3 . 
  poland , greece , and portugal presumably just give one number . 
  whatever the baltics are reporting , looks to be higher-resolution than nuts3 . 
  if you had that resolution in , say , greece , i 'd assume that you 'd get more variation too . 
  all right , let me actually go dig it up ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_san_bruno_pipeline_explosion  in january 2011 , federal investigators reported that they found numerous defective welds in the pipeline . 
  the thickness of the pipe varied , and some welds did not penetrate the pipes completely . 
  as pg&e increased the pressure in the pipes to meet growing energy demand , the defective welds were further weakened until their failure . 
  as the pipeline was installed in 1956 , modern testing methods such as x-rays were not available to detect the problem at that time .
