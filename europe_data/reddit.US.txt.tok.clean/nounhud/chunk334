  what 's the age where that stops ? 
   it took 12,000 years of agriculture in a temperate climate for europeans and far-east asians to evolve to be hard-working and intelligent humans . 
  i 'm kinda dubious that work ethic is predominantly genes rather than environment you 're raised in . 
  well , i see several routes that would be potentially sustainable : * ** the conservative option ** . 
  go back to 1950s-style society , acceptance of abortion/contraception , etc. 
  maybe religion . 
  women mostly full-time raise children . 
  it 's time-tested and works . 
  downside is that you lose about half your productivity , which is a pretty serious reduction in standard of living . 
  * ** the progressive option ** . 
  alter society in some new , not-yet-tried way to produce a society that wants to raise children . 
  hard to evaluate , since this could be just about anything . 
  i can easily believe that progressivism has n't reached its final form yet , though . 
  * ** the incentive option ** . 
  set retirement age based on the number of children you 've raised , for example . 
  there is surely * some * knob or combination of knobs that can be turned to push people hard enough . 
  * ** the meat-grinder option ** . 
  as long as you 're comfortable with it , as long as somewhere else on earth another society is above replacement rate , and as long as they can be induced to immigrate ( easy these days , may not be down the road ) , you can just keep having your existing populating steadily dying off , but replenish it from outside . 
  the country becomes a construct of ideas more than one of bloodlines . 
  anyone immigrating does so intending to have a higher standard of living , but expecting that statistically , their descendants will probably die out . 
  * ** the statist option ** . 
  this is what we do with daycare and public education , but on overdrive . 
  the government raises children . 
  parents have limited or no interaction with them . 
  this would be a radical restructuring of society away from the family . 
  * ** the techno-utopia option ** . 
  technological advancements -- robots , cheap automated education , self-driving cars -- make it so easy and inexpensive to rear children that it becomes more appealing . 
   the us never went through destructive wars in the name of religion back when europe was , we were mostly europe . 
  and using religion in conflict for the `` fill people with an unyielding purpose '' bit was used too . 
  in the american civil war , the union 's battle song was the [ * the battle hymn of the republic * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5mmfpydk_8 ) :  mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord ;   he is trampling out the vintage where the   grapes of wrath are stored ;   he hath loosed the fateful lightning of his   terrible swift sword :   his truth is marching on . 
    his truth is marching on . 
    i have seen him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps ,   they have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps ;   i can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps :   his day is marching on . 
    his day is marching on . 
    i have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel :   `` as ye deal with my contemners , so with you my grace shall deal '' ;   let the hero , born of woman , crush the serpent with his heel ,   since god is marching on . 
    since god is marching on . 
    he has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat ;   he is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment-seat ;   oh , be swift , my soul , to answer him !, 
  be jubilant , my feet !, 
    our god is marching on . 
    our god is marching on . 
    in the beauty of the lilies christ was born across the sea ,   with a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me . 
    as he died to make men holy , let us die to make men free * , [ 14 ]   while god is marching on . 
    while god is marching on . 
  show me the last time any major us news media had a serving european union legislator working full time to inform the us public on europe . 
  this promises change !, 
  well , okay , yeah , but i mean that they conquered it while maintaining an affiliation with normandy . 
  it 's not just `` at some way back in time that we can establish via genetic sampling , someone 's ancestors lived somewhere else in the world '' . 
  well , yeah . 
  multinationals can make money overseas and avoid paying us taxes unless they repatriate the money . 
  buuuuttt , they want to avoid doing so because of differences in tax levels , and then we get back to that corporate tax level in europe . 
   being atheist makes you less likely to become president of us than being a socialist or a muslims . 
  --  nihilists !, 
  i mean , say what you like about the tenets of national socialism , dude , at least it 's an ethos . 
  -- * the big lebowski *, 
  kuwait has a higher ppp-adjusted per-capita gdp than any country in europe except luxembourg , and it can still manage a tfr of 2.44 , a fair bit above replacement level . 
  the arab world is growing , but [ not all that rapidly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate ) . 
  it 's really sub-saharan africa that 's skyrocketing . 
  http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/08/technology/donald-trump-internet/  `` we 're losing a lot of people because of the internet , '' trump said . 
  `` we have to go see bill gates and a lot of different people that really understand what 's happening . 
  we have to talk to them about , maybe in certain areas , closing that internet up in some way . 
  somebody will say , ` oh freedom of speech , freedom of speech . ', 
  these are foolish people . 
  we have a lot of foolish people . '', 
  people always complained that americans were n't familiar with europe . 
  this will surely lead to a large swath of the population that ordinarily would know little about europe becoming properly-informed . 
  well , california has a [ secession movement ] ( http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/12/13/from-his-home-in-russia-calexit-leader-plots-california-secession/ ) , though its leader is living in russia ... 
  we do n't have a system with a recall vote , so there 's no real pressure from the public on presidents normally . 
  the next input will be four years from now . 
  [ trump is the only us president ever to not own a pet . 
  ] ( http://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2016-12-22/will-donald-trump-have-a-presidential-pet ), 
  hmm . 
  i think that i may not have gotten my point across in my comment -- what i was getting at is that he 's definitely german-american . 
  not true . 
  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/23/for-u-s-presidents-odds-for-a-second-term-are-surprisingly-long.html  of the 42 men who served as president before the current incumbent , only 15 won two consecutive elections . 
  also , trump , like hillary , is very unpopular -- neither of the two would have fared well against a typical presidential candidate . 
  typically presidential approval is higher entering office . 
  so unless he manages to do an outstanding job at building support from democrats or unless the democratic party runs an absolutely horrible candidate in four years , trump will most-likely be a one-term candidate . 
  `` i only really watched the speech for the ` climate change is a chinese plot ' bit , and i did n't get it . 
  what the hell ? '', 
  not the most significant point factor . 
  obama has a net worth of [ about $ 12m from a combination of book deals and his $ 400k/year salary as president ] ( https://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/barack-obamas-net-worth-54-happy-birthday-mr-president/ ) . 
  the rule-of-thumb retirement strategy is to assume a 4 % safe , inflation-proof annual withdrawal rate from assets held in stocks . 
  so he 's got $ 480,000 / year in passive income for the rest of his life even ignoring the pension . 
  he 's not among the super-duper wealthy , but he certainly is n't under pressure to punch a time clock . 
  in all fairness , we * did * do the whole american civil war thing . 
   in fact the nato leeches need to start kicking some shit our way you * do * know that trump was in error when he thought that the nato budget issue referred to some sort of money that countries paid the us , right ? 
  [ us presidents can hold dual citizenship ] ( https://www.quora.com/can-a-candidate-for-us-president-born-in-the-usa-hold-dual-citizenship-or-do-they-have-to-renounce-their-foreign-citizenship ) , but [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nationality_law ) , germany apparently does not normally permit dual citizenship unless it 's an eu or swiss citizen . 
  [ no , no , do n't be modest now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_of_donald_trump#ancestry ) :  donald trump 's paternal ancestry is traceable to kallstadt , a village in the palatinate , germany . 
  the trump surname is on record there from the 17th century . 
  [ 22 ] johann philipp trump had established himself as a winegrower in kallstadt by the late 17th century . 
  [ 23 ] trump has said that he is `` proud '' of his german heritage , and he served as grand marshal of the 1999 german-american steuben parade in new york city . 
   i mean , you 'd expect a world leader to not make such mistakes you may have perhaps not been following president trump 's statements over the last year . 
   ah , yes !, 
  i ca n't precisely recall everything from my american civilization books , i was sure for a minute that lincoln had to use some sort of special trick to make sure ohio joined the union . 
  i 'll look it up tonight . 
  you 're possibly thinking of west virginia . 
  it would have been part of the confederate states of america as western virginia , but in part because it contained a [ militarily-critical railroad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltimore_and_ohio_railroad ) , lincoln decided that it was worth offering west virginia statehood ( and thus two senate votes in perpetuity ) if they would secede from virginia . 
  you might also be thinking of maryland , which came [ very close to joining the confederacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maryland_in_the_american_civil_war ) ( which would have been awkward , since if both maryland and virginia joined the confederacy , washington dc would have been surrounded ) . 
  baltimore was particularly opposed to the union :  after the april 19 rioting , skirmishes continued in baltimore for the next month . 
  mayor george william brown and maryland governor thomas hicks implored president lincoln to reroute troops around baltimore city and through annapolis to avoid further confrontations . 
  [ 14 ] in a letter to president lincoln , mayor brown wrote :    it is my solemn duty to inform you that it is not possible for more soldiers to pass through baltimore unless they fight their way at every step .
