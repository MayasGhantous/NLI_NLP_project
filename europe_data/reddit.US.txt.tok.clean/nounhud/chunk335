  i therefore hope and trust and most earnestly request that no more troops be permitted or ordered by the government to pass through the city . 
  if they should attempt it , the responsibility for the bloodshed will not rest upon me . 
  [ 14 ]   hearing no immediate reply from washington , on the evening of april 19 governor hicks and mayor brown ordered the destruction of railroad bridges leading into the city from the north , preventing further incursions by union soldiers . 
  the destruction was accomplished the next day . 
  [ 15 ] one of the men involved in this destruction would be arrested for it in may without recourse to * habeas corpus * , leading to the * ex parte * merryman ruling . 
  for a time it looked as if maryland was one provocation away from joining the rebels , but lincoln moved swiftly to defuse the situation , promising that the troops were needed purely to defend washington , not to attack the south . 
  [ 16 ] president lincoln also complied with the request to reroute troops to annapolis , as the political situation in baltimore remained highly volatile . 
  meanwhile , general winfield scott , who was in charge of military operations in maryland indicated in correspondence with the head of pennsylvania troops that the route through baltimore would resume once sufficient troops were available to secure baltimore . 
  [ 17 ] shortly afterwards , federal soldiers were able to occupy and declare martial law in maryland :  on may 13 , 1861 general benjamin f. butler entered baltimore by rail with 1,000 federal soldiers and , under cover of a thunderstorm , quietly took possession of federal hill . 
  [ 8 ] butler fortified his position and trained his guns upon the city , threatening its destruction . 
  [ 25 ] butler then sent a letter to the commander of fort mchenry :    i have taken possession of baltimore . 
  my troops are on federal hill , which i can hold with the aid of my artillery . 
  if i am attacked to-night , please open upon monument square with your mortars . 
   jean-claude juncker : hands off eu , trump ; we do n't back ohio secession michigan : now let 's not get ahead of ourselves . 
  there might be something in this ohio secession idea . 
    denmark and the uk have official state religions . 
    yet both are two of the most secularist nations in the world . 
  if you want to reliably kill something , have the government run it and deeply involved with it . 
  goes for the church or the economy ... 
   i find it all very tacky , but somehow americans can pull that shit off . 
  would look ridiculous in a european country . 
  rolling back two months : [ polish bishops and president duda declare christ king of poland ] ( http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/polish-bishops-and-president-duda-declare-christ-king-poland ) [ youtube video of enthronization ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzv9dog0ksk ), 
  nah , trump is german-american , like george w. bush and eisenhower . 
  i 'm sure he 'll get along fine with germany . 
   `` the uk has always agreed , and the g20 summit in antalya said , that we will not use taxation of companies as ... an instrument for competition -- that has been agreed , '' he said . 
  seems like a crazy thing to commit to , but all right , fair enough . 
  we need to crack down on rogue countries that let companies get away with low corporate tax . 
  http://taxfoundation.org/article/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-world-2016  the united states has the third highest general top marginal corporate income tax rate in the world , at 38.92 percent . 
  due to the recent reduction in chad 's corporate tax rate , the u.s. rate is exceeded only by the united arab emirates and puerto rico . 
  --  by region , europe has the lowest average corporate tax rate , at 18.88 percent ( 26.22 percent , weighted by gdp ) . 
  time to put your money where your mouth is !, 
  it 's time to get taxing !, 
  i 'm not really sure that counts . 
  that aristocracy came from normandy , so that was closer to great britain being part of france . 
   can a military just drive tanks or whatever through another country in schengen europe without repercussions ? 
  not unless world war iii breaks out . 
  [ in anything short of that , nato has to get clearance from every country along the way when moving forces , which is kind of a pain in the ass ] ( https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2016-06-06/schengen-zone-nato ) . 
   moving troops across europe requires permission at each border . 
  `` during the cold war , we had pretty good plans to rapidly move across borders , but until [ the 2014 nato summit in ] wales we did n't have similar plans for new nato member states , '' says a nato official knowledgeable with the issue . 
  `` right after crimea we sent out a questionnaire about [ border regulations ] to each member states , and the results were pretty scary . 
  some countries needed to recall parliament in order to let nato units cross their borders . 
  and one country said , ` we can only have 1,600 soldiers on our soil . ''' in reality , that meant that nato would be unable to use that member state , which the nato official declined to identify , for passage . 
   the british army has secretly moved tanks through the channel tunnel to test the rail network in case of an invasion of eastern europe . 
  you guys have seriously * never * used the channel tunnel to move tanks out of the uk before ? 
  you always used ships or aircraft ? 
  it 's technically got two okay-to-use names now , czech republic and czechia . 
  it 's just that only squares use `` czech republic '' . 
   the only things americans have learned from the eu is bureaucracy and inability to secure borders or security . 
  i 've got no idea what you 're saying . 
  we used to have no border control at all up until the late 1800s . 
  i do n't think that the eu affected the degree of bureaucracy in the us in any significant way . 
   additionally , every attempt to do so in the past has faced stiff resistance from all the other european nations to the point of two world wars and a huge alliance of everyone vs france . 
  well , the flip side of it is that you guys do keep trying . 
   can you imagine france ceding it 's language to become german speaking ? 
  neither can i. 
  so the language barrier will remain . 
  i do n't think that there will be any sort of formal adoption any time soon . 
  i * do * think that there will be steady drift towards a de-facto * lingua franca * . 
  i 've [ gone over the potential candidate languages before ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/551ozm/france_turns_anglophone_to_woo_uk_businesses/d873jwl/ ) , and will also bet that barring some significant change , it will probably be english ( though when i wrote this , brexit was seen as unlikely to happen , so who knows ... ) if not , german would be one of the stronger contenders ( most-common first language in europe , but little-spoken outside of europe ) , but ... 
  relative to the proportions of population in the eu ? 
  never is a long time . 
   that being said , uniting a bunch of small independent kingdoms with the same language and similar culture is a lot easier than uniting several highly nationalistic countries with different languages and significant cultural differences . 
  people traveled less then , there was n't mass media , and literacy was n't widespread . 
  you sure that there was n't a lot of language variation and cultural variation throughout what is modern-day germany ? 
   nigeria and indonesia well ... they have large populations ... 
  i did not like it as much as his past talks . 
  in his past talks , when he was talking about trade policy , i felt that he was being more objective . 
  he mostly avoided language that had emotional connotations ( `` jingoism '' , etc ) and he was concrete about his concerns . 
  this one dealt more with politics and his political preference played a larger role . 
  his concerns were largely vague and not very well expanded upon -- it felt more like someone just expressing frustration and trying to remain calm while doing so . 
  i think that i could have taken his past talks and given them to anyone , on either side of the issue , and they 'd at least have been willing to listen . 
  on this one , i think that people who want a hard brexit might cut him off partway through . 
   civil vs. common law for one thing . 
  ehh ... louisiana and quebec have a civil law-derived system rather than the common law that dominates elsewhere in the country , and canada and the other states in the us respectively get along with them . 
  normally , `` expat '' is intended to be temporary , `` immigrant '' is intended to be permanent . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/expatriate  one who lives outside one 's own country . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/immigrant  a person who comes to a country from another country in order to permanently settle there . 
  employer-funded group health insurance , the normal route to fund healthcare in the us , should n't show up as household income either . 
  though i guess if you 're retired and have individually-purchased health insurance , it would . 
  that does n't make * that * large of a difference , though . 
  i dug up the numbers for retirees a couple of days ago for a discussion in / r/unitedkingdom , and it looks like a retiree -- the demographic group that will spent the most on healthcare -- [ spends about 12 % of their budget on healthcare ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/5o9ywz/britain_is_one_of_the_worst_advanced_economies/dchs3j8/ ) . 
  regardless of the political positions , i think that it 's easily safe to say that the uk and the us are proportionally highly-represented , though i 'd bet that a big whack of that is english use . 
  that is , i bet that there are more people from the us wandering around here than on the polish-language / r/polska . 
  i 'm not saying that that 's not an input , but it clearly does n't always dominate . 
  if that 's true , the uk public should more-strongly favor freedom of movement with the us than the us public should favor freedom of movement with the uk . 
  yougov says that the opposite is the case . 
  [ median household income in the uk for 2013-2014 was # 23,556 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/income_in_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  at current exchange rates , that 'd be $ 28,945 . 
  [ median household income in the us for 2014 in the us was $ 53,718 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/household_income_in_the_united_states ) . 
  [ yougov polling data shows significantly-stronger support for us-uk free movement in the us than in the uk ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/11/19/majority-support-commonwealth-freedom-movement/ ) . 
   us support : 56 % , us oppose : 22 % , us do n't know : 21 %   uk support :45 % , uk oppose : 27 % , uk do n't know 27 %, 
   48 per cent said they felt especially favourable towards australia , 47 per cent towards new zealand and 44 per cent towards canada . 
  the next most favourably regarded country , the us , was way behind on 31 per cent . 
  in europe , even the most well-regarded states , the netherlands and sweden , trailed badly on 24 and 23 per cent . 
  ( ireland was only 18 per cent . ), 
  sheesh , dump * one * shipload of tea , and you never hear the end of it . 
  also , yougov numbers from late 2015 show much higher support for movement with all countries and with the us about on par with the eu rather than higher : https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/11/19/majority-support-commonwealth-freedom-movement/  ** british support for freedom of movement in the west **   do you support or oppose british citizens and citizens from the following areas having the freedom of movement to live and work in each others ' countries ? 
    | region | support | oppose | do n't know |  | - | - | - | - |  | canada , nz , australia | 58 | 19 | 23 |  | usa | 45 | 27 | 27 |  | european union | 46 | 35 | 19 |, 
   furthermore , it 's not like population growth automatically increases economy . 
  the additional people need to actually contribute through employment or enterpreneurship .
