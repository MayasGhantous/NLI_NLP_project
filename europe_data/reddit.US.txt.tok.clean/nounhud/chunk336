  come on , though . 
  if they do * anything * , even something which is less-productive than the bulk of the population , they 're increasing gdp . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_by_population_density this one has population density so you do n't have to do the math to sort . 
  france still wins , with greece a runner-up . 
  the town of silent hill is [ supposed to be in maine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silent_hill#recurring_elements ) , which is about at southern france 's latitude . 
  sweden would be way , way darker than silent hill . 
  hmm . 
  i 'm still pretty sure that it 's not the term you 'd use . 
  the connotation is one of relaxing rather than countering . 
  if someone winds up saying `` okay , i do n't * really * need to use chemical weapons against you ... i 'll stick with conventional warfare '' , that 'd be a mollification . 
  if someone ca n't use chemical weapons because i bombed their chemical weapons stockpile , i do n't think that it 'd be correct to call it a mollification . 
  https://www.quora.com/how-did-london-become-the-financial-centre-of-the-world  london was helped for a period around the turn of the millennium by light touch regulation , at a time when new york was encumbered with excessive bureaucracy , a prohibitive litigious culture and restrictive regulatory reforms in the form of the sarbanes-oxley act - the latter designed to prevent another enron scandal . 
  discussed in this new york times article , foreign companies simply decided to avoid the hassle by conducting their business and listing their stocks in london . 
  [ shrug ] i 've no expertise on the matter . 
  in 2012 , it [ looks like len pen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2012 ) beat the poll predictions ... but it 's not by the kind of difference required to win predicted in the 2017 polls . 
  the average of the poll results listed in wikipedia gave her 15.39 % , and she actually got 17.90 % , so a vote count 16 % higher than her polls predicted . 
  based on the numbers / u/xbettel gave for the second round , her best second-round matchup is against fillon , and she 's still need a result 70 % higher than her polls are predicting to win . 
  they 'd have to be way , way off , or you 'd need some major event to occur right before the election that radically shifted opinion . 
  edit : wait , no , because every time she gets a vote , fillon also loses a vote , so she 'd need to be 35 % higher than her polls are predicting , not 70 % higher . 
  still , over double the poll error in 2012 would be necessary . 
   i think what he 's referring to is china 's history of extreme censorship which could be used to effectively mollify russian media campaigns hmm . 
  okay . 
  ( also , i think you want `` neutralize '' or similar rather than `` mollify '' , which would be more like `` soothing and making happy again '' ) . 
   unlike western democracies , china will have none of that shit and hit back immediatly hmm . 
  what 's your basis for saying this ? 
  china has far less economic influence on russia than the eu ( the us is not economically all that important to russia ) , and much less conventional or nuclear military clout than nato . 
  china might take different actions , but i am not convinced that china would be dramatically-harsher . 
  i 'd say that if there 's a difference , it 's because it encourages the * dismantlement * of china . 
  that 's a lot more-extreme than the actions proposed as regards the us ( which are comparatively mild , just trying to paralyze the us and keep it not involved ) , and really even more extreme than the eu ( where the idea is to dominate the east and keep the west from becoming something that would oppose russia ) . 
  i think what set him off was being talked over . 
  honestly , i think that this is a bad trend in interviews . 
  i could very easily believe that nemtsov 's killing was for political reasons . 
  but i do not think that it is reasonable to simply assert that putin directed this . 
  the location where he was killed , which the journalist cited as evidence , should not dictate who acted , for example -- it 's not as if the kremlin 's security as a whole would have been involved with an assassination . 
   from my understanding , the plan is to put solar panels all over the tube . 
  oh , that 's just musk off doing his usual `` hype to the latte-sipping crowd '' thing . 
  there 's no reason to use solar power over any other sort of power if it were to be built . 
  in fact , solar power alone would be extremely unsuitable -- solar is not reliable , and this would require reliable power , so you 'd basically just be building a transport system and then throwing grid-attached solar cells on the top of it for the hell of it . 
  the new guy likes talking about protectionism a lot . 
  i am very doubtful that the trump administration will adopt particularly hostile-to-trade policies . 
  in fact , they 've been advocating for bilateral trade agreements for some time ( which would be one possible thing that the uk would be going for , barring addition to either nafta or tpp ) : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-trade-adviser-iduskbn14x1x8  on wednesday , trump 's nominee for secretary of state , rex tillerson , said he was not opposed to president barack obama 's 12-country pacific rim trade deal but shared some of trump 's views `` on whether the agreement that was negotiated serves all of america 's interests at best . '', 
    speaking by phone late on thursday , the trump adviser said tillerson was expressing some personal views on free trade theory . 
  the adviser said the administration was not going to pursue multilateral trade deals . 
    `` you will be shocked by the speed at which bilateral agreements begin to materialize , '' the adviser said . 
  i do n't think that most of these are very accurate . 
   eu : `` hmm nope , we pass . '', 
  agreed , though i still have a hard time believing that the eu and the uk would * completely * go wto . 
  but . . < shrug   india : `` no indians , no deals . 
  want some vindaloo chicken ? '', 
  not clear to me how committed india is to this position . 
  i certainly think that it would be a far lower level of commitment than the eu would have , since india is n't trying to build something like the eu with the uk . 
   usa : '' sorry , we 're closed '' . 
  not an accurate representation . 
  obama said that it will be in line behind ttip ( and if that will not go through with the eu , it kind of eliminates any reason to hold off ) , and trump has been running around saying that he 's enthusiastic about a uk trade deal , though i 'm discinclined to put a lot of faith in what trump claims translating to policy . 
   australia : `` sorry mate , kind of busy right now , ca n't do a thing '' http://news.sky.com/story/ireland-warns-of-difficulties-negotiating-post-brexit-trade-deal-10734565  earlier , australia 's finance minister has told sky news he expects a free trade agreement to be done `` very quickly '' . 
    mathias cromann said there had been `` preliminary conversations '' between the two countries and there was `` goodwill on both sides '' . 
  --  canada : `` idk , let 's see how this thing goes with the european first '' . 
  i do n't see canada making much by way of statements , but i agree that ceta will be more-important to canada , and until it 's actually through , it 's possible that canada 's position would be similar to what obama said . 
   china : `` free-trade deal with united-great - mighty-kingdom ? 
  yes !, 
  of course !, 
  we buy everything , we sell everything !, 
  yes . 
  i think that the real question is more the nature of the terms that an agreement would have , not `` can the uk sign a deal to avoid wto tariffs with countries '' . 
  apparently [ india 's government is working on it ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/08/indias-government-is-now-shaming-people-into-using-toilets/?utm_term=.aaf34881d3e5 ) :  in fact , the advertisements mock the very idea that india is developing . 
  the tagline says : `` only the habit of using a toilet is real progress . ''   and the ridiculing is done by children . 
    `` uncle , you wear a tie around your neck , shoes on your feet , but you still defecate in the open . 
  what kind of progress is this ? '' asks a child in one commercial . 
  another says : `` you may have a smartphone in your hand , but you still squat on train tracks . ''   children are also shown making fun of men who buy a new flat-screen tv , refrigerator and a motorcycle but do not use a toilet . 
  i 'd like to note that if the uk opens up free movement to au , ca , and the us and visa versa , one of two things will happen : * the uk will have no functioning state healthcare system . 
  * the uk will have to pay market rates for doctors ( 2-3x current uk pay for doctors ) . 
  edit : now , admittedly , doctors are just a drop in the bucket compared to all of the other things this affects vis-a-vis the economy , but pointing out that among other things , goods and services needed in those countries are different than what the uk 's economy has become adapted to . 
  karl popper is not really someone who i normally hear described as particularly controversial . 
   for example there were some time ago a famous movement ` femen ' . 
  there are rumors , that soros stopped to support and financing them . 
  that 's the one that pays women to run around topless , right ? 
  i 've seen more-objectionable movements . 
  just as an english nitpick , it would be `` prescribed '' rather than `` prescripted '' . 
  someone writing a `` prescription '' is `` prescribing '' the medicine . 
  will it ? 
  my understanding is that a major part of his claims is that the energy requirements per passenger are far lower than other forms of transit , like car , plane , or train . 
   germany , under fire from u.s. president-elect donald trump for not meeting nato 's defense spending goal , is boosting military budgets , but ** also wants trump to map out a consistent foreign policy agenda ** , defense minister ursula von der leyen said . 
  yeah , the line for that starts somewhere back there , germany . 
  we 've been waiting for over a year now . 
  crushed by itself , not the uk . 
  the author was really working bard to produce an inflammatory , misleading headline . 
  nice try , rolex . 
  why would solar be relevant ? 
  option a : establishing trade with eu and working toward eu membership in ukraine is popular . 
  ukraine and eu have been negotiating trade for some time . 
  russia buys off ukrainian leadership , which makes unpopular move to dump eu and make trade arrangement with the russia . 
  citizen opposition starts with protests in front of the legislature that become increasingly-violent . 
  parliament enthusiastically declares him to have abandoned his position . 
  russian soldiers attack crimea and donbas . 
  russian domestic propaganda goes bonkers . 
  a wide-body passenger jet is shot down by a russian anti-aircraft battery . 
  option b : ukraine is influenced to join a european trade bloc by the us , even though that trade bloc is probably the largest economic competitor -- albeit a friendly one -- with the us . 
  russian negotiation convinces ukraine to do otherwise . 
  in a panicked , snap response to its failed attempt at skulduggery , the cia promptly organizes street violence in an operation without a single leak . 
  the ukrainian government is overthrown by these cia-controlled actors .
