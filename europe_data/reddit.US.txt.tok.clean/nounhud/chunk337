  president escapes . 
  presumably cia-controlled parliament ( honestly , we should just shortcut past all this and have the cia control the russian duma if we can do this ... ) colluding in this against-the-will-of-ukraine operation declares the president invalid . 
  ukrainian citizens in ~ ~ crimea and ~ ~ ( turns out that that was actually russian soldiers , whoops ) donbas rise up against their oppressors . 
  an elaborate cia-ukrainian false flag operation frames russia for shooting down a plane . 
  russian domestic media battles valiantly to get the truth out , but is opposed by a grand , unprecedented coalition of both public and private news media across the west promoting lies . 
  in an abrupt reversal to this flawless , masterful political control of countries , the eu lets an embarrassing dutch referendum out . 
  i just find option a to be a whole lot more plausible . 
  if you 're gon na use `` sphere of influence '' in that sense , though , it 's not the same kind of relationship . 
  we 're big , and we are a major figure in world affairs , but i mean , we are n't annexing bits of canada , and we do n't say `` mexico as a country has no meaning '' . 
  edit : well , not annexing since 1812 against canada ( loss ) and 1848 against mexico ( win ) . 
   well who is `` you '' ? 
  people wearing the flag of europe flair !, 
   i honestly think we are too far gone in the direction of peace to ever go to war between europeans again . 
  maybe !, 
  i was thinking less in terms of going to war in europe and more of susceptibility to populist demagoguery . 
  i mean , i ca n't think of a single bundle that 'd be the same , but that 's equally true of most national leaders . 
  what characteristics would the french reject that the us would accept ? 
  i mean , what is fundamentally incompatible ? 
  i believe that / u/executivemonkey is irish . 
  if he gets credit for anything it should be contributing st. patrick 's day . 
   if you do n't think that more free trade and globalization is better for working people then you do n't need to go into details to understand is not good for you . 
  i would note that your flair reads `` polish , working in france '' . 
  surely you work in france becauwe you see that cross-border interchange as beneficial , rather than just working in poland ? 
  why would you of all people object globalization ? 
   i 'm sorry , but the usa has crazy politics compared to us and a trump-like candidate could never win here . 
  you had hitler and the holocaust and the general consensus was a smug `` hah , could never happen here '' until we [ started experimenting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milgram_experiment ) . 
  i 'm pretty confident that `` it can never happen here '' generates unwarranted confidence in people around the world . 
  people do n't differ * that * much . 
  a lot of people here thought that the prospect of trump winning here was absurd . 
  a republican hardcore social conservative , maybe , or a hawk , or even a libertarianish type . 
  but surely not * trump * . 
  yeah , but you wrote your comment in english ... maybe you 're not * really * qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois . 
   a referendum which was not recognized by any government in the world as valid , well , technically [ afghanistan , cuba , kyrgyzstan , north korea , russia , syria , and venezuela ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_crimea ) consider crimea part of russia , so it 's not * nobody * here . 
  a minority , 7 out of the 197 countries , do . 
  that is how a [ parliamentary system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_system ) works . 
  we do n't have a parliamentary system . 
  trump is head of the executive branch . 
  the house and the senate make up the legislative branch . 
  trump does not head these , though the republican party presently controls both . 
  the executive and legislative are separate branches of government , neither superior to the other , though both have some degree of influence on the other . 
  there have even -- rarely -- been cases where [ presidents become locked in conflict with their own party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_tyler ), 
  internationalism : the new vogue in nationalism . 
  `` do you read reddit all day ? 
  you might be just who we 're looking for ! '', 
  if that miniscule amount was what you meant , your post would still be incorrect -- countries have not failed to fund the infrastructure . 
  i 'm pretty confident that you 'd have been happier with johnson in power than trump . 
  pretty sure that mexico would be in that , fwiw . 
   second eu will just say they will demand 0 trade deficit with uk , nobody can blame them it 's the economically sound thing to do * trade equilibrium is self-balancing in the long term . 
  * you can balance it via trade through a third partner . 
  like a net exports to b , b net exports to c , c net exports to a. 
  forcing a-b trade into equilibrium would generate economic inefficiency . 
  just to clear things up , 2 % is the amount of a country 's gdp that nato asks it to spend as a minimum on defense . 
  there are to `` payments '' . 
  trump , intentionally or more likely via ignorance and not vetting his statements before making them , was unaware of this in one statement that he made . 
  i 'm assuming that you inherited the misinformation from him . 
  you can do better . 
  you had a say in it . 
  a majority eu vote . 
  and while i do n't think that the outcome was the best one for the eu , it did have finland 's input . 
  and part german . 
  ironic , that . 
  if you really want to be technical , the english channel is about twenty miles wide at the narrowest and british and us soil are about half a mile apart between the british and us virgin islands at their narrowest . 
  edit : though you could say that the channel tunnel trumps that . 
  was n't littlefinger canny and politically-competent ? 
  ehh ... there are models that take into account the electoral college , and clinton was still favored going in . 
  i looked at seat count a while back , and the ep is somewhat-weighted against the most populous countries . 
  the french have higher presidential election turnouts than we do ( looks like [ ~ 72 % ] ( https://followmyvote.com/comparing-americas-voter-turnout/ ) , compared to our ~ 53 % ) , but 72 % is also about what the british turnout for the brexit vote was . 
  if it makes you feel better , trump has also declared that he 's ripping up the fta with the us 's # 1 and # 3 trade partners , imposing 35 % tariffs or something on the us 's # 2 trade partner , trying to get an f-18-based replacement for the f-35 , declared that he might jump into a major political conflict with china over taiwan , and a number of other things . 
  trump has been long on controversial declarations and very short on providing any sort of concrete plans , has completely-reversed himself on major public statements multiple times within the same day , and has been regularly contradicted by his vp and people working for him . 
  while obviously trump saying something is n't to be ignored , i 'd say that there 's a pretty strong argument that what trump declares is disconnected from what his administration actually does . 
  he is n't anti-eu . 
  wage pressure will happen long before the bulk of the jobs go away , though . 
  if you only need n people , wages only need to be high enough to retain those n people in the industry . 
   as distasteful as pp and rajoy might be , it seems to me that spain is one of the most economically and politically stable countries in europe at the moment . 
  they just spent a year without a government . 
  i really do n't think that spain is the most-politically-stable country in europe . 
  `` pessimistic '' is not equivalent to `` wants to leave '' , though . 
  how significant is the cap versus acting as a low-tax-but-in-the-eu destination ? 
  that 's right , new zealand !, 
  you 're boned !, 
  [ particularly for aircraft . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holloman_air_force_base#german_air_force_flying_training_center ) ( [ video in german ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbvern8pdpe ) ) . 
  more open space here to cruise around without irritating residents . 
  yeah , i guess that 's what i should have said . 
  given the polar snap , i assume that hel has frozen over ? 
  it sounds like he 's an annoying jerk . 
  there are legions of annoying jerks online . 
  why get excited about it ? 
  he 's not threatening you , dude . 
  would make for a good polandball comic ... 
  even aside from the other issues involved ... while i do n't agree with the soviet taking of poland , at the end of the day , they were after taking land and wealth , to make the ussr wealthier and more powerful . 
  they were n't out to simply kill poles . 
  using atomic bombs against cities simply to inflict pain would amount to genocide of russians . 
  the strategic firebombing of cities , which we 'd been merely doing against countries that had declared war on us , were already considered horrors . 
  while i do n't know my russian history , i doubt that most people in russia were particularly hell-bent on conquest . 
  oh , sure pride in country and all that , everyone 's got that , and after operation barbarossa , soviets would have been defending their homeland . 
  but i remember reading back to the winter war . 
  one russian that the finns captured ( and then used for propaganda purposes ) was carrying a pair of women 's shoes in his pack . 
  he 'd originally gone into town to buy a pair of shoes for his wife , and was simply press-ganged by recruiters looking to fill a quota . 
  a lot of soviet soldiers coming in has been told that the finns were oppressed and wanted to adopt communism , but that the whites had been preventing them -- they 'd join the liberation when the soviets came .
