  one guy in an inflatable boat with a gasoline-powered angle grinder is going to go through that without much trouble . 
  you can secure the mediterranean sea border without problems . 
  the issue is just that you have to * do * something with the people you intercept . 
  you going to shoot them ? 
  that 's not going to politically sell , and if you honestly-believed that europe 's public was at that point , there are less-extreme-but-effective approaches that i think would be much-preferable . 
  you going to register them ? 
  greece is n't going to as long as it means that they have risk of being legally stuck with them , and that is n't actually a place to put someone . 
  you going to let them all into sweden/germany ? 
  neither country 's public is going to be willing . 
  you going to redistribute ? 
  uninvolved european countries are n't going to be willing , because they do n't want the risk of being legally stuck with anyone . 
  you going to adopt the pacific solution ? 
  * i * think that that makes the most sense , in that it addresses legitimate concerns of safety for people who fear for their lives , does n't burden any one country unacceptably , and creates sane incentives . 
  it avoids crime and instability issues . 
  if you * auction * hoteling space , it 's even economically-efficient . 
  however , there has n't been apparent interest . 
  it will cost something , and it means that you wo n't be getting any economic return from people , but it 's been proven to work on at least a smaller scale . 
  you going to send people to turkey ? 
  turkey ( was n't ) going to just accept them . 
  merkel 's current deal with turkey would theoretically address that , and cap migration at current levels and disincentivize illegal migration . 
  if it works , it might be seen as gentler than the pacific solution , and certainly it has some of the same goals of changing incentives . 
  i am doubtful -- under the system , turkey has no incentive to actively participate in stopping illegal migration -- every illegal migrant that gets * in * is one less they have to worry about . 
  the eu ( well , non-turkish european nato members , looks like , until ) pretty much is on the hook . 
  i doubt that it will be popular with the turkish public , and it kinda treats turkey as a dumping ground . 
  the whole thing feels like two parties both trying to make a deal that neither has an interest in really sticking with and trying to make mutually-advantageous . 
  i have a hard time seeing happy countries coming out of this . 
  you going to put people in no-leaving-allowed concentration camps in greece ? 
  you 'd have to stretch the refugee convention to near-breaking point , since it mandates freedom of movement . 
  you could claim that your `` processing time '' is causing a `` backlog '' and thus effectively ignore that the refugee convention mandates no limits and freedom of movement -- this is what the us does . 
  but it 's a lot of dancing around for a relatively small political gain . 
  greece is again going to be worried about being stuck with people in the long term , and it 's not going to be popular with greeks ( though probably more popular than using * all * of greece as a holding tank ) . 
  i think that by taking an open position ( particularly a politically-convenient `` open '' position and trying to close things via dublin agreements ) , germany did exacerbate things ( and ditto for sweden 's leadership ) . 
  i do not think that anything like the 97 % of the flow that you 're blaming on it was due to that . 
  i was with you on the bit about `` the eu is a union , and this is not a great way to deal with problems '' , but i disagree that that was the root cause . 
  the stance germany adopted might have exacerbated things , but there was a legal loophole to allow joining the west -- people were already coming . 
  it 's too neat to just pick a person and blame them . 
  finally , * if * the turkey agreement that merkel set up works -- and i 'm not convinced that it will -- it will disincentivize illegal immigration through greece . 
  [ scilly seemed to be enjoying the affair in 1985 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_hundred_and_thirty_five_years'_war ) . 
  so , as i understand the initial dispute , the polish legislature under the pis tried effectively changing the rules of [ judicial review ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judicial_review ) such that it could [ control the court ] ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-12-31/poland-s-new-leaders-take-aim-at-democracy ) . 
  the court rejected this , and asserted its independence and that the legislature could not define its scope . 
  the us had a rather similar ( and quite famous ) early scotus case , [ * marbury v. madison * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marbury_v._madison ) . 
  the same thing happened -- the legislature tried adjusting the rules of the judiciary ( in this case , actually increasing its power ) . 
  the supreme court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the legislature to do this . 
  in doing so , however , it basically seized what became its largest power over time -- the ability to perform judicial review and have independence from the legislature . 
  no explicit provision was made for this , and while it was ultimately-accepted as working well , there are still some arguments that the supreme court was never clearly granted power to make such a call . 
  i do n't know the polish constitution , so i ca n't say whether or not the same thing applied , but i think that it 's worth pointing out that whatever pis is doing , the us was n't all that far off . 
  granted , the us ultimately * accepted * the judiciary 's decision on the judiciary 's independence and authority , whereas it looks like pis is challenging it , but it 's not as if this was n't a dispute at one point . 
  the infamous [ switch in time that saved nine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_switch_in_time_that_saved_nine ) was a case where the us executive branch ( fdr ) came very close to taking actions that would have effectively gutted the independence of the judicial branch . 
  this is n't to say that poland 's legislature is innocent here , or that they ca n't learn from those cases ... but that the us has done things very similar to what poland has done today , even if in hindsight they were seen as a bad idea . 
   i do n't know how your immigration system works in england , but here in canada we did away with preferential immigration of that kind decades ago . 
  well , [ sort of ] ( http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/canada-us-uk-immigration-rules/ ) . 
  soft limits instead of hard ones these days :  canada 's new federal skilled worker program kicks in on may 4 . 
  like the old immigration rules , potential immigrants get points for certain characteristics . 
  the passing grade is still 67 out of 100 , but the government has altered how many points each trait is worth . 
  as a result , yanks and brits will have an advantage -- as will aussies , kiwis , the french , anyone from an english - or french-speaking nation . 
  for some , particularly older immigrants who do n't speak either official language well , immigration to canada through this program will become next to impossible . 
  but for others , like our southern neighbours , it 's about to get a lot easier . 
    the emphasis on language provides the biggest boost . 
  the category is now the most crucial , worth 28 points -- an increase of four . 
  but that 's only half the story . 
  in an e-mail exchange , citizen and immigration canada explained that points given for bilingualism have been cut in half , from eight to four , due to a `` lack of evidence that second language ability contributes to positive economic outcomes for the majority of applicants . '' in other words , an english-only-speaking american now receives up to 24 points instead of 16 -- an eight-point increase . 
  and five extra points are now given in the adaptability category ( worth a total of 10 points ) if your spouse is fluent in english or french . 
  so if you 're a married american , you could gain 13 more points . 
  easy peasy . 
  [ snip ]  that said , the other big changes to the new system relate to age , and if you 're older you could lose more than you gain . 
  the age category has been boosted by two points and , more importantly , the target age range lowered . 
  previously , applicants could get the full 10 points if they were 49 or younger . 
  that number has dropped dramatically to 35 . 
  and the work experience category , which benefits older immigrants , has been reduced from 21 points to 15 . 
  so , if you 're an experienced , 48-year-old american , you just lost 16 points -- more than you 'll gain with the new language bonuses . 
    but for young americans , moving to canada will be much easier than before . 
  the u.s. is typically our fourth biggest source of immigrants , followed closely by the u.k. , each representing almost 10,000 new permanent residents per year . 
  american numbers spiked somewhat during the recession , but both countries have been warming up to canada over the last decade . 
  in the early 2000s , between 5,000 and 6,000 new immigrants typically came in each year per country . 
  by 2010 , those numbers shot up roughly 40 % , following , for the most part , yearly increases ( see chart , above ) . 
    as you can see , there 's already a trend of americans and brits increasingly relocating to canada ( and to a lesser extent , the french ) . 
  people want to move here -- and for the ones already most similar to us , the harper government just made it easier . 
  that by itself is reason to suspect the increase we 've already seen will continue -- and could even spike . 
  yes , it was working out great until it was supplanted by the great united states-north korea alliance that to this day dominates us foreign affairs . 
  we 'd kept it secret for decades until / u/black-metal-is - gay uncovered it , but i 'm afraid that the cat is out of the bag now . 
  fair enough -- was just the context of the thread discussing the restarting violence in northern ireland that worried me . 
   that 's nothing like the us senate , there 's no population requirement , 1 state 2 senators . 
  the eu 's lower house ( the european parliament ) is population-based like the us house of representatives ( though weighted against large countries somewhat ) . 
  the eu 's upper house ( the council of the eu ) is more-comparable to the us senate , and is not population-based . 
  edit : oh , you 're right , there is some other breakdown , sorry . 
  additionally , the extensive use of veto-based decisionmaking instead of majority votes further reduces the power of people in large eu members relative to those in small members . 
  realistically , if there 's one country that should be screaming bloody murder about being highly-disadvantaged by the legislative system in the eu , it 's germany . 
  eh , disputed and depends upon criteria .

   ... hiv/aids is an american-engineered weapon of biological warfare , either tested out in africa and subsequently unable to be contained by the hapless americans ; or employed there to wreak havok in the first place in order to keep the wise , noble , savage negroes of `` all of africa '' from siding with their socialist liberators against western imperialist oppression/capitalist slavery .

  buying into a conspiracy theory is one thing . 
  [ buying into it after it has been explicitly disavowed as a bogus disinformation campaign by the people that created it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_infektion ) is ridiculous . 
  i do n't know german , but the fourth-hottest post there is a gif animation of a bunch of nazis from world war ii that says something about afd . 
  i do n't see any way that germany has any form of greater official power than other states in the eu . 
  in fact , i ran the numbers a while back , and in the [ european parliament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament ) , on a per-capita basis , germany ( and other large countries ) are disproportionately under-represented on a per-capita basis . 
  in the [ council of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union ) , where representation is on a per-country basis , they 're obviously far under-represented on a per-capita basis , kinda like california or texas in the us .
