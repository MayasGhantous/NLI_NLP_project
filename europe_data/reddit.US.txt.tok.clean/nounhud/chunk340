  i think that the point is that russia complaining about it requires russia to set a very different bar for nato than for russia . 
  trade between economies that are significantly-different normally provides * more * benefits to both parties than those that are not . 
  if you had two absolutely-identical countries and opened trade , there 'd be no [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) to leverage , and it is exactly that difference that * makes * trade beneficial . 
  if you had two that are radically-different , then trade happens where the things that one economy is relatively-good at are exchanged for the things that the other is relatively-good at . 
  edit : if you 're talking about `` different economies '' because you 're thinking of the discussions on here about how different economies in the * eurozone * have had issues -- where the phrase has come up a lot -- that 's a completely-different matter -- that 's because the two countries did n't have currencies that could float relative to each other , which is n't a factor for the us and mexico . 
  yes ... 
  i 'm fine with it as long as it has no authority to censor . 
  hell , i 'd be fine with it in the us . 
  otherwise , it 's just one more source of information -- it needs to earn respect on its own merits . 
  i 'm pretty sure that confucious was radically more-significant than sun tau . 
  ever seen [ chick tracts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chick_tract ) ? 
  what are they worried that said jewish neighbor would do to them ? 
  yes , we both think that the proposal does n't even make sense in terms of serving the goals of the people who this is presumably being marketed to . 
   most disturbingly , it is an area of high seismic activity how ? 
  the closest plate boundary is on the other side of turkey . 
   that is the point here . 
  blue collar workers see that highly skilled immigrants are paid in a month what they make in a year and want them out . 
  that makes no economic sense even if your goal is to subsidize blue-collar domestic labor . 
  if you block foreign high-wage labor you are hurting buying power of low-wage domestic labor and making the latter poorer . 
  i originally thought that this had to be a misquote , but ... 
  is your argument predicated on he idea that international law should be thrown out ? 
  i think that that 's a non-starter . 
  besides , even if we chose to do si , say `` the only thing that matters is brute force and ability to impose will '' , that would n't end favorably for russia given the relative economic clout on each side . 
  no , it 's because the phrase `` the ukraine '' indicates that the region is n't a country . 
  it 's not because the article itself is objectionable , but rather what it means in this context . 
  so to be consistent with that opinion , you condemn russia 's involvement in chechnya , right ? 
   but this is never going to happen because the usa never go to war agains ' t anyone who could actually kick their ass . 
  hmm . 
  the american revolutionary war and rhe american civil war had pretty significant opponents . 
  who were you complaining that we should have had a war with that we did n't ? 
  i 'm amazed to find someone who would say that they 'd support protectionism . 
  that means that you 're saying `` i want to have industries that are doing a bad job and will not be globally-competitive supported by weakening those that are , even though i know that it makes my country worse-off '' . 
  a thousand cuts from poorly-performing industries dragging down the successful ones is what really hurts a country . 
  must be interesting to live in a country with an election campaign cycle that lasts less than a year . 
   libertarian and evangelical vote completely collapsed , and trump is neither . 
  what are you taking about ? 
  this general election went phenomenally well for the libertarian party , record-setting vote totals , no-fee ballot access in tons of states now . 
  i saw an immediate post-election interview on reason.com with the lp party head , and he was deliriously happy . 
  said something like `` your tears are delicious '' to the republican and democratic parties . 
   not to mention his ip laws absolutely fucked us in the software market right as it was a budding industry . 
  if you think that the us is n't doing well on software , who do you think is doing well ? 
  he shifted the state welfare system to the federal one , in effect . 
  ahhh . 
  okay , thanks . 
  `` air ducts '' evoked [ this ] ( http://air-duct-cleaning.regionaldirectory.us/air-ducts-720.jpg ) kind of thing for me . 
  thanks . 
   and people using often antiquated stoves to burn wood and trash . 
  hmm . 
  is this to try to avoid cost associated with paying for garbage pickup service or to try to avoid the cost of fuel ? 
   since it locked out the air ducts in the city could you expand on this ? 
  i do n't know what it would mean to lock out air ducts , and a quick google did n't turn up anything obvious . 
  as far as i can tell from a quick google , this does n't have a single dominant cause , yes ? 
  i see traffic , coal-heavy industry ( i assume without regulations requiring something to remove particles from emissions ) , and simply geographic location to pick up from pollution from emitters in other countries . 
  i think that the first shot would benefit from being shot with a narrower field-of-vision , a zoom lens , to eliminate the green stems from the red . 
  that 's what she 's doing now . 
  the point is that banks conduct their own risk assessment to choose the rate and choose what to do in the event of a default , so they can effectively `` give '' money if they can set up loans . 
  man ... i want to hook a web spider up to something that trawls the internet and does a [ photomosaic-style ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/photographic_mosaic ) image-similarity algorithm to find these automatically . 
  i feel like [ * cataclysm : dda * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cataclysm:_dark_days_ahead ) modders need to pull from this website . 
  well , to be fair , iirc the uk * did * offer a pre-a50-guarantee of continued residency contingent on the eu offering a corresponding pre-a50-guarantee of continued residency . 
  i do n't know what-all that entails , since for corner cases it 's probably a lot more complicated than * just * `` everyone in one place or the other can stay where they are '' . 
  clearly it violated the `` no negotiation in advance of a50 '' position . 
  but they are n't without a basis to complain about either , as the uk did put something on the table and the eu doing the same in return would n't have been crazy -- it would have basically eliminated a lot of uncertainty for a lot of people who would be most directly impacted on each side . 
  elderly voters abroad ( `` retire to spain ! '' ), 
  will , if they 're living on a pension bound to the gbp and one expects single market membership to have significant impact on the value of the gbp . 
  [ i do n't think that hitler was very enthusiastic about swiss gun culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_guisan#defence_of_the_nation ) . 
   maybe neo nazi is too extreme but i also noticed that you have been spreading those far right wing idea about guns in switzerland . 
  is there anything specifically that would make him `` far right '' aside from him being pro-gun ? 
   transporting a gun in your hands is the very definition of carrying . 
  this is how guns are `` transported '' in new jersey ... 
  i do n't know swiss law , but i could imagine that it might differ from new jersey law . 
  i dunno if being in favor of the right to bear arms is particularly nazi . 
  [ the nazi party made use of gun control to eliminate potential rivals as threats ] ( http://www.nationalreview.com/article/365103/how-nazis-used-gun-control-stephen-p-halbrook ) :  in 1933 , the ultimate extremist group , led by adolf hitler , seized power and used the records to identify , disarm , and attack political opponents and jews . 
  constitutional rights were suspended , and mass searches for and seizures of guns and dissident publications ensued . 
  police revoked gun licenses of social democrats and others who were not `` politically reliable . ''   during the five years of repression that followed , society was `` cleansed '' by the national socialist regime . 
  undesirables were placed in camps where labor made them `` free , '' and normal rights of citizenship were taken from jews . 
  the gestapo banned independent gun clubs and arrested their leaders . 
  gestapo counsel werner best issued a directive to the police forbidding issuance of firearm permits to jews . 
    in 1938 , hitler signed a new gun control act . 
  now that many `` enemies of the state '' had been removed from society , some restrictions could be slightly liberalized , especially for nazi party members . 
  but jews were prohibited from working in the firearms industry , and .22 caliber hollow-point ammunition was banned . 
   second even among us open/concealed carry people a semi-automatic rifle is not considered a suitable arm for this purpose . 
  well , when they 're politically-protesting they do .

  yeah . 
  i was more chuckling at the different reaction to america getting whacked and the netherlands . 
  so now you 're spamming the thread ? 
  the hell , dude ? 
       it 's like america , but not shit . 
          lol @ a fucking dutch looking down on anyone else 's country . 
        what 's your angle ? 
      lol go through his history . 
  he just has a hate boner for the dutch . 
    lol in a country of 17 million he claims that all of them are xenophobes . 
  clearly the idea of someone painting an entire country of 17 million with a broad brush is patently absurd , yes . 
   well yeah , there is n't anything to look up to , besides scandinavians maybe .

  also , everyone in the picture is really skinny . 
   carrying uncased assault rifles in public , and especially on public transport , is not `` us gun culture '' .
