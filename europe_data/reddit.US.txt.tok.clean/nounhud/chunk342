  i simply can not viably do that for the entire population , not to an expert level on everything . 
  as best i can tell , the brexit discussion mostly did n't even make it past `` which statements ( 350m gbp/week for the nhs ) are even remotely credible ? '', 
  in a jury trial , you can afford a lot more time to explain relevant factors . 
  it may take months of full-time examination , but you can get there . 
  you can not shut down a whole country while it does nothing but full-time come up to speed on the implications . 
  you can do that with a small number of elected representatives . 
  at least that way , people have electoral input themselves , and you can still have the people making the call be familiarized with the issues . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe have fun . 
  not a fan of the faroe islands ? 
  eh , usenet still wins for inducing flamewars . 
  getting contracting work done quickly and quietly ? 
  there 's `` being butthurt '' , which is kinda vulgar and means that you 're ( perhaps unreasonably ) upset about something . 
  is the meaning similar ? 
   but the key to having good quisnine is partially knowing when something fits & when it does n't . 
  why oh why do you guys put it on so much stuff . 
  you can gloss over most issues by increasing quantity and adding bacon . 
  than catholicism ? 
  errr ... no ? 
  maybe labour is feigning incompetence to make it impossible for any of this to be blamed on them . 
  ... maybe trump is just feigning incompetence for the hell of it ... 
  * europe in the us : the uk , everything in the continent . 
  * europe in the uk : `` european '' means `` continentals '' . 
  * europe to some eu federalists : eu members . 
  ( thus , i assume that the uk is european but might stop . 
  switzerland is not european . ), 
  * ( i assume that the swiss view themselves as european , but i do n't really know ) * russia : of course russia is european . 
  * turkey : we 're also european . 
  are we removing news about ceuta and french guiana now ? 
  easy to forget , but even during world war ii , children were being born and playing . 
   southern ireland < puts popcorn in microwave , 
  i think that it 'd tend to disrupt the eu 's functioning if countries were vetoing things that they did n't actually object to . 
  well , fair enough , but it 's not as if the border changes here are related to that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkswagen_emissions_scandal  the volkswagen emissions scandal ( also known as `` emissionsgate '' or `` dieselgate '' ) ... too late , apparently . 
  future ethnologists must have fun trying to figure stuff like this out . 
  this deserves comics on / r/polandball . 
   in the night , police believe , several perpetrators worked to layer the bricks and mortar as quickly and as quietly as possible . 
  why the hell is n't it possible to * hire * people to do this ? 
  and canadians have their own gun culture !, 
  and finns !, 
  though why someone would want to pass up a chance at american gun culture ... < shakes head sadly , 
   that means they have no source of income therefore they ca n't create new households , thus they are incapable of reproducing and will commit demographic suicide in around 30-40 years if trend continues . 
  i thought that you guys had welfare systems . 
  hell , our poor have significantly more kids than our wealthy . 
  or for another example : i was just looking up some numbers on the amish . 
  farming amish average a bit over $ 18k in annual income , and 8.2 children . 
  they accept no government assistance . 
  by us standards , the poverty line for that many kids is something like $ 40k or $ 50k . 
  they 're still managing to raise the next generation . 
  yeah , can anyone explain to me how this would make any sense ? 
  if there is any country in the eurozone that should be on the same currency as germany , would n't france be near the top of that list ? 
  the issue with the euro is widely-disparate economies ... 
  fair enough . 
  oh , the english was just fine . 
  i was just chuckling at the idea of legions of / r/europe readers sagely nodding and saying `` ah , yes , now * there 's * an experience that i can relate to ! '', 
  the eu has n't [ forcibly-relocated people from border countries to try to lock countries into the empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) the way the ussr did . 
  i do n't think that the two are very comparable here . 
  are n't you supposed to carry your passport when crossing into other countries , even if schengen members do n't check it ? 
  i 'm a little suspicious that this might have more to do with illegal immigration than terrorism , and is just using terrorism as as a legal/political basis . 
  we did a lot of things after 9/11 , both good and bad , using terrorism as a domestic political justification . 
  apple computer has vanished !, 
  us gdp has dropped !, 
  pole poll : would n't touch refugees with a ten-foot pole, 
   taking all these refugees in germany and europe in general , is like putting a hedgehog in your pants . 
  / r/europe : an endless source of similes to help you understand things in terms of more familiar experiences . 
   removing suffrage would totally restore birthrates you 're referring to going back to a monarchy ? 
   intervening in foreign countries is always a bad idea . 
  unless some crazy man is planing on nuking a country , i ca n't see a single reason to support interventions . 
  < cough  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_dragoon * always * ? 
   most valuable colony ever , the usa . 
  the models were n't of the popular vote , though ... they were simulating the electoral college . 
   yep the above grammatically correct . 
  it 's not quite muphry 's law , but irony loves grammatical discussions . 
  ... eliminating voting would restore birthrates ? 
  what , like move back to a monarchy ? 
  ahhh ... good point . 
  they should control for that ... got ta be high-resolution census data from then . 
  iirc , in the worst-hit places in europe , like italy , plague killed about 30 % of the population . 
  the point is to give perspective of the author . 
  in that the author is n't omniscient , they are n't `` shifty '' -- they 're doing what they 're supposed to . 
  i think that this has more to do with language use than identity . 
  to an american , the brits are european ( in the europe-the-continent sense ... the eu sense of the word does n't exist over here ) . 
  to a brit , european happens to be shorthand for `` from the mainland '' . 
  it 's like you guys calling us yanks , when people from the southern us may think of someone from the northeast when that term is used . 
  i do n't . 
  but at least part of the difference is due to the subsidy . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_crisis_of_1961  a soviet tank moved about 5 metres backwards first ; then an american tank followed suit . 
  one by one the tanks withdrew . 
  if we could figure this out , i 'm pretty sure that you guys can manage to agree on a way to avoid losing face on something that you both agree makes sense for both sides . 
  should be `` single word translation '' , yeah . 
   `` we see ukrainian-ness as rabies , '' he said . 
  `` a person is sick . 
  either quarantine , liquidation , or he 'll infect everyone . '' god damn , dude . 
  on the continent , trains receive a higher level of subsidy . 
  money 's money , whether in the form of a ticket or a tax subsidy . 
  leaking information about opponents works best in two-party systems . 
  pew found that the people who voted trump were actually better-off than those that voted clinton . 
  more concerned about competition for jobs from china , though . 
  those scots sure are a contentious people . 
   right and if you are a self sustaining part o society i do n't see an issue with that .
