  well , that 's really just normal old immigration , then . 
  nothing * wrong * with wanting immigration . 
  but it seems to me that that 's different from the problem of dealing with refugee crises . 
  it does seem to me that it is in the interest of germany or another country to use the traditional immigration route to obtain immigration , however , rather than the refugee route , if what it wants is immigration . 
  that 'd let it tune things like skillset , filter based on criminal record , etc. 
  i do n't know what the political barriers in germany are like to increasing immigration levels -- assuming that germany does have annual caps on permitted immigration -- but the only real argument i could see for pulling in people via the asylum mechanism rather than traditional immigration would be if the leadership saw immigration as advantageous to germany but the political barriers to letting more people come in through traditional immigration as too high . 
   i have no problem with people who are actually refugees seeking temporary asylum the point is that if you get temporary asylum and thus legal temporary residence , you 'd be a fool not to extend it into permanent residence and citizenship if possible . 
  the rewards to you are simply too great . 
  some french guy on here was telling me that there was zero chance than the french people would vote for a young president . 
  oh , i 'm not criticizing your point , just amused by the parallel to the courtroom . 
  < buries face in hands  i swear to god , i hate the idea of government-funded healthcare , but i 'm starting to seriously wish that the us provided universal free testing for [ paranoid schizophrenia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paranoid_schizophrenia ) and provided antipsychotics :  one criterion for separating paranoid schizophrenia from other types is delusion . 
  a delusion is a belief that is held strong even when the evidence shows otherwise . 
  some common delusions associated with paranoid schizophrenia include , `` believing that the government is monitoring every move you make , or that a co-worker is poisoning your lunch . 
  '' [ 4 ] in all but rare cases , these beliefs are irrational , and can cause the person holding them to behave abnormally . 
  hey , you can go read alex jones ' conspiracy websites , and i 'll read wikipedia . 
  apparently that 's the badge of not belonging to either of these groups :  before the early 1990s , new world order conspiracism was limited to two american countercultures , primarily the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the antichrist . 
   independently of the kurdish issue , turkey 's leading elite around erdogan seem to be dreaming about a greater turkey in the footsteps of the ottoman empire . 
  can you please provide a link to these claims ? 
  sounds like the difference between a us courtroom and a european courtroom , using the media as judge and hillary as the lawyer for the other side . 
   i also like that he is n't a gun nut he originally had all of about six points on the issues page on his campaign website , one of which was `` i support the second amendment '' or something along those lines . 
  true , that 's a fairly generic republican point , but ... hell , that 's one of the few things that he * did n't * say something that i found egregious on . 
  he was spitting out pretty bog-standard republican statements on gun rights . 
  certainly he 'd be more pro-gun than hillary . 
   what about the percents that trump lost because every corporate news media demonized him beyond recognition ? 
  can you clarify : * what your objection is to incorporation ? 
  * why you feel that criticism of trump -- which was certainly widespread -- was unwarranted ? 
  after all , there is no reason for news media * not * to criticize a candidate . 
  * why you feel that pro-trump media like breitbart is not incorporated ? 
   the iranians are already getting advanced russian missile defense systems at least one of them ( ca n't recall which ) was supporting explicitly regime change without a full-on invasion . 
  that being said , even if there were a full-on military conflict -- which i doubt -- it would n't matter . 
  iraq had `` advanced russian missile defense systems '' in 1991 ( a time when said defenses enjoyed rather more resources ) and there were claims of horrendous casualties for anyone attacking via air . 
  http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/air-defence-equipment.htm  by the summer of 1990 , iraq possessed 16,000 radar-guided and heatseeking surface-to-air missiles ( sams ) , including the soviet sa-2 , sa-3 , sa-6 , sa-7 , sa-8 , sa-9 , sa-13 , sa-14 , and sa-16 , and the franco-german roland . 
  additional air defense was provided by air force interceptors and organic army assets , including the sa-7 / 14 , sa-8 , sa-9 / 13 , sa-16 missile systems , and the zsu-23 / 4 self-propelled aaa system . 
  in addition , the iraqi air defense had more than 7,500 aaa pieces protecting all targets of value , some deployed on the roofs of numerous buildings in baghdad housing government facilities . 
  these weapons -- 57-mm and 37-mm aaa pieces , zsu-23 / 4 and zsu-57 / 2 self-propelled aaa systems , and hundreds of 14.5-mm and 23-mm light antiaircraft weapons -- formed the backbone of the integrated air defense network . 
  in major high value target areas ( such as baghdad , airfields , chemical agent production complexes , and nuclear facilities ) the combined arms air defense could prove lethal to aircraft operating below 10,000 feet . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_war the air defenses were simply obliterated in short order by us cruise missiles and stealth aircraft , and it was inevitably game over once those fell apart . 
  we had a total of 147 soldiers killed by the other side in the war , compared to tens of thousands on the other side , with over half a million surrendering . 
   nobody knows what his territorial ambitions in syria and iraq will lead to . 
  erdogan does n't want an independent kurdistan in either emerging , as it would cause major problems moving forward for turkey . 
  < shrug  that 's not a new position for turkey . 
   that does n't say anything about pakistan no , but your statement was n't limited to pakistan . 
   israel does n't even confirm the existence of nuclear weapons , thus speculation about how it go them , if it did , is without substance . 
  israel broke a political promise to the us on nukes . 
  their fig leaf was a re-interpretation that they merely promised that they would not be the first country to * announce * nuclear weapon possession . 
  there 's [ plenty of material out there on israel 's weapon effort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mordechai_vanunu ) . 
   i.e , khan built the pakistani bomb on the basis of us technology . 
  him stealing nuclear data does n't conflict with my comment that the french were not scrupulous about nonproliferation . 
  hello , 15-hour-old account . 
   people forget how wrong the propaganda about the ussr was . 
  specifically what are you talking about ? 
  you 're talking to a guy with '' [ nwo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_world_order_%28conspiracy_theory%29 ) '' in his * username * . 
  you 're probably wasting your time . 
  i have n't seen people doing that . 
  i have seen people objecting to said russian influence , however . 
  not a one-or-the-other situation . 
   do you ever stop to think that maybe there are other problems here and it is n't just an evil russian boogeyman ? 
  i think that there are absolutely other issues . 
  i also do n't think that the presence of those issues means that there is no agenda . 
  you do n't start pushing political positions that start with zero support . 
  when [ russia was hosting that eu and us separatist conference ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/us-and-eu-separatist-groups-to-gather-on-moscows-dime/ ) a few months back , it was n't * fabricating * those movements , just encouraging them . 
   from my work in the aerospace field in the 90s i know for a fact that the french were very scrupulous about not violating the missile control regime . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_israel  israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons [ 9 ] [ 10 ] and to be the sixth country in the world to have developed them , allegedly having built its first nuclear weapon in december 1966 with the help of france . 
  [ 11 ] [ 12 ] mmmhmm . 
   with the uk gone i think the eu 's potential will finally be unleashed . 
  i think that this is about as reasonable as the leave supporters over on / r/ukpolitics who say the same thing in reverse . 
  i 'd think that jurisdictional issues would make this kind of low-impact , since i 'd assume that it would only count if the actor is doing this in ireland . 
  [ flynn has it in for iran ] ( https://lobelog.com/lt-gen-michael-flynn-ret-has-it-in-for-iran/ ) ( flynn is trump 's national security advisor )  * `` as the washington post editorialists have said , regime change in tehran is the best way to stop the iranian nuclear weapons program . 
  the same applies to their missile arsenal , which is of high quality and growing . '' [ meet jim `` mad dog '' mattis , trump 's iran hawk choice for secretary of defense ] ( http://www.vox.com/world/2016/12/1/13718282/pentagon-jim-mad-dog-mattis-trump-iran-hawk-russia-secretary-of-defense-general ) ( mattis is trump 's secretary of defense )  a well-known figure among current and retired military officers , mattis has spent years warning publicly and privately about the threat posed by iran , and that may be the most important thing to understand about the incoming defense secretary . 
  donald trump spent his campaign talking tough about tehran and blasting the nuclear deal , but he 's offered few specifics about what he would actually do in office . 
    that means mattis -- a hawk who describes tehran as `` the single most enduring threat to stability and peace '' in the middle east -- will be instrumental in shaping the new administration 's iran policy . 
  he 'll also help determine whether trump chooses to one day use force against tehran . 
  [ snip ]  iran , he said , `` remains the single most belligerent actor in the middle east , '' and one whose `` consistent behavior from the 1979 through today shows no signs of changing . '' [ snip ]  things reached a breaking point in early 2013 when obama abruptly removed mattis from his post . 
  according to the well-sourced military reporter tom ricks , the move came because senior administration officials grew tired of mattis 's insistence that the iranian threat extended well beyond its nuclear program [ trump 's dhs secretary warned about iranian infiltration of south america ] ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/trump-homeland-secretary-warned-iran-infiltrating-southern-border/ ) ( kelly is trump 's secretary of homeland security ) if there 's a country in mena that should be worried about the trump administration , i 'd finger iran . 
  i think that it is extraordinarily-unlikely that the us would become involved in turkey other than * possibly * if turkey wound up with a civil war and requested aid and if the us also agreed ( and then it would be on behalf of the administration ) . 
  my understanding is that much of erdogan 's support was due to turkish economic growth that happened while he was in power . 
  if turkey sees an economic downturn under him , might that cut into his support ? 
  i think that a number of people oppose merkel , and so will attribute anything bad possible to her , whether it 's an accurate and honest assessment or not . 
  was it not ? 
  i mean , you made the initial assertion . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_party_presidential_primaries,_2016 trump got 44.95 % of the popular vote and 69.8 % of the delegates . 
  realistically , even if all but one other candidate dropped out , they would have had to pick up almost all the other votes from the other candidates to win . 
  he was the only one running on a nativist platform . 
  turns out that that 's what nearly half of the republican party primary voters were looking for :  trump maintained wide poll leads throughout 2015 and into 2016 , primarily due to his brash and unapologetic style of speaking and campaigning , emphasizing a disregard for political correctness , as well as populist and nativist policies , earning him the support of working-class voters and voters without a college education , among other demographics . 
  neither / s nor a nutcase . 
   a civilian object the [ geneva convention definition of a legitimate military target ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legitimate_military_target ) post-dates vietnam and was never ratified by the us anyway , but i expect that the plant in question would have qualified under it . 
   protocol i to the geneva conventions , article 52 , provides for the general protection of civilian objects , hindering attacks to military objectives . 
  article 52 states , `` in so far as objects are concerned , military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature , location , purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction , capture or neutralization , in the circumstances ruling at the time , offers a definite military advantage . '', 
  [ snip ]  * legitimate energy targets include installations providing energy mainly for national defense , such as coal and other fuels , and plants producing gas or electricity mainly for military consumption . 
   seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine , `` if belarus/kazakhstan/ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used '' . 
  we did . 
  [ russia vetoed it . 
  ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/world/europe/russia-vetoes-un-resolution-on-crimea.html ) arguably , this is n't surprising . 
  however , there were actual responses . 
  the one that won out was economic pressure , not a military approach . 
  i think that there are some good reasons for this , not the least of which being that i think that the eu would , now and in the future , prefer to exert economic pressure rather than military pressure in europe . 
  remember that a military option would have potentially produced a syria-like situation , but in ukraine , and probably at much larger scale . 
  it might , assuming a conventional conflict that did not escalate ( not at all certain ) , have resolved things relatively quickly . 
  but a hot conflict nato on ukrainian territory it also would have killed people and generally screwed up ukraine more than is the case , further delaying ukraine from getting back to a sane economic situation . 
   trump did n't win because of trump , he won because he ran as a republican and there is a reason for the saying `` democrats fall in love , republicans fall in line '' .
