  he won votes in the general election in significant part because he was a republican , sure , but he still won the primary election first , where no such phenomenon existed .

  google translate :  ** new year : cars burned and 454 arrests **   according to bruno le roux , the eve of the year was marked by incidents , notably in strasbourg . 
    while the services feared a terrorist , the new year 's eve `` went particularly well '' , without `` major problem '' , said sunday morning bruno le roux . 
  however , 454 people were arrested throughout france , including attacks on law enforcement and 301 in custody . 
  `` what i regret once again , is that there are too many attacks or insults or throws of various projectiles on the security forces , '' insisted the minister of the interior , citing the case of a firefighter `` slightly injured '' on the arm in oyonnax ( ain ) and two crs bruised by stone throws in nice . 
    `` i ask of course the greatest firmness , '' said bruno le roux . 
  warning that `` no act '' against `` those who are there to protect us will not be tolerated '' , he wished to `` congratulate and thank above all the 100,000 security forces that were mobilized '' , `` the 40,000 firefighters on the territory and the `` mobilized forces on civil security '' . 
  according to him , this positive balance is the consequence of `` security devices '' which `` had been dimensioned in view of the threat '' , in particular terrorist . 
    ** the calamity of firecrackers **   scattered incidents have been reported in bouches-du-rh\u00f4ne , is\u00e8re and loire-atlantique . 
  the phenomenon of cars burned was observed almost everywhere in the hexagon : some 25 vehicles were found charred in the yvelines , a dozen others in total having burned in brest , rennes and vannes . 
  there were 650 vehicle fires , where they were 602 last year . 
  over the past five years , the number of vehicles burned has decreased by 20 % . 
    with at least ten people wounded in the night from saturday to sunday , including a three-year-old , strasbourg is once again confronted with the calamity of firecrackers during the new year . 
  for several weeks , the authorities had set up a awareness campaign against firecrackers in colleges . 
  after christmas , they passed the top speed . 
  as part of the state of emergency on the bridges to germany , filter dams have enabled the police , as well as customs and paf officers , to seize more than one tonne of pyrotechnic material - of which large calibres - whose importation is prohibited in france . 
  on saturday evening again , the prefect st\u00e9phane fratacci and the mayor of strasbourg , roland ries , who went to the emergency rooms of the university hospitals , recalled the dangers presented by the firecrackers . 
  a tradition in alsace , as in germany , which has a hard life . 
  the message , widely relayed by the media , did not prevent a resurgence of serious injuries because of firecrackers last night . 
    the wounded were operated on by hand , including six in the sos hands service of the university hospitals , based in illkirch-graffenstaden . 
  three had to be amputated with a finger part , including the three-year-old child . 
  for its part , the service sos hands of the clinic of the diaconesses has operated to him four people in the night . 
  last year , only three people had to be treated , whereas there were two deaths in 2013 and one death in 2014 , each time with serious injuries . 
    ** faces in the city center **   however , around midnight , the gathering in downtown strasbourg took place in a seemingly good atmosphere , bringing together several thousand people and many families . 
  an anti-intrusion device blocked all four accesses to the kl\u00e9ber square , which is in the pedestrian zone . 
  about 80 municipal policemen were in support of the police , enabling the deployment of the 600 national police officers in the more sensitive districts of strasbourg , and in haguenau and s\u00e9lestat . 
  besides the soldiers of operation sentinel , the device included 500 gendarmes distributed between the strasbourg agglomeration and the rest of the department . 
  and the video-protection images deployed by the city are shared with the national police . 
    however , this important device did not prevent some overflows . 
  bridges leading to the hyper-center , but also the crossroads on the outer boulevards were `` held '' by youngsters who were playing with firecrackers and rockets , sometimes shooting at other groups . 
  some had settled in the middle of streets , including in residential areas ... a brawl in the city center , between two bands , degenerated , with a serious wounded and several arrests . 
  while the phenomenon of burnt cars has largely diminished , there has been violence in some suburbs , with arrests . 
   everyone with half a brain knows the eu is in the deepest shit . 
  there are multiple ways to interpret this sentence . 
  yoda-speak is [ object-subject-verb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object%e2%80%93subject%e2%80%93verb ) order . 
  this is [ object-verb-subject ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object%e2%80%93verb%e2%80%93subject ) . 
  well , that 's what i got from it . 
  your two comments with the interposing one from / u/jeanrenomarryme :    come on , do n't you start with the `` russians got trump elected ''     i think russian involvement is very likely . 
  without all the email staff another result would be possible . 
    i know it warms many a nationalist 's heart to think `` we put our puppet in the white house '' , but i do n't subscribe to this point of view . 
  reputable , time-required-to-sink-into-them accounts are n't cheap in terms of human time , which makes for a pretty damn good captcha . 
  i 've seriously-considered the possibility of leveraging , say , * world of warcraft * playtime or other things that people do for fun to manufacture expensive identifiers that can be used to bootstrap reputation elsewhere . 
  so , instead of having a blank reddit account that has posting restrictions until you build enough content for the system to not restrict your posting rate , you have a reddit account linked to some hash that blizzard has cryptographically-signed-off on having been associated with an account `` used to play at least 80 man-hours of * world of warcraft * '' . 
  ca n't manufacture those without putting in some effort , but if you use many sources like that to help bootstrap reputation elsewhere , it 'd help reduce the burden of having to re-create reputation every place you go . 
  add a bunch of common sources -- facebook , world of warcraft , twitter , whatever -- and you can avoid the issue where you start with no trust for new accounts . 
  the other ways to address the same problem , like using openid , or similar systems to identity provider services , is that they 're not pseudanonymous -- the service that i want to use knows that i 'm foo@blah.com . 
  i just want them to reliably vouch for the fact that i 've sunk n man-hours into something . 
  yes . 
  i would rather that , say , mccain be drawing the lines of decorum and national interest . 
  well ... okay , yes . 
  that is certainly what 's objectionable . 
  but the point is , / u/aguywitharaygun was equating the two points i mentioned . 
  well , 12-hour-old throwaway account , if russia pulls out of crimea i expect that we can start mending relations and pulling down sanctions . 
   yea , i mean honestly i 've just lost all faith that anything from `` government '' in the us is accurate or honest . 
  is that so , nine-hour-old throwaway account ? 
  you mean / r/russia ? 
  i 'd be very surprised . 
  it 's very low-traffic . 
  if you 're going to pay someone , you 're going to aim for high-volume outlets to get the most bang for your buck . 
  posting something on / r/russia would be like advertising in the back of a very , very low-volume niche magazine . 
  it 's not worth the time to write the ad copy . 
  folks like vigorous and lucky13r do n't fit the profile that the eu turned up for paid commenters , either -- they 'll engage in discussions and so forth , and do n't just copy-paste talking points . 
  point is , there are people who do n't like the west and do like russia-as-putin-does it , or at least are willing to settle for putin 's - russia-as-the-best-available-option-for-the-moment . 
  that 's just how it is . 
  if you were on a russian-language forum , you 'd probably find more of them . 
  if any country in the world got in a spat with another country , you 'd expect to find people on both sides of the issue out there . 
  paid commenters on the internet are real , but they are n't the bulk of supportive comments out there . 
  people feel pride for their country , to varying degrees . 
  you are n't going to have people simply slagging on russia for their whole life , even if they do n't agree with everything that putin does . 
  no , i think that it 's pretty safe to say that his statements have been way out-of-line from what any other republican candidate would have said . 
  source ? 
  google news turns up nothing .

  that youthful thirst for knowledge just brings a tear to your eye , does n't it ? 
  i dunno how wealthy a typical diplomat is . 
  i mean , better than the average , i imagine , but i do n't think that i 'd call them insanely-wealthy . 
  if they 're political appointees and were major donors , they potentially are quite wealthy ( but then i expect that private tutoring starts to become an option ) . 
  the average starting salary for a [ 2013 grad with a bachelor 's degree in the us , completely-ignoring field , is about $ 45k/year ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/04/15/college-degrees-with-the-highest-starting-salaries-3/#34578d6f7f0b ) . 
  it looks like comparable foreign service guys [ make about $ 48k-56k ] ( http://www.pathtoforeignservice.com/foreign-service-officer-salary-a-comprehensive-guide/ ) , with some cost-of-living adjustment , so while some of the positions could make a fair amount more , and it 's not a badly-paid position , they 're not obscenely-wealthy either compared to whatever they 'd be doing outside of the foreign service . 
  more to the point -- the critical difference between `` islamic extremists object to charlie hebdo '' and `` russian defense ministry spokesman slags on charlie hebdo '' is that the latter is n't working to kill off cartoonists or prohibit charlie hebdo content ( well , in france at any rate . 
  no idea what it 's like in russia ) . 
  frankly , if ch ran something after a bunch of us military figures died in an accident , while i think that probably the department of defense would simply stay out of it , if they * were * going to be a statement , it 'd probably be not all * that * far off this one . 
  ditto for most other governments . 
  i mean , what are you going to say ? 
  i appreciate being pissed off at russian foreign policy , but taking it out on every person in the news in russia does n't accomplish anything . 
  the russian army choir did n't make the decision to become involved in crimea . 
  trump is not a puppet , i agree . 
  that 's hyperbole . 
  the question of whether russia 's involvement was sufficient to flip the election is another question , and not the same matter . 
   well , imagine the implication if they are n't involved he implicated them . 
  i 'm not objecting to him not committing . 
  that 's fair . 
  i 'm objecting to him strongly implying to supporters that russia was not involved ( see / r/the _ donald for an example of this gone bonkers ) or encouraging it ( e.g. 
  the [ quote encouraging looking for hillary 's emails ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html?_r=0 ) ) . 
  i disagree on your assessment of assange . 
  certainly i think that there 's an expectation that unless trump is going to raise very severe allegations about the fbi and cia that he not discount statements that those agencies have made -- he is , after all , interviewing for the job of running them . 
  ah fair , enough -- i guess what i should raise as concern is his denial that russia was involved .
