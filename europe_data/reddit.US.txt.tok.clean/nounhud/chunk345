  that is , he said `` if russia * were * involved , then i would object '' . 
  my concern is that you ca n't permit a precedent where a state illegally involves itself in the election and then gets a pass from whoever benefits from that involvement . 
  at what point did he condemn russian actions ? 
   this hack thing is just partisan nonsense . 
  trump is assuming office in a few weeks . 
  which is why paul ryan just stated that this is necessary and long overdue ? 
  he 's no democrat . 
  come on . 
  trump should have just said `` i had nothing to do with this , and i condemn it , and i won on my merits '' from the beginning . 
  the `` russia did n't do anything '' thing was just embarrassing . 
  trump fucked up -- he should have talked to the intelligence guys and had his pr team put together something better . 
  end of story . 
  hopefully he does a better job the next time some scandal or sensitive political issue comes up . 
   i know this is farfetched , but obama could end the year issuing an international arrest warrant for putin . 
  would n't be a good idea . 
  even if you had the kind of legal certitude required , one does n't start issuing arrest warrants for sitting heads of state , diplomatic immunity that they 'd have abroad aside . 
  hell , spies are , by definition , breaking the law . 
  you start going after heads of state because they have spies ... well , that just is n't the way the world works . 
  while i do n't think that putin 's actions in crimea or in the 2016 us election will be likely to be to russia 's benefit , i * do * believe that his administration did took them with the honest belief that they would benefit russia . 
  putin 's leading russia , and acting for it . 
  putin 's not a rogue member of the government ; he 's leading russia . 
  you pressure russia in response , not arrest putin .

  if the risk factor became high enough -- i personally think that the attack frequency would need to be much higher -- could have some legal mechanism for mandating [ ankle monitors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ankle_monitor ) -- that 's about as cheap as you can go to monitor people . 
  better , not worse . 
  worse would be not having the infrastructure in place to know any of this information . 
  the fact that this data was available means that all that would be necessary would be better analysis and/or more resources to investigate people . 
  did he finish that off by saying that ukraine is n't a real country and that ukrainians are just squatting on the land of other countries ? 
  seriously ? 
  i 'd think that it 'd be about twice to four times that that if there are four brigades . 
  but the general point , that this can not be interpreted as a significant security risk , still holds .

  [ continued from parent ]  yanukovych was removed from power through a revolution and replaced by a new interim government in february 2014 . 
  at an eu summit in brussels on 21 march 2014 , the new ukrainian prime minister , arseniy yatseniuk , and european union leaders herman van rompuy and jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , along with the 28 national political leaders or heads of state on the european council , signed in brussels the political provisions of the aa , [ 10 ] [ 79 ] with the dcfta to be signed after the presidential election in may 2014 . 
  [ 80 ] [ 81 ] the european union and the ( then ) new ukrainian president petro poroshenko signed the economic part of the ukraine -- european union association agreement on 27 june 2014 , [ 2 ] [ 82 ] and described this as ukraine 's `` first but most decisive step '' towards eu membership . 
  [ 13 ] president of the european council , herman van rompuy , said at the signing ceremony : `` in kyiv and elsewhere , people gave their lives for this closer link to the european union . 
  we will not forget this . 
  '' [ 83 ] now , you may not want to trade with ukraine or to have ukraine as a member . 
  but there was majority support in ukraine for this , and there had been long-term interest in the association agreement in the eu . 
  going back to your comment :  however expansion of the eu and thus nato , did seem to be a possibility , polls in ukraine showed majority support for joining the eu in ukraine . 
  polls did not show majority support for joining nato until after russia attacked ukraine . 
  it seems most unlikely that had russia not attacked , that ukraine would have joined nato any time soon -- finland , for example , has not . 
  the eu is a different story , of course . 
  but ... ukraine also is not part of russia . 
  it has the ability to choose to make that arrangement . 
   there is still no trade advantage for the eu , in fact we have a money pit on our hands . 
  but hey so long as we can drop a few missile `` defense '' systems around the country who cares . 
  why would the us want to re-site ballistic missile interceptors in ukraine ? 
  and sure , every poorer member that joins the eu will cost in convergence effort . 
  but obviously , that 's seen as an investment : the same reason that wealthier west germany was willing to rejoin with east germany , and the same reason that the other ex-behind-the-iron-curtain countries received subsidies . 
  look , there 's a very straightforward answer : ukraine 's public did the same calculation that most of the rest of eastern europe has and realized that life dealing with the eu was rather-more-pleasant than life dealing with russia , same as polls stated . 
  nato did n't enjoy any particular benefit in accepting a new member , and even if it did , the prospect that the eu would go through a vast , immensely-costly rigamarole for nato 's benefit seems pretty implausible . 
  * now * ukraine has a great deal of interest in nato membership , but that was after russia attacked it . 
  but obviously nato could n't make that decision . 
   there is still no trade advantage for the eu , in fact we have a money pit on our hands . 
  but hey so long as we can drop a few missile `` defense '' systems around the country who cares . 
  european union and ukraine both saw financial advantage in the association : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement  the ukraine -- european union association agreement is a treaty between the european union ( eu ) , euratom , their 28 member states and ukraine that establishes a political and economic association between the parties ... the agreement comes after more than two decades in which both parties sought to establish closer ties with each other . 
  on the one hand , the european union wants to ensure that its imports of grain and natural gas from ukraine , as well as its exports of goods to ukraine , are not threatened by instability in the region , believing that instability could eventually be reduced through sociopolitical and economic reforms in ukraine . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] ukraine , on the other hand , wants to increase its exports by benefiting from free trade with the european union while attracting desirable external investments , as well as establishing closer ties with a sociopolitical entity to which many ukrainians feel strong cultural connection . 
  and the process had been going on for some time . 
  this was no surprise :  on 22 july 2008 , it was announced that a `` stabilisation and association '' - type agreement would be signed between ukraine and the european union . 
  [ 16 ] ... the signing of an association agreement between ukraine and the european union , although finalised , was postponed on 19 december 2011 ... the eu association agreement ( aa ) was initialed on 30 march 2012 in brussels ... kostiantyn yelisieiev , ukraine 's ambassador to the eu , responded in february 2013 by rejecting any preconditions by the eu for signing the aa . 
  [ 42 ] however , on 22 february 2013 a resolution was approved by 315 of the 349 registered members of the verkhovna rada stating that `` within its powers '' the parliament would ensure that the 10 december 2012 eu foreign affairs council `` recommendations '' are implemented ... in march 2013 , stefan fuele , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , informed the european parliament that while ukrainian authorities had given their `` unequivocal commitment '' to address the issues raised by the eu at this point , russia [ started pushing back ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan#initial_causes ) :  in mid-august 2013 russia changed its customs regulations on imports from ukraine [ 108 ] such that on 14 august 2013 , the russian custom service stopped all goods coming from ukraine [ 109 ] and prompted politicians [ 110 ] and sources [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] to view the move as the start of a trade war against ukraine to prevent ukraine from signing a trade agreement with the european union . 
  polling shows majority support in ukraine for joining the eu at this point . 
   on 21 november 2013 the verkhovna rada failed to pass any of the six motions on allowing the former prime minister yulia tymoshenko to receive medical treatment abroad , which was an eu demand for signing the association agreement . 
  [ 55 ] [ 56 ] the same week tymoshenko had stated that she was ready to ask the eu to drop the demand for her freedom if it meant president viktor yanukovych would sign the association agreement . 
  [ 57 ] the same day a ukrainian government decree suspended preparations for signing of association agreement ; instead it proposed the creation of a three-way trade commission between ukraine , the european union and russia that would resolve trade issues between the sides . 
  [ 55 ] prime minister mykola azarov issued the decree in order to `` ensure the national security of ukraine '' and in consideration of the possible ramifications of trade with russia ( and other cis countries ) [ 58 ] if the agreement was signed on a 28 -- 29 november summit in vilnius . 
  [ 55 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] according to ukrainian deputy prime minister yuriy boyko ukraine will resume preparing the agreement `` when the drop in industrial production and our relations with cis countries are compensated by the european market , otherwise our country 's economy will sustain serious damage '' . 
  [ 58 ] some eu diplomats were more skeptical of the reasons put forward . 
  [ 61 ] later on 21 november 2013 , the russian presidential press secretary , dmitry peskov , called the ukrainian decree `` a strictly internal and sovereign decision of the country , and we think we have no right to comment on it '' and stated that russia was prepared to have tripartite negotiations with ukraine and the eu on trade and economic issues . 
  [ 62 ] the european parliament 's monitoring mission in ukraine stated ( also on 21 november 2013 ) that there was still a possibility to sign the eu-ukraine association agreement . 
  [ 56 ] the same day ukrainian president viktor yanukovych stated `` an alternative for reforms in ukraine and an alternative for european integration do not exist ... we are walking along this path and are not changing direction '' . 
  [ 63 ] [ b ]   in the following days , euromaidan , the biggest protests since the orange revolution , were being held in kiev by opposition parties . 
  [ 65 ] [ 66 ] on 26 november 2013 the ukrainian government admitted that russia had asked it to delay signing the eu association agreement and that it `` wanted better terms for the eu deal '' . 
  [ 67 ] `` as soon as we reach a level that is comfortable for us , when it meets our interests , when we agree on normal terms , then we will be talking about signing , '' president yanukovych stated in a televised interview . 
  [ 67 ] the same day russian president vladimir putin called for an end to the criticism of the ukrainian decision to delay the association agreement , and that the eu deal was bad for russia 's security interests . 
  [ 67 ] putin was responding to statements by the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , and the president of the european commission , jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , that had stated they `` strongly disapproved '' of russia 's actions . 
  [ 67 ] on 26 november 2013 prime minister azarov stated during a government meeting `` i affirm with full authority that the negotiating process over the association agreement is continuing , and the work on moving our country closer to european standards is not stopping for a single day '' . 
  [ 68 ] president yanukovych still attended the 28 -- 29 november eu summit in vilnius but the association agreement was not signed . 
  [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] during this summit the european union and ukraine initialed an air services agreement . 
  [ 71 ] also during the summit , president yanukovych stated that ukraine still wanted to sign the association agreement but that it needed substantial financial aid to compensate it for the threatened response from russia , and he proposed starting three-way talks between russia , ukraine , and the eu .
