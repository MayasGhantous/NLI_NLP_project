  he also urged brussels to help ukraine soften the terms of a possible loan from the imf . 
  [ 72 ] the eu rejected trilateral talks and asked yanukovich to commit to sign the association agreement , which he refused to do . 
  [ 72 ] at the end of a summit president of the european commission jos\u00e9 manuel barroso stated that the eu will not tolerate `` a veto of a third country '' in their negotiations on closer integration with ukraine . 
  [ 73 ] he also stated `` we are embarked on a long journey , helping ukraine to become , as others , what we call now , ` new member states ' . 
  but we have to set aside short-term political calculations . 
  '' [ 74 ]   the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , added that `` we may not give in to external pressure , least of all from russia '' . 
  [ 73 ] barroso reiterated that the eu 's offer to ukraine in terms of signing an association agreement remained on the table . 
  [ 75 ] [ c ] simultaneously , president yanukovych stated that he still intends to sign the association agreement at a later date `` once we get down to work and find solutions for economic problems , when we get the opportunity to sign a strategic partnership agreement with russia and everything else that we need to do , so that normal relations can be established between the european union , russia , and ukraine ... this is our responsibility '' . 
  [ 78 ] at this point , with the eu being significantly-more-popular than the trade agreement with russia , euromaidan begins :  euromaidan started in the night of 21 november 2013 when up to 2,000 protesters gathered at kiev 's maidan nezalezhnosti and began to organize themselves with the help of social networks . 
  [ snip ]  on 29 november 2013 , it became clear that ukraine did not sign the association agreement at the eastern partnership summit in vilnius . 
  the number of protesters in kiev swelled to 10,000 . 
  [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] in lviv , protesters numbered some 20,000 . 
  [ 28 ] as in kiev the lviv protesters locked hands in a human chain , symbolically linking ukraine to the european union ( organizers claimed that some 100 people even crossed the ukrainian-polish border to extend the chain to the european union ) . 
  [ 28 ] [ 29 ] euronews reported that protesters in kiev believed the rally should go on and were calling for the second azarov government 's and president viktor yanukovych 's resignation . 
  [ 30 ] this escalates until february 2014 , when government officials begin vanishing and heading outside the country .

  here 's a google translate translation :  `` the shootout . 
  the three night in piazza i maggio , station area . 
  one of the police flying squad is sent after a call : has anyone heard gunshots . 
  the police arrive to find a man , a north african . 
  and ` walk , alone . 
  at the request of the patrol leader to show the documents , pulls out a .22 - caliber pistol from his backpack and shoot , then hides behind a car . 
  the officers return fire , it would be a blow started from driver 's gun to kill him . '', 
   he probably died shooting precisely because of the reason you named : he wanted to die a martyr . 
  he could have died a martyr at the scene of his truck attack if he 'd wanted to do so . 
  he wanted to kill pollice to get away , and you guys did n't let him kill the police or get away . 
  good job !, 
  maybe we just look italian . 
   if tunisia did n't want to take him back , the solution is simple . 
  we will imprison him indefinitely as he poses a risk to the citizens of the european union and does not have the right to reside within italy . 
  all right . 
  i 'm assuming that you 're from wales ? 
  are you willing to have wales contribute land to house a detention facility for undeportable people the eu deems dubious , and is the eu as a whole willing to contribute funds to operate such a thing ? 
  because , i 'm going to be honest -- i think that some of the difficulty would be a country or countries being willing to host such a facility . 
  also , you might sign on for legal obligations in doing so . 
  it looks like there are [ british organizations ] ( https://www.barrowcadbury.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/noreturnnoreleasenoreasonreport.pdf ) that are trying to figure out how to overturn detention of non-deportable immigrations . 
  https://ukaji.org/2015/09/07/rapid-response-what-do-we-know-about-immigration-detention/  in march 2015 the uk 's all party parliamentary group on refugees and the all party parliamentary group on migration ( apgr/m ) published their ` report of the inquiry into the use of immigration detention in the united kingdom ' . 
  the apgr/m found the system of immigration detention `` expensive , ineffective and unjust '' and called for `` wholesale change '' to the practice . 
  the inquiry 's findings will be debated in parliament on 10 september 2015 . 
    one of the apgr/m 's four key recommendations is that there should be `` a time limit of 28 days on the length of time anyone can be held in immigration detention '' . 
  furthermore , the report argues that decisions to detain should be `` very rare '' and that `` detention should be for the shortest possible time and only to effect removal '' . 
    the return directive ( directive 2008/115/ec ) , formally adopted by the european parliament and the council on 16 december 2008 , states that , `` any detention shall be for as short a period as possible and only maintained as long as removal arrangements are in progress and executed with due diligence . '' [ 1 ] the uk is not bound by all the conditions of the directive and remains the only eu member where there are no time limits for individuals being detained under immigration administrative powers . 
  ( denmark and ireland were also not bound by the entirety of the directive , but in both countries immigration detention is subject to regular judicial review . ), 
  unless things have changed since 2015 , i assume that this is still the situation . 
  it 's more-satisfying to go after people who * do n't * want to commit suicide in their attack . 
  they can be thwarted . 
  `` frank '' , as in `` blunt '' . 
   thats quite claim you are jumping toward there all right , if that 's not what you 're saying , then never mind . 
  if someone 's making a claim , i 'd like to be clear about what it is that they 're making . 
  what did you mean by it ? 
   the more important question is why the eu wanted trade deals with ukraine ? 
  aside from the general `` trade is advantageous '' argument ? 
  i 'd assume that the eu has an interest in eventually working ukraine into the eu , and the eu ultimately becoming a voluntarily-joined organization that includes all of europe . 
   the one that 's so overly-liberal that it has zero strive for self-preservation ? 
  what do you mean by `` liberal '' in this context ? 
  intra-eu freedom of labor ? 
  technically , hard to prove that you have or have not fulfilled a vague metaphor . 
   the cia 's monthly eastern european contribution . 
  how about you be frank : is this some sort of claim that the cia was the `` real '' reason that ukraine wanted a trade agreement with the eu over the one with russia ? 
  has nato ever tried to pressure nations on arms smuggling before ? 
  maybe so , i have n't gone looking , but i doubt it . 
  pressure might happen if it were a concern for another country , but i do n't think that it would happen via nato -- it 'd go via the regular diplomatic country-to-country channels . 
  it just does n't relate to what nato does , even if both countries happen to be members of nato . 
   a couple million go a long way for most parties here i think that the moral of the story over here is that parties need to stop spending their money on political ads and start spending it on plausibly-independent chains of hackers to break into the other party 's and candidate 's computer systems , because that 's a hell of a lot more cost-effective . 
  hillary spent about $ 1.4 b and trump $ 930m . 
   one of the many conspiracy theories in russia is that the ' 1917 revolution and destruction of russian empire is solely to be blamed on the germans , who financed the bolsheviks . 
  it certainly was n't solely , but the `` sealed train '' with lenin potentially screwed things up for a long time for a hell of a lot of people in the world , and not just in russia . 
  informational weapons can make the strongest biological or nuclear weapons look like nothing . 
  i wish that train had n't gone out , but hindsight is 20/20 . 
  the germans would have had no idea the scope of what the bolsheviks might lead to ... 
  imagine alternate-timeline 1920 where the bolsheviks are n't the ones who wind up running things in russia , the first big domino . 
  a democratic/constitutional monarchy/etc russia . 
  no giant ideological conflict , maybe no world war ii , no cold war , no iron curtain . 
  china and russia and eastern europe probably a lot wealthier . 
  no idea what the twentieth century would have looked like , but i bet it would have been a lot different . 
   trump seems intent to become bush 2.0 in terms of political scandals . 
  if trump did nothing more-objectionable than bush 2.0 , i 'd be ecstatic . 
  is there a reason that you 're a throwaway account ? 
  that 's true of probably all political organizations , yes ? 
  why would nato , a military alliance , engage in law enforcement in turkey ? 
  ca n't you make it something like / r/shittrumpfanssay or something like that instead ? 
   in all four crises , merkel 's governments have dithered and german leadership has fallen short . 
  it seems like complaints alternate between : * germany is not showing leadership and * germany is pushing countries around  by offering better relations , the eu and the united states may give putin a reason to cooperate with the west . 
  that may also prove naive , as putin tends to operate by his own set of principles , but it is hard to see how merkel 's antagonistic approach can achieve any improvement to the current status quo . 
  i fail to see how this accomplishes either establishing eu authority vis-a-vis putin or achieves any desired goals . 
  if one simply ends sanctions , one also rather damages the ability to threaten economic pressure to achieve geopolitical goals , which i 'd understood the eu preferred to use of hard power . 
   the inadequacy with which europe has dealt with its quadruple crisis over the past decade alone calls for fresh leadership in berlin . 
  why ? 
  i 'd think that if there 's a concern about eu authority , it 'd be at the eu level , not in germany . 
   the austrian case should be a warning to germany . 
  after decades of grand coalitions between center-right christian democrats and center-left social democrats in vienna , voters have flocked to the far-right freedom party . 
  their candidate , norbert hofer , almost captured the symbolic post of the presidency earlier this month , only narrowly losing to independent candidate alexander van der bellen . 
  after 11 years in power , merkel 's cdu has run out of ideas . 
  over the past 35 years , it has only been out of government for seven years ( 1998-2005 ) . 
  only real change in germany has the potential to break the deadlock in all four crises facing the eu . 
  as far as i can tell , upset seems to be over the migrant crisis .
