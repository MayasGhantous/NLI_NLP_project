  why would changing the party running things address any of this ? 
  `` run out of ideas '' does n't make much sense to me -- after all , everyone is free to propose whatever ideas they want . 
   the eu today is more vulnerable to external aggression than it has been in 25 years , and merkel 's moves to further antagonize russia will only deteriorate relations . 
  how is merkel antagonizing russia ? 
  as far as i can tell , the eu has been relatively reactive -- ukraine gets occupied , sanctions go down . 
   the eu needs a new german-brokered grand bargain , one which entails increased economic solidarity between member states at the price of a truly common eu migration policy with real burden sharing of refugees . 
  does this mean `` being protectionist '' ? 
  like , cutting into trade with china , say ? 
  i do n't think that that 's likely economically-advantageous to the eu at all ( any more than i think that cutting into trade with china would be advantageous for the us ) . 
   if done right , `` red-red-green '' could give european integration a new lease on life and reestablish the european union as a key pillar of the global liberal order . 
  what 's clear is that if it remains under merkel 's leadership , europe will remain a fading power that both trump 's united states and putin 's russia can easily ignore . 
  why would moving to less-liberal leadership tend to make europe not `` a fading power '' ? 
   western banks accepted pilfered funds from russian clients , and western real estate agencies welcomed oligarchs to buy their most coveted properties in st-tropez , miami , and london . 
  this time around [ there is some effort to prevent people from running off with ukraine 's assets ] ( https://star.worldbank.org/star/ufar/ukraine-forum-asset-recovery-ufar ) and over the years , efforts to help address with corruption at an international level have spread slowly . 
  that being said , i do n't accept responsibility for not intervening in privatization . 
  first , the responsibility must always primarily lie with the country running a policy . 
  yeah , maybe someone can cooperate , but it 's going to have to drive this . 
  if the complaint was `` russia wants aid reacquiring stolen state assets '' and the us refused to participate , that 'd be on firmer ground . 
  but complaining that the us did n't take the primary role is difficult for me to swallow . 
  second , preventing someone from purchasing properties anywhere would require full global cooperation . 
  that 'd take a lot of time to throw together , and i 'm not even sure it could be pulled off today . 
  third ... it would not have been politically-viable . 
  had the united states walked in and said `` okay , * here * is how you should dole things out '' , there would have been * outrage * in russia , and anyone who felt disadvantaged ( or thought that pretending to be would be politically-advantageous ) would be up complaining publicly about foreign meddling . 
  that 'd be many , many angry russians who probably already had little trust and were worried about the future . 
  it simply would not have been accepted . 
  in the us 's defense , because there 's a lot of us-specific criticism there : the bomblets were n't intended to remain -- they simply were n't as reliable as had been intended . 
  we were n't the ones to initially move into vietnam . 
  we had one big go at colonialism , and that was the philippines . 
  while we certainly did less-than-admirable-in-retrospect things there , they were controlled by us for less than 50 years after hundreds of years under europe and were from the beginning moving towards an independent philippines . 
  and as for anti-communism -- we were n't the ones to open pandora 's box by using lenin to destabilize russia , thereby releasing the serious push for global communist revolution . 
  if our efforts to close that box were motivated by self-interest and harmed others , it was , albeit in a less-direct form than tanks rolling over a border , a real threat . 
   1/3rd of all bombs dropped did not explode [ 30 % of all * submunitions * of cluster weapons . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unexploded_ordnance#laos ), 
  the british lancaster was capable of carrying larger bombs than any world war ii american bomber . 
  the us and the uk [ accidentally bombed switzerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombings_of_switzerland_in_world_war_ii ) on a number of occasions , to give an idea of what navigation and target identification was like at the time . 
  technically it was the [ italian general douhet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giulio_douhet ) whose pre-war theories led to the adoption of bombing cities as a way to break morale . 
  ( it did n't actually work very well in practice , at least with conventional bombs . ), 
   the entire population was in the front line of an air war and they could be terrorized with urban bombing . 
  in his book the war of 19 -- he described a fictional war between germany and a franco-belgian alliance in which the germans launched massive terror bombing raids on the populace , reducing their cities to ashes before their armies could mobilize . 
  because bombing would be so terrible , douhet believed that wars would be short . 
  as soon as one side lost command of the air it would capitulate rather than face the terrors of air attack . 
  in other words , the enemy air force was the primary target . 
  a decisive victory here would hasten the end of the war . 
    however , subsequent conflicts would largely discredit douhet 's theory . 
  air marshal arthur `` bomber '' harris set out in 1942 to prove douhet 's theories valid during world war ii . 
  through four years under his command , raf bomber command attempted to destroy the main german cities . 
  by 1944 -- 1945 , in partial concert with the usaaf , they had largely achieved this aim ; but no revolution toppled the third reich . 
  the heavy bombers involved in the combined bomber offensive did not win the war alone , as harris had argued they would . 
  douhet 's theories about forcing the population to starting a revolution , when subjected to practical application , were shown to be ineffective . 
  in fact , there is considerable evidence to show the bombings did nothing but antagonize the german people , galvanizing them to work harder for their country , and the final defeat of germany was not achieved until virtually the entire country had been occupied by allied land forces . 
  [ snip ]  in `` rivista aeuronautica '' in july 1928 , he wrote that he believed that 300 tons of bombs over the most important cities would end a war in less than a month . 
  that can be compared with the fact that the allies during world war ii dropped in excess of 2.5 million tons of bombs on europe without this being directly decisive for the war . 
   the yankes knew what they knew , they were more brave < dubious  < looks up sources  http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/failurestratbombing.aspx  both great britain and the united states entered the war with plans to conduct a strategic bombing campaign against germany . 
  for the british , their guidance was ap 1300 , first written under the direction of hugh trenchard in the late 1920s and updated ( slightly ) for 1939 . 
  the us had developed awdp-1 which was remarkably similar to the goals of ap1300 ( i.e. 
  daylight precision bombardment of german war industry was the most efficient way to end the war ) . 
  the us doctrine differed primarily in that it was based on unescorted , heavily armed bombers that flew in formation at high altitude . 
  the crux of the american theory was bombing specific targets in daylight , most especially `` bottleneck '' targets , which destroyed , would cause the enemy 's economy to collapse . 
  both countries recognized that it would take time to build up resources for an invasion of europe and the only prospect they had to strike initially at germany was via a bombing campaign . 
    the british were shocked at the appalling attrition their bombers suffered in daylight strikes . 
  without long range fighter escorts , the bombers suffered unsustainable losses to luftwaffe fighters and anti-aircraft artillery fire ( aaa ) . 
  by 1940 , the british had switched to night operations for survivability reasons . 
  both their losses and effectiveness went down . 
  their types of targets had not changed but their means of navigating and finding precise targets had changed little since 1918 . 
  the end result was a douhet like scattering of bombs over a wide area in hopes of one bomb finding the target . 
  due to the difficulty in flying close formation at night , the british tactics were for individual aircraft to navigate to their target and bomb individually . 
  due to appalling weather for most of the year , inexperienced flight crews , and primitive navigation aids , their bombing effectiveness was minimal . 
  until well into the war , the only targets bomber command could locate and bomb effectively were sizeable german towns . 
  bombing accuracy was so abominable that a 1941 british report stated that there was only a 22 % chance of a bomber crew finding its way to within 5 miles of its target and for heavily defended targets in the ruhr , the percentage dropped to 7 % . 
  [ 5 ] even late in the war , when radar use became widespread the specially modified `` pathfinder '' aircraft were used to mark targets with incendiaries ; bombing accuracy had increased to a 50 % chance of a bomb falling within a mile of its target . 
  while the raf bombing campaign had limited usefulness against the sinews of the german war machine , it was decided at the casablanca conference in 1942 that the raf would continue to bomb at night and the americans during the day to create a `` round the clock '' bombing campaign against the germans . 
  this `` casablanca directive '' tasked allied bombers in england with the `` progressive destruction and dislocation of the german military , industrial , and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the german people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened . '' [ 6 ] subtly , the emphasis of the british strategic bombing campaign shifted from a counter industry campaign to a counter morale campaign . 
  this shift to directly targeting cities was rationalized as an effort to `` de-house '' the workers in the armaments industry and destroy their morale . 
    the united states took a different tack . 
  equipped with more heavily armed defensive weapons , the b-17 `` flying fortress '' and b-24 `` liberator '' , the americans were convinced that their strategy of daylight precision attacks was valid . 
  equipped with the fabled norden bombsight , it was claimed that a b-17 could `` drop a bomb into a pickle barrel from 20,000 feet '' . 
  the results told a different story . 
  hitting targets in the middle of concentric white circles in sunny texas was not quite the same as bombing german industry . 
  with bad weather obscuring the target area 60 % of the time in winter , strong unforecasted winds aloft , persistent enemy fighters , inadequate targeting intelligence , and lack of long range escort fighters until 1944 ; the us strategic bombing campaign was limited in its effectiveness . 
  the us army air force calculated that under fire , bombing accuracy declined 10-20 % . 
  as a result , the british measured their bombing accuracy in miles and the us in thousands of feet . 
  service ceiling : british [ avro lancaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avro_lancaster ) : 21,400 ft us [ b-24 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consolidated_b-24_liberator ) : 28,000 ft us [ b-17 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_b-17_flying_fortress ) : 35,600 ft the us would have been able to fly higher , which would have helped in an era where it took fighter planes some time to get to altitude . 
  armament : british avro lancaster : 8 .303 machine guns us b-24 : 10 .50 machine guns us b-17 : 13 .50 machine guns so , basically , the major doctrinal difference in heavy bombing dictated the day/night decision . 
  the us built bombers that were intended to operate independently of fighter escort . 
  this sacrificed bombload but meant that as long as a bomber could reach a target , it could operate without restriction . 
  the british built bombers that were intended to rely on fighter escort for defense . 
  this gained bombload but meant that they could only operate safely within the range of their fighters . 
  when they had to extend beyond this , their bombers were vulnerable -- so vulnerable that they were forced to operate at night . 
  the us had more-heavily-armed and higher-flying aircraft . 
  the us was more-able to ward off german fighter defenses . 
  wikipedia also says that the b-17 in particular was notable for [ being able ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all_american_\\ ( aircraft \\ ) # / media/file : damaged_tail_of_b-17 . jpg ) to survive [ severe damage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:b-17_damage_cologne.jpg ) . 
  the brits , on the other hand , could carry more and much-larger bombs -- kinda the * raison d'etre * of a bomber . 
  they took half a day to be * sure * . 
  it 'd be a lot worse if the police cleared the actual terrorist incorrectly . 
  if this was a serious question , [ have egg on your face ] ( https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/have-egg-on-your-face ) is an idiom for being embarrassed . 
  it looks like that german policy of not releasing identity of suspects was a really good idea . 
  given that germany would be the major proponent of such a thing if there were to be such an arrangement , i do n't really see grounds for such a complaint . 
  germany having disinterest would kill it anyway . 
  compared to whose immigration laws ? 
   there was a letter from the executive office stating any us military personnel ordered to fire upon a commercial aircraft would not be held accountable .
