  it really seems to me like establishing a trans-eu brake on granting citizenship would have been a vastly-more-reasonable approach to dealing with this . 
  i do n't . 
  that generator needs to cut out articles , conjunctions , and other really-common words that do n't relate to the meaning of the text . 
  also , it looks larger . 
  that actually has multiple distinct fraktur typefaces on one piece of paper . 
  well , i do n't think that there are many coptics . 
  probably mostly lutherans , baptists , catholics , and methodists ... but let 's see ... [ checks for statistics ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianity_in_the_united_states  christianity is the most adhered to religion in the united states , with 70 % of polled american adults identifying themselves as christian in 2014 . 
  [ 1 ] this is down from 86 % in 1990 , lower than 81.6 % in 2001 , [ 2 ] and slightly lower than 78 % in 2012 . 
  [ 3 ] about 62 % of those polled claim to be members of a church congregation . 
  [ 4 ] the united states has the largest christian population in the world , with nearly 280 million christians , although other countries have higher percentages of christians among their populations . 
    all protestant denominations accounted for 51.3 % , while roman catholicism by itself , at 23.9 % , was the largest individual denomination . 
  a 2008 pew study categorizes white evangelicals , 26.3 % of the population , as the country 's largest religious cohort ; [ 5 ] another study in 2004 estimates evangelicals of all races at 30 -- 35 % . 
  [ 6 ] the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ( mormons ) is the fourth largest church in the united states , and the largest church originating in the u.s. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ snip ]  ** protestantism **   | family | total | us % |  | - | - | - :|  | baptist | 38,662,005 | 25.3 % |  | pentecostal | 13,673,149 | 8.9 % |  | lutheran | 7,860,683 | 5.1 % |  | presbyterian/reformed | 5,844,855 | 3.8 % |  | methodist | 5,473,129 | 3.6 % |  | anglican | 2,323,100 | 1.5 % |  | adventist | 2,203,600 | 1.4 % |  | holiness | 2,135,602 | 1.4 % |  | other groups | 1,366,678 | 0.9 % | [ snip ]  ** orthodox christianity **   the association of religion data archives ( arda ) as of 2000 reported just below 1 million eastern orthodox and oriental orthodox adherents in the us , or 0.4 % of the total population . 
  [ 54 ] [ snip ]  ** the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints **   ( mormons )   current u.s. membership is 6.4 million . 
  that does not conflict with my comment -- christianity has punished heretics in the past , including via death . 
  catholicism had ( sometimes ; at some times you had multiple competing popes ) a central authority . 
  but that 's not christianity . 
  christianity fragmented over many denominations . 
  you 've got catholics , adventists , anabaptists , anglicans , baptists , calvinists , a host of charismatic and pentecostal movements , evangelicals , lutherans , methodists , eastern orthodox , the coptic orthodox ... i 'm not going to list all of them , but they 've all got their own structure . 
  even the larger churches above are n't a single organization -- there 's no `` high official of all lutheran organizations '' . 
  no , i 'd call it general drift over time . 
  people trimming out things that just did n't work for them in modern society . 
  there was no great lawgiver in christianity that came and modernized it , not in that sense . 
  nobody said `` okay , all christians out there -- usury is now okay , because credit is useful in markets '' . 
  if 0.0001 % of 1.5 b were suicide bombers , the world would have long since have turned into a massive bloodbath . 
  and yet both sides refrained from use of chemical weapons in world war ii . 
  even if a fight is a knock-down , drag-out fight with bitter costs , it seems like it 's possible to draw lines and have them hold . 
  is it ? 
  i mean , [ * good king wenceslas * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_king_wenceslas ) is n't a song about how the world is perfect . 
  well , i 'm not sure what you mean by `` open war '' -- whether you 're making the definition contingent upon a formal declaration , or whether the effort must be all-in , or what . 
  in the formal declaration sense we have n't officially declared war since world war ii , though we 've been involved in many conflicts since then . 
  and we 've had only a few wars that were fought with the explicit goal of the destruction or unconditional surrender of the other side . 
  but normally , a war does n't need to be a * total war * to be considered a war . 
  take the [ spanish-american war in 1898 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish%e2%80%93american_war ) . 
  it targeted spanish colonial possessions . 
  but it never had as a goal spain itself -- the us was n't going to put boots in madrid . 
  it seems difficult to me not to call that war , just as it seems difficult to me not to call the [ falklands war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falklands_war ) a war . 
  after all , few wars are fought with the goal of the total annihilation of the other side . 
  europe 's seen hundreds of years of wars that seek to take territory or property . 
  the goal of both parties is peace -- simply on the terms that * they * want . 
  declarations are diplomatic tools that might be used to achieve that goal , but it really seems to me that the fighting is more of what matters . 
  it was , perhaps , not a tremendously * large * war , not one that stretched the capabilities of each side 's productive capacity or manpower . 
  if your point is that no country would declare a total war , a war of annihilation , against a nuclear power ... then perhaps that might be true . 
  but that would also be a very limiting definition , and not the common sort of war that history has seen either . 
   ca n't really reason with someone who does n't have any can we now ? 
  * i said `` reasonable '' , rather than `` reason with '' . 
  * i disagree that everyone in the middle east has no reason . 
   only thing they do understand is brute force . 
  the whole middle east ? 
   with a few brief exceptions in history they were always like that . 
  you do realize that there is a tiny handful of people who are off engaged in suicide-terrorism things , and that the overwhelming majority of people in the middle east are not , right ? 
  i assume that you 'd agree with me that it would be unreasonable to call the irish `` violent terrorists '' because of the troubles . 
  i mean , turkey * has * been seeing political violence recently . 
  hmm . 
  is that according to german legal code ? 
  do n't you and portugal go back a ways ? 
  and since the whole 1812 business , we 've got on all right . 
  has iceland had any disputes ? 
  broadly-speaking , religions -- and this is not specific to islam -- tend to punish heresy ( adopting an `` incorrect '' form of the religion in question ) more-harshly than non-belief . 
  i doubt that that was the result of intentional new russian policy . 
  frankly , russia would probably prefer to have ukraine simmer down and fade out of view . 
  responding to actual russian actions is one thing . 
  increasing sanctions because the situation has had something unpleasant happen does n't buy anything . 
  i think that : * killing an ambassador is extremely unlikely to lead to war . 
  this is not a new event in the world . 
  * russia is very unlikely to go to war with turkey , which would entail attacking a nato member . 
  * that a nuclear response would be even more unlikely . 
  * that this is a truly foolish path to advocate for over turkey 's eu membership . 
  argentina versus uk , to name one ? 
  the new secretary-general of the un as of jan 1 has just spent a decade in charge of the un refugee program and was president of socialist international . 
  want to bet whether that will produce an anti-international right-wing backlash ? 
  i would respond , but your post is full of big words . 
  poor delaware . 
  also , `` haven '' . 
  means a safe place . 
  not necessarily . 
  if you live in germany legally on a temporary permit for ... i think four years ... you can apply for permanent legal residence . 
  though i ca n't recall whether employment was part of that requirement . 
  i mean , he was n't . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if he has a heart attack , the department of state is n't going to shed many tears . 
  given that most of those seem to be euroskeptic , they might crack up the eu . 
  it used to be even higher in ireland , until we decided to redefine the foot in 1959 and split the difference with the brits :  the international yard and pound agreement of july 1959 defined the length of the international yard in the united states and countries of the commonwealth of nations as exactly 0.9144 meters . 
  consequently , the international foot is defined to be equal to exactly 0.3048 meters . 
  this was 2 ppm shorter than the previous u.s. definition and 1.7 ppm longer than the previous british definition . 
  that does n't really sound like a reasonable , measured response that would likely improve the global situation . 
  technically the us now has pretty good odds ( greater than 99 % in a model on a recently-posted academic paper on / r/credibledefense ) of being able to pull off a successful , fully-arsenal-destroying nuclear first strike against russia , unless the russian nuclear forces have already moved to an alerted status . 
  i 'd give nato good odds in such a matchup . 
  the goal of non-penetration is n't lead poisoning . 
  it 's so that all of the kinetic energy goes into ripping up tissue , rather than being wasted in a bullet flying out the other side . 
  hell , neither can totalitarian ones . 
  the us ambassador to libya was killed in 2012 and we did n't beat the shit out of libya for it ( not that we did n't happily bomb them a while down the road at france 's request for other reasons ... ), 
  you do realize that you come off as a cariacature of yourself , right ? 
  nothing remotely at that level . 
  hey , i did n't know that he was a gun rights supporter !, 
  well , the lack of it does come with some substantial consequences that are often considered to be `` needed '' . 
  the welfare state relies upon not having a seriously-shrinking population , and japan is suffering difficulties from this , and i think that many people would consider what welfare provides `` needed '' . 
  i think that `` need '' here is being used in a somewhat-casual sense , as in `` man , my car is really old ... i need a new one '' , to mean `` it is desirable to have a growing population '' . 
  without maintaining population levels , europe 's economic and other influence on the world will necessarily undergo significant relative decline . 
  i 'd rather be the guy who has to carry the rounds for one of these than the guy who has to be toting [ 120mm mortar rounds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o65nb1j4spi&amp;t=1m ) , though ... 
   i advocate a much , much harder stance on russia since 2009 and called for a ban from swift in 2014 already .
