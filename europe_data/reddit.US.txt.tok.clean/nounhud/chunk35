  you guys just love your commonwealths . 
  i ca n't believe you beat me to this comment . 
  i suspect that [ roundabouts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roundabout ) ( which are very rare in the us and confuse the hell out of us drivers , but common in the uk ) are a partial substitute . 
  two-and-a-half times the size of the rest of it combined ? 
   it 's hard being a single parent hey , you 're the one talking about breaking up with france after you got together . 
   what was this about then ? 
  [ declaration of independence , on imposing french law instead of english law ] ( http://agovernmentofthepeople.com/resources/united-states-declaration-of-independence/ ) :  * for abolishing the free system of english laws in [ a neighbouring province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec_act ) , establishing therein an arbitrary government , and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies nobody should have to tolerate that !, 
   9 times out of 10 they 're skilled and then there 's joe . 
  darn it , joe . 
  i dunno how well you guys match up to france . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone  due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet , france possesses the second largest eez in the world , covering 11,035,000 km2 ( 4,514,000 mi2 ) , just after of the eez of the united states ( 11,351,000 km2 / 4,382,000 mi2 ) . 
  [ contradiction ] the eez of france covers approximately 8 % of the total surface of all the eezs of the world , whereas the land area of the french republic is only 0.45 % of the total land area of the earth . 
  and  the united kingdom 's exclusive economic zone is the fifth largest in the world at 6,805,586 square km . 
  it comprises the exclusive economic zones surrounding the united kingdom , [ 51 ] the crown dependencies , and the british overseas territories . 
  the figure does not include the eez of the british antarctic territory . 
  the exclusive economic zones associated with the falkland islands and south georgia are disputed by argentina . 
  i do n't have a measurement of coastline handy , but i 'd think that eez area probably approximates being proportional to coastline .

  ehhhh ... complicated . 
  `` colony '' is n't the same thing as annexing land to the country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colony  in politics and history , a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a state , distinct from the home territory of the sovereign . 
  true , pretty much all us states had a period as a territory before they became a state ... but i also think that it was pretty clear that the territorial status was a transitional one towards becoming a state . 
  the us does have things that could be considered analogous to colonies : [ unincorporated territories , land which is not incorporated into the country of the united states of america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territories_of_the_united_states#unincorporated_organized_territories ) . 
  this is several islands : guam , the northern marianas , puerto rico ( puerto rico only technically ; court decisions have ruled that it has become incorporated into the us ) , the us virgin islands , american samoa , and some small uninhabited islands that are now wildlife refuges . 
  and there were points in history when there were [ rather more-substantial things held under us control without having been incorporated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._colonial_possessions ) . 
  the phillippines would be the most-notable historic example , i think .

  ah , see , [ germany just really , really loves poland ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/496/asdf.jpg ) . 
  it 's also true that the focus on constitution as more-fundamental than any other element of government might be a us-centric view . 
  i could easily see a government saying `` yeah , we should codify things in a constitution , as everyone else is doing , same stuff we 've been doing thus far '' , and say that this really can not be said to represent a change in government . 
  that being said , i do think that if there is an argument against the uk or san marino , it 's not so much a constitutional one , and really one of the other two issues raised : * the uk really underwent a pretty fundamental shift from what was in practice an absolute monarchy to what is in practice a republic . 
  however , it did so very smoothly and i 'd have a hard time drawing a single dividing line , and in fact , this is [ really still a process underway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fixed-term_parliaments_act_2011#background ) . 
  i would not myself call it a broken line of government , though it is today completely different than it once was . 
  * i am not familiar with the nazi occupation of san marino ( and then the two-month allied occupation after the allies drove the axis out ) , but as far as i can [ tell from a skim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_san_marino#world_war_ii ) , it while the country clearly did not have formal sovereign power for a brief period of time , it also did not really disrupt government :  san marino 's hope to escape further involvement was shattered on 27 july 1944 when major gunther , commander of the german forces in forl\u00ec , delivered a letter from german headquarters in ferrara to san marino 's government declaring that the country 's sovereignty could not be respected if , in view of military requirements , the necessity of transit of troops and vehicles arose . 
  the communiqu\u00e9 , however , underlined that wherever possible occupation would be avoided . 
  [ 14 ]   fears were confirmed when on 30 july a german medical corps colonel presented himself with an order for the requisition of two public buildings for the establishment of a military hospital . 
  on the following day , 31 july 1944 , in view of the likely invasion by german forces , the state sent three letters of protest : one to joachim von ribbentrop , german foreign minister , one to adolf hitler and one to benito mussolini , [ 14 ] the latter delivered by a delegation to serafino mazzolini , a high-ranking diplomat in the italian ministry of foreign affairs . 
  demanding to meet mussolini with the intention to ask that its neutrality be respected , the following day mazzolini took them to see mussolini , who promised to contact the german authorities and intervene in favour of san marino 's request . 
  [ 15 ]   san marino was a refuge for over 100000 civilians [ 16 ] who sought safety on the passing of allied forces over the gothic line [ 1 ] during the battle of rimini , an enormous effort of relief by the inhabitants of a country that at that time counted only 15,000 people . 
  [ 14 ]   despite all this , the germans and allies clashed on san marino 's soil in late september 1944 at the [ battle of monte pulito ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_san_marino ) ; allied troops occupied san marino after that , but only stayed for two months before returning the republic 's sovereignty . 
  yeah , i get you . 
  could n't refrain from linking , though . 
  would have if the confederacy had won . 
  edit : well , no , not even then , because they were n't trying to take over the north , just split away . 
  the author here was n't counting rebellions as resetting the timer on other countries -- just the actual sovereign government being booted out or undergoing radical change such that it might not be considered the same government . 
  there was no assertion by the confederacy that the us did not exist as a sovereign state or that its government was illegitimate -- just that part of the country had left . 
  being called a young country ai n't a zing over here . 
  but just because this seems like a glorious argument waiting to happen : [ ** what is the world 's oldest living , continuous government ? 
  ** ] ( https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100704221429aaekkhs )  best answer : every time i see this question i do n't think i have ever seen a concrete answer . 
   there is a lot of if , ands , and buts . 
    there is always the same contenders for the prize ... they are as follows :  ( in other words , i did n't personally come up with these , this is an often asked question that has been argued forever )   * san marino  * vatican city  * iceland  * england  * isle of man  * switzerland  * usa ( yes , the usa , believe it or not )   san marino has been a continuous republic since 301 ad , although its current constitution is only about 400 years old . 
    san marino 's existing constitution dates to 1600 , but there was that nastiness in 1739 where the constitution was temporarily replaced with someone else 's . 
  and also the nazis . 
  but if you dont ' count the nazis , than 1739 . 
  back to sm in a moment . 
    the vatican city ...   the holy see is not a sovereign nation . 
    the holy see should not be confused with the vatican city state , which came into existence only in 1929 , while the holy see dates back to early christian times . 
  ambassadors are officially accredited not to the vatican city state but to `` the holy see '' , and papal representatives to states and international organizations are recognized as representing the holy see , not the vatican city state . 
    iceland has had a parliament running since the early 900 ad . 
    iceland was a good guess , except that they were part of norway 's and later denmark 's monarchy until 1918 . 
  so they were n't completely sovereign until 1918 . 
    the united kingdom since 1649 . 
   england had a violent transfer of power under oliver cromwell in 1649 , resetting their clock then . 
   you might want to date it at 1707 ( see history ) instead , which is still older than the u.s. 
  however , i 'm wondering if the gradual decline of the power of the king/queen since the start of the 19th century would disqualify the uk ? 
  if it does n't disqualify them , than i 'm going with the uk since 1707 . 
    if you disqualify the uk , than you have to go with san marino since 1739 . 
  unless you count the brief drive-by from the nazis . 
    the legislature of the isle of man has been continuously in place for over 1000 years . 
   the isle of man is n't sovereign , disqualifies them outright . 
    modern switzerland is up there . 
  since 1291 . 
   but napoleon conquered switzerland in 1798 so switzerland is disqualified . 
    nothing in africa comes even close to consistent over the past 300 years . 
  same with much of asia . 
    most all aboriginal populaces of the world have been `` conquered '' by some country or another in the past 300 years . 
  those aboriginals unfortunate enough to be in north or south america were conquered in turns by the english , spanish , portuguese , italian , and french . 
  those in asia and australia by the english ( again ) , french , chinese , japanese , russians , or each other . 
  those in africa by english and french , italy , or again each other . 
   ( what disqualifies the aboriginals of australia ? 
  lack of recognizable govt ? ), 
    that leaves us back with san marino , the uk , and the usa . 
    if you disqualify both the uk and san marino , than it 's the usa !, 
    the usa is the longest lived government to have ever existed without radical changes ; either by violent or non-violent means . 
    holding truths to be self-evident since 1787 !!, 
    crazy huh ? 
      edit   jim l - damn , if i 've got my date wrong on the uk , which was my choice , then it 's either san marino or the us !, 
    most lists you will see say san marino ( jeporady and trivial pursuit say san marino also ) now who 's the young whippersnapper ? 
  san marino should start using this line in every un speech . 
  i really think that there must be some kind of language barrier on that , because while i suppose `` polish death camps '' could be seen as ambiguous , nobody over here thinks that it means anything but `` death camps that were located in poland '' , same as nobody has a problem understanding that `` french fries '' does n't mean that france owns them . 
   they have problem with calling usa any of that  bankster we do a pretty big chunk of finance . 
   jew largest number of any country in the world . 
   soros lackey soros is a us citizen . 
  c'mon , pis , get your game on . 
   i think there needs to be some enclave of latin enthusiasts speaking the language exclusively before any revitalization would be possible . 
  / r/latina, 
  i 'd say that the main alternative contenders * globally * would be : * mandarin .
