  is this the sheer number of people moving to work , or beggars coming , or concern about organized crime entering areas that previously did n't have issues , or what ? 
  i mean , having large , populous countries linking up with each other via mutual desire is a new phenomenon , and i 'm very willing to believe that the process is not as smooth as it could be ... 
  whoah , that is an * extremely * misleading title . 
  `` ukraine will not join eu , dutch are promised in effort to save treaty '' definitely gives the impression that they got a promise that ukraine wo n't be joining the eu . 
  instead , they were promised that if they agreed to the eu-ukraine association agreement , that this did not * guarantee * eu membership to ukraine :  in a bid to assuage dutch concerns , european leaders have spelled out that ukraine has not been promised eu membership , nor any help from european armies in the event of invasion , as a result of signing an association agreement . 
  this was always the case ( though perhaps less-than-scrupulous people presented it as otherwise ... ) note that this is the original title -- it 's * the guardian * at fault here , not the submitter . 
  people * do * need to have somewhere to live . 
  it 's certainly possible to retain landmarks , but if you do n't have enough housing , you 've got worse problems . 
  if you can do that and make the housing look fancier , cool , but ... 
  wow , i thought that that was morphed . 
  that dog [ actually does have a mouth that wide ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/7gafd ) . 
  it 's a lot better than not having housing that people need . 
  london would have a lot more affordable housing if it 'd start letting those go up . 
  ah , fair enough . 
   russia 's sputnik agency is reporting this on tuesday , quoting croatian daily vecernji list , which said it was able to `` exclusively '' see this document . 
  `` nato is ready to intervene in the balkans operatively when necessary to prevent inter-ethnic conflict and promote security and stability , '' said the `` secret nato document on the situation in the western balkans , '' according to the paper . 
  hmm . 
  okay , not saying that there is n't anything here , but the claim is : * secret nato document ... * ... that a croatian daily paper says that it is the only one that has access to ... * ... quoted in a russian state propaganda outlet ... * ... which in turn is re-quoted on b92 ... that 's kind of a lengthy and sketchy chain to follow with a lot of agenda involved to track down nato policy documents . 
  i actually went looking online for material on how the estonian , latvian , and lithuanian assets frozen as a result of [ executive order 8484 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executive_order_8484 ) were handled a while back . 
  i could n't find any sort of ceremonial re-transfer of authority after independence from the ussr , so i think that in effect , the sovereign authority over it were just transferred to the respective baltic delegations that the us [ recognized as holding sovereign power of the state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_government-in-exile#diplomacy ) :  of the three baltic states , only estonia established a formal government in exile . 
  in the cases of latvia and lithuania , sovereign authority had been vested in its diplomatic legations . 
  even with regard to estonia , the legations were the primary instrument for the conduct of diplomacy and for administering the daily matters of state ( such as issuing passports ) . 
  estonia 's primary legation was the consulate in new york city . 
  ... because i see references to estonia 's new york consulate funding estonian diplomatic operations in london , and i assume that it was drawing from that . 
  estonians/latvians/lithuanians may be a lot more familiar with how the government-in-exile systems functioned , since i 'm guessing that it 's covered in their history classes . 
   crimea is not asking to be recognised as a sovereign state , but part of russia , and i think everyone recognises it as that [ almost all countries do not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_crimea#crimean_crisis_and_subsequent_developments ) . 
  aw , thanks . 
  might have been even happier if we 'd shown up , say , five decades earlier , i suppose ... 
  well , it dropped in rank . 
  if you 're going to rank world defense spenders , you 're going to have to convert to some form of common currency . 
  that being said , i think that it 'd be interesting to rank ppp-adjusted military budgets . 
   i agree with this , and think longer term punishments for raping children should definitely be in place ( minimum sentence 10-15 years with minimum 10 years of no parole is what i 'm personally leaning towards in cases of young children being raped ) < checks state codes  in this us , this varies significantly by state . 
  towards the low end , ** california ** : http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/penal-code/pen-sect-264.html  ( c ) ( 1 ) any person who commits rape in violation of paragraph ( 2 ) of subdivision ( a ) of section 261 upon a child who is under 14 years of age shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 9 , 11 , or 13 years . 
  http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/penal-code/pen-sect-261-5.html  ( e ) ( 1 ) notwithstanding any other provision of this section , an adult who engages in an act of sexual intercourse with a minor in violation of this section may be liable for civil penalties in the following amounts : [ snip ]  ( d ) an adult over the age of 21 years who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under 16 years of age is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ( $ 25,000 ) . 
  towards the high end , ** alabama ** : http://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/2006/13297/13a-6-61.html  ( a ) a person commits the crime of rape in the first degree if : [ snip ]  ( 3 ) he or she , being 16 years or older , engages in sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex who is less than 12 years old . 
    ( b ) rape in the first degree is a class a felony . 
  http://codes.findlaw.com/al/title-13a-criminal-code/al-code-sect-13a-5-6.html  ( a ) sentences for felonies shall be for a definite term of imprisonment , which imprisonment includes hard labor , within the following limitations :   ( 1 ) for a class a felony , for life or not more than 99 years or less than 10 years . 
  [ snip ]  ( c ) in addition to any penalties heretofore or hereafter provided by law , in all cases where an offender is designated as a sexually violent predator pursuant to section 15-20a-19 , or where an offender is convicted of a class a felony sex offense involving a child as defined in section 15-20a-4 ( 26 ) , and is sentenced to a county jail or the alabama department of corrections , the sentencing judge shall impose an additional penalty of not less than 10 years of post-release supervision to be served upon the defendant 's release from incarceration . 
    ( d ) in addition to any penalties heretofore or hereafter provided by law , in all cases where an offender is convicted of a sex offense pursuant to section 13a-6-61 , 13a-6-63 , or 13a-6-65 .1 , when the defendant was 21 years of age or older and the victim was six years of age or less at the time the offense was committed , the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole . 
  edit : also , this is an aggravated felony , and for any state , if you survive serving your sentence , if you 're a legal resident but not a citizen , [ immigration control will take over ] ( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/crimes-that-will-make-immigrant-deportable.html ) :  if you were convicted of an aggravated felony at any time , there will be very little that you can do to avoid deportation , unless you can prove it is more likely than not that you would be tortured in your native country upon return . 
  a waiver to return to the u.s. will not be available for any purpose . 
  you should obtain competent counsel who can help you avoid an aggravated felony conviction that will permanently render you inadmissible to the united states . 
  how about that !, 
  til . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easterlings  in the fiction of j. r. r. tolkien , `` easterling '' and `` easterlings '' were generic terms for men who lived in the east of middle-earth , who mostly fought under morgoth and sauron , not directly but rather on behalf of their own lords . 
  `` easterlings '' is a thing that means something already ... just saying . 
  i bet that your russian friends ( a ) speak english and ( b ) are not representative of the population as a whole . 
  honestly , i 've never paid much attention to criticism of the olympic country and accomodations and all that , but after sochi i did ... and i think that brazil caught significantly more flak over issues associated with hosting the olympic games than russia did . 
  i think that that 's just how the coverage is . 
  it was negative , yeah , but russia was not unusual . 
   it is the same with a lot of leaders . 
  i even struggle to finde some positive news about trump on the_donald . 
  it is all about liberals suck , hillary/obama did this and that , but i still don \u00b4 t understand what trump will fix about anything . 
  in trump 's defense , that 's really kind of the norm for this us election on both sides . 
  both major candidates were miserably unpopular across-the board . 
  yeah , hillary 's got some supporters out there , but i 'm pretty sure that most people were more driven by being even more unhappy about trump . 
  i do n't recall * that * many people really cheerleading for hillary as a candidate . 
  negative campaigning is far more effective in a two party environment , since if you discourage people from voting for the other guy , you become the automatic default . 
  my vague guess , though i 've never seen someone trying to measure it , is that environments with more multiparty-friendly voting systems , like most of europe , probably see less negative campaigning . 
   but today the west was `` provoking russia '' and trying to undermine president vladimir putin , he said . 
  if `` not accepting annexation of parts of russia 's neighbors '' is `` provoking russia '' or `` trying to undermine president vladimir putin '' , i 'm comfortable with that . 
  if you wanted to blame the west for not doing a reasonable job of trying to facilitate russia 's transition to a liberal democracy or smoothing the economic path in the early 1990s , fine ( though i think that had that happened , the west would have caught flak for internal political interference ) . 
  i think that in an alternate reality with a liberal russia , things would probably have been a lot better on both sides . 
  but it seems to me that it 's pretty difficult to defend putin 's actions . 
  there are a number of satnav systems , but not with full global coverage .

  turkey is n't arranging to have boats with hidden flags operating either . 
  the worst thing that turkey has done is to not stop them . 
  the eu ca n't really replicate that process , because the people in question do not want to be in turkey and do want to be in the eu : few migrants are likely to travel back to turkey . 
  imho , if the eu wants to discourage inflow , the eu is best-off doing a pacific solution-style approach , where it finds a country willing to take them that does n't provide the favorable work-and-benefit environment in the eu , and by closing the doors to further migrants , dissuades more from coming . 
  anyone who gets caught gets fingerprinted and goes to a camp there ; they can be repatriated home , but ca n't come to the eu . 
  that 's the most-compelling and - viable approach that i 've seen to reduce the flow in the near term , unless eu members are willing to withdraw from the refugee convention . 
   but that 's exactly what 's happening . 
  no -- there 's an important difference . 
  turkey * is n't stopping them * from moving from turkey to the eu . 
  if turkish naval boats were taking refugees to italy and dropping them in the eu , it 'd be different . 
  the un [ universal declaration of human rights ] ( http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ ) would actually prohibit them from stopping people from leaving :  article 13   ( 1 ) everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state . 
    ( 2 ) ** everyone has the right to leave any country ** , including his own , and to return to his country . 
  that is , it 's the eu member , the target country , that 's responsible for doing the interception and processing . 
  you may stop people from entering your country , but you may not stop them from leaving . 
  now , granted , turkey using them as leverage for something is sketchy . 
  but they 're offering to do something that goes above-and-beyond any obligations they have . 
  it 's not as if they 're not living up to some requirement that they block people from fleeing to the eu . 
  there are things that i think that one could object to turkey on . 
  but on the refugee crisis , at * worst * they 're playing hot potato , which is not really any different than what most of europe is doing . 
  and in practice , they 've been housing a heck of a lot of refugees . 
  i 'm not an advocate of letting unskilled economic migration into europe . 
  but beating up on turkey here does n't hold water -- turkey 's at doing at least as much as the eu . 
  no eu member has shown anything like interest in stopping refugees from cruising on straight through to their target destination , as long as it gets them out of their country . 
  no , if you want to complain about countries shifting load to europe , those that do n't take any in or that take few in would be more-reasonable . 
  really , though , towing random people to turkey and dumping them there going to be met by turks with about the same amount of enthusiasm as you 'd have for the prospect of turkey doing the same to your country . 
  and , frankly , i doubt that it 's even the most-effective way to discourage economic migration into europe . 
  in mexico and south of the border , people take out debt to pay smugglers to get them into the us . 
  those people then expect a take of their earnings . 
  i would be surprised if similar approaches did n't work in the med . 
  well , there were competing claims about the effects of brexit . 
  i mean , the intent is nice , but it would be very hard to avoid cases where someone acts as a proxy for someone else . 
   well the us was trying to change the strategic balance in europe by building a global network of shields aimed at ~ ~ russia ~ ~ iran and ~ ~ china ~ ~ north korea . 
  fixed that for you . 
  yes .
