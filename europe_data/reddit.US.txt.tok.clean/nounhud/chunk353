  nobody 's ever tried doing what the eu has accomplished at the scale it 's working at -- gluing together many major existing countries in a voluntary union . 
  this is forging new ground , and so far , seems to be going all right to me . 
  edit : ah , i just checked your comments and saw the one about how western democracy will fail and eurasianism will be the future . 
  thanks for clearing up your position . 
  western europe wasnt socialist . 
  social democracy , maybe . 
  pew is a major polling company , and if you do n't consider their work reputable , i 'm not sure who you would find reputable . 
  pew 's also ime better at disclosing methodology than gallup . 
  this is measuring * perceptions * . 
  i suspect that most , if not all , churches are incorporated . 
  i recall people saying that merkel was failing to successfully lead and the eu suffered from inaction on here a while back . 
  ca n't have it both ways . 
   trump 's tax returns is just the last straw it 's really not . 
  it 's the modern-day norm for presidential candidates in the us to publicly release those , and quite unusual for trump to have refused to do so . 
  i would expect this to be highlighted if any one candidate said that nobody could see their tax data , not just trump . 
  roger that !, 
  sounds like an opportunity for romanian consulting firms to act as a middleman . 
  no , that 's not ... what i mean is that ppp measures the `` cost of things '' at a given location . 
  for example , in the us , we have pretty expensive labor , so it costs more to have someone sitting behind a cash register than it does in paraguay . 
  the costs there get passed on to the customer . 
  ordinarily , if labor can move freely and if people can choose where to purchase their goods , you 'd expect there to be little difference . 
  if paraguay were next door to new york city and people could live in paraguay and work in new york city , they 'd probably have people doing so , and the result is that labor costs would fall off in nyc and thus so would the price of goods . 
  ( and labor costs would rise in paraguay near the new york border . ), 
  even if paraguay labor could n't cross the border , people in nyc would shop in paraguay , and the relative shift in demand would tend to cause their ppp indexes to converge . 
  basically , you 'd rarely expect to see huge swings in color in this map in adjacent regions , because of this `` smoothing '' effect . 
  this is true for most of the map -- you have a gentle gradient with ppp drifting from one level to another . 
  but it 's not the case at the austria-hungary border . 
  that has a very high level in eastern austria and a very low level in hungary . 
  well , i mean , it 's not as if ukraine can be gathering data in crimea -- they wo n't have any data available . 
   and its other way around , slovaks and hungarians generally go to burgenland for shopping . 
  that confuses me . 
  the ppp index is based upon relative price differences in a market basket of goods . 
  based on that map 's coloration , the areas in austria near hungary * should * have said goods cost more than in hungary . 
   most of austrians and hungarians do n't live near the border , though . 
  yeah , but i 'm talking about the postcodes that are on the border -- there 's a sharp , steep cliff there . 
  i 'm guessing that 's it . 
  i understand that the eu defines data-reporting standards and if the data is n't compatible , i assume that people do n't use it . 
  clearly need to do the same thing with quebec for the canadian market . 
  i like their fries . 
  they 're also [ notable for having surprisingly little salt ] ( http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2012/02/fast-food-french-fries-taste-test-mcdonalds-burger-king-wendys.html ) . 
   either force these companies to pay their share where they make the profit if there were a single , simple , loophole-free way to define that , this would n't be an issue . 
  hungary and austria are in the single market . 
  i 'd think that it should be possible to buy anything other than , say , services that are * very * tied to location simply by running across the border . 
  and yet , hungry is near the bottom end and austria near the border is near the top end . 
  why would n't austrians avail themselves of hungarian offerings a handful of kilometers away , and why would n't hungarians cross the border to work ? 
  does russia make ppp data at a postcode level available ? 
   ms le pen had been widely reported as saying the education ban should apply to foreigners , but after her speech she clarified to the afp that she was talking about illegal immigrants . 
  it 's not clear to me who this involves . 
  i 'd think that if france * knew * that someone had entered illegally , they 'd be deported . 
  does this refer to people who entered illegally and were refused asylum but have deferred deportations or otherwise can not be deported ( e.g. 
  the destination state refuses to take them ) ? 
  or is this a meaningless statement ? 
  as i understand it , they [ * did * want to deport them to madagascar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) -- i mean , that was n't a front . 
  / u/xnicolex is what you might call critical of the us and of the uk on any topic . 
  i came to this sub in part because it talked about politics without flaming , i was quite impressed with . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt_%28tv_network%29  the sharp decline in the ruble at the end of 2014 , forced it to postpone channels in german and french . 
  [ 100 ] rt prioritized english-language targets with what budget it had available . 
  now russia has viewed it as successful enough to want to throw additional resources into targeting french-language targets . 
  that 's news . 
  he 's not a putin puppet . 
  he has made a lot of statements that are disconcerting . 
  his position on russia is not one that i agree with . 
  certainly russia 's done what it can to promote him as being what it sees as the most-favorable candidate , and those efforts might have swung the election . 
  i see him as someone that has potential to cause harm . 
  i wish that we 'd dug up someone preferable . 
  but that does n't mean that moscow tells him what to do . 
  nor would le pen be a putin puppet . 
  she may take actions that putin would greatly like to see happen , and russia may have purchased some degree of influence via financing , but she does n't take marching orders from moscow . 
  `` puppet '' is n't an accurate term . 
  for one thing , russia almost certainly does not want iran getting clobbered . 
  if there 's one notable constant in trump 's cabinet , it 's people with an exceptional level of level of hostility towards and distrust for iran . 
  [ mattis is secdef and hates iran ] ( http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/james-mattis-iran-secretary-of-defense-214500 ) . 
  pence is vp and has criticized the iran deal . 
  [ kelley is head of dhs and thinks that iran is screwing with the us in the americas ] ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/trump-homeland-secretary-warned-iran-infiltrating-southern-border/ ) . 
  priebus is chief of staff and wanted the iran deal killed some time back . 
  pompeo is heading cia and has been an opponent of the iranian deal and wants to , if anything , increase pressure on countries to impose pain on iran . 
   you think europeans are stupid enough to fall for it ? 
  i do n't think that you or anyone else is immune to propaganda . 
  or advertising , for that matter ... a lot of people seem to think that it does n't work on them . 
  now , whether or not banning is the right response is another question . 
  i 'll be damned , [ i think that you 're serious and not a parody ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/altright/comments/5h6nb9/do_we_agree_that_the_american_experiment_failed/ ) . 
  no doubt , but ... well , most people do n't really seem to * make * things much any more . 
  my grandfather and my father did woodworking and designed and built things if they needed something around the house . 
  but ... one effect of mass production is that usually you can get something that is just better and cheaper from a mass production line . 
  you do n't enjoy that sense of pride and satisfaction from having made something * real * that you use . 
  homebrewed alcohol is something that you made yourself . 
  so , hypothetically , i can defer puberty until , say , 30 and still have a normal puberty with normal development , just retaining a chilld 's body until then ? 
   transgenders are neither mentally ill , nor are they handicapped . 
  i think you need to go back to the roaring 20s when in psychology some thought lobotomy was the greatest treatment on the planet . 
  that question is a difficult one . 
  you can come up with semi-scientific rules , like saying `` does this condition interfere with/harm your life '' ? 
  `` harm '' itself is a bit of a fuzzy word , but i think that we could all agree that , say , becoming suicidal or murderous above some ill-defined level is harmful . 
  but a lot of it comes down to social norms . 
  in the us , a big chunk of the change happened when the [ dsm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diagnostic_and_statistical_manual_of_mental_disorders ) redefined homosexuality to not be a disease . 
  i regret that -- while it 's hard to say * who * exactly should determine social norms , the thing is really intended as a tool to deal with clinical issues . 
  i think that people have unfortunately shunted off the issue of determining social norms to it as a way to avoid difficult discussions and to make appeals to the authority of science . 
  i do n't think that that 's a fantastic route . 
  i think that a reasonable discussion should look more like `` does it hurt me if someone else has sex with someone of the same gender ? 
  will it cause generally-agreed-upon-to-be-negative effects in society ? '', 
  that 's the * sort * of conversation that i 'd like to see .
