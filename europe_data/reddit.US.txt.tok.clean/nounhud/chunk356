  i should point that out whenever people link to that sub . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jezebel  jezebel ( / \u02c8d\u0292\u025bz\u0259b\u0259l / , [ 1 ] hebrew : \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05d6\u05b6\u05d1\u05b6\u05dc / \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05d6\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05dc , modern iz\u00e9vel ' / ` iz\u00e1vel tiberian \u02be\u00cez\u00e9\u1e07el / \u02be\u00cez\u0101\u1e07el ) ( fl . 
  9th century bce ) was a queen , identified in the hebrew book of kings ( 1 kings 16:31 ) as the daughter of ithobaal i of sidon and the wife of ahab , king of israel . 
  [ 2 ]   according to the hebrew bible , jezebel incited her husband king ahab to abandon the worship of yahweh and encourage worship of the deities baal and asherah instead . 
  eh , sounds like this baal thing is more fun anyway . 
   in christian lore , a comparison to jezebel suggested that a person was a pagan or an apostate masquerading as a servant of god . 
  by manipulation and/or seduction , she misled the saints of god into sins of idolatry and sexual immorality . 
  [ 17 ] in particular , christians associated jezebel with promiscuity . 
  that 's pretty much the take on both / r/ukpolitics and / r/unitedkingdom . 
  specifically `` build ships and be the blockader instead of the blockadee '' . 
  cheaper than tying up a bunch of your land with agriculture . 
  does n't work , because that can also be explained by people choosing to come based on what 's on offer relative to their age . 
  you want to actually sanity check age via biometrics , or get the best approximation you can . 
  i * have * been wondering about your coffee table , though . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't think that this is a good approach , for the following reasons : * there 's no reason that a protest vote needs to have a particularly catastrophic outcome for the public as a whole . 
  it could be on any matter at all -- the only thing that characterizes it is that someone is voting to express their views on an issue other than the one literally written on the ballot . 
  there may be no serious negative outcome to a protest vote , or it may not affect the people who voted on it significantly . 
  * i 'm dubious that people are very good at connecting the effects of most policy decisions with those decisions . 
  i can think of a number of policies , like rent control , that are not-generally seen as being a good idea by experts , yet receive public support . 
  * it seems to me that people are good at finding explanations for things that fit with their political position . 
  in most countries , the public is split into a number of different political factions . 
  while each `` faction '' may have a more-or-less internally-self-consistent view on policies , and the fact that they have not reconciled themselves to a single common position makes me suspicious that the public rarely shifts as a whole . 
  if i say `` prices in london are high '' , i can have * the economist * telling me that it 's because of excess regulation and someone in / r/unitedkingdom telling me that it 's because businesses are greedy . 
  they 're talking about the same fact , but they 're fitting data to different interpretations . 
  * it may be very costly . 
  * some decisions are difficult to reverse . 
  the italian constitutional referendum is not , but brexit could -- depending upon implementation -- be . 
  * it seems to me that even if people regret a protest vote and swear off protest voting , that this is unlikely to change much . 
  the electorate is a snapshot of voters of a range of ages across a human lifetime , and there are always new young voters coming into the electorate and older ones dying off . 
  how many country-level referendums does a typical voter engage in in their lifetime ? 
  sure , in theory if everyone somehow `` learned '' not to protest vote after a single vote and if votes were held frequently enough , you could do it . 
  say each person votes on 100 referendums in their lifetime -- if everyone only protest-votes in a maximum of one vote , that 's just 1 % of the electorate potentially protest-voting in any one election . 
  if they only vote on two issues in their lifetime , however , you 're talking about 50 % of voters that might be protest voting . 
  * it 's often difficult to predict what would have happen if a different choice was made -- `` what if '' scenarios for countries are really speculative . 
  if i ca n't compare actual outcomes , it 's hard for me to know that the vote is actually consequential . 
   you do n't decide what a protest vote is , nor do you judge wether it is a problem no , i 'm not in a position to make an authoritative call . 
  but i can certainly have an opinion on the matter . 
  as i said in the post title , though , that 's not the angle that i 'm taking here -- i 'm avoiding arguing that point . 
   and least of all do you have the right to ` fix ' people 's votes . 
  if it turns out that a voting system is n't working the way people would like -- for example , perhaps people are using it to express opinions other than that of the voted item -- i think that many people would say that it could stand for improvement . 
  same way that someone might say that , for example , fptp has issues as a voting system . 
   sensationalist rags looking for page hits who put less effort in their articles than the average teenager in a facebook post . 
  well , i do n't agree with you on the effort issue . 
  they might be sensationalist , but my own bet is that if they are incorrect , it 's because either they are viewing the issue through a political lens or writing to appeal to people who are . 
   what gives you the right to question votes , let alone democratic systems ? 
  to discuss the prospect that might be protest votes or that democratic systems could be improved ? 
  anyone can do that . 
  i 'm assuming that your position is that they are not protest votes -- if so , that 's fine . 
  i mentioned that as a possibility , and i 'm simply echoing claims from various media sources saying that they were . 
   this is just the usual anglo-american euro-hate . 
  frankly , i think that you 'd find that the bulk of the us tracks eu goings-on rather little . 
  there have n't been any recent polls that i see -- as i said , it 's * really * not a topic of major public discussion -- but [ here 's a decade-old gallup poll ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/12043/americans-know-little-about-european-union.aspx ) saying that the overwhelming bulk of americans say that they know little or nothing about the european union and that if they have a position on it they generally see it as positive or irrelevant in world affairs , not a negative . 
  secondly , while the uk is much more-involved and does have much stronger positions on the matter , i 'd point out that there was just a very long and ardent argument in the uk over exactly this , which was came down to a split between 2 % of the voting population . 
  the population is roughly evenly split . 
  further , i do not normally see , say , the bbc or other institutions of the british government taking a euroskeptic position . 
  while there is certainly a euroskeptic population in the uk , i 'd point out that this is probably heavily-driven by immigration -- most eu members have not seen the level of intra-eu immigration that the uk has -- and that the us had similar ( if not more-severe ) backlashes during immigration waves in its past , including in response to [ internal immigration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okie#great_depression_usage ) . 
  i 'm very doubtful that most countries do better . 
  thirdly , of all the points to dismiss as `` anglo-american euro-hate '' , you chose a statement made by an official in the italian government ? 
  i mean , what do you want from either the uk or the us on this ? 
  that 's true , but at * least * search engines can work that out with context -- `` isis terrorism '' * probably * is n't talking about ancient egyptian goddesses . 
  `` is '' is just too universally-used for that to work . 
  even though `` isis '' has religious connotations , if i search for `` isis worship '' , i get links about isis , not isis . 
  yeah , but afaict there 's pretty much zero uptake there . 
  the media started with `` isil and seems to have moved to `` isis '' . 
  `` is '' would make life with search engines utterly miserable , like calling an organization `` and '' or `` i '' or `` the '' or something like that . 
  at this point , i think that there have been public threats against or conflict with pretty much every major military power out there , and military success against none of them . 
  realistically , you might manage to run a guerrilla campaign against one of the smaller countries and slowly wear them down , but this is just not going to work .

  so you 've already got in some kind of scrap with most of the substantial military powers in the world , and your territory is busily contracting . 
  you 've also threatened regional powers , like [ saudi arabia ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-threatens-saudi-arabia-islamic-state-says-it-will-destroy-prisons-holding-2251341 ) ( [ 2015 arar attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_arar_attack ) , [ mahasen mosque attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mahasen_mosque_attack ) , [ 2016 medina suicide bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_saudi_arabia_bombings ) ) . 
  if you 've already bitten off that much and you 've managed to be in conflict with all three of saudi arabia , iran , and turkey * at once * , you probably could do with scaling things down . 
  hmm ... wikipedia says that it changed ( that is , you were planning to fly the catobar-requiring f-35c when you were expecting to have the carriers be catobar , and switched to the stobar-capable f-35b when the carriers switched ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier  for a period following the 2010 strategic defence and security review , the government had intended to purchase the f-35c carrier variant and modify one carrier to use the catobar system to launch and recover these aircraft . 
  this was because the cheaper f-35c variant has a greater range and can carry a larger and more diverse payload than the f-35b . 
  [ 40 ] [ 67 ] on 10 may 2012 defence secretary philip hammond announced in parliament that the government had decided to revert to its predecessor 's plans to purchase the f-35b rather than the f-35c , and to abandon the completion of prince of wales to a catobar configuration . 
  [ 41 ] the reason given was that `` conversion to ` cats and traps ' will cost about double what was originally estimated -- and would not be delivered until 2023 at the earliest . '', 
  wow , that 's an unforgiving design . 
  if you screw up your landing , your plane is going directly into the intake of a massive turbine . 
  wow , that 's an unforgiving design . 
  if you screw up your landing , your plane is going directly into the intake of a massive turbine . 
  because it ca n't be heading into the wind to cut the speed-relative-to-the-deck of the aircraft ? 
  i dunno , is that still a factor on modern-day ships with jets ? 
  the percentage of airspeed that you shave off ca n't be nearly as much as it once was . 
  i suspect that a significant chunk of russia not operating an `` aircraft carrier '' and instead operating a `` heavy cruiser '' is due to the [ montreaux convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_straits ) rather than due to some deep desire to classify the ships accurately as-regards actual role :  although the montreux convention is cited by the turkish government as prohibiting aircraft carriers in the straits , [ 16 ] the treaty actually contains no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers . 
  however , modern aircraft carriers are heavier than the 15,000 ton limit , making it impossible for non-black sea powers to transit modern aircraft carriers through the straits . 
    under article 11 , black sea states are permitted to transit capital ships of any tonnage through the straits , but annex ii specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ship . 
  in 1936 , it was common for battleships to carry observation aircraft . 
  therefore , aircraft carriers were defined as ships that were `` designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of carrying and operating aircraft at sea . '', 
  the inclusion of aircraft on any other ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier . 
  [ 17 ]   to take advantage of this exception , the soviet union designated its kiev-class and kuznetsov-class aircraft carriers as `` aircraft carrying cruisers . '', 
  the aircraft carriers were armed with p-500 and p-700 cruise missiles , which were also found on the slava-class cruiser and the kirov-class battlecruiser . 
  the result of this is that the soviet navy could send its aircraft cruisers through the straits in compliance with the convention , while at the same time the convention denied access to nato aircraft carriers , which exceeded the 15,000 ton limit .
