  [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]   turkey chose to accept the designation of the soviet aircraft carriers as aircraft cruisers . 
  any revision of the montreux convention could leave turkey with less control over the turkish straits . 
  the un convention on the law of the sea had already established more liberal passage through other straits . 
  by allowing the soviet aircraft cruisers to transit the straits , turkey could leave the more restrictive montreux convention in place . 
  i realize that you probably are using `` army '' as a generic for `` military '' , but just pointing out that the jets lost here were probably part of the [ russian navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_navy ) rather than the [ russian army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_ground_forces ) . 
  people should continue using `` isis '' . 
  `` is '' is useless as a search keyword .

  the 12k aircraft losses is n't just from carrier landing accidents -- that 's in total . 
   you 'd think they 'd spend the time when it 's idle just practising landing on it it looks like it 's spent some time in [ dry dock ] ( https://warisboring.com/russias-creaky-old-aircraft-carrier-is-up-to-something-strange-d05d5d9a927c#.7wcupvmdr ) . 
  what the us did [ during world war ii when it could n't spare training time on its front-line carriers was convert a pair of ships into dedicated freshwater training carriers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_wolverine_%28ix-64%29 ) . 
   ca n't say i am surprised , the us had its fair share of carrier related incidents and their pilots have been perfecting it for over half a century . 
  https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/76679e75-3a49-4bf5-854a-b0696e575e0a/the-u-s--navy-s-transition-to-jets  between 1949 , the year jets started showing up in the fleet in numbers , and 1988 , the year their combined mishap rate finally got down to air force levels , the navy and marine corps lost almost twelve thousand airplanes of all types ( helicopters , trainers , and patrol planes , in addition to jets ) and over 8,500 aircrew , in no small part as a result of these issues . 
  [ snip ]  today , the accident rate is normally one or less per hundred thousand hours of flight time , making mishaps an unusual occurrence . 
  this is in stark contrast to the landmark year of 1954 , when naval aviation ( that is , navy and marine combined ) lost 776 aircraft and 535 crew , for an accident rate well above fifty per hundred thousand flight hours -- and the rate for carrier-based tactical aviation was much higher than that . 
  well , that 'd make iran happy , at any rate . 
  i 'd say `` liberal '' , not `` leftward '' . 
  he also screwed over legitimate soviet scientists like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikolai_vavilov  it was not until later when he was under pressure from the soviet state that vavilov began to criticize the non-mendelian concepts of trofim lysenko , who won the support of joseph stalin . 
  as a result , vavilov was arrested on august 6 , 1940 , while on an expedition to ukraine . 
  he was sentenced to death in july 1941 . 
  in 1942 his sentence was commuted to twenty years ' imprisonment ; he died in prison in 1943 , [ 11 ] of starvation . 
  yeah , i thought the same thing , but my hot button was this whole `` annexing european territory '' thing , not mattis . 
  i 'm increasingly dubious that sanctions ending will happen , though . 
  trump has n't been talking about it recently -- it 's been putin raising the issue . 
  it was n't a core promise of trump 's campaign . 
  it did n't show up on his first 100 days plan . 
  he avoided ever specifically talking about sanctions . 
  any major actions will be going through a lot of people in the bureaucracy who are very much going to advise against such a shift -- if anything , obama was relatively-dovish , with real criticisms coming out about his willingness to go into syria . 
  and trump has showed an unprecedented degree of disinterest in following up on things that he 's said to date . 
  also , to the extent that anything can be inferred from cabinet picks , trump has chosen a decidedly-hostile-to-iran cabinet , and that probably wo n't make for a terribly-friendly situation with russia . 
  mattis , the most recent pick , does n't have a russia-friendly history , either . 
   newsflash : most countries only care about themselves it would be nice if russia would care about russian territory instead of ukrainian territory . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/8832b0ea-b33b-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0 * ft * 's take is that as long as trump and merkel do n't break ranks , neither will fillon . 
  based on google , i assume that it 's an allusion to [ * red heat * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095963/ ) . 
  well , in all fairness , chechnya 's part of the russian federation . 
  russia would probably be about as enthusiastic about it being cut away as ukraine is having russia chewing on crimea and donbas ...

  http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/02/252113.htm  secretary kerry announced today that the united states is providing nearly $ 601 million in additional life-saving humanitarian assistance for those affected by the war in syria . 
  this new funding brings u.s. humanitarian assistance in response to this conflict to more than $ 5.1 billion since the start of the crisis . 
  what we have n't been doing is taking in refugees in anything like the kind of numbers germany has . 
  iirc after a lot of tugging , we got pulled up to 17k for 2016 . 
  to be fair , that is showing the relative share of * part * of nato ( damned if i know what the criteria is for inclusion ) . 
  all the large ones appear to be there except turkey , but there 's still a slice that is n't shown . 
   also how the hell does the usa support that ... http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160415170401-nato-gdp-2-780x439.jpg, 
  that is true , and in the event of a multi-front world war ( like world war ii ) , some of those resources would not be available in europe . 
  still , * barring * that , if things do get serious , it is possible to redirect a lot of presently-overseas resources there -- resources going to build and maintain physical infrastructure in east asia , would n't be , but soldiers , aircraft , naval vessels and so forth can . 
  the vast bulk of us soldiers are on the us mainland , for example , but if the shit-hits-the-fan in europe , they are n't likely to be simply idly sitting in the us .

  there is n't an automatic right-to-work in the us , though ( unlike the uk and germany ) .

   both sides hate him for being weak , spineless , behaving like a rotten oyster on the world stage i think that part of the problem is that it was his position of political weakness that made it hard for him to take a leadership role in europe and in the world . 
  ca n't do controversial things if you 're worried about re-election . 
  merkel , as i understand it , did n't have any realistic challenges to her office , so she could take a stronger position . 
  in summary : i think that this is basically too-vague in its form to be actionable for companies and individuals . 
  i simply can not know whether something i am doing will violate it or not . 
  if i understand correctly , the goal here is to shift authority from member country level to eu level . 
  i agree with this in at least some cases . 
  i think that a legislature probably has to hash out the details before something like this enters into force . 
  these are so broad and overarching that it 's nearly-impossible for a company to know whether its actions might run afoul of it . 
  i do not think that tying together the grant of authority and the specific guarantees is the best way to do this -- it hands an immense wad of power to the ecj and creates huge uncertainty , if i understand this correctly . 
  in the us , if you wanted to move something from state to federal level , someone would propose a constitutional amendment . 
  three-quarters of the state legislatures would need to agree . 
  at that point , the amendment comes into force , and the states cede control over the item to the federal government . 
  it would * probably * say something like `` the federal legislature shall have the authority to pass laws on this issue '' , rather than detailing all the fine points itself -- that is , the grant of power would be independent from the legislation in question . 
  * then * the legislature would create the laws ( which would be specific-enough to be something that one could take action on ) . 
  you could look at , say , the [ eighteenth amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eighteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) , which federalized authority , and the separate [ volstead act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volstead_act ) , which used that authority to establish the precise rules . 
  it may be that i am unfamiliar with the eu 's processes here , and that there is some other mechanism involved or some reason why this is not necessary . 
  what it * seems * to me is the case , though , is that the idea is to let members retain legislative authority in the area , but then to let the ecj push them back into line if it thinks that they have crossed the boundaries . 
  however , it seems to me that this three-stage process makes more sense : 1 . 
  member states agree to move authority over an item to the eu level . 
  they still will retain input on the item , but only as a member -- they wo n't have absolute control over it within their borders . 
  the ep uses that authority to establish new laws . 
  these laws may be evaluated by the ecj . 
  again , this may just be due to a misunderstanding of eu process on my part ... but if my understanding is correct , it really does seem like having a tight , understandable set of expectations for companies and non-commercial organizations and individuals in advance is much preferable to them having to guess whether-or-not an action is legitimate , take it , and maybe be whacked by the ecj . 
  [ continued from parent ]  work remains an important foundation of life support and self-realization . 
  not specific to the digital world . 
   effective employment protection must be ensured in the digital age . 
  all right , this is a contemporary issue . 
  it seems to me that this warrants its own document too , and this is * exceedingly * vague on a critical issue -- it 's hard to know whether to buy into this . 
  it could range from requiring employers to put money in escrow to spend $ n on retraining if the industry fails to having the government keep defunct industries alive just to make work available , which could be fantastically-expensive . 
  i do not think that this is a solved problem . 
  i was reading about how us federally-funded retraining was not very successful a while back . 
  i think that it would make more sense to , rather than start guaranteeing rights , to instead fund an organization with the target of ensuring that unemployment/underemployment above a certain age falls below a certain level and to deal with automation or shift in demand .
