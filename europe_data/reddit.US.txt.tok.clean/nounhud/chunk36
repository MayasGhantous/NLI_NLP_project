  more speakers , and will probably matter more than it does today given china 's economic growth . 
  on the other hand , the writing system is disconnected from the spoken system , which makes it expensive to learn the writing system -- it 's like having to learn an extra language . 
  the language is fragmented , even if it 's classified as a single language -- some parts of china can not easily communicate with other parts . 
  i am less-bullish on this than i once was . 
  * spanish . 
  big in the americas , and more people have it as their first language . 
  however , the spanish-speaking world is substantially less-well-developed than the english-speaking world . 
  at one point , i thought that hindi would be another possibility , but i spoke to some folks from india about this for a while -- english is really the * lingua franca * in southern and more-developed india , and hindi in the northern bits . 
  arabic has [ worse fragmentation ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/06/arabic ) than mandarin chinese .

  i 'm curious whether english will change , though . 
  i think that at least use of a `` simplified '' english would make sense . 
  attempts at totally synthetic languages have fallen hard , but people * have * changed existing natural languages successfully . 
  that 's a pretty big problem . 
  most people in the us ( including myself , until reading this forum ) do n't know that `` east '' and `` west '' or `` north '' or `` south '' or `` central '' have any kind of status meanings in europe . 
  i 'm pretty sure that people in the us mostly-still use the [ divisions from the cold war ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/cold_war_alliances_mid-1975.svg ) , since that is overwhelmingly what `` eastern europe '' referred to in all kinds of media , and what people are familiar with . 
  `` eastern europe '' is n't a zing , but rather a geographical location . 
  that 's not to say that i ca n't understand where you 're coming from , because the `` south '' ( capitalized , modern-day us southeast ) has had some sort of similar connotations . 
  just that the meaning associated with `` eastern europe '' does n't exist in the us , or the idea that describing a country as being in eastern europe would be offensive . 
  ... kind of similarly , i was utterly unaware that the idea of visa-free travel from a particular country was a status symbol in europe until i saw people here become absolutely * outraged * over the idea of french visa-free travel to the us being suspended after the terrorist attacks -- europeans cross national borders a lot , and i guess that the best-off countries in europe tended to get visa-free travel easily , so not having visa-free status is , in europe , i guess kind of like saying that someone is * better * than someone else . 
  it 's just a car bomb . 
  [ the uk used to have a ton of those a couple decades back ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_bombings_during_the_northern_ireland_troubles_and_peace_process ) . 
  some people are getting a bit end-of-the-world about turkey over it . 
  that being said , i am unhappy to see this happening . 
   arrogant ignorant american you guys should really popularize a new term , then , because `` eastern europe '' has had a different definition at at * least * one point in time , and unless massive , globally-influential things suddenly happen in the region and keep it in the news , it 's likely that the older terms will continue . 
  we call ohio part of the [ midwest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midwestern_united_states ) , even though ohio has n't been anywhere near part of the western us for about a century and a half . 
  < eyeroll  if the author is right ( which i 'm awfully dubious about , because i do n't think that eastern europe is some sheltered waif ) , sounds like eastern europe now has a more-realist picture of the world . 
  great , everyone wins . 
   if trump becomes president of the world 's greatest democracy -- or if someone like le pen accedes to power in france -- the new and aspiring democracies will irrevocably lose a critical reference point and a driver of their own aspirations . 
  we 're not going to change the president that we elect because * not * doing so would somehow help maintain some illusion in eastern europe . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  whether-or-not trump is a good candidate , the us has had opposition to immigration in the past that makes trump look like nothing . 
  if eastern europe actually sees trump as harming `` aspirations '' , that 's fine -- they can set their own successful example for us . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i would guess that the uk public would say . 
  that 's also almost exactly what the [ australia thread on the question was saying ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/4a6ees/australia_canada_nz_and_uk_support_eustyle_free/ ) that someone linked to . 
  / u/mike _ blomkvist deleted a bunch of his posts now ( which makes it even harder to see what i was arguing about ) , but the gist of his posts ( at least as i understood it ) was that it would n't be * possible * to have free movement between the uk and nz/ca/au because doing so would be politically-incorrect because those countries are `` majority white '' members of the commonwealth , and other countries that were n't would not be included , so britain could never be part of such an arrangement . 
  he raised the `` majority white '' concern as a issue of political correctness -- i just saw that as an extremely-unlikely objection . 
  that being said , maybe there are good reasons not to have free movement between those countries -- i just do n't think that that his particular objection is very plausible . 
  for you not to be able to do so , someone must be objecting . 
  i can understand a claim that something is politically unacceptable with some group of people who could veto such an arrangement . 
  that seems plausible to me . 
  however , i 'm saying `` okay , now what is that group ? '', 
  and i 've heard that it is n't australia 's public , is n't new zealand 's public , and is n't canada 's public . 
  so it 's got ta be that the british public would say `` yeah , as we said in the poll , we 'd like to have free movement ... but we feel that the embarrassment of not including other countries would outweigh the benefits of that free movement , so we ca n't do it '' , as that 's the only option left . 
  i 'm saying that that does n't seem at all realistic to me -- the uk has been cutting deals that look like this with numerous other similar groups without batting an eye . 
  i think that you think that i said the opposite of what i said . 
  / u/mike _ blomkvist was saying that it would be politically-unacceptable for the brits to be in a free movement association with ca , nz , and au because those countries were `` majority white '' , and that it would n't be acceptable for the uk to have freedom of movement agreements with these because such an agreement would n't be including other commonwealth members that were * not * `` majority white '' . 
  i asked him whether he thought the public of those countries would object , and he said that no , * they * could be in an association together , but that the uk could n't . 
  my point was that i can not imagine the british public objecting to freedom of movement with au , nz , and ca because those countries are not more multiracial than is the case . 
  your post itself is an example of what i was saying was the case in the uk -- you were saying `` i 'd be * just fine * with au , nz , and ca free movement that excludes india . '', 
  to repeat my [ post below ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4a8qos/australia_canada_nz_and_uk_support_eustyle_free/d0yh04q ) :  < headscratch  you 're saying that the objection would come from the uk 's public , then ? 
  i 'm trying to imagine this ...   canada , nz , and australia come forward and say `` yeah , sounds pretty good . 
  we 've gone over it in detail , and aside from a few small things to work out ... * < in the background , quebec yelling ` french receives equal standing in all areas with english '  * ... we 're on board . 
  so , shall we begin ? '', 
    uk : yeah ... turns out that we thought that it might be a good idea , but it turns out that we want nigeria in . 
    au-ca-nz : wait , what ? 
  why ? 
  nigeria 's incredibly-poor and overpopulated . 
  europe was already complaining about illegal immigration from nigeria . 
  there have been civil wars , there 's serious ethnic separatism going on , religious conflict , absolute certainty that all hundred-and-eighty-two-million people would leave as soon as they could escape ... that place is a disaster . 
    uk : well ... we just feel that it would be * awkward * otherwise . 
  i mean , you guys are majority white , right ? 
    au-ca-nz : yes . 
    nz : well , two-thirds of us ...   uk : so , you can see how this might be offensive . 
  ca n't really have a union that permits for free movement without a more multiracial mix . 
  would just be embarrassing . 
    au : are n't those the same lines that your free movement agreement between wales , england , scotland , and northern ireland follows today ? 
    ca : and your free movement agreement with the republic of ireland ? 
    nz : and your free movement agreement with the eu ? 
    uk : well , yes , but i mean that we could n't do it with * you * . 
  that would be offensive . 
    not gon na lie to you , i just have a hard time seeing this conversation happening . 
   if the eu is acceptable -- and the eu could be pretty-accurately renamed `` the union of white-majority countries that were n't british colonies '' -- to the brits in terms of political correctness , i ca n't imagine the british public objecting to free movement with countries that happen to be in the commonwealth on the grounds that they happen to be majority-white .

  's fair enough , and i agree that it seems likely that the realms existence is simply a matter of political politeness among many friendly-to-the-uk countries . 
  let me rephrase -- it seems to me that it is possible for canada , uk , nz , and australia to establish a free movement zone without including nigeria if they so wanted , and it does not seem to me to be difficult to sell this to any of the respective publics . 
  that may not be in the * uk * 's interests , since it seems to me like it would create a lot of regulatory issues with eu membership , and joking above aside , i 'm not clear that those countries would want to become eu members . 
  but politically-possible ? 
  sure , why not ?
