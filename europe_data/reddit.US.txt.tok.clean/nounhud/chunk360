  is this a positive right , where government must subsidize to smooth out economic differences ? 
  if someone lives in french guiana , are they required to have the same throughput available for the same price as someone living in berlin ? 
  how does this interact with existing hate speech regulation ? 
   the use of automated procedures must not lead to the exclusion of people from access to goods , services or participation in social life . 
  this applies in particular to health , protection from elementary life risks , right to work , right to housing , right to freedom of movement , and to the judiciary and the police . 
  i assume that this is aimed at reassurance for people whose jobs are threatened by automation . 
  it might be desirable to * control * that rate , but i do n't think that people should be guaranteed that the state or companies prevent jobs from being automated at all , or it may seriously hamper europe 's ability to economically-compete . 
   ( 1 ) in the digital age , internal and external security is threatened in a new way . 
  in the exercise of the responsibility for the protection of the state , strict legal limits must be observed . 
  seems redundant -- this is just saying `` laws must be followed '' , yes ? 
  surely that would already have been the case . 
   ( 2 ) security authorities shall not access private data . 
  exceptions are only permissible on the legal basis for the protection of particularly important legal goods . 
  i 've never liked loopholes like this that might obsolete the guarantee entirely , but from what i 've read of constitutions and similar documents in europe , this kind of `` soft '' guarantee is a lot more common over there , so this may just be a difference in approach . 
   ( 3 ) massless monitoring is not carried out . 
  the translation is bad here . 
  i do n't know whether this is `` baseless '' monitoring ( as in , monitoring without a warrant ) or `` electronic '' monitoring . 
  the former * might * be viable , but seems excessively-broad -- for example , that would seem to ban , say , traffic cameras . 
  the latter seems too broad . 
   ( 4 ) weapon systems may not be fully automated . 
  i would be more-specific . 
  for example , does an `` on/off '' switch suffice ? 
  does someone have to take action at every point in time ? 
  do the rules change when at war ? 
  what about defensive systems ? 
  i can understand establishing certain `` lines '' that everyone can agree on , like standardizing the degree to which long-range missile systems require human authorization . 
  i am a lot less-sanguine about placing restrictions on point-defense systems like [ phalanx ciws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phalanx_ciws ) , [ tunguska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2k22_tunguska ) , [ ds30m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30mm_ds30m_mark_2_automated_small_calibre_gun ) , [ meroka ciws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meroka_ciws ) , [ goalkeeper ciws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goalkeeper_ciws ) , [ gdm-008 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rheinmetall_oerlikon_millennium_gun ) , and similar . 
  my belief here is that the goal is to avoid unbounded automated escalation . 
  for example , a small glitch causes a robot to act , which causes a larger counter-reaction , which causes a larger counter-reaction , and so forth , and within the hour , a nuclear world war iii is underway , with limited human involvement . 
  i think that this is a technically-complex task that would be better served by an international , un-level treaty . 
  * first , the action taken here should be bilateral between potential opponents , not unilateral , since the main incentive to do this is that one 's opponent might also do it . 
  * second , this is of limited value in avoiding automated escalation unless both sides coordinate specifically how to avoid escalation , draw specific lines . 
  * third , it may make more sense to agree on bans on weapons that take effect and * require * very fast reactions in response , like use of laser weapons . 
  it may make sense to require that automated response may not exceed weapons that give a particular range or a particular destructive power . 
  it may make sense to require actors to describe in response what they would consider an action requiring automated escalation ( e.g. 
  `` any projectiles traveling towards this ship at more than x speed and reaching y range may permit for an automated response '' ) . 
  basically , i do n't think that a document on civil rights guarantees , where being unilateral is fine , is a good place for commitments on weapons . 
   everyone has the right to freely express his opinion in the digital world . 
  a censorship does not take place . 
  i like the idea . 
  i 'm going to be honest -- a document on digital rights is almost certainly * not * the place to change european policy on hate or political speech . 
  there is no reason to tie this to electronic communication . 
  if europe wants to say `` you are guaranteed the right to advocate for communism '' , it makes no sense for that to be online only . 
  further , i do n't think that that right should be bundled up with a lot of these other things -- it 's too important . 
  if the eu wants a declaration of freedom of speech , let that stand on its own . 
  it 's not just keeping up with technological change . 
   ( 2 ) digital incitement , bullying and activities which are likely to seriously jeopardize a person 's reputation or integrity shall be prevented . 
  this -- in particular the `` jeopardize a person 's reputation '' -- is almost * certainly * more-restrictive than the current state of affairs . 
  i 'm not enthusiastic about that , and i 'd suggest that people carefully consider the consequences . 
  does accusing a corrupt politician of corruption jeopardize his reputation ? 
   ( 3 ) a plural public discourse space is to be ensured . 
  sounds grand , but not concrete . 
  what does this actually wind up meaning ? 
  can private forums be moderated , for example ? 
   ( 4 ) public bodies and operators of information and communication services are obliged to ensure compliance with paragraphs 1 , 2 and 3 . 
  i do n't know if the eu has us-style [ common carrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_carrier ) status , but normally in the us , telcos can simply disclaim responsibility for the specifics of communications unless they are made aware of an issue . 
  that is , they have no obligation to actively-monitor for these . 
  i think that if this is not the case , it may place a heavy burden on telecommunication operators -- it is not clear to me whether this is compatible with such a status . 
   profiling by government agencies or private is only permitted on a legal basis . 
  i do n't understand the point of this . 
  surely it was already the case that laws needed to be followed ? 
  edit : maybe this is a politically-acceptable way to sneak in an explicit guarantee that profiling is explicitly allowed ?
