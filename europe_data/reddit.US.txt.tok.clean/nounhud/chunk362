  my belief here is that the goal is to avoid unbounded automated escalation . 
  for example , a small glitch causes a robot to act , which causes a larger counter-reaction , which causes a larger counter-reaction , and so forth , and within the hour , a nuclear world war iii is underway , with limited human involvement . 
  i think that this is a technically-complex task that would be better served by an international , un-level treaty . 
  * first , the action taken here should be bilateral between potential opponents , not unilateral , since the main incentive to do this is that one 's opponent might also do it . 
  * second , this is of limited value in avoiding automated escalation unless both sides coordinate specifically how to avoid escalation , draw specific lines . 
  * third , it may make more sense to agree on bans on weapons that take effect and * require * very fast reactions in response , like use of laser weapons . 
  it may make sense to require that automated response may not exceed weapons that give a particular range or a particular destructive power . 
  it may make sense to require actors to describe in response what they would consider an action requiring automated escalation ( e.g. 
  `` any projectiles traveling towards this ship at more than x speed and reaching y range may permit for an automated response '' ) . 
  basically , i do n't think that a document on civil rights guarantees , where being unilateral is fine , is a good place for commitments on weapons . 
   everyone has the right to freely express his opinion in the digital world . 
  a censorship does not take place . 
  i like the idea . 
  i 'm going to be honest -- a document on digital rights is almost certainly * not * the place to change european policy on hate or political speech . 
  there is no reason to tie this to electronic communication . 
  if europe wants to say `` you are guaranteed the right to advocate for communism '' , it makes no sense for that to be online only . 
  further , i do n't think that that right should be bundled up with a lot of these other things -- it 's too important . 
  if the eu wants a declaration of freedom of speech , let that stand on its own . 
  it 's not just keeping up with technological change . 
   ( 2 ) digital incitement , bullying and activities which are likely to seriously jeopardize a person 's reputation or integrity shall be prevented . 
  this -- in particular the `` jeopardize a person 's reputation '' -- is almost * certainly * more-restrictive than the current state of affairs . 
  i 'm not enthusiastic about that , and i 'd suggest that people carefully consider the consequences . 
  does accusing a corrupt politician of corruption jeopardize his reputation ? 
   ( 3 ) a plural public discourse space is to be ensured . 
  sounds grand , but not concrete . 
  what does this actually wind up meaning ? 
  can private forums be moderated , for example ? 
   ( 4 ) public bodies and operators of information and communication services are obliged to ensure compliance with paragraphs 1 , 2 and 3 . 
  i do n't know if the eu has us-style [ common carrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_carrier ) status , but normally in the us , telcos can simply disclaim responsibility for the specifics of communications unless they are made aware of an issue . 
  that is , they have no obligation to actively-monitor for these . 
  i think that if this is not the case , it may place a heavy burden on telecommunication operators -- it is not clear to me whether this is compatible with such a status . 
   profiling by government agencies or private is only permitted on a legal basis . 
  i do n't understand the point of this . 
  surely it was already the case that laws needed to be followed ?
