  [ here 's a random reddit user who i just chose from the_donald submitters ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/coontzcontrolreddit ) -- a throwaway account that ran for three months . 
  ordinarily , i 'd say `` this is just an election account '' -- it 's advocacy , pushing short , repetitive talking points , and not getting in any conversations . 
  it claims that the poster is a supporter of other , similar candidates who also liked trump -- something you 'd do if to pull people off those other candiates . 
  ordinarily , i 'd call that an advocacy account ... but just one for the elections . 
  but it also pushes some decidedly unorthodox foreign policy and `` do n't trust your government or your country 's news media '' material . 
  the foreign policy in particular ( `` do n't trust the eu , do n't trust nato , do n't trust turkey , do n't trust saudi arabia , split with them , ally with russia '' ) is quite odd for an account intended to promote us elections -- foreign policy is not normally something that is a major concern in us elections . 
  so , i 'd at least consider the possibility that this is legitimately one of said astroturfing accounts :  [ the polls are rigged .

  saudi arabia are our enemy and we ca n't pretend we 're allies . 
  we need to force them to deal with their humanitarian crisis , and we ca n't support the largest state sponsor of terrorism .

  we 're in seven wars at the moment , and trump wants to get us out of these wars so we can focus on what 's best for our nation .

  trump has always been supportive of bernie and the only republican candidate better than him was rand paul .

  http://www.acea.be/statistics/tag/category/average-vehicle-age  cars in the european union are on average 9.73 years old . 
  that seems like germany is about on-par with the rest of the eu . 
  leave did not run on such a proposal . 
  mind , i do not think that it would have ( politically ) been in leave 's interest to do so . 
  cameron made a serious error by permitting leave to combine multiple , incompatible leave options in the referendum , and from the standpoint of running a successful campaign , leave had every reason to take advantage of that unwise decision . 
  a better question would be why the public and press did not demand such a specific proposal from leave .
