  anyway , while i do not think that it would be advantageous for leave to have run on a proposal , what i was getting at was that the `` it was up to the government to make a plan '' excuse seems to me to be a pretty silly claim . 
  does the uk not have think tanks and the like ? 
  i mean , the government is hardly the only organization in the world that can prepare a proposal . 
  yes , they may not have the access to confidential information that the british government does , and perhaps they might miss some details , but come on . 
  you can not tell me that the only organization in the world that can provide a high-level proposal for brexit beyond `` leave the eu '' is the government . 
  who proposes the uk 's legislation ? 
  surely not just the government . 
   there is no continent `` america . '', 
  [ actually , the definition of `` continent '' is surprisingly malleable around the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent ) . 
   the six-continent combined-america model is used in france and its former colonies , italy , portugal , spain , romania , [ citation needed ] latin america , [ 27 ] and greece . 
  [ 18 ] --  in contrast , there are many `` united states of ... '' i think that it 's only mexico , actually . 
   ... but it does identify such established left-wing , libertarian and right-wing sites as the naked capitalism blog , zero hedge and drudge report as conduits for russian propaganda . 
  * zero hedge * is an [ * extremely * disreputable blog ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/zero_hedge ) . 
  i think that most self-respecting libertarians would object to it being called `` established libertarian '' . 
  if you want a respectable us right-libertarian outlet , look at the more-highbrow [ cato institute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cato_institute ) ( [ website ] ( https://www.cato.org/ ) ) , or maybe the more-pop-appeal [ * reason * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reason_%28magazine%29 ) . 
  not , for the love of god , * zero hedge * . 
  that thing is on par with * infowars * and other complete-and-utter bullshit conspiracy sites . 
   donald trump 's pick for national security adviser , michael flynn , asked about his regular appearances on rt , seemed unable to tell the difference between the russian state channel and cnn . 
  yeah , i 've been exceedingly unimpressed with what i 've seen of flynn . 
   the eu is led by people who 'd rather side with saudi arabia headchoppers than russia . 
  perhaps whether-or-not there are people who cut off someone 's head somewhere in a country is n't the primary geopolitical driver for alliances and partnerships ? 
  hell , i like you guys , and you 've got some sheepshaggers somewhere ... 
   i think our two systems are so different , you do n't really can compare it . 
  hmm . 
  that 's a good point . 
  it looks like the savings rate is based on disposable income rather than discretionary income , so systems where fewer services are tax-funded * would * indeed have a lower apparent savings rate . 
  a savings rate that uses discretionary income instead , to avoid differences in how much the state pays for services , might be interesting ... but then that would exclude rent/house payments , and that seems like something that * should * be compared . 
  < sigh   as much as i know , in the us you get your full salery and have to pay the taxes by your own ( or am i wrong ? ) . 
  ehh ... that gets complicated . 
  normally , [ since world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_withholding_in_the_united_states ) , not in practice . 
  for most people , an employer estimates how much you owe in income tax and withholds that . 
  your income taxes at the end of the year involve simply cleaning up any difference from how much should have been paid . 
  however , that is n't * mandatory * -- you could ask the employer to withhold nothing -- and you 'd need to handle paying in full . 
   for business owners this was a bonus payment originally and did not have payroll taxes associated . 
  so it was a hack to give employees higher salaries without paying higher payroll taxes . 
  ahhhh ... okay . 
  this sounds like employer-provided health insurance becoming the norm in the us back when employers [ started doing so to avoid fdr 's world war ii-era wage caps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stabilization_act_of_1942 ) . 
  it had no real point * after * the caps were removed , but by then it had become convention , so that nobody wanted to accept a salaried job without the employer including a health insurance package ... and it became unthinkable to move away from it . 
  us salary-paying jobs normally pay an even salary year-round , no additional month of salary reserved for winter or summer . 
  i got ta say that i do n't totally understand the process of reserving extra salaries for particular times of the year . 
  in the long run , you 're going to be paying people a constant amount anyway . 
  unless someone lives hand-to-mouth and can not save , it does n't seem to have much benefit to have an employer regulating income for times when one might have more expenses . 
  furthermore , europeans -- with a few exceptions , like denmark -- are [ decidedly better than americans at saving their earnings ] ( https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/916lqg-household-saving-rates?page=2 ) . 
  so what 's the rationale for not just splitting things up into 12 salaries ? 
  is it that an employer could legally not pay the 13th and 14th if it hits hard times without violating employment contracts ? 
  edit : typo fix : rationale for * not * just splitting things up into 12 salaries . 
   well , i tell you , it wo n't be the unemployable young who are going to pay . 
  they 've played a significant role in japan ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/as-japan-strains-to-care-for-elderly-sacrifices-begin/2012/04/28/giqau10cnt_story.html ) :  and the potential tax hike is only a sneak preview of the burdens to come as japan grows into the world 's grayest society , a nation where two decades from now seniors will outnumber children 15 and younger by nearly 4 to 1 . 
    economists and government officials say that japan , in the coming years , will probably raise the retirement age , again increase taxes and trim spending on everything from education to defense , all to care for its elderly . 
    young japanese -- those entering the workforce amid two decades of stagnation -- will face the greatest burden : they will earn less in real terms than their parents , pay higher pension premiums , receive fewer social services and , eventually , retire with a less-generous pension package . 
    and that 's the best-case scenario , experts say , possible only if a notoriously fractious government succeeds in pushing through a series of unpopular measures . 
  the longer one waits , the less-possible it is to have the older chunk of the population cover the gap . 
  one issue at a time -- too-low fertility before skill-to-available-jobs-mismatch . 
  the skill-to-jobs mismatch * is * being addressed to at least some degree by rising education levels in the developed world * and * rising wages in the poorer parts of the world . 
  those will ultimately bound it . 
  edit : well , okay , someday we 're gon na have to figure out human-level ai , but that 's likely to change all sorts of things , so-dramatically that it 's hard to predict exactly what will happen to society . 
  and [ that -- friendly ai -- is a whole complicated field unto itself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friendly_artificial_intelligence ) . 
  well , a [ * logan 's run * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logan%27s_run ) - type scenario would n't be genocide , since it 'd be past the point of reproduction , and would be universal rather than tied to any of the criteria for a qualifying group being targeted . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide#international_law  the cppcg was adopted by the un general assembly on 9 december 1948 and came into effect on 12 january 1951 ( resolution 260 ( iii ) ) . 
  it contains an internationally recognized definition of genocide which has been incorporated into the national criminal legislation of many countries , and was also adopted by the rome statute of the international criminal court , which established the international criminal court ( icc ) . 
  article ii of the convention defines genocide as :    ... any of the following acts committed ** with intent to destroy ** , in whole or in part , a ** national , ethnical , racial or religious group ** ... 
   well done ladies . 
  hmm . 
  what evidence do you have that this is due to female preference ? 
  what if it 's due to male preference ? 
  that would seem to me to be equally-compatible with the data , unless you think that women commonly lie about having taken birth control pills to have children when their partner does not want them ( which seems like a really good way to have an unhappy relationship , and seems like something that most women would want to avoid ... ), 
  does n't really answer the question unless you also know what percentage of women living in england and wales arrived there from abroad . 
  ( also , keep in mind that there may be significant differences in age . ), 
   and the majority of our population is also `` not crucial or important '' . 
  if you reduce population , you also reduce demand for that labor . 
  i suspect that you 'd find that the demand is pretty proportional to the population . 
  it 's not as if europe has some sort of fixed number of job slots and that reducing population leaves that fixed number unchanged . 
  what europe ( and the us , and probably all highly-developed countries today ) have is a skill mismatch between jobs that countries need people to be doing and what skillset people actually have . 
  if you cut the population in half , but retain that same proportion of mismatch , you 're still likely to see the same issues . 
  that is , it 's unlikely that a us with half the population would suddenly require a significantly-higher proportion of low-skill jobs . 
  i will concede that there are cases where that is * not * true . 
  for example , in an ideal world , you will always mine the n most-productive deposits of a material . 
  that means that as you increase the number of miners , productivity falls off . 
  this is known as the [ law of diminishing returns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_diminishing_returns ) . 
  however , i really doubt that this dominates in the us , which is relatively-sparsely-populated , and if these pressures show up in the us , it 's unlikely that europe reducing population density to a us density would resolve her own issues . 
   a fertility rate of 1 would mean the population would be divided by half after each generation , but by the time it reaches critically low numbers it will probably be like the year 2500 or so , at which point we 'll probably have a solution well , it depends on your definition of `` critically low '' . 
  you can work an approximation out by current_date + ( average_age_of_mother_giving_birth x log ( population ) / log ( 2 ) ) . 
  for spain , that 's 2016 + ( [ 32 ] ( https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/sf_2_3_age_mothers_childbirth.pdf ) x log ( [ 46,423,064 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spain ) ) / log ( 2 ) ) . 
  the people of spain will be entirely gone in 2830 if you had a tfr of 1 with no unexpected mortality . 
  that being said , it * will * represent a decline in europe 's relative influence in the world and a number of other things that one might care about , like having a decent quality of life in retirement ( or retirement at all ) , long before that . 
  and many effects will be front-loaded -- the fund-retirement issue is a problem for the immediate future . 
  cutting a country in half is only one step down the logarithmic scale to eliminating it , but it creates a tremendous difference in influence for many things where the relative linear size of countries matter . 
   i do n't believe that syrian refugees have only a tfr of 2.5 . 
  why is that ? 
  that 's about [ what syria has ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/syria/total_fertility_rate.html ) . 
  hmm . 
  we do something similar ( beyond the will-only-offer-a-rather-spartan-retirement social security ) , but people here simply do n't save all that much . 
  [ you have a significantly-higher personal savings rate than we do ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=unitedstapersav&amp;v=201611230936r&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;title=false&amp;url2=/denmark/personal-savings&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) . 
   but it would require a lot of changes to how we think about elderly care . 
  well , i imagine that a cup of hemlock at retirement would solve the issue of funding care for the elderly . 
  i suspect that that 's not really a tradeoff that most would like to make , though . 
  fastest-growing religion in the world today . 
  assuming current trends continue , by 2050 , will be on par with christianity in number of adherents . 
  http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religiously-unaffiliated/ see the `` demographic characteristics of the religiously unaffiliated that will shape their future : fertility '' section . 
   as a result , the percentage of the world 's population that is [ religiously ] unaffiliated is expected to drop , from 16 % of the world 's total population in 2010 to 13 % in 2050 .
