    this decline is largely due to the advanced age and low fertility of religiously unaffiliated people globally relative to other religious groups . 
  the three largest unaffiliated populations live in china , japan and the united states ; there also are significant numbers of religiously unaffiliated people in many european countries . 
  all of these areas have older populations and lower fertility rates than the global population overall . 
  ** total fertility rates of unaffiliated by region , 2010-2015 ** | region | all religions | unaffiliated | difference | | - | - | - | - :| | sub-saharan africa | 4.8 | 4.3 | -0.5 | | latin america-caribbean | 2.2 | 2.3 | 0.1 | | north america | 2.0 | 1.6 | -0.4 | | asia-pacific | 2.1 | 1.6 | -0.6 | | europe | 1.6 | 1.4 | -0.2 | | world | 2.5 | 1.7 | -0.8 |, 
   we have problems with low wages . 
  i have a hard time with that argument . 
  essentially everyone is better-off than their grandparents were , but their grandparents managed to produce a greater-than-replacement fertility rate . 
  true , the standard of living they accepted was decidedly lower than ours was ... 
  you ca n't get it with that much precision across countries . 
  in developed countries , it 's about 2.1 , but it varies by country due to mortality rate differences . 
   these so-called `` prohibited '' subsidies are considered the most serious form of anti-competitive practice as they require an undertaking from the company in receipt of them to promise not to operate in other jurisdictions . 
    you can have the money if you promise you wo n't open plants elsewhere - in this case even in another us state . 
  i ca n't figure out if they 're objecting to offering tax breaks to open a plant somewhere -- common in the us -- or tax breaks to open * all plants * in the current location . 
  the former restriction seems like it would be problematic . 
  the latter might be okay . 
  on the other hand , i assume that private companies * can * offer such arrangements . 
  my guess is that if the `` cut deal to get exclusive access to plants '' thing comes up , you 'll find private companies essentially taking on the role -- e.g. 
  a state hires a `` business-development company '' to bring companies into the state . 
  i imagine that there could be some state-to-business-development-company relationship that will be weak enough to dodge wto objections . 
   nobody should arm himself , i think everyone should arm themselves , but i do n't think that migrants , as a group , are a particularly substantial physical threat . 
  the issues they post are those of economic and social pressures , not really of imminent death . 
  i 've noted a lot of use of the phrase `` fleeing poverty and conflict '' in us media , to sort of combine economic migrants with refugees . 
  you wo n't maintain that deficit in the long run , though -- you can have a trade imbalance with the rest of the world , but not a long-term one . 
  even if you tried to force it to remain , your currency would just wind up weakening , making your exports more appealing and making imports less appealing to you . 
  that is , international trade does n't involve picking partners to try to maintain a persistent trade surplus with the rest of the world . 
  i 'll grant that society-as-it-is-at-the-moment is not sustainable , and it * was * sustainable a while back ... but another potential option would be changing the society in yet another way to bring birth rates up . 
  just because we had a sustainable society does n't mean that it is the only possible sustainable society . 
  contraception and abortion are legal in turkey , and turkey still manages to stay at about replacement level . 
  granted , [ erdogan was off asking people to * voluntarily refrain * from using it ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36413097 ) , but it 's still available . 
   you realise we have about a # 100 billion per year trade deficit with the eu ? 
  that 's just fine . 
  you can never run a long-term trade deficit with the rest of the world . 
  you can have a persistent net trade surplus to * one party * , but then you 're having a net trade deficit to another party to make up for it . 
  you want to trade with parties that you have surpluses * and * deficits with . 
   you 'd be surprised how many people voted thinking that they could get out of the eu while retaining the advantages . 
  i 'd wager that a large chunk of the population of any country has a very limited understanding of how international trade benefits them . 
  not saying that that does n't happen to be the case in this particular instance -- maybe it does -- but the logic you 're using to argue for it is the [ argument to moderation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_to_moderation ) , a fallacy :  argument to moderation ( latin : argumentum ad temperantiam ) -- also known as [ argument from ] middle ground , false compromise , gray fallacy , and the golden mean fallacy [ 1 ] -- is an informal fallacy which asserts that the truth must be found as a compromise between two opposite positions . 
   the chinese logic is to conquer as much market share as possible with low prices ( if need be below cost ) to increase prices once it is the dominant player . 
  there are numerous articles saying that this is not the goal and that they screwed up . 
   moscow has deployed its s-400 air missile defence system and iskander ballistic missile system in the russian exclave kaliningrad , situated between nato members lithuania and poland . 
  the move has alarmed countries throughout central europe . 
  the [ iskander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k720_iskander ) apparently has a 500mi ( 805 km ) range . 
  [ circle with that radius drawn on kaliningrad ] ( https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php?circles=%5b%5b804670%2c54.7104264%2c20.4522144%2c%22%23aaaaaa%22%2c%22%23000000%22%2c0.4%5d%5d ) , to give an idea of coverage . 
  note that this is not a small amount of overproduction . 
  china is currently apparently producing about 100m tons over consumption annually . 
  edit : corrected number -- had overcapacity rather than overproduction . 
  the [ golden gate bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_gate_bridge ) in california is 1.7 miles ( 2.74 km ) long , and uses 88,000 tons of steel , so if you assume that ratio , you 're talking about 3109 km of bridge from the annual surplus . 
  while china 's steel dilemma is certainly disruptive to other steel manufacturers , i wonder if that 's the best way to go about it . 
  my understanding is that china built a lot of steel capacity expecting continued growth , then economic contraction caused there to be overproduction . 
  china faces the same complaints other countries do about job losses ... and arguably increasing unemployment would be more-politically-severe in china , so china is selling steel at a loss to avoid killing off its steel capacity until demand returns . 
  http://qz.com/699979/how-chinas-overproduction-of-steel-is-damaging-companies-and-countries-around-the-world/  widespread labor strikes and a slowing domestic economy have put pressure on local chinese officials to keep factories going , even as leaders in beijing have pledged to cut capacity and said they could lay off millions . 
  most of these factories are state-owned , meaning they 're subsidized by the government , rather than making market-driven decisions . 
  i wonder if it would be instead possible to have a win-win situation -- have a bloc of other countries agree to purchase a certain quantity of steel at a below-the-current-chinese-market price of steel for a few years and engage in steel-heavy infrastructure-building in that period . 
  that 'd let china purchase domestic political stability by subsidizing infrastructure in other countries . 
  china [ severely screwed itself over with state-driven efforts to bulk-produce steel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_leap_forward ) before , and it probably could do without crashing into that again .

   the eu acts as a block just a reminder -- i post this periodically , but since we have a ton of international affairs people , think that it 's of interest . 
  in english , `` bloc '' refers to a group of countries operating together . 
  a `` block '' would be a solid chunk of material . 
  frankly , even if the eu takes a `` no restrictions on services '' thing , i bet that both parties would want more than that . 
  tell you what . 
  nafta permits for financial services , but even it does n't simply say `` financial services are okay '' . 
  maybe base something on that ? 
  http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/nafta/chap-141.asp it 's maybe a bit dense . 
  there 's also some analysis online that i read somewhere of the intra-nafta financial services limitations . 
  it basically covers the list of concerns that each party had and what was put in as a result of that . 
  on a phone at the moment , so not going to go digging for it , but that might be a starting point for a model of a intra-country financial services agreement . 
  why would it being flattering or not be relevant ? 
  do you have a reputable source for that quote ? 
  his wikiquote page does not list it , and it sounds unlikely to me . 
   but that would just put the eu at the mercy of the us and russia , yes , if all suppliers ( add norway and anyone else with lng facilities ) collude , you have a problem in a market . 
  but that 's a lot harder than just one doing so . 
  mind , i think that the eu should probably * also * use hydrofracking , but that 's another story . 
  turkey is n't practicing genocide today ( unless this is a reference to the century-old armenian genocide ) . 
  turkey is n't particularly extremist . 
  you could think of erdogan like being similar to , oh ... maybe reagan on religion . 
  he 'll use religion to get popular support , but he 's really not running anything like a religious state . 
  turkey 's not an islamic theocracy like iran , with a religious figure in ultimate control . 
  it 's a lot easier to criticize a forecast as `` wrong '' than to produce a credible alternative . 
  if the eu wants to subsidize energy in the east , it can do so by internally providing gas subsidies . 
  the eu 's interest is in establishing multiple suppliers to limit the degree of influence that any one supplier has over them , and then negotiate as a bloc to maximize the eu 's leverage , particularly if the eu controls the bulk of the customers for any one supplier . 
  then the supplier needs the customer , but not visa-versa . 
  what the eu was doing before was having individual countries deal with a single monopoly supplied in russia . 
  estonia needed russia , but russia did n't need estonia . 
  that had put estonia in a weak bargaining position . 
  ... what on earth is wrong with you ? 
  why is there any reason to believe that jens stoltenberg is seeking `` glory '' at all ? 
  in fact , a number of the nyt 's political positions * do * irritate me . 
  there 's a reason that i do n't subscribe . 
  but they ca n't reasonably be called not reputable . 
  what , one of the world 's larger militaries , and control of black sea-mediterranean transit ? 
  turkey has n't done anything militarily harmful to us . 
  it 's involved in economic negotiation with the eu over refugees , but : * that 's not incompatible with nato .
