  the us competes economically with , say , germany too , even if we 're rather more polite with each other . 
  * turkey has legitimately been handling more than its fair share of the refugee situation , and having to foot the bill . 
  they 've got a fair beef there . 
  hell , turkey could grouse at the us too . 
  * from a demographic and political standpoint , turkey is more at risk than europe . 
  * turkey is no worse -- a lot better , in fact -- than eu members on the point . 
  turkey at least housed people . 
  eu members mostly tried to unload migrants as quickly as possible in germany 's direction . 
  erdogan is an autocrat . 
  but ... is isolating him likely to improve or worsen that ? 
  how will that achieve your goals ? 
  remember how we kinda went a bit nuts after 9/11 ? 
  that failed coup was turkey 's 9/11 . 
  i am pretty confident that that is not the case . 
  i think that : * that would hurt ordinary russians , whose only crime is having been born in russia . 
  * that would give up on the concept of a marketplace of ideas leading to truth , which i do n't want to sacrifice . 
  * that would reduce legitimacy to being the one to run the government ( `` i 'm the arbiter of truth because i run the government '' ) . 
  that 's a weak guarantee . 
  * that might drive propaganda efforts underground , but would not kill them . 
  north korea seals out the outside world and dangerous ideas . 
  i do n't want to be north korea . 
  maybe there has n't been a satisfactory answer to propaganda yet , but i 'm loathe to kill conversation . 
  i 'd say they do understand the value of lower prices , which is why they 're negotiating as a bloc . 
  if the eu wants to internally create gas subsidies , she can do that .

   the new york times ( sometimes abbreviated to nyt ) is an american daily newspaper , founded and continuously published in new york city since september 18 , 1851 , by the new york times company . 
  the new york times has won 117 pulitzer prizes , more than any other news organization . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   the paper 's print version has the second-largest circulation , behind the wall street journal , and the largest circulation among the metropolitan newspapers in the united states of america . 
  the new york times is ranked 39th in the world by circulation . 
  following industry trends , its weekday circulation has fallen to fewer than one million daily since 1990 . 
  [ 10 ]   nicknamed `` the gray lady '' , [ 11 ] the new york times has long been regarded within the industry as a national `` newspaper of record '' .

  you may not agree with its politics , but it 's about as reputable and august as a publication gets . 
  that 's a well-known , reputable publication , albeit one politically-opposed to trump . 
  yes , because every political conflict is driven by the cia . 
  that 'd be foolish and detrimental to nato and the us . 
   it 's not really something we do in europe , except for buying a house . 
  we probably have more private debt in relative terms compared to the eu as a whole , but you can [ take a look at the danes , who seem to be miles out in front of us ] ( http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/household_debt_gdp/ ) ... also , [ gross debt-to-income ratio in the eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/graph.do?tab=graph&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00104&amp;language=en&amp;toolbox=data ) . 
  looks like the czechs , poles , and hungarians carry the least debt load relative to income . 
  < shrug  the intermingling of the word `` race '' and `` ethnicity '' and what the various terms that have fallen under them all make up a complicated swirl in the us stemming from history . 
  i intentionally used the text the article used . 
  * `` latino '' is * probably * more correct than `` hispanic '' and i think that it 's seeing more use , but `` hispanic '' was historically used for `` everyone south of the border , because everyone down there who comes north speaks spanish aside from a few francophones and the brazilians , neither of which makes it to the us much , and it 's not correct to just mis-call everyone mexican '' . 
  * `` white '' and `` black '' are n't really races either ( though if you really wanted to start tamping down on terms , invariably someone would say that `` race '' does n't have hard-and-fast definition either and ... ) * you could be a light-skinned latino with a black mother and speak spanish . 
  got ta reconcile that somehow . 
  at the end of the day , this set of terms ( along with `` asian '' meaning people * only * from east asia ) and `` native american '' ( once `` american indian '' ... thank you , christopher columbus ) and a few other oddball ones , like `` pacific islander '' , more-or-less make up a set of identities in common use in us society . 
  it 's a little fuzzy , but it 's what people work with in common use , and it has real social meaning , so it gets used for data-gathering . 
  i 'm gon na bet that urbanites in russia are better-off than rural dwellers . 
  we have high * income * . 
  that does n't mean that we have high * wealth * .

  if there 's an issue , i do n't think that clobbering germany would solve anything . 
  i think that it 's more that germany gets more shit than anyone else about potentially having right-wing views , and as a result , germany has made this a * very strong taboo * . 
  right now , the main country accepting refugees in europe is germany , right ? 
  the all-time highest comic on polandball ? 
  [ slagging on germany for potentially abruptly going nazi ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rpzhc ) . 
  the uk has busily locked itself down at the channel , many countries have massive opposition to migrants , hungary is building fences , we 're furiously `` making ourselves great again '' , borders have been raised , and germany 's the only country sailing on merrily . 
  perhaps less dumping on germany for a lack of care for human rights would go further . 
  also , on a related note -- i still really think that the eu should , even if it is to remain a confederation , provide members with * some * kind of brake or control on immigration ( or at least naturalization ) to other members . 
  members extend free movement and free labor to the citizens of all other members . 
  because someone legally living in an eu country can normally get citizenship after a few years , this means that countries are extending those rights to access to many other countries , shaping their societies as well . 
  whether that 's a good idea or not to let many people in , right now , if even a * single * country permits someone in and grants citizenship , they enjoy access to the entire eu within a few years . 
  there is no control that members have over this intake . 
  that does not seem to me to be well-designed -- neither switzerland nor germany would not permit one of their constituent states to act without the whole having a voice in granting the right to live and work in the rest of the country . 
  that does n't necessarily mean a single common immigration policy , but at least some form of * brake * or control so that if a majority disagrees with a state extending large numbers of people citizenship , there 's some sort of emergency-stop switch . 
  the present system permits for malta , as the smallest eu member , with a mere 0.1 % of the eu 's population , to potentially open the floodgates to the eu as wide as she would like , without any other members having any say in the matter . 
  sure , but it 's not a relative matter -- being # 1 is n't an inherent benefit here , but rather one of serving what demand exists . 
  if there 's a widening income gap and people are unhappy with the standard of living at a lower educational level , then ... well , the way to fix it is to keep pushing up the average level of education , and thus squeezing together those income bands . 
   the problem with education in the us is that it is too expensive . 
  i 'll disagree with you here -- well , okay . 
  i think that the subtext that you 're aiming for is `` more subsidies should be applied '' , and specifically on that i disagree . 
  there are a couple of beneficiaries of education . 
  the first , and the most significant one , is the one educated . 
  [ there 's a strong correlation between education and higher income ] ( http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm ) -- and that 's not even factoring out some fields of study that have a low or negative roi , like theology . 
  so , if that person is the * only * one who benefits , there 's no externality to internalize . 
  sure , they have to spend money , but they also receive the benefit later . 
  if they 're the one benefiting , you also want them to be the one spending the money , else you 've * introduced * an externality . 
  in real life , that person is n't the only one ... but they 're the one that benefits to a very great amount . 
  it does * cost * that person a lot of money , but if you know that you can make a lot more money later by spending some money now , there 's a straightforward way to deal with it -- via loans . 
  and , hence , we use loans . 
  we could have the taxpayer pay for it , but it 'd still be the same issue -- that 's going to be funded by the * government * taking out loans in the form of treasury bonds , which are paid back by the taxpayer . 
  problem is , if you do this ... you 've got an externality again . 
  maybe i feel like doing another two years of university for the hell of it ? 
  well , * i 'm * not going to be the one mostly paying for it , so why not run up the bill , since it 's going to other people ... even if i do n't think that it 's actually worthwhile in terms of what i gain if i had to pay for it . 
  now , true , there are some other benefits . 
  if someone goes on welfare , that is a cost to other people in society , and that 's a negative externality . 
  having a society that is n't generally-literate imposes a cost on other people -- you ca n't rely on signs and forms and all that , and that 's a negative externality . 
  i suspect that you 'd find that theft and robbery are associated with high wealth disparity , and that 's a negative externality . 
  so other people do receive * some * benefit , and so to internalize that externality , it makes sense for them to pay something towards that benefit . 
  in the us , that 's currently about [ $ 160b/year ] ( http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/06/federal-and-state-funding-of-higher-education ) specifically towards higher education . 
  that 's about $ 500 a year , if you break it up evenly , that every man , woman , and child in the us would pay to live in a society where 30 % of the people around them have a bachelor 's degree or above . 
  i do n't know if that amount is reasonable or unreasonable , though i do think that it 's reasonable for it to be much less than what the individual who is educated pays . 
  make europe cro-magnon again !, 
  does n't make sense to do so , though .
