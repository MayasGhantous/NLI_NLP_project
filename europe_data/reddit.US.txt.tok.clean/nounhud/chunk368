  at any rate , some form of harmonization would need to happen for an fta to go through . 
   its funny how you think international law matters anymore . 
  if the us feels the need to suddenly leave treaties like the abm treaty the abm treaty had provisions for withdrawal , which the us followed . 
   i 'd like a labour reform with `` less work '' tbh . 
  i 'm not sure what that means . 
  the typical voter in the us does not weight foreign policy very highly . 
  if you want an n week unemployment cushion , save n weeks of expenditures , and you 've achieved the same thing . 
  hard data , please , not `` skyrocketed '' . 
  yes , that 's what i mean -- i do n't mean that a country is actually instructing young people to leave and go elsewhere . 
  hmm . 
  in the extremely-broad sense of the word that any constraint is a difficulty to deal with , maybe . 
  but normally , i 'd take destabilization to refer to trying to make stop working reasonably , and while i 'm not an expert and am simply going from news articles , i do n't think erdogan has that as a goal . 
  he wants an end to criticism from the eu for his domestic actions and probably whatever favorable deals he can get , but the eu to break down ? 
  i do n't see why . 
  kansas may not be my ideal , but kansas is n't a disaster . 
  yes . 
  some of us would rather not have a clinton or a bush or someone like trump . 
  there 'll be a remake . 
  why would erdogan want to destabilize europe ? 
  i mean , wanting to pressure the eu for more-favorable terms , sure ... 
   trump made those comments just after saying putin is `` not going into ukraine . '', 
    `` well , look , you know , i have my own ideas . 
  he 's not going into ukraine , ok ? '', 
  trump said of putin . 
  `` just so you understand . 
  he 's not going to go into ukraine , all right ? 
  you can mark it down and you can put it down , you can take it anywhere you want . '', 
  well , i agree with the part about trump having his own ideas ... 
  ah , but switzerland is a federation too !, 
  median has germany well above the us . 
   surely the uk could just start its own trading under other arrangements ? 
  as an expert on treaty law , i fail to understand why you need any `` trade agreements '' to trade ? 
  well , supposing that the uk trades with the us and us starts exporting products to the uk that do n't follow uk pdo law . 
  what 's your next step ? 
  you do n't let countries on an accession path vote . 
  due to [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) , reducing barriers to trade with any given country is advantageous for both countries . 
  you can debate about how countries divvy up the gains internally , but the gain is real . 
  probably pdos . 
  edit : i do n't know if they were actually * the * sticking point , but they 'd been listed as a major point of contention for at least a year , and i never saw resolution on them . 
  he just renounced that yesterday . 
  all eu ftas that i 've looked at -- and thus , i assume all -- have isds . 
   you mean with that ` discussion ' i just read where there is one person outraged over the fact the eu leaders reject that whole single market without fom is up for debate ? 
  i mean , there is a legitimate point there . 
  the objections to it are political , not financial . 
  it 's on a different level from `` why ca n't trade arrangements be negotiated on a country-by-country basis '' . 
  hell , while the position that the eu is raking is simple , i 'd argue that the eu * could * theoretically make this work as well . 
  you 'd need the two following elements : * it to be temporary , so that it does n't interfere with the eu 's goals of ultimately having free movement . 
  that does n't sound like something the briton would accept , except for the fact that economic convergence is also a goal , and it 's economic disparity that is driving internal migration . 
  * that it not economically-penalize the , say , romanian worker . 
  just as with the fact that the briton feels overwhelmed by a ton of people coming in , so too do poorer european countries regret having their youth move abroad . 
  let us say that there were , say , a thirty year plan for economic convergence in the eu , and the wealthier states could choose either to accept freedom to work or to transfer funds ( and thus take a standard of living hit ) sufficient to achieve a target rate of economic convergence ? 
  at the end of that period , the option expires . 
  that would be a goal to which i believe that both sides could agree , in theory . 
  my belief is that poorer countries would generally prefer to have domestic economic growth sufficient to achieve convergence to having to send their youth abroad to achieve same . 
  i do not actually think that the uk would be willing to transfer that much money or dreams of doing so . 
  i think that doing so would have grievous impact on the uk economy . 
  i think that accepting workers would be far more to the uk 's benefit . 
  but i do claim that at least in theory , there are terms on which this could be made to work . 
  the us did not work like that , but the us never incorporated existing populous countries , so maybe that 's a better way of dealing with things . 
  i do n't think that your image of the us media is particularly correct . 
  hahaha , love the flair . 
  just say `` central europe '' . 
  * the point is to be a tripwire force , not to gamble everything on a defense at the border . 
  if there is a fight , it means that france is in it from the get-go . 
  * fun fact : [ finland went into the winter war with a total of 32 not-very-up-to-date tanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) . 
  i 'm dubious that this is new . 
  political positions in newspapers and other media , like talk radio , has existed forever . 
  i 'd argue that the main difference is that : * the long tail perhaps permits for some smaller , more-extreme echo chambers . 
  * comments often make it easier to demonstrate holes in someone 's reasoning . 
  * the low cost of publication means that the professional journalist can be completely cut out of the loop . 
   2017 may be even wilder than 2016 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geert_wilders, 
  to be totally frank , if i were an eu federalist politician , i 'd be pushing now too . 
  probably not going to have a more opportune political environment show up . 
   chief strategist bannon . 
  he 's also the main source of the racial issues associated with trump . 
  what 's this about german , though ? 
  i thought that it was just fn . 
  [ trump has an entire wikipedia article on * his * legal difficulties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_affairs_of_donald_trump ), 
   america has had such assholes before , jackson , nixon springing to mind . 
  even if trump tries to play to the crowd , what follows is the bureaucracy , the generals , the courts , his own party , who will press on him hard . 
  thanks . 
  i hope so . 
  i think that trump deserved a fair chunk of the criticism that they 've been giving of him . 
  libya was not clinton 's project . 
  i 'll own going along with it , but not driving it . 
  hmm . 
  i was going to just say `` well , obviously serbia is n't joining '' ... but it looks like there was some friction with russia over how after the russian sanctions on poland were put in place , serbia-grown apple exports to russia promptly increased by 50 % , and i assume that it 's relevant as regards relabeled apples . 
  well , it does n't have to do with nato . 
  it does have to do with a european common defense in that it pulls a lot of clout away from finland , which is in the eu but not nato . 
  i agree with him on bannon , though . 
  bannon is potentially a serious risk , depending on the amount to which this is just `` bannon trying to use trump 's electoral victory to expand his company 's userbase '' versus `` bannon pursuing policy goals '' . 
  regardless , if i were the eu i 'd be a lot more comfortable with bannon nowhere near trump . 
  i 'd * personally * be a lot happier with bannon out of the white house and away from trump too . 
   europe has been the geo-politico-economic center of the world for much of the past three millennia . 
  the [ great divergence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) kicked off in the late 1400s . 
  that 's what , over time , rendered europe , starting with the uk , so wildly-disproportionately-wealthy . 
  here 's a [ graph of historic world gdp ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/the-economic-history-of-the-last-2-000-years-in-1-little-graph/258676/ ) . 
  historically , china and india dominated . 
  ( note that the time axis is strongly-compressed in the past on this graph ), 
   i know , i know , there is nothing like a defensive shield in the baltics to counter iranian aggression against europe .
