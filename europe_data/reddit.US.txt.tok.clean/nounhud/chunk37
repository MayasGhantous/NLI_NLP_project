  no , i 'm pointing it out becase it seems very implausible to me . 
  / u/mike _ blomvkist was saying that it would n't be politically possible to create a free movement zone among commonwealth countries without including the poor members of the commonwealth as well , and i was saying that that seems unlikely to me . 
  well , i guess you presumably know the people in canada and australia and new zealand better than i , and if they 'd insist that nigeria and pakistan be included in any free movement area that they were part of or they 'd drop out , i suppose that 's that . 
  i 'm still kinda skeptical . 
  < shrug  well , do n't use `` commonwealth '' in the name , or as i pointed out above , have it apply to the `` commonwealth realms '' instead of the commonwealth of nations . 
  seems like an odd objection . 
  you think that australia , say , would refuse to be a member of a free movement area unless it also included pakistan ? 
  if anything , i 'd really rather think that the australian public would prefer to be part of a free movement area that excluded pakistan . 
  up until bush went all `` no terrorists will make it across our multi-thousand-mile-long undefended border '' , we let canadians in w/o a passport and visa versa ( had to show a driver 's license , though ) . 
  i did n't see anyone demanding that the same policy apply to anyone else . 
  edit : ah , they still do under a new program , but only with a few states that have [ instituted creepy electronic biometric identification requirements on their dl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/driver's_license_in_the_united_states#enhanced_driver.27s_licenses ) :  enhanced licenses are issued to u.s. citizens in washington , vermont , michigan , minnesota , and new york , and establish nationality in addition to driving privileges . 
  ... [ and some canadian provinces ] ( http://www.clippervacations.com/crossing-the-us-border/ ) ...  british columbia , manitoba , ontario , quebec, 
  ah , so australia can be in eurovision but not the eu , eh ? 
  hmm . 
  maybe instead of the [ commonwealth of nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) , the [ commonwealth realms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_realms ) , which include australia , canada , nz , and uk , but not ireland or any of the other countries you listed : the countries that choose to recognize the queen as head of state . 
  edit : that does include [ the bahamas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bahamas ) and [ jamaica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jamaica ) , though that might be an easy sell :  in 2011 , a survey done showed that approximately 60 % of jamaicans would push to once again become a british territory ; citing years of social and fiscal mismanagement in the country . 
  [ 31 ] edit2 : heh , if that did happen , the commonwealth free movement zone or whatever would only be 55 miles from the us coast , not much further than the uk is from france . 
  edit3 : actually , i 'm just being stupid -- it 'd have a land border with the us , because of canada . 
  his conclusion was that it was not edited . 
  i provided the content of the first comment , and it does not say that the photo was fake . 
   your source says that it is likely he edited photos . 
  where ? 
  the closest it comes is :  i do n't know whether it was edited by the soviet government but it was certainly edited by wikipedia contributors . 
  when you look at the file 's history you will notice that it started out like this when it was originally posted in 2005 and it was changed to this in 2007 . followed up by :  the 2005 version looks very heavily retouched ( by airbrushing etc , ie old methods , not photoshop ) whereas the 2007 version looks more like an unedited photo . 
  followed up by :  2005 version is a painting of the 2007 photo . 
  wikipedia 's askhistorians take was that the photo was real :  most of stalin `` disfigurement '' occurred on his neck and cheeks . 
  a beard would have covered this and the quality of the photos probably would n't give an accurate representation either . 
  also , stalin gained a lot of weight in his time as head of the ussr which may have lead to the worsening of his condition . 
    there are many photos of the young and strong stalin where there is no signs of abstract physical features . 
  most of these photos or of course very old , but likely originals , such as the ones from his school years and time as a revolutionary . 
    so either this picture is n't edited or nearly all pictures of stalin are edited with the originals unfounded or destroyed . 
  if stalin liked how he looked in the pictures he would have no reason to edit them . 
    edit : a word   edit 2 : the back page of young stalin is actually a series of photos of the man throughout his life   sorry for the quality it was just a quick google search , however looking at my own copy i also see no disfigurement in any of the photos . 
  considering the quality of journalism in the book i assume none of the photos are altered as it would be a bad historical base for the book . 
  since all of the photos are before stalin gained most of his weight i think it 's safe to say the weight contributed greatly to his distaste of his personal image and may have flared up some of the leftover mumps wounds . 
  wikipedia has the picture from / u/hackbrettscorsch image as stalin in 1902 and your picture as stalin in 1911 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin also see : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2d8at2/was_that_young_handsome_stalin_photo_edited_at/, 
   the increase from 1,2 % to 2 % would n't be enough to offset this . 
  2 % is somewhat-arbitrary , true . 
  but that does n't mean that it is meaningless . 
  your statement is that `` if i cut my spending , it will benefit myself , and it will not , all-else-held-equal , substantially affect things '' . 
  the problem that you crash into is , as obama pointed out , [ the free-rider problem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_rider_problem ) -- if defense spending is a pool into which everyone can dip and pull some out of , eventually everyone has a reason to do so , and the whole winds up losing out . 
  national security is one of the standard [ public good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_good ) examples . 
  the way you deal with a public-good problem is to require all members to contribute at least a certain amount to the pool . 
  that 's what that 2 % line is for . 
  it 's possible that maybe 2 % is off , and if so , nato can certainly discuss a different level . 
  but the current state of affairs , where member countries commit to a level and then proceed to just ignore it , is very much the free-rider problem in action . 
   would n't that fall under `` free riding '' ? 
  if there 's an estonian-lithuanian-norwegian-dutch large transport plane , in what way would that be free-riding ? 
   lack of personnel on a per-capita basis ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_forces_of_the_netherlands 59k active-duty . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands 17m population . 
  active-duty military 0.35 % of population . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_armed_forces 1.3 m https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states 322m . 
  0.4 % of population active-duty . 
  that does n't seem like a fundamental limitation . 
   lack of projecting power ( you do n't expect us to come up with aircraft carriers like france and the uk , do you ? ), 
  nato already set up programs with some smaller members to let them share the costs of running expensive hardware , like heavy transport aircraft , [ in which they have shared ownership ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_airlift_capability ) between each other , so that they retain access to major items . 
  that 's bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , the netherlands , norway , poland , romania , slovenia , the us , finland , and sweden . 
  the netherlands is the home base of an independent ( and substantially-larger ) franco-german-driven effort , the [ european air transport command ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_air_transport_command ) , to share strategic airlift capacity . 
  that 's belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands , spain , and italy . 
  if the netherlands can be a member of both multinational groups , and the home base for the latter , running most of europe 's strategic air transport capacity , she can presumably do the same with other military assets . 
   and the focus on being all-round ( no air-superiority fighters , nor bombers . 
  only multirole ) . 
  the us has put heavy focus on the multirole f-35 , funded pretty much only the r&d for the f-22 , and most bombing in recent conflicts has been done via multirole aircraft . 
  these decisions do n't seem to be unique to the netherlands . 
  he could have refused to leave iraq until the country was better-stabilized , though that would have turned it into an occupation of a country against the wishes of its democratically-elected government . 
  the us was involved before that , where the us knocked out air defenses with stealth aircraft and cruise missiles , to give france and the uk air superiority . 
  that 's fair . 
  the running-out-of-munitions thing was pretty bad , though -- that means that the idea was presumably to draw from the us stocks from the beginning , after the us was involved . 
   libya is much more of an interest to europe than it is to america . 
  agreed . 
   libyan oil does n't go to america ... it goes to europe . 
  i do n't know how relevant that is . 
  oil is kinda fungible , and prices do n't wildly vary around the globe . 
  you can get the oil from elsewhere , long as you 're willing to do transportation costs . 
  obama got into office running on a `` we get out of wars in the middle east '' card . 
  he took substantial political heat for re-entering the middle east at europe 's request . 
  what , i expect , he expected was for libya in particular to be finished by europe ( or at least an attempt made a la the us in iraq ) . 
  in iraq -- which certainly was a us project -- the us led and took responsibility for things that screwed up and paid for stabilization efforts . 
  europe got the us involved , but did n't follow up , which is , if i understand correctly , what irked him . 
  true , you can say `` wait a minute ... iraq * still * ended up a clusterfuck , regardless of how much effort went into finishing it . 
  and iraq was n't popular for blair , either , who took plenty of his own heat . '', 
  in the entire history of nuclear weapons , exactly two have been used in conflict -- by the us , in one week . 
  india and pakistan have fought , the us and the ussr have fought , and nobody went nuclear . 
  nuclear weapons are a fine thing and all that , but they are not a trump card that ends the relevance of all else military , unless you are actually willing to make use of nuclear weapons in all situations where you would use conventional forces or you are convinced that every other potential adversary has nuclear weapons and will similarly use nuclear weapons in all situations where they would use conventional forces . 
   military consolidation yes but more spending makes no sense before the consolidation happens since it would mostly be wasted anyway . 
  i do n't understand the ordering being important . 
  hell , you can combine the two -- have country a specialize in antiaircraft stuff and b in vehicles . 
   and neither europe nor us really wants a europe capable of intervening around the world on our own . 
  so obama personally and us nato representatives and the state department are just blindly pushing for a policy that they do n't want ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   let 's be fair , even if we did spend the 2 % on the military , it 'd still be in a terrible state . 
  i do n't believe that . 
  what irremediable flaws are you claiming that the dutch military suffer from that would prevent it from functioning ? 
  * you ca n't kick people out of nato . 
  * there are gentler solutions , like refusing to participate in military operations that people want that do n't actually involve article 5 . 
  * language * has * been getting stronger over past years . 
  having obama make public statements like the one in the article is pretty significant . 
  * i honestly believe ( and i think that many other people do too ) that it is in europe 's interests to fund her military properly . 
  yes , it 's possible for europe to reduce her foreign affairs in scope , and thereby avoid some risks and maybe some military cost .
