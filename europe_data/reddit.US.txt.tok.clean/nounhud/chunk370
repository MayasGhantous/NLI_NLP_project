  the idea of something like it coming with eu membership may also be very popular . 
  two caveats that occur to me : since in some cases , the issue the public has is wanting to deal with corruption in their government , this may be hard to sell . 
  the powers required to obtain information to conduct investigations would give access to economically-sensitive information . 
  countries would want to have a high confidence in it . 
  while i 'm generally sympathetic to that argument -- the idea that profound state restructuring should require a supermajority ( though i 'd prefer that it be of * elected representatives * ) , remember that if you want that , you could probably argue that the same should be true as to * entering * the eu . 
  i doubt that the uk would be an eu member today if it had to pass a 2/3 vote to join . 
  ehh ... actually , i do n't think that that 's universal . 
  pew , which i like and which is frequently posted on here , lists a lot of methodology information , but does n't necessarily post the original forms used to ask the questions , for example . 
  most polling companies list rather less information about methodology than pew does . 
   i have n't met even one sincerely pro-eu briton . 
  i like linking [ i can tolerate anything except the outgroup ] ( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/ ) on here . 
  the main thrust of the article is n't exactly what you 're talking about , but as part of its supporting argument , it also talks about how there is an * absolutely amazingly overwhelming * tendency for people to self-segregate along political lines . 
  starts in section iii . 
  i mean , i agree , but that 's true of a very great many people on each side . 
  it 's actually one thing that deeply impressed me with / r/europe , and one reason why i * came * here and to other european political forms in the first place . 
  by-and-large , political discussion seems to be vastly more reasonable -- people are n't simply demonizing each other . 
  i do n't know if that 's what europe 's really like as a whole , or if it 's just that the sort of people who are multilingual and hang out on an international forum are the cream-of-the-crop , but / r/europe is a lot-more-fun to discuss things on than / r/politics in an election year . 
  i mean , people seem to go out-of-their-way to be neutral , and they certainly do n't condemn everyone who supports another political party . 
  even when i see bias , it 's ... well , it 's a lot more * reasonable * . 
  edit : well , except when it comes to thatcher ... maybe that supports the argument that multilingualism creates a [ selection bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selection_bias ) , since britons will already speak english ... 
   obama 's imperial presidency i do n't think that obama was particularly notable in expanding the powers of the presidency . 
  fdr would be my guess for most-extreme-executive-authority-expansion . 
  on that item , i will definitely agree with you . 
   e.g. 
  he wants to be hard on iran but soft on russia . 
  i kind of doubt that trump is familiar with their relationship or that consistency there was critical to his campaign . 
   he also wants to increase spending on the army but commit less to nato , which is also a bit of a contradiction . 
  same , but for the difference between the ( small ) contributions to nato 's administrative costs and measuring relative size of the ( much larger ) defense funding . 
   you are fired i 'm still impressed that a guy known for being a wealthy mogul running a multinational catering to the wealthy wanting a route for conspicuous consumption and known in not insignificant part for yelling `` you 're fired '' at people successfully ran on a `` protect jobs '' platform . 
  i mean , realistically , i do n't think that i could construct a less-plausible background for someone running on such a platform . 
   read up on finlandization . 
  helpful link : [ wikipedia : finlandization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ), 
   as you 've just quoted , article i , section 8 gives congress and only congress the authority to declare war . 
  agree . 
   any president who refuses to combat our enemies during a state of war is guilty of treason under article iii , section 3 , and can be removed under article ii , section 4 . 
  disagree . 
  that would * only * be true if the declaration of war was a mandate to take specific action . 
  it is an * authorization * . 
  edit : actually , i take that back . 
  it still would n't relate to the crime of treason , which does n't relate to `` ignoring congress '' . 
  you could have committed treason by doing so even compelling the president to take specific military action is not a congressional power , and you could be not guilty of treason even if it is a congressional power . 
   are you actually arguing that a declaration of war is just a suggestion , and that the president has the authority to wage war against congress 's authority ? 
  no , i think i 've been pretty clear that congress does have the power to * authorize * war . 
  i 'm arguing that congress does n't have the ability to * compel * the president to take specific actions with the military , because that falls under the sphere of executive authority , not legislative . 
  well , it * can * do anything it wants in the sense that it can put out a piece of paper saying `` stop sitting around and respond to the attack on an ally by counter-invading '' . 
  my position is that such a binding demand would be unconstitutional , and / u/9timesoutof10 's position is that it would be constitutional . 
  ( maybe it 's a * bad idea * for it to be unconstitutional -- the us at the time of its creation was less-interested in global politics -- but that 's a different matter . ), 
  well , to be fair , they did n't vote to * require * him to do so , just to authorize him . 
  let 's look at [ house resolution 955 ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/955/text ) . 
  it does three things : * authorizes spending ( the budget is controlled by congress and is clearly within their domain ) . 
  * requires executive reports ( part of [ congressional oversight ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congressional_oversight ) , also clearly under congressional control ) . 
  * explicitly does not authorize the president to go to war or count as a war powers resolution authorization to engage in hostilities with russia . 
  that 's also a congressional power . 
  congress * also * criticized russia on ukraine , and passed [ house resolution 758 ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-resolution/758/text ) . 
  any time you see the text `` calls on '' , it can be considered non-binding , like '' ... calls on the president to cooperate with united states allies and partners in europe and other countries around the world to refuse to recognize any de jure or de facto sovereignty of the russian federation over crimea , its airspace , or its territorial waters ; '' . 
  the president can simply ignore that . 
  / u/9timesoutof10 is claiming -- and i disagree with him on this point -- that if congress * did * explicitly demand that the president attack russia , that the president would be bound to do so and would be subject to impeachment if not . 
  neither of these two bills deals with that , so neither can be treated as refuting his statement . 
  i think that the point is that aj + only shows the acronym instead of the full name . 
  that makes its association less-obvious . 
  kinda like russia today rebranding to rt. 
   his words seem arbitrary , either he does n't mean what he says , or he changes his mind on a whim . 
  i think that in some cases , he 's also not known anything about something he 's been asked about and then tries to make up something on the spot that sounds vaguely-plausible , and that this has exacerbated things somewhat . 
  i 've seen several quotes where it seems like he simply made whatever-it-was-up and thought that he was n't committing to much , but where in context , the thing was an awful mis-statement . 
  from his `` first 100 days '' promises , some clearly [ are n't ever intended to be acted upon ] ( https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/_landings/contract/o-tru-102316-contractv02.pdf ) :  third , a requirement that for every new federal regulation , two existing regulations must be eliminated . 
  the executive branch employs about five million people in organizations that span a huge range of things and regularly establish [ federal regulations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/code_of_federal_regulations ) throughout . 
  i ca n't imagine that trump believes that this is remotely viable . 
  some of these could just permit for weasel room . 
  for example `` renegotiating nafta '' could involve a very small set of changes , and given trump 's lack of specifics and apparent lack of general interest in the details of trade arrangements , my guess is that this is precisely what he plans to do . 
  but there is no way that he can viably implement a `` for each new federal regulation , two existing must be eliminated '' . 
   on evidence that any reasonably well-informed person could clearly see to be blatantly fake i guess that 's where we differ . 
  i 'd say that the evidence was played up , but understandable at the time . 
  oh , i agree with you there , though i do n't think that we 've regularly chosen the-best-person-out-of-322-million-people-to-do-the-job either . 
  i 'm just saying that i do n't think that an after-the-fact complaint about the vote not being a popular one carries a lot of weight . 
  mind , if hillary had spent the past two decades or so promoting electoral reform and then this happened , i 'd maybe be inclined to view it in a different light -- but she was n't . 
  that 's [ article i , section 8 that you 're looking for ] ( http://constitutionus.com/ ) :  the congress shall have power to ... declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; to raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; article ii , section 2 , places the president * in control of that military * :  the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the united states congress has the ability to * authorize * the president to act with the military in a war -- normally , without a declaration , he lacks that ability ( aside from those no-war-declared-police-action-things that presidents have been doing increasingly more of over the years ) . 
  not only can he withdraw troops , but he potentially -- not yet proven in courts yet -- can withdraw from nato over congress 's disagreement . 
  [ * goldwater v. carter * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goldwater_v._carter ) was the closest this came to being resolved , where us senators tried taking the president to the supreme court over the president unilaterally withdrawing from a defense treaty and the supreme court declined to hear the case . 
  that is * ending * a war . 
  my point is that there is no direct mechanism or precedent for congress to force an unwilling president to attack a country . 
  congress * authorizes * him to do so . 
  there are some indirect mechanisms . 
  congress could refuse to fund the government the next time the budget comes up , or could offer to pass a law that the president wants . 
  [ cfr : congress and u.s. foreign policy ] ( http://www.cfr.org/united-states/congress-us-foreign-policy/p29871 ) ( which notes that it 's not clear that even the war powers act , one of the three very limited restrictions i listed above , is constitutional . ), 
   `` trump 's victory was important because renzi strongly backed hillary clinton and so people link him with the loser and the mainstream establishment that clinton was seen as representing , '' said alessandra ghisleri , head of the euromedia agency . 
  that does not sound very plausible to me . 
  this was a vote entirely on internal italian affairs , yes ? 
  us foreign troop deployments are decided upon by the president . 
  congress has two points of involvement , both dealing with blocking the president from taking action : * congress needs to authorize overseas troop deployments over sixty days . 
  * congress needs to declare war to authorize the president to conduct one . 
  congress has only one major point of involvement in foreign affairs : * ratifying treaties that the president has negotiated . 
  ( sometimes , the president just pretends that congress has ratified it and goes ahead with it , [ as we did with the united nations convention on the law of the sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_and_the_united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea ) ) . 
  yes , if you want a `` france 's assessment wound up being the correct one '' , i 'll certainly extend that . 
  eh , i 'm not very friendly to that objection . 
  trump made the right response ( if he could manage that * more often * , i 'd be estatic ) on that -- he pointed out that he 'd have campaigned differently if the voting system worked differently . 
  clinton 's job was to campaign to said voting system . 
  she played the game and knew the rules , same as everyone who ran before her ( and she 's even on her second go-round , with the strong support of the dnc -- they know perfectly well how to work the system to maximize advantage , and have done so for longer than any other political party in the history of the us ) . 
  the voting system is in many , many ways an artifact of the past , but that does n't mean that it was a mistake . 
  for example , congress basically bought off west virginia in the american civil war , and had it split away from virginia and the confederacy and join the union as an independent state , giving the union control of critical rail and water routes . 
  had they not done so ... hey , maybe there would n't be a us today .
