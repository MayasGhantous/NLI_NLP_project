  while us states do n't own defense contractors , i do n't particularly see why eu states could n't . 
  germany could have fully-private companies , and france can own a share in hers . 
  some of the companies on each side might have to close and others enlarge , but if what one is mostly-interested in is the flow of euros ... < shrug , 
   things have gone too far . 
  i do n't really see how . 
  they 're far , far closer than , say , france and germany or any other members were when they first got together . 
  for both sides , one might add . 
  more to the point , seems like smuggling of goods into and out of the eu would be a concern if i can just drive a truck across the northern ireland-republic of ireland border . 
  i could understand spot checks or otherwise trying to keep the border minimal-enough that for some purposes it can * approximate * no border , but i do n't see how you can have a customs union and absolutely zero border . 
   there is no `` silver bullet '' solution well ... there was one situation that led [ france and the uk to nearly tie the knot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-british_union#world_war_ii_.281940.29 ) . 
  after germany won the battle of france :  reynaud supporter charles de gaulle had arrived in london earlier that day , however , and monnet told him about the proposed union . 
  [ 1 ] de gaulle convinced churchill that `` some dramatic move was essential to give reynaud the support which he needed to keep his government in the war '' . 
  [ 2 ] the frenchman then called reynaud and told him that the british prime minister proposed a union between their countries , an idea which reynaud immediately supported . 
  de gaulle , monnet , vansittart , and pleven quickly agreed to a document proclaiming a joint citizenship , foreign trade , currency , war cabinet , and military command . 
  churchill withdrew the armistice approval , and at 3 p.m. the war cabinet met again to consider the union document . 
  despite the radical nature of the proposal , churchill and the ministers recognized the need for a dramatic act to encourage the french and reinforce reynaud 's support within his cabinet before it met again at 5pm . 
  [ 1 ]   the final `` declaration of union '' approved by the british war cabinet stated that [ 1 ]    france and great britain shall no longer be two nations , but one franco-british union . 
  the constitution of the union will provide for joint organs of defence , foreign , financial and economic policies . 
  every citizen of france will enjoy immediately citizenship of great britain , every british subject will become a citizen of france . 
    churchill and de gaulle called reynaud to tell him about the document , and they arranged for a joint meeting of the two governments in concarneau the next day . 
  the declaration immediately succeeded in its goal of encouraging reynaud , who saw the union as the only alternative to surrender and who could now cite the british rejection of the armistice . 
  [ 1 ]   other french leaders were less enthusiastic , however . 
  at the 5 p.m. cabinet meeting , many called it a british `` last minute plan '' to steal its colonies , and said that `` be [ ing ] a nazi province '' was preferable to becoming a british dominion . 
  philippe p\u00e9tain , a leader of the pro-armistice group , called union `` fusion with a corpse '' . 
  while president albert lebrun and some others were supportive , the cabinet 's opposition stunned reynaud . 
  he resigned that evening without taking a formal vote on the union or an armistice , and later called the failure of the union the `` greatest disappointment of my political career '' . 
   and as far as paris is concerned , a common european defense means rallying europe behind french interests in africa . 
  well , yeah . 
  everyone 's got their own security concerns , and that 's going to be one of them . 
   france has experienced firsthand the lesson washington learned years ago : you have to do the dirty work yourself . 
  this essentially means all multilateral formations and troop arrangements are useless , because they will never actually be used in combat . 
  huh ? 
  we 've fought alongside a number of countries , especially the uk . 
   europe 's defense industry as a whole struggles to keep up with progress on a global stage ; there are 19 countries producing small arms , six producing submarines , five producing major surface combatants , and two producing combat aircraft -- each independently of the other . 
  got ta be willing to have enough faith in each other enough to know that those production facilities will reliably be available in the future if need be to start shutting down some redundant ones . 
   national capitals are largely to blame . 
  the big states , particularly france , try to use the defense cooperation argument as a pretext to squeeze out other competitors and keep the defense industry in their own hands . 
  other eu member states have adopted a predatory attitude toward offset contracts to boost their own national industries , demanding offsets that would render defense deals impossible commercially . 
  small states in particular have perhaps the most backward attitude of all : they want to protect and preserve their ( generally uncompetitive ) national champions . 
  some of these states abuse the national defense exemption to single-market rules to protect all sorts of domestic industries . 
  regarding european cooperation , they would rather safeguard their own small arms manufacturers than contribute to a european missile project . 
  not unique to the eu . 
  us states fight over these too . 
  have the ep make that decision , and have votes be traded by representatives to determine who gets what . 
  should not be a blocking factor . 
   russia is `` a top violator '' among tiny european countries mainly due to its large population . 
  per capita wise , romania looks more worrisome . 
  the waterboarding was stopped . 
   on the us military airfield in the ramstein palatine , the headquarters of the nato air forces are also located . 
  the approximately 500 soldiers who are stationed there are about 30 turks , according to a nato spokesman . 
  after the failed putsch of 15 july in turkey , thousands of soldiers were also arrested there . 
  diplomatic conflicts ? 
    the rhineland-palatinate ministry of integration in mainz did not want to comment on the case any further . 
  `` for reasons of security and protection of personality rights , we do not provide any information on questions concerning individuals in the asylum procedure , '' said a spokeswoman . 
  nice , so you confirm it , narrowing it down to less than 30 people , then refuse to comment further ? 
  what happens when turkey orders all 30 back tomorrow and three refuse to come ? 
  not gon na be that hard to figure out who it is , yes ? 
  nationalists , why so international ? 
  i 'd also advise encouraging your candidates for german leadership to not call for russia to break into computer systems of competing parties . 
  i 'm somebody , and i care . 
  i mean , if you eat the cake and throw it back up , you can do that . 
  all in all , it seems unwise , but ... 
  in all fairness , the commenter was arguing with another commenter who was insisting `` but russia is our enemy ! '', 
  not sure he disagreed on the whole germanic bit , though . 
  could be trolls , damned if i know , but seriously ... you could sample goddamn * stormfront * and expect more-amiable comments than that . 
  edit : also , given the extent of [ fraktur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fraktur ) use , i imagine that stormfront is probably all about germany . 
  i beg your pardon ? 
  edit : the now-deleted comment that i responded to said something about how `` your weak ideology has failed '' or something like that . 
  breitbart was [ involved with ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/06/the-transatlantic-flirtation-behind-ukips-sudden-meltdown/ ) trump and farage closely . 
  not so bizarre that they 'd now be trying for france . 
  curious to know how much influence bannon has on trump . 
  [ some of the press feel ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bannon-flattered-and-coaxed-trump-on-policies-key-to-the-alt-right/2016/11/15/53c66362-ab69-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html ) that [ it 's a lot ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.3850142/trump-pick-for-chief-advisor-steve-bannon-disastrous-for-america-1.3850146 ) . 
  edit : i wandered over to the breitbart website , curious to take a look at the comments and get a feel for the userbase . 
  whew ... it 's ... certainly unique . 
  one such comment , on the first article i clicked on :  may i suggest that the age-old clash of civilizations is once again reasserting itself after the hiatus of the last 50 years culminating in the now-rejected globalist worldview . 
    russia may have a surrogate in iran but russia as a civilization has bigger fish to fry . 
    russia is far more concerned about germany ( with its eu allies e.g. 
  the vichy part of france ) and its regional surrogate turkey . 
  germany is signalling through its open-border policy its readiness to embrace major parts of the muslim world . 
  such an alignment is nothing new to germany as it tries to outplay its historic arch-nemesis , russia , in the middle east . 
    iran is russia 's regional counterweight surrogate to germany 's regional surrogate turkey . 
    the calculating is that it is better to have the the germanic and slav civilizations play out their rivalry in a region away from their centers of civilization and then go head-to-head locally . 
    so where does the usa fit in this ongoing , historic clash ? 
    here once again , president elect donald trump has got it spot on with his approach to russia . 
  when the major civilizations go head to head russia and the usa will come together , in extremis , in order to protect the survival of their respective civilizations . 
    president elect donald trump 's approach to russia is not a historic aberration but rather is a confirmation of long term usa / russia relations . 
  well ... that 's a little disconcerting . 
  i 'm kind of wanting to know how universal those positions are at breitbart and how closely bannon subscribes to 'em . 
  edit2 : apparently [ harry reid , the democratic leader in the senate , has called for trump to boot bannon out of the white house ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8vf6ydpita ) . 
  that 's the republican speaker of the house , paul ryan , and the democratic leader in the senate at least that are fighting with bannon , with bannon having declared that he wanted to `` destroy '' ryan . 
  edit3 : [ 169 house democrats call on trump to ax bannon ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/house-democrats-trump-steve-bannon-231497 ), 
   the total of $ 32.69 bn is 1.3 % greater than the budget approved for 2016 . 
  note that this is in nominal , not real terms , and that the ecb is [ predicting euro inflation for 2017 of 1.2 % ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/indic/forecast/html/table_hist_hicp.en.html ) , so it 's about a 0.1 % increase in real terms . 
  france is expected to see [ real gdp growth in 2017 of 1.5 % ] ( https://www.banque-france.fr/uploads/tx_bdfgrandesdates/economic-projections-june-2016.pdf ) , causing this to be a further decrease in percent-of-gdp terms . 
  well ... there are really `` bending the rules '' ways for each branch of government to create a constitutional crisis . 
  * the supreme court could have someone petition for a ruling on something fundamental and vital to another branch , grant cert , and put out a crippling ruling . 
  * the legislature could pass laws that would make it impractical for the president or supreme court to operate . 
  * the president could command the federal resources to do things that would make it impractical for the supreme court or the legislature to operate . 
  so , in that sense , yeah , they can all produce a massive showdown . 
  but what i mean is that in , say , the british system , the pm can * always * be recalled if the party is unhappy with him .
