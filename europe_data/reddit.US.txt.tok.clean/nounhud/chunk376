  so a lot of how-significant what pence says is comes down to how much trump chooses to allow him to do and how much he chooses to listen to his advice . 
  `` the vice presidency is not worth a bucket of warm piss . '', 
  -- john garner , vp under fdr cheney was important because bush let him do a lot and paid attention to his advice . 
  we do n't yet know exactly how this will play out . 
   no one really respects trump that 's just because they have n't had an opportunity to talk with him yet . 
  you just wait until he grabs merkel in the pussy . 
  they 'll get on fantastically . 
  he 's not helping , at any rate . 
  the national guards are federalizable by the federal government . 
  they have to come if they 're federalized . 
  state defense forces do not . 
   america - for better or for worse - has fighting in its dna . 
  genetically , the us is mostly european . 
  we already have a wall along significant chunks of the border . 
  i do n't even see how he has to back out at all . 
  he just extends 'em a bit and he 's done . 
  i still do n't have fully-automated construction . 
  gon na be awesome when it happens . 
  the single city with the most tourists per year is hong kong , and it 's pretty modern . 
  http://blog.euromonitor.com/2016/01/top-100-city-destinations-ranking-2016.html in order : * hong kong * london * singapore * bankok * paris * macau * dubai * shenzhen * new york city * istanbul that 's a fair collection of cities with modern buildings in the top ten . 
  no , but it might be a good idea , politically . 
  both the eu and the us have significantly-worse unemployment for the poorly-educated . 
  http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/employment_statistics  the employment rate of those who had completed a tertiary ( short-cycle tertiary , bachelor 's , master 's or doctoral levels ( or equivalents ) ) education was 82.7 % across the eu-28 in 2015 ( see table 3 ) , much higher than the rate ( 52.6 % ) for those who had attained no more than a primary or lower secondary education . 
  the eu-28 employment rate of persons with at most an upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education was 70.7 % . 
  the largest falls in employment rates since the beginning of the financial and economic crisis ( comparing 2008 with 2015 ) were witnessed for persons with at most a primary or lower secondary education ( down 3.8 percentage points ) , while notably smaller falls were observed for persons with a tertiary education and persons with at most an upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education ( both down 1.1 percentage points ) . 
  hmm . 
  if true , that does n't seem like a class issue , though . 
  there is , but lower . 
  [ eu ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/1 ) [ us ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-states-unemployment-rate.png?s=usurtot&amp;v=201611051022r&amp;d1=20110101&amp;d2=20161231 ) [ us state and similar area breakdown ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_unemployment_rate ) the us as a whole is comparable to the lowest countries in the eu , and there 's a wide span . 
  in particular , major eu economies like france and italy are high . 
  that being said , disability fraud in the us probably causes some people to not be counted as unemployed , but disabled . 
  oh , right , right . 
  good point !, 
   that being said i find direct democracy of referendums to be the most fair and ethically correct ways of conducting voting in a pressing issue . 
  far cheaper to make ten men aware of the details of an issue than ten million men aware of the details of an issue . 
   people know the globalized economy is n't working for them . 
  only the elites fail to understand that reality . 
  [ labor-heavy low-education assembly-line jobs are n't coming back ] ( http://washingtonmonthly.com/2016/06/29/what-donald-trump-gets-wrong-about-u-s-manufacturing/ ) , regardless of what barriers to trade are put in place . 
  it 's cheaper to automate now that we have the technology . 
  could probably do a pretty good number on any kid on the ground , head the way the swing is going , rolled onto his side when the car comes forward and traps him between the car and the rocks . 
  the page i referenced also includes illegal immigrant demographics from twenty years ago -- ecuador 's ranking was still the same . 
  my point is that the dominant issue is where you were . 
  there are places in the us with a lot of vietnamese and places with pretty much zero . 
  if you 're in a cluster of ecuadorians , you 're going to see ecuadorians . 
  the distribution of various immigrant groups is n't all that homogenous . 
   the right and libertarian fringe are much more consistent on this issue . 
  there are libertarians who advocate for a borderless world ( assuming you 're using the term to refer to right-libertarians ; dunno about the left 's position ) . 
  did n't you orthodox people kick it off before that with the [ byzantine iconoclasm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_iconoclasm ) ? 
   the left has become so preoccupied with civil rights that it seems to have forgotten about social rights , and if it wants to start winning again , it needs to stop fetishizing minorities and start to address the problems of a majority that is defined not by race , sex , nationality or sexual orientation , but by class . 
  well , here 's your [ gini coefficients ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) . 
  from the world bank data , of the countries in the world with the lowest gini coefficients ( most equal share of income ) , of the 25 lowest countries , 19 were european . 
  i mean , i guess you could push it arbitrarily-far ( `` we need a little more equality of income !, 
  '' ) , but by-and-large , europe has pretty flat income . 
  no it wo n't . 
  it 's not some magic coincidence that the parties have a stable position somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 % . 
  if one party started losing out , they 'd shift their position to move toward 50 % . 
  the us system will always tend toward two centrist parties . 
   the us calls the left ` liberals ' because that 's the further left you can get in the us , liberalism is centrist , not left . 
  that 's not why . 
  [ it was a function of liberals adopting left-wing policies in the new deal era .

  yeah , but the problem is that given any close election , numerous factors could have swung the vote . 
  huh . 
   sinclaire campaigned in the united states elections , 2012 in richmond , virginia . 
  sinclaire supported tim kaine in his successful bid to become a senator for virginia . 
  [ 45 ] sinclaire also canvassed for support for president obama . 
  [ 46 ] ( tim kaine was hillary 's running mate up until trump beat them . ), 
  surprising amount of political-link-building-efforts from your `` break away from the eu '' politicians with us politicians . 
  yeah , but he 's still not gon na have the us bail 'em out . 
  i mean , it 's cheap to urge germany , france , and company to do so . 
  [ * bastion * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjy7nhwrdio ), 
  seems difficult to enforce . 
  * the barrier to becoming a news site is low . 
  * you can set up a news site anywhere in the world . 
  * while there some industries that have intense disclosure requirements ( like working in finance over here , you have to disclose your stock trades even if you 're just married to someone who might have access to insider information ) , this is rare , and i do n't think that it 'd be practical to track or impose them . 
  remember that bribes do n't have to be explicitly quid-pro-quo or monetary . 
  how do you say that someone hiring someone 's cousin was n't just because they happened to be the best at their job , or that someone paying a very high price for some artwork did n't happen just because they * really * wanted that artwork ? 
   cnn and other orgs did n't take marching orders directly from their government cnn does n't have the government tell it what to write . 
  we do have government-run broadcasters -- voice of america , radio free liberty/radio europe -- but they 're pretty explicit about being a us broadcast . 
  they also have legislatively-mandated editorial independence , though obviously there 's no way to prove that it has n't been violated . 
  there are ways that the government can influence media . 
  i mean , the government gives press conferences to release information to the media , and the white house press secretary can spin that as best he can if he 's trying to promote a particular view . 
  if the president gives a speech , he can phrase things however he wants . 
  bush gave many speeches where he mentioned al qaeda and saddam hussein in close proximity without ever * explicitly * claiming that hussein had anything to do with 9/11 , and a majority of americans wound up believing that hussein was responsible . 
  but cnn and the other major news networks in the us do not take instructions from the government as to their broadcasts . 
  they may well have bias from looking at something from a us position or from wanting to appeal to the audience , but that 's a different affair , and all media will have that . 
   but we here in europe bombed our self back in the stone age 70 years ago . 
  ok germany bombed europe back in the stone age . 
  actually , the bombing bit was mostly us and the brits . 
  anglo-american strategic bombers , according to official sources of the west german government in 1962 , dropped 2,690,000 metric tons of bombs on continental europe ; 1,350,000 tons were dropped on germany within its 1937 boundaries ; 180,000 tons on austria and the balkans ; 590,000 tons on france ; 370,000 tons on italy ; and 200,000 tons on miscellaneous targets such as bohemia , slovakia and poland . 
  by contrast , germany dropped a total of 74,172 tons of bombs as well as v-1 and v-2 rockets and `` buzz bombs '' on britain -- five percent of what the anglo-saxons rained down on germany . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_bombing_during_world_war_ii you guys probably fired more shells , though . 
  according to that [ martens centre eu report that was posted a while back ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54q2ry/the_bear_in_sheeps_clothing_russias/ ) , the bulk of the money moscow spends targets countries in the east of europe , not the west . 
  i was surprised too .
