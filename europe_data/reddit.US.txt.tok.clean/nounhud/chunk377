  [ that observation has been made before ] ( https://www.youtube.com/v/nh0ac5hupdu?autoplay=1&amp;start=88&amp;end=95 ) . 
  hmm . 
  as far as i know , putin did n't produce brexit -- i 've seen `` the eu sucks and makes life horrible for this british housewife '' - type articles on rt , but i do n't think that rt was a dominant factor in this class of things compared to other british media . 
  also , farage has been doing his `` attack the eu '' thing since before putin was in office . 
  ukip dates to 1993 ... putin took office in 2000 . 
  i 'm just saying that i think that it would be a mistake to conflate farage with official british policy -- think of taking le pen as official french policy . 
  well , it 'll depend on region . 
  but greatly outnumbered by north americans . 
  http://immigration.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceid=000845 top ten countries of origin for illegal immigrants in the us : | country | continent | count | | - | - | - :| | mexico | north america | 6,720,000 | | el salvador | north america | 690,000 | | guatemala | north america | 560,000 | | honduras | north america | 360,000 | | philippines | asia | 310,000 | | india | asia | 260,000 | | korea | asia | 230,000 | | china | asia | 210,000 | | ecuador | south america | 170,000 | | vietnam | asia | 160,000 | not sure how much of that phenomenon is due to the [ dari\u00e9n gap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dari%c3%a9n_gap ) left in the [ pan american highway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-american_highway ) . 
  ( entertaining note : this is over 10 % of el salvador 's population illegally in the us ), 
  nothing wrong with protesting , but that 's not the same as being the one throwing things . 
  think that that guy with the gashed head is going to say `` hey , those guys have a reasonable point ... i 'm gon na knock it off '' or do you think that he 's gon na just feel justified in using violence next time * he 's * the one with the brick or the bar or whatever ? 
  i mean , i 'm sure that there were a number of factors , and some states started earlier . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_in_europe#history  abolition has been common in european history , but has only been a real trend since the end of the second world war when human rights became a particular priority . 
  the kingdom of italy had abolished the death penalty for civilians with the adoption of the zanardelli penal code of 1889 , but the fascists had reintroduced it with the 1930 penal code . 
    the european convention on human rights was adopted in 1950 , but some countries took many years to ratify it . 
   first time i actually think of the uk as my enemy . 
  well , i do n't believe that the uk or its government is out doing so . 
  farage has his own projects . 
   these added system mean that we can actually ask for lower budgetary percentages , like 0.5 % or as you say 1.8 , and actually achieve more . 
  this is a pr win , especially since the agreement is democratic rather than dictated the 2 % commitment was agreed upon by representatives of all nato members , each of which had a democratically-elected government agree to it . 
  if you want to additionally do an eu army ( and i would think that the eu needs a common foreign policy as well for that to work , but whatever ) , that 's fine . 
  there 's no conflict . 
  the eu army will simply enjoy a minimum amount of resources available to it . 
   the 2 % floor for military budgets does not assure our security , it 's a joke . 
  2 % of nothing is nothing , and small countries are running on very little to begin with . 
  2 % of many small amounts adds up to 2 % of the eu 's gdp , which is not a small amount . 
  also , all members sat down and collectively established that level as acceptable . 
   it 's not realistic to expect anything to come of it other than making small countries poorer actually , most of the small and poorer countries are doing surprisingly well . 
  it 's countries like germany that make a lot of that gap . 
   and considering the accounting tricks the uk gets away with you ca n't ever know if that 2 % is legit . 
  ca n't be worse than no measurement . 
  if it turns out that there 's a severe problem with gaming the system , we can look at making the thing more-specific . 
  i 'm willing to give a flat 2 % a fair chance , though . 
  less onerous if it works . 
   if you want to support increased eu security and lower american spending here , it 's better to have an actual system of budgeting and requisition across the whole of the eu . 
  that could certainly be part of the implementation . 
  i do n't see why nato should mandate that , though -- that would be out-of-scope for nato . 
  if you 're hell-bent on achieving that via that route , the eu could do that . 
  in fact , in the us , the military is part of the fiscal transfer mechanism , so it might be good for eu stability . 
   one that might take even less than that 2 % , were n't you just complaining a paragraph up that countries might try fancy accounting to avoid it ? 
  no , i think that if members want a different level , they need to actually bring up 1.8 % or whatever and argue for that level being sufficient . 
  `` agree and ignore '' is n't a good route . 
  i think that the percent here is reasonably clear and unambiguous , and no more gameable than most other measurements that i can think of . 
  this also places the burden * comparatively * evenly across the eu . 
  but , if the eu feels that some poorer members are unduly burdened , they can certainly always agree to have wealthier members cover cover part of the poorer members commitment , the way the cap reimburses farmers . 
  our president-elect has made statements that rather than withdrawing from a treaty the us has signed , he might ignore it . 
  that spending does n't do any good if it 's not used for obligations . 
   what 's the benefits of romanians ( which most likely seem to be drunk men or female escorts ) , slovakians etc entering a wealthy nation where culturally is a giant world apart . 
    obviously a fellow northern or western european entering the uk is while not necessarily a benefit , is most likely not a drain either . 
  the cofounders of apple computer were a syrian-american and a polish-american . 
  had a think tank put together a serious set of changes that could broadly be agreed-upon as being viable and promote that . 
  not really leavens fault , though -- they just played to win ( if playing dirty ) . 
  cameron screwed up by allowing a referendum where all leave options were possible merged into one . 
  if nato is n't around then you 're probably going to be going over 2 % . 
   i 'm not against a defence alliance with the us in principle . 
  but all of europe has become militarily dependent on the us . 
  right now , if it starts talking about removing forces a lot of leaders will start groveling , why do you want to see that happen ? 
  and whose fault is that ? 
  we were the primary ones pushing for a floor on european military budgets and the ones to keep nagging about it . 
  a lot of countries agreed to return to 2 % and then just kept cutting . 
  i dunno , have n't similar figures retired with their swiss bank account to pleasant climes before ? 
  who was returned from abroad ? 
  i can think of pinochet ... but who else ? 
   seems so obvious now when you look at it in hindsight . 
  does it ? 
  i did n't think that the formation of the soviet union was obvious . 
  nor the collapse of it , at least at the time it did . 
  people in the ussr might have had a worse standard of living than in the west , but i think it could have continued for some time . 
  north korea 's ability to have managed to keep tottering on is much more surprising to me . 
  i think that it 's worth distinguishing between the guy on the street and whoever these guys are . 
  i do n't know , how many ? 
  i 'd vote for him . 
  reagan worked out all right . 
   do you think most americans would be willing to join an anglosphere political union if it meant that they had to swear allegiance to the queen once again ? 
  no swearing allegiance to kings and queens . 
   ... countries that have broadly similar political structures and systems ; and that also tend to cherish the values of parliamentary government , individual liberty , the rule of law and the free market . 
  the membership list of this club varies quite considerably depending on the author but at its core are the english-speaking `` five eyes '' countries of australia , new zealand , canada and the united states . 
  actually , most of mainland europe has a parliamentary system , and the us does not . 
   and secondly dublin politicians refuse to allow highrise buildings because that would depress the house value of their voters . 
  this is not economically-efficient . 
  yet as homeownership becomes common , it becomes a common issue . 
  i am thinking that maybe countries need to rethink zoning policies in a world where many people are homeowners and also set the rules for allowing more construction . 
  maybe require local zoning boards to provide a queue of housing construction authorizations that are automatically triggered based on change in housing price . 
  north american . 
  not a lot of people from below panama coming in . 
  not even secularism ? 
  is fn religious ? 
   according to sources at the scene , the anti-racism protesters easily outnumbered the nmr marchers , and started pelting them with snowballs and fireworks . 
  foolish . 
  you do n't want to escalate to violence . 
   i guess this is the same as him not caring about catalonia or kurdistan ... 
  i 'd argue that my interpretation would make more sense as an explanation for being in favor of brexit , opposed to a scotexit , and not caring about catalonia or kurdistan . 
   wants nations to be independent and sovereign . 
  i 'm dubious . 
  [ scottish independence : ukip leader nigel farage urges queen to back no vote ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-29170924 ) [ farage says idea sturgeon will call second scottish independence pool after brexit is `` moonshine '' ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14507821.farage_says_idea_sturgeon_will_call_second_scottish_independence_pool_after_brexit_is__moonshine_/ ) that really does n't sound like an idealist hell-bent on national sovereignty ( though i do agree that scotland 's better off staying in , and i kind of wish that all you guys in europe would take the separatism down a couple notches until the current issues are worked out ) . 
  for quite some time after the us was created , the trendy thing to do for the wealthy and governments was to build greek stuff because democracy . 
  sure , it was 1800 years out-of-date , but before the us , it 's what there was to look to for democracy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/architecture_of_the_united_states#greek_revival  greek revival style attracted american architects working in the first half of the 19th century . 
  the young nation , free from britannic protection , was persuaded to be the new athens , that is to say , a foyer for democracy .
