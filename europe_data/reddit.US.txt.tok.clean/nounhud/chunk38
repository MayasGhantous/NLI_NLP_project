  mk 6 was first operationally deployed with dolphins during the vietnam war from 1965 to 1975 and in bahrain from 1986 to 88 . 
  [ 6 ] when an enemy diver is detected by a dolphin , the dolphin approaches from behind and bumps a device into the back of the enemy 's air tank . 
  this device is attached to a buoy which then floats to the surface , alerting the navy personnel of the intruder . 
  sea lions carry a similar device in their mouth , but instead attach it by hand-cuffing one of the enemy 's limbs .

  wow , * all * of those pictures are doing the `` hold the rat right in front of the camera to make it look bigger '' thing that / u/red _ fs was commenting on . 
  this has been an interesting battle in the us over the past couple decades , since it 's one of the few areas where there 's a really active fight over speech restrictions . 
  so , there have clearly been groups who want to ban ideas that they find distasteful or disagreeable , but this runs into the first amendment . 
  historically , pornography in general has had something of a loophole , for which the [ miller test ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miller_test ) has been the criteria since the 1970s . 
  under that , works are not protected by the first amendment ( and thus it is constitutional for the government to make laws against them ) if all of the following criteria for obscenity were met . 
   * whether `` the average person , applying contemporary community standards '' , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest ,   * whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct or excretory functions [ 3 ] specifically defined by applicable state law ,   * whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . 
  [ 4 ] broadly-speaking , over time the interpretation of the first amendment has tended to be strengthened , and it 's been tough to show the third point . 
  since child pornography involving children actually * performing * sex acts necessarily involves those sex acts being performed , it was ruled in [ * new york v. ferber * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_v._ferber ) that this was not protected by the first amendment ; this particular exception passes the high bar of [ strict scrutiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strict_scrutiny ) . 
  in 1996 , congress passed a law , the [ child pornography prevention act of 1996 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/child_pornography_prevention_act_of_1996 ) , which banned content that did * not * merely contain actual minors , but depicted them . 
  this law was challenged in 2002 in [ * ashcroft v. free speech coalition * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ashcroft_v._free_speech_coalition ) and overturned on the grounds that congress had overstepped its powers in banning [ simulated child pornography ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simulated_child_pornography ) because of the * content * -- that only images where the production actually involved minors could be constitutionally-banned . 
  congress then passed the [ protect act of 2003 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protect_act_of_2003 ) which banned simulated child pornography that was indistinguishable from real child pornography on enforcement grounds . 
  while parts of this have been challenged in the supreme court and overturned , the core portion of this has not yet been challenged to the us supreme court , so it 's not clear how this will hold up . 
  under current us law , images like the ones in the article are protected by the first amendment , and could not be banned , unless they can not be distinguished from actual images of minors having sex , and as long as they do not pass the miller test . 
  finally , some of the impetus over the debate in banning pornography was the idea that its availability might drive sex crime ; this is a plausible theory , and it had a number of advocates . 
  perhaps the high point of this was the last-hour [ ted bundy confession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ted_bundy#pathology ) :  on the afternoon before he was executed bundy granted an interview to james dobson , a psychologist and founder of the christian evangelical organization focus on the family . 
  [ 317 ] he used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic `` roots '' of his crimes . 
  `` it happened in stages , gradually '' , he said . 
  `` my experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality , is once you become addicted to it ... 
  i would keep looking for more potent , more explicit , more graphic kinds of material . 
  until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it . 
  '' [ 318 ] violence in the media , he said , `` particularly sexualized violence '' , sent boys `` down the road to being ted bundys . 
  '' [ 319 ] the fbi , he suggested , should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave . 
  [ 6 ] `` you are going to kill me , '' he said , `` and that will protect society from me . 
  but out there are many , many more people who are addicted to pornography , and you are doing nothing about that . 
  '' [ 319 ]   multiple biographers , [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] researchers , [ 323 ] and other observers [ 324 ] have concluded that bundy 's sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to dobson 's agenda as a longtime anti-pornography advocate , telling him precisely what he wanted to hear . 
  [ 325 ] while he asserted in the dobson interview that detective magazines and other reading material had `` corrupted '' him and `` fueled [ his ] fantasies ... to the point of becoming a serial killer '' , in a 1977 letter to ann rule he wrote , `` who in the world reads these publications ? 
  i have never purchased such a magazine , and [ on only ] two or three occasions have i ever picked one up . 
  '' [ 326 ] he told michaud and aynsworth in 1980 , and hagmaier the night before he spoke to dobson , that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer . 
  [ 327 ] `` the problem was n't pornography '' , wrote dekle .
