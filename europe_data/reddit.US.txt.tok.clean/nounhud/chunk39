  `` the problem was bundy . 
  '' [ 328 ] over subsequent years , however , a number of studies on the issue wound up finding a [ negative ] ( http://www.hawaii.edu/pcss/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1999-pornography-rape-sex-crimes-japan.html ) correlation between availability of pornography and sex crime -- that is , pornography availability not only was not associated with increased sex crime , but was associated with decreased sex crime . 
  that 's more-or-less where things stand today , with the added wrinkle that the internet has made it much-more-difficult for countries to apply their own particular standards on pornography , where those are not common to the rest of the world .

  that 's potentially a lot more-compelling than gen. breedlove saying that he was theorizing about it , but it 's still not clear from the story whether this is based on intelligence or not .

  also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_general_of_nato  because nato 's chief military officer , the supreme allied commander europe , is traditionally an american , the secretary general has traditionally been a european . 
  there is nothing to preclude a canadian or american from becoming the secretary general , but everyone to occupy the post to date has been european . 
  many articles seem to reference the `` decided they did n't like it , went home '' bit . 
  i think that this might be because it presents a marvelous solution to the issue for many people involved -- no legal or financial or whatnot obligations . 
  however :  last year , 150,000 afghans arrived in germany . 
  the german authorities estimate less that half qualify for asylum . 
    german officials say that at present , a tiny number of afghans -- 1,600 , according to estimates given to them by afghan officials in germany -- are willing to go back home voluntarily . 
  that 's about 1 % of the people involved , assuming that that represents the backlog of one year . 
  this is not going to substantially-affect the challenges involved .

  i 'm not used to gradients being used in logos , probably because most logos are designed to be also usable in places where gradients ca n't be easily-used ( embossing , etc ) .

   if i were living in germany i 'd buy a flat now before prices rise too much . 
  really ? 
  if i were living in germany i 'd stay away from real estate purchases so that when prices go down i do n't lose money . 
  also , thoughts on what nationalist and their opposing parties would best do : if i were trying to plan what nationalist parties should do with this , i would not suggest that they try to swing further towards nationalism , but rather use the crisis as a way to break the taboo over voting for a nationalist party . 
  that would be beneficial to them past the present crisis . 
  being seen as a comparatively-centrist political party that is willing to make difficult-but-practical calls in the interest of the public in their country would break the biggest weapon that their political opponents have had against them -- portraying them as a dangerous unknown . 
  for incumbent parties * opposed * to nationalist parties , i 'd think that their best strategy would be to explain that there is a plan and that this plan is one that will likely succeed and that it protects the interests of the public in their country . 
  their biggest risk is being seen as not having a plan , or having a plan that is seen as quixotic . 
  a pain and a constraint to sell one 's policies to the public , perhaps , but that 's democracy for you . 
  if you do n't sell your policies , your political opposition will provide their own , unflattering explanations for them . 
  from the outside looking in , i do n't think that the predominant public interest is nationalism per se , but a desire to see limited migration . 
  while i realize that some of the nationalist parties have taboos associated with them , many people here have explicitly-stated that they are not particularly-happy about this or that nationalistic party , but that they believe that they will honestly limit migration . 
  thus , these parties can credibly present themselves as an option to limit migration . 
  there is no other public real input to control migration . 
  i think that few parties other than nationalist ones have said `` our platform will be limiting migration '' , and it 's not as if any eu member states have a popular referendum on whether-or-not to do so or provided a mechanism other than giving another party power . 
  major figures within the eu have not , by-and-large , credibly-stated that they will limit migration or control it . 
  chancellor merkel has said that she `` expects '' that most asylum-seekers will return , and she presumably has political or other reasons for choosing her words in such a way , but obviously to a member of the public that is less-than-convincing . 
  what if they * do n't * return ? 
  what if migrants wind up being dropped on them ? 
  none of the eu leaders have proposed eu-wide policies that would result in hard deadlines or limits . 
  it seems to me ( and , i would think , to others ) that it is entirely-possible that the migration crisis seen today could continue and expand in scope . 
  nor do i think that this is specific to europe : almost every other country around the world has strongly-limited intake . 
  so i 'd say that this is a comparatively non-nationalist position which expresses itself via the growth in influence of nationalist parties . 
  i think that you 'd see similar patterns if , say , the greens or the center-right were the only party that was seen as credibly claiming to limit migration . 
  secondly , currently any eu member has the ability to admit more people to the eu by simply setting immigration policy that permits more people in . 
  once citizenship is granted , that person receives the perks of eu citizenship granted by other eu members . 
  individual eu members have no way to veto or control this . 
  because it would be unreasonable for citizens of an eu member to demand that the immigration policies of another member be limited , the only real option that appears is considering leaving the eu . 
  as nationalist parties are also , as far as i can tell , the most-credibly eurosceptic , this again becomes a reason to vote for nationalist parties . 
  within a democracy , a person 's membership is important -- it confers political power . 
  within a wealthy country , access to the labor market is important , as it sets income . 
  both of these are obviously things that the public has real interests in wanting to control . 
  and i think that many people are reaching for the most-viable lever that they have to do something about this . 
  so , to be blunt , i think that the rise in political support for nationalist parties has two not-particularly-nationalist concerns at its core , where supporting a nationalist party is the only ( if imperfect ) option available : * concern over control of migration to one 's own country . 
  * concern over control of migration into other eu members , due to the state of present cross-member eu controls over migration into the eu . 
  so , fred bloggs or sven svensson or hr . 
  og fru jensen , none of whom have abruptly become far-more-ardent nationalists than they were two years ago , apply the one limited option available to them in the best way that they can see to try to address something that they * do * consider a concern . 
  and thus , the political rise of the nationalist parties . 
  this could be addressed by changing policy , but for one reason or another , current leaders within the eu have felt that doing so would not be a good decision . 
  i do n't know whether they made this decision with a full understanding of the extent of the political costs , but whether they have or not ... that 's the decision that was and is taken . 
  eventually , one way or another , my guess is that the current crisis will abate or parties within eu members will take positions that are more-credibly likely to limit the impact of the migrant crisis on their country . 
  at that point , my guess is that support for nationalist parties will also fall , unless they have changed their image and policies to be more appealing to the general public by that time .
