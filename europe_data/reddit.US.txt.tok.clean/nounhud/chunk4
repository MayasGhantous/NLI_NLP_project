  [ 4 ] the swiss government had a decentralised structure , so even the federal president was a relatively powerless official with no authority to surrender the country . 
  indeed , swiss citizens had been instructed to regard any surrender broadcast as enemy lies and resist to the end . 
    as a consequence , general guisan developed his famous r\u00e9duit national concept in summer 1940 , according to which the swiss army would have retreated into the alps relatively soon if attacked , but would have kept up resistance based on some sort of guerrilla and stay-behind tactics from there . 
  the swiss paramilitary organization aktion nationaler widerstand ( resistant national action ) , formed from contacts between selected army figures and conservative civilian circles , had the explicit task to persuade the civilian population to resist invaders . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   the main strategy , however , was deterrence rather than fighting . 
  even though tiny switzerland had an army of only 430,000 men , germany never risked invasion . 
  on 20 august 1945 , general guisan left his command , considering his mission to be fulfilled . 
    having become a national hero by successfully avoiding war , [ 8 ] guisan died in pully on 7 april 1960 . 
  switzerland 's situation is somewhat-specialized -- germany had a ticking clock to contend with and a finite number of troops , and could n't afford to tie up her military dealing with a long and drawn-out resistance , which is precisely what guisan was threatening -- denying germany a stand-up , knock-down fight that could have been completed quickly . 
  still , it 's an even-more-recent example . 
  russia 's not nk-like ... not yet , at any rate , and i doubt it would be in the near future . 
  there 's a pretty substantial difference between `` government is aggressive , has friction with neighbors , does some objectionable extrajudicial things and involves itself in media '' and `` country is effectively fully-isolated from the rest of the world in a perpetual state of faux war '' .

   the only reason russia invaded crimea is because there was a pro-western completely legitimate '' '' '' '' `` color revolution '' '' '' '' '' in ukraine that threatened to take away their only warm water port . 
  russia has other warm-water ports -- the phrase `` only warm water port '' and russia was afaik primarily a big deal wrt port arthur , since it was the only warm-water port access on the pacific . 
  even in the black sea , she has more ports -- the largest of which is the [ port of novorossiysk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_novorossiysk ) -- just nothing as large and well-suited . 
  on a side note , global warming will probably be advantageous to russia in terms of warm-water port access .

  google translate output : russia and zimbabwe have agreed to fight together with the us and eu sanctions . 
  it is reported by tass , citing the statement of the intergovernmental commission on economic cooperation at a meeting in the capital harare african country . 
   `` in addition to expressions of solidarity in condemning the sanctions , we must combine our efforts to prevent damage to our economies , which would cause the authors of these unjustified and immoral actions , '' - he said after the committee meeting , minister of foreign affairs of zimbabwe simbarashe mumbengegwi . 
  he also thanked russia for the fact that in 2008 , she , along with china vetoed a draft international sanctions against zimbabwe , which was discussed at an open un security council meeting . 
  the meeting took place in harer during the visit to the russian delegation , headed by industry and trade minister denis manturov . 
  in his speech he talked about the fact that russia and zimbabwe plan to establish a business council , whose first meeting will take place in july 2016 . 
  it also reported that representatives of the two countries agreed to build a complex of platinum production at the field `` darvendeyl '' . 
  the project will be attended by russian state corporation `` rostec '' group `` vi holding '' , vnesheconombank and zimbabwean company pen east mining company . 
  zimbabwe is the third largest in the world reserves of platinum , and the question of cooperation with russia in the development of deposits was back in 2014 . 
  now working in the country 's two largest platinum developer - anglo american platinum and impala platinum . 
  the us and eu imposed sanctions on zimbabwe because of alleged violations of the election of the president and the unjust , in their opinion , the confiscation of farm land . 
  sanctions against russia were introduced in 2014 due to the annexation of crimea and events in ukraine . 
   the `` good european '' germans drag their feet with their nationalistic defence of their uncompetitive insurance companies . 
  i think that europe would probably benefit from more competition there , but is that a fundamental limitation of the eu ? 
  supposing the uk proposed a new act for the eu which placed certain requirements on opening up to competition within the eu . 
  it seems like that could address those concerns , yes ? 
   there is minimal downside for nato membership well : * there 's an expectation of maintaining a level of military spending . 
  which is , admittedly , often-ignored ... * there 's a possibility of being dragged into a conflict that one might have sat out of or dragged into a conflict more-deeply than would have been the case . 
  much of the fighting in world war i and ii wound up being done in mainland europe rather than in scandinavia . 
  * if you want to join a bloc with russia , it 's obviously going to be an issue . 
  * russia has reason to create disincentives , like trade disincentives , to join nato , and there 's the cost of those . 
  * while nato may not mandate something , there may be expectations that would n't exist in the absence of membership . 
  for example , nato members do not have to participate in exercises or host troops . 
  france withdrew from exercise participation for decades and booted out at least us troops , ( if not other nato troops ... dunno what the story was ) , to make a political point . 
  nato did n't require it , but at the time the us was irritable about it . 
  it 's not as if it would have been an issue if the troops had n't been there in the first place . 
  finally , while , yes , you * can * choose to leave at any time , it takes a year 's delay for that to take effect ( i assume so that other members can adapt to the change , shut down bases , etc ) . 
  i mean , true , not during the cold war ... but finland * did * get attacked and part of the country annexed in the winter war . 
   nato has to and i mean has to respond to any form of attack on a member nation . 
  legally , they do . 
  and i agree with your position , that nato would . 
  but that 's not the point -- there are people who are skeptical . 
  latvia might say `` yeah , nato * probably * would ... but the costs of them not doing so are so high for us that we do n't like taking that risk '' . 
  and what really matters most of all is how credible russia finds that guarantee . 
  politically , if soldiers from your country are attacked , that 's going to blanket the news the next day , and that country gets a `` protect the tribe '' vibe going -- it becomes politically-easier to be involved . 
  if that makes for a more-credible deterrent , it seems like a clear win to have people based there . 
  i dunno ... i do n't seem to recall much actual shooting and land annexation in the cold war . 
  not in europe , at any rate . 
  to defend it . 
  how long could it possibly take to distribute them in the event of an actual disaster ? 
   nuclear regulators say waste no longer reaches the river following the last confirmed dumping scandal in 2004 , but anti-nuclear activists say it 's impossible to tell given the level of state secrecy .

  the us state flags are almost all technically-awful . 
  our [ first national flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_union_flag ) * was * [ a corporate flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_india_company#/media/file:flag_of_the_british_east_india_company_\\ ( 1707 \\ ) . svg ) . 
  really ? 
  i actually was on the edge on the blue being too dark . 
  the us has some gold-on-navy-blue state flags , and i 'm [ not really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_indiana ) happy [ with them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_alaska ) -- they seem excessively-dark . 
  from a technical standpoint , it 's not bad . 
  it 's simple fairly-easy to recognize at a distance , though i think a stripe or something would have made it even easier , and i 'm not a rabid fan of lots of stars in general as being overly-detailed . 
  it does n't look like another flag . 
  it 's not another tricolor . 
  the stars were explicitly not tied to the count of member states , which avoids a lot of re-creating flags * a la * the us . 
  it 's timeless -- it does n't try to incorporate something that might later be regretted . 
  the colors are okay . 
  it 's reasonably-clear which side is up -- i ca n't think of any flags that have stars point-down . 
  i think that using three colors instead of two might have been a good idea , as i think that it might make use of color to refer to the flag more-obvious . 
  it avoids being like any member state 's flag ( i guess it 's closest to ukraine , which is n't ( yet , at any rate ) a member ) , which helps avoid political issues . 
   the helicopter rotor , according to witnesses nearby , said it broke off . 
  this solves the pension problem but accelerates the population decline problem . 
  huh . 
  does that provide a route to latvian citizenship ?
