   it is more than the peak reached in the late 1800s when there was an agriculture crisis in sweden . 
  i * strongly * suspect that the author is speaking in absolute terms , not in per-capita terms .

  if you count lakes , the [ swiss military ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_switzerland#lakes_flotilla ) . 
   the contemporary force utilises the aquarius-class ( patrouillenboot 80 ) riverine patrol boats , which are operated by motorboat company 10 of the corps of engineers and which patrol lakes geneva , lucerne , lugano , maggiore and constance . 
  [ * the final end of the austrian navy * ] ( https://suite.io/christopher-eger/3t227m ) , christopher eger  with the end of the cold war and international draw down in military spending that followed hit the austrian military [ which at this time , had two patrol boats as a naval force ] hard . 
  in 1994 the shipyard that bulit the patrol craft , korneuberg werft ag , closed its doors and eliminated the possiblity of overhaul work and replacement craft being built in austria . 
  budget cuts across the board decreed that the patrol boat squadron , along with its vessels be stricken without replacement . 
  on august 30 , 2006 the squadron was dissolved , the flags lowered , and their crews reassigned to other units in the army . 
  this ended over six hundred years of austrian naval history . 
  http://www.neatorama.com/2010/07/05/landlocked-navies-of-the-world/  in the 13th century , the mongolian navy was the largest in the world . 
  it lost that fleet during two failed invasions of japan . 
  since that time , it shrank down to nothing . 
  in the 1930s , the mongolian navy was reborn under the auspices of the soviet union . 
  it received one boat , the sukhbaatar , to patrol lake hovsgal . 
  the soviet-made vessel was dragged overland to that lake . 
  the ship was named after damdiny sukhbaatar , the mongolian leader who drove china out in the 1920s . 
  it , and its successor , the sukhbaatar ii , eventually sank . 
    but as of 2001 , one vessel remains -- the tugboat sukhbaatar iii . 
  it 's manned by seven men , only one of whom knows how to swim . 
  the ship is homeported at khatgal , and it continues its regular patrols of lake hovsgal . 
  but due to financial constraints , the mongolian government privatized its navy in 1997 . 
  so now the sukhbaatar iii supplements its income by hauling freight across the lake . 
  `` unofficial '' i do n't know of any way to determine when to use `` im - '' , `` in - '' , and `` un - '' other than just memorizing them .

  honestly , this is kind of the reaction i get when * national geographic * goes on about culture being destroyed and being tainted by the modern world and all that .

  the [ salton sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salton_sea#latest_instance_of_the_salton_sea ) has an interesting history , which i ca n't help mentioning whenever it comes up :  in 1900 , the california development company began construction of irrigation canals to divert water from the colorado river into the salton sink , a dry lake bed . 
  after construction of these irrigation canals , the salton sink became fertile for a time , allowing farmers to plant crops . 
  [ 12 ]   within two years , the imperial canal became filled with silt from the colorado river . 
  engineers tried to alleviate the blockages to no avail . 
  in 1905 , heavy rainfall and snowmelt caused the colorado river to swell , overrunning a set of headgates for the alamo canal . 
  the resulting flood poured down the canal , breached an imperial valley dike , and ran down two former dry arroyos : the new river in the west , and the alamo river in the east , each about 60 mi ( 97 km ) long . 
  [ 13 ] over about two years , these two newly created rivers sporadically carried the entire volume of the colorado river into the salton sink . 
  [ 9 ]   the southern pacific railroad tried to stop the flooding by dumping earth into the canal 's headgates area , but the effort was not fast enough , and the river eroded deeper and deeper into the dry desert sand of the imperial valley . 
  a large waterfall formed as a result and began cutting rapidly upstream along the path of the alamo canal that now was occupied by the colorado . 
  this waterfall was initially 15 feet ( 4.6 m ) high , but grew to 80 feet ( 24 m ) high before the flow through the breach was stopped . 
  originally , it was feared that the waterfall would recede upstream to the true main path of the colorado , becoming up to 100 to 300 feet ( 30 to 91 m ) high , at which point it would be practically impossible to fix the problem . 
  salton sea   as the basin filled , the town of salton , a southern pacific railroad siding , and torres-martinez native american land were submerged . 
  the sudden influx of water and the lack of any drainage from the basin resulted in the formation of the salton sea . 
  [ 14 ] [ 15 ] note that the area was full of salt flats from the ancient times when the gulf of california stretched further north , and all those have been dissolving and turning it into an increasingly-saline environment . 
  think of it like a reverse netherlands . 
  i 'm imagining this train full of africans and middle easterners running in a loop back and forth between france and the uk . 
  privacy policies are just expressions of policies . 
  they are n't legally binding under anything that i 'm aware of . 
   so the same rules apply to them as to eu citizens , as per the eu anti-discrimination basic law . 
  uh , no ? 
  what anti-discrimination law says `` non-citizens of the eu living in an eu member must be granted the same rights as eu citizens by eu members '' ? 
   us and china gon na be superpowers of 21st century . 
  also the eu , if you guys stop threatening to break up . 
  first , not very diplomatic . 
  that 's the foreign minister as presented by rt , so you can not imagine a more-friendly-to-the-kremlin setting for the statement to be made in . 
  i thought that the french economic minister saying `` if the british leave no banks plus open borders at calais '' was undiplomatic and unwise , and was about to comment how he should leave things to the foreign minister . 
  i think that * people * are just undiplomatic . 
  second , russia has herself not been interested in joining past unions : [ on nato ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato%e2%80%93russia_relations#suggestions_of_russia_joining_nato ) :  in march 2009 , the polish foreign minister , rados\u0142aw sikorski , suggested including russia in nato . 
  [ 67 ] speaking to one of the main polish daily newspapers after the lecture , mr sikorski explained , ' i stand by everything i said , but that does n't mean i 'm inviting russia to join the nato . 
  i simply presented a certain hypothetical vision , a reference to a debate that took place in the nato in the mid-1990s . 
  then , under the clinton administration , there was a debate on whether , and on what terms , russia could become a member of the alliance . 
  ' [ 83 ] russian leadership , however , made it clear russia did not plan to join the alliance , preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level now . 
  in march 2009 , the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . 
  '' [ 67 ] [ on the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union#russia ) :  among the most vocal supporters of russian membership of the eu has been former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ; in october 2008 he said `` i consider russia to be a western country and my plan is for the russian federation to be able to become a member of the european union in the coming years '' and stated that he had this vision for years . 
  [ 229 ] russian permanent representative to the eu vladimir chizhov commented on this by saying that russia has no plans of joining the eu . 
  [ 230 ] russian prime minister vladimir putin has said that russia joining the eu would not be in the interests of either russia or the eu , although he advocated close integration in various dimensions including establishment of four common spaces between russia and the eu , including united economic , educational and scientific spaces as it was declared in the agreement in 2003 . 
  [ 231 ] [ 232 ] [ 233 ] [ 234 ] now , in all fairness , it 's also quite likely that nato and eu members would object to russia 's membership , so it 's possible that those comments were made in light of the fact that no near-term application would succeed anyway . 
  but assuming that those statements are consistent with the continued position of the russian government , the only thing i 'm left with is that this amounts to saying that european countries should join the [ eurasian economic union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_economic_union ) . 
  i had no idea that the [ frapp\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frapp%c3%a9_coffee ) was greek until you said this . 
  i 'd always assumed that it was french . 
  i know , i was all set to argue for hugely-different import quotas on alcohol being a dominant factor .

  you 're not being asked to subsidize anything . 
  well , males 20-30 is what , probably on the order of a fourteenth of your population ? 
  you 'd expect some people from that to go missing . 
  here 's some us [ fbi statistics on missing persons ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2012 ) . 
  about 800,000 cases per year , ~ 95 % of which are closed out . 
  so 40k per year . 
  320m people , and you 've got one missing person that stays gone for each 8000 people and one missing person that is temporarily gone for each 400 people . 
  that 's a lot of people . 
  facebook lets people easily amplify concerns , so that previously , a person gone missing that would have been ignored is suddenly amplified and seen in a different light , and a positive feedback loop exists . 
  this sort of thing is called [ mass hysteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_hysteria ) , and there are plenty of well-documented cases of it . 
  just a couple of decades ago , there was the now absurd-sounding [ day-care sex-abuse hysteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria ) . 
  the thing to do is n't to ask `` has anyone heard of rumors of anything like this '' , and instead to go look for missing-person statistics and see if they 've risen . 
  it 's possible that they have , mind , but unless you do that , you wo n't be able to distinguish between mass hysteria and an actual increase in disappearances . 
  while it 's plausible , i * still * have not seen hard evidence to support this claim . 
  this is n't `` we have intelligence sources that we ca n't disclose that indicate this '' , but an `` i 'm theorizing '' thing . 
  furthermore , as commander of us european command , breedlove has a professional interest in the degree of general concern over russia , since it means that he 's more likely to get us budget directed his way . 
  i am guessing that eucom was not enthralled about the idea of a `` pivot to asia '' . 
  i am not saying that he is wrong . 
  he may be right . 
  i am sure that he has people on his staff that think that this is the most-reasonable explanation . 
  certainly , russia is aware of the effect that the migrant movement is having and has considered its consequences . 
  but russia also has reasons in syria alone for doing what it is doing . 
  i have not seen concrete evidence presented to support claims that this was russia 's intent .
