  and until that happens , i do n't think that he should be making statements like this . 
  proposing it as a hypothetical , sure , that 's okay , and worthy of a discussion . 
  but not making statements about intent as fact . 
  that was the peak as the bubble collapsed . 
  if you treat every peak as the norm , you 're going to call most things that are volatile stagnant . 
   do you think a bankrupt us state would have ever been treated in a similar way ? 
  technically , us states [ can not declare bankruptcy under federal law ] ( http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-07-20/state-cant-declare-bankruptcy.html ) ; they can not legally shed debt like that . 
  that being said , i do n't really know what would actually happen if one managed to screw itself over beyond hope of recovery . 
  thus far , has never come up . 
  edit : well , in 1841 , some [ states did partially default ] ( http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2011-07-29/history-of-debt-defaults-us-states-1840s ) , but they did n't receive federal protection as a result of it : there was no bankruptcy process . 
  i think that one can safely say that that would not be a way to produce political change or shift in sentiments favorable to us interests . 
   the issue with smoking is that it affected non-smokers terribly . 
  in the us , smokers were profitable , because the government * did n't * fund healthcare ( well , directly ) but * did * fund social security , and smokers had a sufficiently-high rate of killing themselves off early that they tended to disproportionately pay into the system without withdrawing . 
  my guess is that there 's some productivity cost associated with an addiction , even if it 's nothing but addiction , simply because it means that people do things like take vape breaks . 
  the question of how to deal with addiction when it 's disconnected from direct health harm beyond the addiction itself is not really a new question , though ... [ wireheading ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wirehead_%28science_fiction%29 ) posed this question before , where we can completely disconnect direct health damage . 
  oh , one other item : * company/product identification this might be important . 
  i , and i suspect many people in the us , can think of irish beer , swiss chocolate , french cheese , german cars , italian leather , and so forth . 
  but ( perhaps because it 's historically been pretty easy for countries to move around and open up locations in multiple states ) i do n't think that many companies have that kind of identification , and few products . 
  maybe texas instruments . 
  few companies . 
  idaho potatoes , california raisins , florida oranges , and georgia peaches are things in the us to some degree , but i do n't know to what degree those marketing efforts stretched overseas . 
  there are a few regions that are internationally-known in association with products : new york with finance , detroit with automobiles , silicon valley with software , hollywood with movies . 
  and i 've seen some maps that reference these ( sometimes describing the whole state as same ) , which makes me suspect that these things play a major role in shaping people 's image of a place . 
  but at least in the us , those are typically regions , not states . 
  outside of maybe the nations in the uk ( scotch , irish , welsh , english ) , i do n't think that regions below the level of a country have a great deal of visibility over here for their products . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indentured_servitude_in_the_americas#north_america the term is not really accurate here , but same kind of idea . 
  i think that you need to flair up . 
   `` these indiscriminate weapons used by both bashar al-assad , and the non-precision use of weapons by the russian forces - i ca n't find any other reason for them other than to cause refugees to be on the move and make them someone else 's problem , '' breedlove said . 
  that 's something to investigate . 
  showing that russia has motive is not the same thing as showing that russia has done this with that intent . 
   after the vw scandal broke the ca dmv had affected owners mail in their registration for destruction , meaning that their cars were defacto lemons that could not be used on public roads . 
  most people returned them under lemon laws and now vw dealers are all screwed . 
  you sure ? 
  i know a vw owner in california , and he simply ca n't legally * sell * the thing any more ... i do n't think that he 's mandated to deregister it . 
  he was pretty angry about it , but not as much as not being able to drive the thing . 
  you 're right about california , though -- the la basin was a disaster in the 1980s , and california has gone to massive and expensive lengths to stop air pollution and has more-restrictive-than-federal requirements . 
  even if no other state went nuts on vw for this and even if there were n't masses of lawyers wanting in on a lucrative class-action suit , that would not go over well in california . 
  i would suggest switching out whatever lawyers you had providing you with legal advice . 
  well , to be fair , that was erdogan giving some silly speech to a domestic audience to for populist appeal , not the foreign ministry making a statement . 
  i would be quite surprised if erdogan bought into it at all , and i certainly do n't think of it as turkey making a statement on something . 
  you can find statements from probably * any * national leader -- go poke around in their campaign speeches for something intended for domestic consumption until you can dig up something that 's awkward on an international level and then treat it as being a statement of the country . 
  it 's actually not that far off in most ways . 
  i think that it 's far more-analogous than to identifying provinces in any european country . 
  * number -- there are 50 states in the us and [ 50 internationally recognized sovereign states with territory located within the common definition of europe and/or membership in international european organisations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_in_europe ) . 
  * population -- europe has a bit over twice the population of the us . 
  that 's not completely-unreasonable to give lower visibility to us states on these grounds , but it 's not that far off . 
  * economy -- europe ( not the eu ) has a gdp of $ 20t , the us of $ 17t . 
  that seems comparable . 
  * culture/language/wealth -- here i think that you might have an argument , since some of what probably makes up someone 's mental image of a country is its culture and language and wealth , and the us is more-homogenous . 
  * foreign policy -- this one certainly is legitimate -- the us has one foreign policy , and europe does not at all . 
  if you think of countries in terms of their foreign policy ( which i think that the general public mostly does not do ) , then it 's an unreasonable comparison . 
  to be fair , a lot of the us international knowledge seems to be driven by pop culture . 
  texas and california have distinct cultures and shapes and a lot of people and have contributed to things that people have probably heard of . 
  alaska has a unique shape , but it does n't have a large population , and it has very little cultural impact on the rest of the world . 
  the european states that americans knew are ones with a large population and that there 's more cultural awareness of in the us , and italy , germany , uk , and ireland were all major contributors of immigrants to the us . 
  i knew extremely-little about most of the balkans until recently , and i 'm the very-abnormal sort who would hang out on a forum about europe . 
  similarly , i ca n't imagine that wyoming is something looms large in the daily life of a typical belgian . 
  [ we were close , dammit !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_tannenbaum ), 
  oooh , the scribbled out `` russia '' labeling `` poland '' is probably more-annoying for europe than the attempts to identify montana as canada is for canadians . 
   people who cross illegaly borders should be arrested and if available deported . 
  the problem is n't the arresting . 
  it 's where you 're going to deport . 
  * if it 's from a place recognized as unsafe , if someone does n't have their identification in a form that you can verify , you can hardly ask the people there whether the person is a legitimate applicant for asylum -- they 'd be quite comfortable saying `` no '' . 
  furthermore , you 'd need to violate the refugee convention ( and some bits of eu law , as i recall , that encode similar requirements ) . 
  while i think that the refugee convention * should * be revised , it 's not an obvious `` do x , done , problem solved '' fix either . 
  * you ca n't deport to turkey , because turkey is n't going to accept people . 
  i do n't know what libya is doing ( or even whether it 's considered safe ) . 
  * if someone is from somalia , afghanistan , or nigeria , they automatically have no refugee convention claim anyway , so they have every interest in refusing to tell you where they are from or lying about it . 
  * for some poor countries , [ remittances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/remittance ) from workers working abroad is a big chunk of their economy -- about a third of eritrea 's . 
  even * aside * from getting rid of sources of potential political unrest , this is a substantial source of income for those countries -- they 've no reason to want to take people in unless they can avoid it either . 
  eh , so was christopher columbus , and look where it got him . 
  turkey is not going to accept them . 
  i am not sure that turkey actually has any legal obligation to do so -- they are n't turks , after all . 
   is a way of buying time for germany to try to find that way of stopping or diverting most of the refugees while fucking over all the transit countries . 
  it 's been , what , a year-and-a-half now ? 
  i mean , i agree with the idea of buying time , but you got ta spend the time you buy on something . 
  there are options out there , but you got ta choose one and do something with it . 
  * the us [ sent people to guantanamo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_sea_signal ) . 
  * australia did the [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) . 
  * it 's possible that a few countries could take everyone in at least the near term in , but it would radically change those countries unless people left -- this means selling the swedish and german ( i guess now only german ) public on some big changes . 
  it would also almost-certainly create problems for federalists in that if these people receive eu citizenship , they will receive freedom of movement and labor , and at least for a generation , i think that this will be very objectionable to other eu members . 
  * sell other eu countries on taking people in . 
  it might be possible if a credible promise could be made that they will not * stay * . 
  maybe . 
  i also do n't understand how people would be kept from illegally-moving within the eu , so this seems like a problem from germany 's standpoint again , but it 's possible that that could be done . 
  * sell turkey on keeping them in turkey . 
  i do n't see this working , simply because it does n't make sense for turkey . 
  and while i imagine that it might be true that there 's more social friction created by pulling a great deal of muslims into the eu , turkey probably faces greater security concerns and is less-able to economically-deal with an influx . 
  * set up [ sezs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_economic_zone ) in other countries to provide labor and start companies in europe setting up factories . 
  i think that that 's one of the more-compelling possibilities for limiting economic pull . 
  * try and sell the us on taking in a bunch itself . 
  the us is very unlikely to be interested in taking people in , and has taken in what amounts to a token number and already touched off a revolt by the majority of state governments against it . 
  this does not eliminate pull factors at all . 
  i am dubious that this will be successful . 
  * walk into an out-of-control zone in libya/syria/etc , drop a military there , and announce that now people are going to be living there . 
  i 've heard some people here suggest this . 
  doing this with the intent of it being permanent will either violate or come close to violating the [ fourth geneva convention , section iii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_geneva_convention#section_iii._occupied_territories ) , which prohibits mass population transfers during occupations . 
  i think that this one is probably inadvisable . 
  * come to some sort of agreement with is/russia/turkey / sa/us/france / uk/kurds/libyan factions/iraqi factions/all other involved parties all over the middle east that everyone is happy with and just get everything functioning again and then start deporting people .
