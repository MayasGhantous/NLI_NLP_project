  given how long people have been working on `` peace in the middle east '' and the fact that the interests of various parties are at odds , this does not seem like a minor undertaking . 
  it was like two posts , dude , and if i were n't american i 'd probably have a hard time resisting comparing russia to the us too , because it 's likely to go over poorly with both . 
  it 's like `` pakistan , the alternative india '' . 
  i have seen germany , greece , russia , austria , hungary , poland , the uk , france and probably others that i forget about get roasted * far * more severely on here than the us does . 
  the us is a big honking country and some people are n't going to like it , and if your red line is `` nobody ever says something remotely-objectionable '' , you 're going to be perpetually unhappy in life .

  it 's possible that this is n't a representative sample -- for example , maybe women are more-likely to just find somewhere to live until there 's an established path forward , and young men are more likely to be out in a crowd at the border trying to push past riot police . 
  < shrug  i only have his viewpoint . 
  broadly-speaking , other indian expats i know have not been very positive about living in india -- but that 's also obviously subject to selection bias , as they are n't a random sample of people in india , but people who chose -- and * worked very hard * to leave . 
  additionally , these people are probably some of the better-off people in india , since they could obtain a good education , and on top of that , the education itself probably colored their views . 
  also , india is one of the countries in the world that i feel like i know the least about from reading and from history , and certainly the `` major '' country that i know the least about . 
  there were a few things that others have mentioned that probably are more-measurable : * i always thought of india as being a peaceful place , probably because gandhi looms so large in india 's international image . 
  a bunch of indian expats described ... i guess you could think of it as kinda strongmen/mafia types running gangs of unpleasant people who control villages and beat people up . 
  * corruption . 
  one indian guy ( a long-standing friend of mine ) described it as what he saw as being the greatest thing holding india 's business world back , and other people i mentioned this to confirmed this being a huge problem . 
  i asked him what he thought would best be done to tackle it and he just shrugged his shoulders and said `` that 's the way it is . 
  i have no idea . '', 
  the combination of population density and poverty has led to some pretty epic slums , which i 've read articles on , and that 's certainly something that you can measure , but obviously there are people who are n't directly impacted by that .

   when ` culture ' is understood only as the difference between an englishman saying ` cake ' and a hungarian saying something like ` torte ' only slightly differently and for different tortes than an anglophone says the word , while still these guys over here have ` babka ' , and ` history ' is understood only as stuff that happened between world war one and before the break up of one national union or the other and which involves static unchanging lines of the now being those of the tomorrow no matter what , and ` language ' barriers are really just opportunities to learn a little bit more about ` culture ' and ` history ' during erasmus ... would n't the same argument apply even more-strongly to us ? 
  i do n't think that merkel 's policies are bizarre , but pacific solution ? 
   it should be no surprise then that russia 's national strategy is to move its frontier as far west as possible . 
  well , nice knowing you , ireland . 
   but more important , they created a maritime trading block that generated massive wealth compared to the soviet alliance ( dragged down as it was by landlocked russia ) . 
  you 're an `` expert in geopolitics '' , right ? 
  i really think that if anything , it 's connected to the strength of more-modern political movements , but if you 're looking for something , sweden was [ relatively-early on the train for eugenics ] ( https://i.imgur.com/s6ukqvn.png ) , which obviously did n't work out that well a few years down the road , and also ran for a comparatively-long time . 
  is there some sort of idiom in german that directly translates to `` i have no plan b '' but actually means something more like `` this is the only route that makes sense '' or `` i am not on the verge of changing direction '' ? 
  because to my ears , saying `` i have no plan b '' just sounds reckless ; the connotation is n't a positive one . 
  there are approaches , like having the eu intercept people at the schengen edge and using the pacific solution , that would be european solutions . 
  they would not involve redistribution , and would n't screw over greece especially ) . 
  it would make no sense to adjust for education here : if a country is producing insufficiently-many highly-skilled workers , it 's entirely-reasonable for it to be the case that that country pays highly-educated workers more , providing a positive roi on that degree . 
  `` ah , '' you might say , `` but what if an employer just pays someone with an advanced degree more for no reason , not because they get a return from it '' ? 
  an employer has no particular reason to segregate people unless they 're getting a return on investment -- if you believe that the market more-or-less works , this is kinda fundamental . 
  i think that the argument you want to make is that skilled worker visa workers tend to make less than native workers , which makes sense -- the skilled workers are being partially-compensated by their sponsorship and route to citizenship . 
  there 's no need for that worker to be less-competent in any way . 
   the listed top h1-b professions require top education , which ca n't be compared with a general nationwide average . 
  right , that 's the point -- romanian _ said that there was no shortage in those professions , and i 'm pointing out that there is . 
  the one where there is n't a legal concept of and ban on hate speech . 
  afaik , germany is n't demanding that facebook do anything about non-german users . 
  the people who are n't on the ship yet are n't in the shower , and they 're going to find out what happened pretty quickly . 
  why does the estonian government want to bring in refugees in this theory ? 
  that 's plainly ridiculous . 
  there are no soldiers in the u.s. navy . 
   honestly i would n't give the german government a god damned inch as there 's no fundamental difference between germany 's demands and china 's < shrug  germany 's presumably going to block facebook in germany unless it plays by germany 's rules . 
  you can withdraw , and someone else will fill the gap . 
  that might be worthwhile if you get a return in global image or it pulls more employees in or something , but there is going to be a cost that that has to outweigh . 
  at the end of the day , it 's german voters who have to say `` we do n't like these restrictive policies and want to loosen them '' , not a us company that wants to apply us standards to germany . 
  i prefer the us-style approach , but that 's something that you 'd have to convince germans of , not just go ahead and do it . 
  well ... yeah , ever since nuclear arsenals became large enough to pretty much do in the other civilization . 
  not really breaking news , though . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't know ... he was n't suggesting that immigration held to the present standards should be shut down . 
  that 's also probably a fair point , though i 've yet to speak to a legal migrant who has expressed that concern . 
  anecdotal , of course . 
  there 's a pretty easy way to see whether there 's a shortage or not -- are wages for a field dramatically-higher ? 
  here are the [ top 100 h1-b professions ] ( http://www.myvisajobs.com/reports/2012-h1b-visa-category.aspx?t=oc ) . 
  pretty much everything on here is well-paid relative to the [ typical worker in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personal_income_in_the_united_states ) :  the overall median income for all 155 million persons over the age of 15 who worked with earnings in 2005 was $ 28,567 . 
  [ 8 ] now , okay , saying `` higher than the norm '' * is * a little bit simplified . 
  for example , a field may be extremely dangerous ( mercenary ) , or maybe only likely to be possible for a few years ( actress ) , or maybe there is an extremely low chance of actually getting into the profession for people trying to enter it ( professional athlete ) , and all of these can also drive wages up . 
  but none of those really apply to the things in that table -- these are simply people skilled in a particular field . 
  that 's the skilled worker visa program working the way it should -- to help address shortages of people in particular fields . 
   fascinating how europe loves social democracy but a simple way to keep wages high is verboten . 
  artificially-inducing shortages is obviously going to keep wages for that field high . 
  it will do so by transferring wealth from workers in non-bottlenecked industries to the workers in the bottlenecked industry . 
  but that 's economically-inefficient . 
   also interesting how now the justification for immigration is skills , when we discuss the unskilled referencing their lack of skills is racist . 
  < shrug  i 'm fine with skilled immigration . 
  i do n't think that talking about people being unskilled is racist ( or if your definition of racist includes that , i 've no problem with you being racist ) . 
  that 's not a constitutional amendment . 
  he 's talking about altering an irs tax rule . 
  i suppose that it could be challenged ( and overturned ) as unconstitutional , though the [ supreme court to date has n't objected to church tax exemptions as unconstitutional in * walz v. tax commission of the city of new york * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walz_v._tax_commission_of_the_city_of_new_york ) :  the court held that there was no nexus between these tax exemptions and the establishment of religion , and that federal or state grants of tax exemption to churches did not violate the first amendment, 
  the professions that h1-b workers enter have wages higher than average , indicating a shortage of that skillset -- ideally their wages would fall off . 
  how does globalism relate to this ? 
  guy 's daughter could have died . 
  on the up side , this guy is definitely going to change europe 's fertility rate . 
  here 's the [ process ] ( https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution/ ) for amending the us constitution . 
  i 'll first extract this tidbit :  the president does not have a constitutional role in the amendment process and then provide a summary of the process : - a.a the federal house of representatives ( the lower house of the us legislature ) proposes , by a two-thirds supermajority , the amendment . 
  - a or - a.b the federal senate ( the upper house of the us legislature ) proposes , by a two-thirds supermajority , the amendment . 
  - or - b a two-thirds supermajority of the state legislatures call for a constitutional convention ( has not yet happened in the history of the us ) . 
  okay , now the thing has been proposed . 
  - the proposed amendment gets sent to all of the state governments . 
  - three-quarters of the state legislatures ratify the amendment . 
  now the constitution is amended . 
  the election of a us president has little impact on the process of constitutional amendment .
