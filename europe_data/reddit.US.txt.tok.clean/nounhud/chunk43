  he does n't get to propose , veto , or do anything -- he 's not involved . 
  he could campaign for it , but so could anyone else . 
  finally , of all the constitution that i suspect is least-likely to be weakened by constitutional amendment , i 'd put the first amendment as the least-likely bit . 
  birthright citizenship * maybe * , but i strongly doubt that people are pissed off enough right now . 
  maybe a hundred years ago . 
  anyone born in the us already has us citizenship . 
  they are n't an immigrant . 
  wow , i had n't realized that [ barbados was so small ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/barbados/@13.1922672,-59.6086596,12z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8c43f1fbae321aa3:0xeec51b38cf4362b ) . 
  [ population density of 660/km2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbados ) , and the largest gap i see on the island without roads in google maps is about 2km square . 
  you could certainly make the point that ppp-adjusted numbers will make the difference less-stark ... but a third of eritrea 's gdp comes from foreign workers sending money back , and for foreign remittances ppp does n't come into play . 
  and even with a ppp adjustment : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd * greece : $ 25,877 * montenegro : $ 14,338 * albania : $ 10,304 * syria : $ 5,100 ( 2010 , will be much lower now , also oil prices dropping will hit this ) * pakistan : $ 4,209 * libya : $ 28,583 ( okay , this one 's legitimately an outlier , though again , oil ) * eritrea : $ 1,299 * iraq : $ 12,417 ( oil ) * nigeria : $ 5,019 ( oil ) * morocco : $ 6,365 * sudan : $ 3,175, 
  there 's also an argument that h1-b skilled worker or skilled worker citizenship quotas might be too low , but that 's not what he was disagreeing with -- he was n't happy with illegal immigration or with the idea of open borders . 
  not a policy i 'd support . 
  some of the most-highly-opposed people i know as regards to illegal immigration are legal migrants . 
  one indian gentleman i spoke to had worked to reach the very highest levels of skill and education in his country , had used that skillset to acquire employment at a software company in the united states , and was proud ( justifiably , in my opinion ) of his accomplishments . 
  he saw simply letting gobs of people waltz in because they chose to ignore the law as an affront to all of the effort that he had put in over time and the rules that he had followed . 
  the idea of open borders made him roll his eyes , and say `` you know , nounhud ... india is not a great place to live . 
  if the us opened its borders , every person in india would come over . 
  you just do n't understand -- it would n't be a few people , but everyone . '', 
  doh , you 're right -- sorry , linked to the wrong page . 
  yup . 
  there are * some * perks to returning home -- common language , more-knowledge of how things work , family connections -- but europe is just so much wealthier that there 's going to be economic draw . 
  greece has a [ per-capita gdp as of 2014 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd ) of $ 21,498.4 . 
  compare to the countries listed above : * no current per-capita gdp data for syria ( probably because it 's not as if any kind of reasonable measurement can be made at the moment ) . 
  the last time data was recorded was 2010 , [ at $ 1,700 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/syria/gdp-per-capita ) , and looking online , it looks like it 's estimated to see gdp contraction of ~ 15-16 % per year . 
  additionally , oil was a big chunk of its exports , and oil has just collapsed in price . 
  * pakistan : $ 1,316 * libya : $ 6,573.4 ( also an oil producer ) * eritrea : last recorded in 2011 at $ 544 . 
  * somalia : $ 542 * iraq : $ 6,420 ( also an oil producer ) * nigeria : $ 3,203.3 ( also an oil producer ) * morocco : $ 3,190 * sudan : $ 1,875 to be blunt , these people can probably be pulling in a good deal more money in europe -- even in greece , though obviously berlin or london would be preferable -- by competing for even unskilled labor slots than they can back home . 
  they can undersell existing people in the market , raise their standard of living , and even if that standard of living is unimpressive by europe 's standards , it 's pretty good by standards back home . 
   many migrants are voluntarily returning from northern european countries i 've seen one article about returns , and that was much-less than the intake . 
  the point of calling poison gas rooms showers back in nazi germany was that people would n't resist entering . 
  if a ship is going to take people back to their country of origin , you 're probably going to have a more-difficult time getting people onboard . 
  if you say `` this is housing '' , it 's easier to get a load of people onboard . 
   4 million in ireland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ireland  population : 6,378,000 [ 3 ] ( as of 2011 ), 
  * the two largest cruise ships in the world are the [ ms * allure of the seas * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_allure_of_the_seas ) and the [ ms * oasis of the seas * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_oasis_of_the_seas ) . 
  these max out at 6,296 people each . 
  that 's nothing compared to an island . 
  * cruise ships are n't cheap , and if they get trashed , that 's going to be a comparatively-expensive form of housing . 
  the two above ships cost $ 1.4 b ( in 2006 dollars ) each . 
  that 's up to $ 222,363 per migrant in fixed costs alone , discounting inflation . 
  * if this is someone 's clever idea to fill up a ship with unresisting migrants and then sail it back to their home country and dump them off there a la german `` showers '' , that 's not going to work . 
  people have cell phones now , so you can only get the first load to go without complaint , and there is n't enough shipping capacity to hold a substantial chunk of people in that first load . 
  greece is still probably better-off than syria , pakistan , libya , eritria , somalia , iraq , nigeria , morocco , and sudan . 
  plus , there 's always a chance that an opportunity to head north will show up . 
  i still think that the pacific solution is a better idea than this , since that addresses both of these issues . 
  why do people * create * animated gifs , a format that was never intended to store real-world video , after the late 90s , is a better question . 
   for example this soundbite from pmq it 's just a trainwreck cameron in that clip made me the most-sympathetic i 've been to corbyn yet , and i 'm no corbyn fan . 
  makes him look like a kid born to blue-collar workers who grew up to become a union leader ? 
  but , yes , i get your point . 
  the guy should try applying in the us . 
  i work with a number of born-overseas people with advanced degrees . 
  seems to work well for them . 
  i realize that it 's not the point of your metaphor , but an interesting bit of history : [ lobster used to be cheap -- here 's how that changed ] ( http://io9.gizmodo.com/lobster-used-to-be-cheap-heres-how-that-changed-1705612697 ) also , apparently [ global warming has been greatly-increasing the numbers of lobsters ] ( http://ideas.time.com/2012/08/22/why-cheap-lobsters-arent-a-bargain/ ) and driving their price down . 
  there may be concern that some refugees will eventually get citizenship , but surely not yet , and without citizenship , they wo n't be able to vote . 
  i thought that it was frustrating that wage * floors * were so popular , but this leaves me even more clueless . 
  if it fails , i blame the us !, 
  or maybe russia . 
  the italian cavalry , however , * did * charge a british tank column in africa in world war ii : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amedeo_guillet  guillet 's most important battle happened towards the end of january 1941 at cher\u00f9 when he decided to attack enemy armoured units . 
  at the end of 1940 , the allied forces faced guillet on the road to amba alagi , and specifically , in the proximity of cher\u00f9 . 
  he was entrusted by duca amedeo of aosta with the task of delaying the allied advance from the north-west . 
  the battles and skirmishes in which this young lieutenant was a protagonist ( amedeo did not have the appropriates rank , but he commanded an entire brigade ) are boldly written in the british bulletins of war . 
  the `` devilries '' that he created from day to day , almost seen as a game , explains why the british called him not only `` knight from other times '' but also the italian `` lawrence of arabia '' . 
  horse charges with unsheathed sword , guns , incendiary and hand bombs against the armoured troops had a daily cadence . 
  a look at official documents show that in january 1941 at cher\u00f9 '' ... with the task of protecting the withdrawal of the battalions ... with skillful maneuver and intuition of a commander ... 
  in an entire day of furious combats on foot and horseback , he charged many times while leading his units , assaulting the preponderant adversary ( in number and means ) soldiers of an enemy regiment , setting tanks on fire , reaching the flank of the enemy 's artilleries ... although huge losses of men , ... capt. 
  guillet , ... in a particularly difficult moment of this hard fight , guided with disregard of danger , an attack against enemy tanks with hand bombs and benzine bottles setting two on fire while a third managed to escape while in flames . 
  `` in those months many proud italians died , including many brave eritreans who fought without fear for a king and a people who they never saw or knew . 
  even today , the `` devil commander '' uses words of deep respect and admiration for that proud population to whom he feels himself in debt as a soldier , italian and man . 
  he never stops to repeat that `` the eritreans are the prussians of africa without the defects of the prussians '' . 
  his actions had the hoped success and saved the lives of thousands of italians and eritreans who withdrew in the territory better known as the amba alagi . 
  at dawn gulliet charged against steel weapons with only swords , guns and hand bombs at a column of tanks . 
  he passed unhurt through the british forces who were caught unaware . 
  amedeo then returned to the steps in order to recharge . 
  in the meantime , the british succeeded to organize themselves and fire at raised zero with their howitzers . 
  the shells ripped open the chests of guillet 's horses before exploding . 
  it was the last cavalry charge that british forces faced as well as one of the last in the history of warfare . 
  guillet then turned to charge again . 
  in the meantime however , the british had organized themselves and fired horizontally with their howitzers . 
  while that was costly , the italians also did pull off a successful major cavalry charge against the ussr : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charge_of_the_savoia_cavalleria_at_isbuscenskij  on august 24 at 3:30 am an italian mounted exploring patrol , sent to recon s.h. 213,5 , made contact with the enemy . 
  the soviets , having lost the element of surprise , opened fire on the entire line . 
    with the camp under fire , col. bettoni cazzago had no choice but to order , as a last resort , a cavalry charge with drawn sabers and hand grenades against entrenched infantry . 
    while the horse drawn artillery ( so called `` flying batteries '' or voloire in piedmontese language ) quickly deployed its four pieces and opened fire , the machine guns deployed at the front of the italian camp and started firing back . 
    col. bettoni cazzago ordered then the 2nd squadron ( over 100 horsemen ) to attack the enemy on the left flank . 
  under command of cpt . 
  de leone , the squadron began a winding maneuver through a gorge , succeeding in engaging the enemy at the left end of the front , outflanking it and storming it longitudinally with drawn sabers and hand grenades . 
    corporal lolli , unable to draw , as his saber was frozen in its sheath , charged holding high a hand grenade ; trumpeter carenzi , having to handle both trumpet and pistol , shot by mistake his own horse in the head . 
  [ 2 ]   some horses , even though riddled by bullets , would keep galloping for hundreds of meters , squirting blood at every beat , suddenly collapsing only a while after their actual death . 
  [ 3 ]   after having crossed just about half of the enemy line the strength of the squadron was already reduced by half , and the commander himself was grounded . 
    realizing that the 2nd squadron was taking heavy casualties , and perceiving through his binoculars that the enemy riflemen , after the horsemen had jumped over their holes , would get up and shoot at their back , col. bettoni ordered the 4th squadron to dismount and launch a frontal attack . 
  this would allow the 2nd squadron to regroup behind enemy lines and perform the return-charge . 
    the 4th squadron was led by cpt . 
  silvano abb\u00e0 , an olympic bronze medalist with a passion for photography , who was killed while leading his men and was awarded the gold medal . 
    once the 2nd squadron was back , its commander urged a new attack . 
  this was performed by 3rd squadron , led by the impatient cpt . 
  marchio , who rushed frontally to the enemy without taking the detour through the gorge at the side of the battlefield . 
  major litta modigliani decided on his own accord to join the 3rd squadron charge , together with the remaining horsemen of the command personnel , a dozen of them . 
    all action had ceased by 9:30 am . 
    32 cavalrymen had died , including the commanders of the 3rd and 4th squadrons , 52 were wounded . 
  well over 100 horses were also lost . 
  the enemy had left behind 150 dead , 300 wounded , 600 prisoners ( among which some estonian platoons equipped with italian uniforms taken from the sforzesca division ) , 4 cannons , 10 mortars and 50 machine guns .
