  [ 4 ]   shortly afterwards some german liaison cavalry officers arrived . 
  they were deployed at the left of the savoia and they had witnessed everything from the neighbouring heights . 
  they expressed their wonder and admiration for the anachronistic episode to bettoni cazzago saying : `` colonel , this kind of things , we can not do them anymore '' . 
  [ 5 ]   after removing the wounded and the dead , the battlefield remained covered of dead horses . 
    given that the relatively high casualties would prevent the launching of any more charges , should the need arise , cmd . 
  bettoni decided not to pursue the enemy , which thus retained a solid foothold on the west bank of the don river . 
  however the `` isbushenskij charge '' , as it was then named , temporarily relieved the whole area of enemy pressure , delayed by 24 hs . 
  the full soviet attack on tschebotarewskij , and likelly bought time for the routed `` sforzesca '' division to seek safety . 
  [ 4 ]   the bold action was repaid with a gold medal to the regiment standard and to captain abb\u00e0 and major litta modigliani who died in action . 
  another 54 silver medals and 49 war crosses were also awarded . 
  yes . 
  and what i 've seen from people who are more-familiar with the era supports this . 
  here 's a quick reference : https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/3042/why-didnt-france-and-uk-invade-germany-september-3rd-1939  and from what i see those thoughts were reasonable - if an allied offensive , no matter how poorly prepared , took place , the allies would soon be in berlin . 
  hitler left only 23 divisions on western front , while the allies had 110 divisions . 
  and those germans divisions were poorly equipped . 
  the french had 4 to 1 advantage in artillery , 80 to 1 advantage in tanks and the germans hardly had any planes there . 
  during nurnberg trial general alfred jodl admitted that the germany would easily be defeated in 1939 if the allies helped the poles . 
  hitler gambled and concentrated the bulk of manpower , as well as nearly all mechanised units and luftwaffe on poland . 
  and it 's not like it was just a logistical challenge of transfering those resources to the western front in case of allied offensive - the poles managed to destroy much of that equipment and that 's the reason why wehrmacht generals asked hitler to postpone the invasion of france for next year . 
  * germany was tied up in poland . 
  this meant that their army was out-of-position to defend against an attack through france , and the british and the french would have been able to move in where they pleased . 
  * germany was not actually that well-prepared for war at the time of the polish invasion -- short tanks , materiel , etc. 
  germany was better-off at the end of the [ phoney war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war ) . 
  * the offensive turned out to hugely-matter . 
  in world war i , the overwhelming story had been that the defender won -- fighting from fortifications with machine guns and supported by artillery was such a benefit that an attacker suffered massive losses . 
  this influenced thinking in world war ii , and so the allies decided to fight a defensive war in the [ battle of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_france ) . 
  that turned out to be a bad move in world war ii , where the use of tanks ( and air power ) had shifted the hand to the attacker . 
  additionally , because the french and british let the germans be the attacker , the germans had the initiative -- they could choose where the battle would be . 
  hitler was able to take a gamble , that the allies would not be able to respond well to a rapid armor-heavy attack in an unexpected region . 
  that gamble was quite successful . 
  had hitler been on the defensive , he would not have enjoyed the ability to make that gamble -- he would have been forced into letting the allies dictate the terms on which the conflict would be fought . 
  hindsight is 20/20 , of course , but things probably would have gone differently for much of europe if that attack had gone through . 
  well , unless the people who wrote the annotation put it in the public domain ( extremely unlikely ) , that 's where the `` author '' portion of the money will be going . 
  the publisher will make some money too . 
  nobody else should have rights , since the original work is in the public domain , so i imagine that that 's about it . 
  i do n't think that any of the statements from european leaders are senseless -- maybe motivated by their interests or the interests of their country , but that 's different . 
  i have my own opinions as to the best way to proceed , but it 's not like hollande stood up and said `` the best way to address the migrant issue is to issue everyone state-funded shirts '' or something like that . 
  if you 're penned up with nothing to do all day and separated from anyone you might have known back home , i actually would n't be surprised . 
  the olympic village is [ somewhat famous for a lot of sex ] ( http://time.com/7554/a-brief-history-of-sex-at-the-olympics/ ) -- the most-fit young people in the world all penned up in one small housing area . 
  same sorta idea . 
  i guess it 's not really a dish , and i do n't know how widely-known they are in europe , but i 'd never even heard the term `` sprat '' in the united states . 
  while i 'd occasionally had sardines in hot sauce in the us on crackers , that was about as close as i got . 
  when i finally tried [ latvian smoked sprats in oil ] ( http://mouth-full-of-sardines.blogspot.com/2012/07/riga-gold-67.html ) , i was astounded . 
  these were * exceptional * . 
  link : * [ gambas pil pil ] ( http://johnnys-kitchen.blogspot.com/2013/04/gambas-pil-pil.html ), 
  i had that once , and completely forgot the name -- i remember being amazed by the sweet taste . 
  thanks for telling me what it was !, 
   romania 's anticorruption prosecutors have uncovered eur 431 million worth of bribes in the corruption cases that they sent to court last year . 
  this sum is comparable to the co-financing needed for romania 's highway construction program for the next three years ( 2016-2018 ) jesus . 
  [ as of 2011 , the dna 's budget was only $ 22m ] ( http://www.acauthorities.org/country/ro ) . 
  edit : and keep in mind , while they probably did n't recover all the money : * some of it will be recovered . 
  * when someone bribes something else , they 're doing so to make * more * money on something else -- so the losses to the country are greater than the amount of bribes . 
  * there 's an additional dissuasive factor in future cases -- i do n't know what that multiplier is , but i strongly suspect that it 's much more than a 1:1 factor .
