  the republican party has its strongest support in the middle of the income scale . 
  hmm . 
  i 'd say that the two american parties * are * pretty moderate ( for whatever version of moderate you have ) simply because the voting system strongly favors two centrist parties . 
  a third party just kills the one of the big two that it 's closer to , which is against its interests . 
  a party that moves away from the center loses control . 
  the flip side of this is that you could view american parties as more comparable to coalitions in a parliamentary system , rather than parties in such a system . 
  within the coalition , there are groups with extreme views , simply because there is no other place to obtain political influence .

   and their forces are very effective , with the two most well known and effective special forces coming from the uk and us ( sas & navy seals ) . 
  nitpick : i 'm dubious that special forces are a substantial chunk of a military 's effectiveness in a situation where it would become vitally necessary to call in nato . 
   pantos ? 
  your comment might have gone over better if you had avoided berating / u/jocap and instead included your explanation of the differences . 
  i had no idea why hungary would want to force stores closed on sunday ; it seems simply economically-senseless to me . 
  for anyone else who is also looking blankly at this , [ an explanation ( well , guesses ) i found online ] ( http://hungarianspectrum.org/2015/03/20/what-is-behind-the-sunday-closing-of-hungarian-retail-stores/ ) . 
  world war ii reparations ? 
  i do n't think so , and i do n't think that it 's just germany wanting to stop the flow of migrants . 
  i do think that there 's a pretty good argument that the eu should cover greece 's costs in dealing with this , since it 's a eu problem that 's being solved for the other eu members at greece 's expense . 
  i still think that the pacific solution makes more sense -- it does n't put the burden on a single member and creates disincentives to come to europe for economic reasons that are at least as great as those created by placing people in greece . 
  just as people talked about brexit ( or british renegotiation ) setting a precedent for europe , so does the eu hanging a member out to dry -- because of that , in the future , members who think that they might be placed in a similar position wo n't be willing to trust that the right thing will be done . 
  it 's difficult to do a lot of agreements if members can only extend a limited amount of trust to each other . 
  and i strongly suspect that there will be bad feelings in greece over this . 
  and finally , if this does n't work -- either because the land borders to macdedonia , bulgaria , and albania ca n't be sealed sufficiently , or because of the sheer difficulty in sealing off a country that does n't want migrants , is full of islands and comparatively-poor seafaring people with boats , and has sea access across the adriatic to other countries -- that 's a lot of goodwill burned for a non-solution . 
  it 's hard to seal borders with a neighbor whose government does not want those borders sealed . 
   in other words , kurdistan could play the role that turkey used to play . 
  i do n't think the author has a very good picture of the role that turkey plays . 
  no , but the defense of some other eu members might be if the uk left . 
  actually , i think that 's probably preferable to all of whatsapp being monitored electronically for political opposition . 
   how most people ( especially on the internet ) think about economics . 
  that was n't really a counter-argument from varoufakis . 
  * guy in audience says that debt-financed spending is n't sustainable . 
  * varoufakis says that cutting spending decreases overall economic activity more than simply the direct reduction in spending . 
  both can be true without conflicting at all . 
   exxonmobil 's public response was to protest against regulatory frameworks , financial incentives and `` protectionist policies , '' which it said were holding industry back . 
  it also called on the us to end its ban on exports of crude oil and lng . 
  huh ? 
  the crude ban removal happened [ in december ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/congressional-leaders-agree-to-lift-40-year-ban-on-oil-exports-1450242995 ) , and it looks like any restriction on lng exports ( which i was n't aware of ) [ was also removed ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f1773832-b5ee-11e5-b147-e5e5bba42e51.html ) . 
  he 's american . 
  he just happens to ardently want the us out of nato . 
  not all eu members are in nato , and the eu has the [ mutual defense clause ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/sede/dv/sede200612mutualdefsolidarityclauses_/sede200612mutualdefsolidarityclauses_en.pdf ) :  if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in accordance with article 5 1 of the united nations charter . 
   and that has nothing to do with the uk i 'm pretty sure that it does . 
  the [ seven years war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_years'_war ) and the next 150 years of british empire expansion meant that big chunks of the world wound up with english as the `` high language '' . 
  i think that most people talking about a `` british accent '' in the us mean [ received pronunciation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/received_pronunciation ) , rather than , say , a [ cockney accent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cockney#cockney_speech ) , which would be referred to as a `` cockney accent '' . 
  hmm . 
  austria has a big incentive to not take the fingerprints of new applicants or people entering so that they ca n't get legally-stuck with responsibility for them by other members ( `` there 's no proof that this person ever passed through austria !, 
  ca n't give him to me ! '' ) . 
  however , those countries should n't really have an incentive to not fingerprint people that they are deporting . 
  i guess that , regardless of solving the `` adjust policies to make it desirable for member countries to fingerprint people entering illegally '' issue , it 's probably possible to get them to fingerprint people being deported without an issue . 
   i honestly do not believe that people who traveled 1000 km through other safe european countries qualifies as refugees that being said , do you want to dump them on greece ? 
  i think that that 's the `` easy '' argument -- `` they do n't conform to the refugee convention 's requirements for preventing penalizing illegal immigration '' . 
  a better one might be `` the refugee convention was not well-designed and should be revamped . '', 
  i 'd think that at least the following should apply : * it should be possible to place some kind of cap on refugee count . 
  the refugee convention makes no provision for this , and theoretically binds switzerland to take in the whole of the population of china if there is a civil war in china and that population applies . 
  this obviously is n't viable -- signatories have signed up for things that they would never actually do . 
  * a major problem is that the economic draw of working in the country in question is huge . 
  the refugee convention was originally intended to patch up europe after world war ii , not permanently authorize flows from around the world . 
  as long as some countries are significantly-wealthier than others , the population of any poor country with a conflict has a huge incentive to immediately head to the wealthiest country they can . 
  i think that removing the bits about requiring freedom of movement and labor and providing welfare on par with that of nationals might make sense -- that the only obligation is to provide for basic needs and to keep someone safe , not to provide an economically-preferable environment to that present back home in peacetime . 
  a country could , of course , choose to permit that , but it is not * mandated * to do so . 
  i think that those are the biggest flaws in the refugee convention as it stands today . 
  fixing those two is really required to make it operate as a way for countries to viably provide a safe haven without making the requirements unrealistic . 
  amnesty international does n't like the us deporting illegal immigrants either . 
  theoretically , someone is gathering fingerprints .

  japan also was n't an ally at that point , but ... 
  `` two casualties in severe paper-cut incident . '', 
  while you 're right in military terminology , the public tends to use it to refer to deaths . 
  hmm , that 's awkward . 
  actually ... i 'm not sure that it is against the law . 
  i mean , it probably crashes into immigration regulations and will result in people being denied entry , but i do n't know whether it actually breaks a country 's law to try to enter a country under a fake name . 
   one of the most one-sided treaty of all time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel#economic_performance  a three-way treaty between the united kingdom , france and belgium governs border controls , with the establishment of control zones wherein the officers of the other nation may exercise limited customs and law enforcement powers . 
  ** for most purposes these are at either end of the tunnel , with the french border controls on the uk side of the tunnel and vice versa . 
  ** for some city-to-city trains , the train is a control zone . 
  why ? 
  i 'd think that it would make sense to do border checks before having people enter the tunnel to avoid having to arrange for seating to send them back . 
  i mean , it 's potentially helpful in that it 's not possible to apply for asylum on british soil -- at least in germany and the us , there are substantial legal benefits to applying for it once already on soil -- and presumably there are more dubious people trying to get from france to the uk through the channel tunnel than visa versa , if that 's what you mean .
