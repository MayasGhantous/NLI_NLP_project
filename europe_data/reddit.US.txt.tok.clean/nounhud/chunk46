  hmm . 
  looking at wikipedia , it 's about halfway in-between what the us uses as a frigate and a destroyer . 
  this ship is in the * aquitaine * class , so 6,000 metric tons , or 5,905 long tons . 
  the current-generation us destroyer is the [ * arleigh burke * - class destroyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arleigh_burke-class_destroyer ) , which displaces half that again . 
  the next-generation us destroyer is the [ * zumwalt * - class destroyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zumwalt-class_destroyer ) , which displaces over twice that . 
  the current us frigate classes are the [ * freedom * - class ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom-class_littoral_combat_ship ) , at 3,444 long tons , and the [ * independence * - class ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence-class_littoral_combat_ship ) , at 3,054 long tons . 
  that being said , the definitions of the classes have shifted dramatically over time towards larger ships , to the point where current ships in a class would have been in a completely different class in terms of displacement if you go far back enough , so a great deal of this is tied to the age of a ship .

  that 's less than half of the present-day uss * zumwalt * , a destroyer . 
  i do think that if one is to classify based on displacement , it would probably make more sense to compare the * languedoc * to ships introduced at the same time , like the uss * zumwalt * . 
  on the other hand , there * are * nations out there which operate ships that are significantly smaller than the * languedoc * that they still describe as destroyers -- argentina is currently operating the [ * almirante brown * - class destroyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almirante_brown-class_destroyer ) , which is only 3,360 long tons full ( though the wikipedia article comments that most nations would treat a ship like this as a frigate ) . 
  edit : just because i was curious , a couple of largest warships of their time : | class | service introduction | service retirement | displacement ( full , long tons ) | | - | - | - | - | | [ * nimitz * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier ) | 1975 | - | 104,000 | | [ * midway * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midway-class_aircraft_carrier ) | 1945 | 1992 | 67,000 \u00b2 | | [ * yamato * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yamato-class_battleship ) | 1937 | 1942 | 72,000 | | [ hms * queen mary * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_queen_mary ) | 1913 | 1916 | 31,650 | | [ * lion * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lion-class_battlecruiser ) | 1912 | 1920 | 30,820 | | [ * warrior * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_warrior_%281860%29 ) | 1861 | 1902 | 9,137 \u00b9 | | [ hms * victoria * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_victoria_%281859%29 ) | 1864 | 1867 | 6,959 \u00b9 | | french ship [ * valmy * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_ship_valmy ) | 1849 | 1856 | 5,826 \u00b9 | | spanish ship [ * nuestra se\u00f1ora de la sant\u00edsima trinidad * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_ship_nuestra_se%c3%b1ora_de_la_sant%c3%adsima_trinidad ) | 1769 | 1805 | 4,950 \u00b9 | \u00b9 may be standard displacement instead of full displacement . 
  \u00b2 at this point , the * yamato * had been sunk . 
  i have to hand it to france for making the most-attractive stealthy design i 've seen . 
  broadly-speaking , stealthy aircraft and ships do n't appeal to me all that much aesthetically ( though , hey , who knows -- maybe it 's just a lack of mental associations with the shape and eventually that will change ) . 
  neither the soviet union nor china claimed to have actually achieved communism -- the parties just claimed that doing so was their ultimate goal . 
  they identified their systems as socialist . 
  the west used the term ( `` communist china '' ) for political reasons and to refer to the fact that they were run by communist parties that espoused ultimately moving to communism . 
   the problem is that they also support staying in the single market . 
  this is an incoherent proposition : it 's impossible to stay in the single market and keep your sovereignty . 
  this man either : * wants a turn to european-member-level economic protectionism against each other * or is willing to say so in hopes of getting eu-wide political power . 
  neither is very reassuring to me . 
  turkey and libya probably are n't going to want hot spots in themselves for substantially the same reasons that italy and greece do n't want hot spots in themselves . 
   to make europe more like the third world i 'm pretty sure that that is n't merkel 's underlying goal . 
  [ world bank global rankings 2014 | logistic performance index ] ( http://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global?sort=asc&amp;order=infrastructure ) has germany as # 1 in the world . 
   i think it 's time to make heavier sanctions , let 's destroy putin 's russia economy . 
  i would suggest that destroying russia 's economy is probably not as effective for getting what one wants than in establishing sanctions and tying the lifting of those sanctions to getting what one wants . 
  well , 70 % of them , if i recall merkel 's quote correctly . 
  i could understand objecting to 30 % of everyone who comes into the eu not leaving , but it 's not as if we know that 30 % will remain this time too . 
  my point is more that it 's not at all clear that this is a permanent situation or that the eu must maintain similar immigration policy in the future . 
  obviously , the general position of people in favor of relatively-open borders has shifted somewhat due to the scale of the influx and due to the problems ( particularly the schengen breakdown ) caused by it . 
  i can see arguments that the uk could make for not wanting to be in the eu . 
  `` i value maintaining the uk 's culture over that of merging with the eu '' , or `` i worry about some members damaging our global economic competitiveness with their economic policy '' or something like that . 
  things that will be an issue over the long term . 
  but `` there 's currently a migrant crisis happening '' seems like it 's an awfully short-term concern to be going separate ways from the rest of the eu on . 
  how many countries * have n't * had a migrant crisis at some point ? 
  supposing three years from now , germany , sweden , and so forth have successfully rounded up the bulk of the people who sought asylum and returned them to their countries of origin . 
  it 's not impossible . 
  then would you want eu membership ? 
  [ not much correlation between per-capita gdp and attitude to eu membership here , which kind of surprises me ] ( http://imgur.com/gy6q4uw ) . 
   is n't something like close to half of all illegal migrants in the us are from asia ( between india and china ) that come over on airplanes and pass through regular immigration checks and then just overstay ? 
  ] ( http://immigration.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceid=000845 ) ~ 8.5 m from latin america , ~ 1.17 m from asia . 
  yeah , i think that `` partial collapse '' is a better word , even if this winds up not being temporary . 
  as far as i know , countries with borders that are n't substantially impacted by the migrant crisis are n't trying to shut them down -- i do n't think that spain and portugal are out trying to re-establish border control . 
   neoclassical libertarian i have no idea what these words mean in conjunction with each other . 
  in the end , the waves ruled britannia . 
    even heavily guarded and builtup ( and expensive ) borders like the iron curtain or the north korea border or the walls between mexico and the usa are letting through millions of people . 
    you surely know a lot about the us . 
  i think that you could have made the same point to / u/allwordsaremadeup -- that most of the the us southern border is not heavily-guarded and built-up -- without insulting him in the process . 
  if every correction on reddit had an attached attack on the original commenter , this would n't be a very pleasant place to be . 
  on a related note , i was looking at those miles of razor wire going up and thinking `` i 'll bet that removing miles of rusty razor wire in the future will kinda suck '' . 
   austria is as european as cheese and wine . 
  [ wine developed in the middle east ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wine ) . 
  the comment you responded to was deleted , so i 'm going to respond here myself and quote it , because i think that it was interesting :  in north america , unless you 're creating game of thrones - incest is as taboo as it gets . 
  you 're far better off talking about the glories of nazi 's in front of a jew than even thinking of incest . 
    i ca n't find any reason to disagree . 
  i think it 's incredibly repulsive and i do n't think most of the world making it illegal is some dumb mistake . 
  just the same as pedophilia or rape . 
    please europe , know your bounds . 
  i know this was a topic in germany not that long ago too . 
  my response :  i think it 's incredibly repulsive and i do n't think most of the world making it illegal is some dumb mistake . 
  i do n't . 
  i mean , i do seem to intuitively be affected by the [ westermarck effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westermarck_effect ) in that i do n't find the idea of sex with a sibling very appealing . 
  but i do n't see it some sort of incredibly-terrible thing that would cause massive problems for society , either . 
  about half of the us states prohibit cousin marriage , but that was a form of [ * preferable * - to-non-cousin marriage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cousin_marriage ) in some societies . 
  we 've seen a wide range of sexual norms in history , and it seems to me that generally , people feel very strongly that whatever * they * grew up with is absolutely right and that any deviation would be horrific . 
  i guess that [ pederasty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pederasty ) would probably rank fairly high on the list of sexual taboos in the west today , but in ancient greece , japan up until fairly recently , and a number of other societies , pederasty was fairly-common . 
  it was n't clear that it wound up creating some sort of catastrophic failure . 
  ditto for [ polygamy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polygamy ) . 
  views on sexual modesty have covered a wide gamut : some societies felt that strong segregation of the sexes was important . 
  women exposing their breasts in public is a social taboo in the uk today , but wearing dresses that leave the breasts exposed [ would have been the norm in minoan civilization ] ( http://www.nmia.com/~jaybird/thomasbakerpaintings/ancient_minoan_costumes.html ) . 
  in sudan , there have been ( and are ) people who considered not wearing clothing below the waist to be normal . 
  in some places in asia , views on kissing were [ quite different from that in the west ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiss#east_asia ) :  instead of kissing , manchu mothers used to show affection for their children by performing fellatio on their male babies , placing its penis in their mouths and stimulating it , since it was not considered a sexual act , while the manchu regarded public kissing with revulsion , which was considered sexual . 
  [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] i 'm not arguing that every culture is as good as any other culture , that there are no measurable benefits to one or another . 
  i think that the attempt in anthropology to avoid harmful-to-having-an-objective-viewpoint by disconnecting the idea of having a `` better '' or `` worse '' culture from study of the culture has unfortunately sometimes spilled over into the idea that the public should take no position on the merits of culture . 
  i have suspicions about the merits of some of these practices . 
  but i also think that people have a strong tendency to attach themselves to the idea that the sexual norms that * they * were raised with are the only ones that can work well in society . 
  cultures * do * tend to create attachment to them -- if they did n't , they would n't be able to propagate to future generations . 
  but i think that it 's a good idea to not automatically fall into an excessive preference for `` the way things were when i was a kid '' . 
  being conservative as a default is reasonable , but if someone 's arguing for a different way of doing things , it 's also necessary to provide an answer that 's something more than a gut feeling coming from the norms that one was raised with . 
  nordics can not into estonia ? 
  well , i also am concerned about the prospect of a surveillance society . 
  however , i think that some people are more-concerned about more influences of the prospect of unrestricted immigration due to no functioning border control at the edge of the eu than just that of terrorist attacks , though . 
  it affects wages , social norms , in a democracy affects political power , affects the viability of the welfare system in those countries , and so forth . 
  supposing , for example , that the fingerprints and border passage data of eu members were discarded after the passport was verified , and only the fingerprints of people who could not be verified ( e.g. 
  people running around with a piece of paper claiming that they are syrian ) were retained . 
  would that address your concerns ? 
  vw is moving in on the austrian wine industry . 
   you really think you can eliminate the french , german , italian , british people just by absorbing their states ? 
  though i think that free movement and similar policies do a great deal to put in place processes that tend to dissolve boundaries between those nationalities , as even things like us speaking on this forum does . 
   they will always prefer their own nationality . 
  we do n't have the vandals or the ostrogoths running around any more . 
  that identity does n't exist any more : clearly it 's the case that it * is * possible for nationalities to divide or combine and mingle . 
  you may feel that that is undesirable , but i do not think that an argument that `` this does not happen '' holds water . 
   i genuinely do not understand this hard-on for the states to have more power . 
  well , first of all , that was originally the intended state of things -- the `` norm '' from which the shift happened was a weaker federal and stronger state governments . 
  but second of all , i think that it 's important in order to let ideas be tried out . 
  [ right on red ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_turn_on_red ) is not a thing in the eu . 
  it was also not a thing in the us , since many people thought that it would be extremely-dangerous . 
  if it had required the entire country to sign on , all at once , it might * never * have happened .
