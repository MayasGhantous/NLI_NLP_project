  however , because individual states could choose whether to adopt it or not , it was able to be adopted by states willing to be the guinea pig . 
  when it worked , other states were able to gradually adopt it , and because of that mechanism , we were able to adopt a policy that probably would n't have otherwise happened . 
  in a world without states able to set their own laws and try things out , with one single powerful central government , that probably would not have happened . 
  us supreme court justice sandra day o'conner 's dissent in [ * gonzales v. raich * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gonzales_v._raich ) sums up this argument very well , i think , in the context of allowing states to opt into medical marijuana : note that although here , she is talking about federalism favorably , that is in contrast to a unitary state -- she is talking about retaining state powers independent of the federal government :  justice o'connor , dissenting , began her opinion by citing * united states v. lopez * , which she followed with a reference to justice louis brandeis 's dissenting opinion in * new state ice co. v. liebmann * :    federalism promotes innovation by allowing for the possibility that `` a single courageous state may , if its citizens choose , serve as a laboratory ; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country ... '' [ 10 ]   o'connor concluded :    relying on congress ' abstract assertions , the court has endorsed making it a federal crime to grow small amounts of marijuana in one 's own home for one 's own medicinal use . 
  this overreaching stifles an express choice by some states , concerned for the lives and liberties of their people , to regulate medical marijuana differently . 
  if i were a california citizen , i would not have voted for the medical marijuana ballot initiative ; if i were a california legislator i would not have supported the compassionate use act . 
  but whatever the wisdom of california 's experiment with medical marijuana , the federalism principles that have driven our commerce clause cases require that room for experiment be protected in this case . 
  furthermore , even beyond the argument that having states-as-laboratories is a good idea , some people have real , different preferences on an ongoing basis . 
  i can choose to live in texas if i want one sort of environment and laws , and california if i want another . 
  if you assume that preferences and norms have geographical correlation , then it is the case that people 's preferences about the society they live in will be better served by having more-distributed authority -- instead of just forcing a least-common-denominator policy on everyone that gets 50 % +1 buy-in from the public , i can live somewhere that does things that i * like * . 
  that does not mean that i am opposed to a federal union . 
  but i disagree very much with the idea that a transfer of state authority to federal authority is an inherent good : i think that there are many reasons to believe that it is * undesirable * in many cases . 
  in some areas , i would certainly rather have more diversity among state laws . 
  i imagine that this would n't resolve the class-action lawsuits , anyway . 
  not unless vw gets big tobacco-style immunity , and that 'd require all the states getting onboard individually and would be unusual .

  well , the article says that most of the legal ones are from the us ( maybe kids born there , family ties , people retiring down south ? ) . 
  my guess is that a substantial chunk of the illegal three million is probably people coming up from less well-off spanish-speaking states nearby , since [ mexico and panama are the wealthiest spanish-speaking states in north america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_north_american_countries_by_gdp_per_capita ) .

  while i think that free movement is important to building a european identity ...  countries not participating in that do not belong in eu and should not have access to the inner market .

  while use of double-negation for emphasis shows up in several [ poor , rural areas in the us ] ( http://microsyntax.sites.yale.edu/negative-concord ) , use of this particular structure is characteristic to aave . 
  when people use this phrase in the sense that it showed up in the meme , it 's to ridicule the person that they 're portraying as having said the thing . 
  i guess it would be zinging them for being proud and poorly-educated . 
   i live in mexico , we do n't have foreigners everywhere like in other countries . 
  [ it 's rising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_mexico#numbers_of_people_by_nationality_in_mexico ) :  mexico is a country of emigration , immigration , refuge , transit , and return migration . 
  according to the 2010 national census , there are 961,121 immigrants registered with the government as living in mexico , the majority of whom are us citizens . 
  [ 1 ] this is almost double the 492,617 foreign-born residents counted in the 2000 census . 
  [ 1 ] according to the intercensal estimate conducted in 2015 , the foreign-born population was 1,007,063 .

  the [ cia world factbook ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bu.html ) does list it among top industries , though :  agriculture : 5.2 %   industry : 27.4 %  services : 67.4 % ( 2015 est. ),

   it 's the same reason why a bank would rather lend money to google rather than a kebab shop .

  ehhh ... the south could still produce cotton after the war . 
  the reason that slavery , rather than indentured servitude ( as was more-common in the north ) became so common was that the south was [ originally malarial , and the not-resistant-to-malaria europeans tended to be severely sick or die in the summer ] ( http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/02/02/malaria-and-the-mason-dixon/ ) . 
  had that not been the case , it 's a pretty good bet that the slave trade would never have reached anything like the levels that it did . 
  i 'd be more suspicious of the following as points of objection : * non - [ compensated abolition of slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compensated_emancipation ) . 
  if slavery were banned ( and at the time , the south was on the verge of losing a deadlock in the senate that it had used to block abolition and ensure that the deadlock remained ) , slave-holding states would be at risk of massive losses . 
  the modern equivalent would be , say , companies taking on debt to buy construction equipment and then all of that construction equipment being taken away .

  i do n't see a reason that putting the operators in a cockpit instead of some distance away makes it more in-line with democracy : it seems like it just increases risk , cost , and the amount of unnecessary stuff you have to have on the aircraft .

  i understand that some of the pressure to make use of temporary work in at least some eu members , like france , is that full-time/regular workers have the state mandating a lot of things of their employers , like making it difficult and expensive to fire people . 
  that makes the risk of taking someone on higher . 
  it sounds like [ france has been shifting towards relaxing those restrictions ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/new-law-aims-to-boost-french-competitiveness/a-18584644 ) , and if so , i 'd expect pressures in favor of temporary workers to fall off . 
  i think that we can all agree that germany 's failure to crack down on the use of child labor is extremely disappointing . 
   more than 20,000 people ehhh . 
  normally people covering protests ( particularly a media source favorable to the protest 's goals , like rt would be here ) will maximize the video field of vision to show as many people as possible while still letting them fall off the edges of the frame , as it makes the protest look larger . 
  there was n't anything like 20k people visible in the video . 
   so other people cant 's see my answers . 
  deleted comments can be expanded . 
  i 'm from the us , and i do n't think that it 'd make sense to shoot it down . 
  i also am skeptical that the us would shoot down an mi-8 that passed across , say , alaska unless us air defense believed that it posed a threat or there was a belief that it was russian national policy and russia had been doing so intentionally and warned . 
  ( ` course , i also would n't want to be in an mi-8 and gambling on that , but ... ) right now , the eu , us ( and turkey now , i guess , since there are sanctions and counter-sanctions between russia and turkey ) effort with russia has been economic . 
  they and russia all clearly prefer that this conflict be economic rather than military , since both sides have refrained from , say , clobbering each other with cruise missiles . 
  i 'm guessing that the eu , the us , and turkey probably have people advising this policy who are specialists in the area , who are well-informed on the costs and benefits , and probably have pretty extensive information available to them on what 's currently happening . 
  i do n't think that i 'd want to gainsay that . 
  finally , as regards estonia 's interests in particular -- i think that it is probably disadvantageous to shoot down the helicopter . 
  estonia probably has her own aircraft ( including civil aviation , not just military ) which probably have clipped russian airspace . 
  estonia would be within her legal rights to bring down russian aircraft in her airspace , but on the other hand , russia would be within her legal rights to bring down estonian aircraft within her airspace . 
  that 's not a win for estonia . 
  finally , a ( conventional ) shooting war is likely to be disadvantageous to eastern europe in particular , since that 's right on the front lines . 
  i can understand frustration , but i think that the best response is probably not military . 
  one possibility might be non-military restrictions tied to airspace violations : e.g. 
  fly an aircraft into someone 's airspace , a fine gets imposed . 
  disregard fines , and sanctions are activated . 
  the country in question can be responsible for recouping fines or establishing rules for air behavior however it wants to avoid pilots incurring fines against it . 
  i expect that if kidnapping becomes the norm , there will probably be measures taken to address it . 
  if your point is that a large incursion could overwhelm estonia 's air defenses and that there are aircraft that could avoid those defenses , i agree , but they 'd also be running afoul of nato , which always has a [ fighter force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) assigned to provide air defense . 
  this rotates , and wikipedia says that that is presently four belgian f-16ams and four spanish typhoons .
