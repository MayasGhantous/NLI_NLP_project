   no , they 're not trying to improve anyone 's commute self-driving cars would improve my commute . 
  having a capable military [ provides for meaningful defensive benefits as well ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/we-asked-a-military-expert-if-the-whole-world-could-conquer-the-united-states ) , even if that 's the only light to judge it in . 
  i 'd think , though , that most countries also want offensive ability -- even against things like piracy on their ships . 
  the world has n't suddenly become a place without any violence , even if europe is n't internally the ongoing barfight that it has been in the past . 
  [ yeah , about that , canada ... ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/john-ivison-nato-allies-miffed-over-canadas-failure-to-meet-defence-spending-commitment ),

  ah , fair enough , thanks for the explanation . 
  < headscratch  [ lisbon treaty , article 42.7 ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-5-general-provisions-on-the-unions-external-action-and-specific-provisions/chapter-2-specific-provisions-on-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/section-2-provisions-on-the-common-security-and-defence-policy/129-article-42.html ) :  if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter . 
  this shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
  it means that all eu members are required to aid any eu member . 
  finland is an eu member ; it must both aid and be aided by other eu members . 
  well , i mean , i guess i can understand the concern , but realistically , i ca n't see how a more-credible guarantee could be made short of fighting russia on a more-frequent basis for the sake of proving a point , which seems like a bad idea .

  there 's no formal requirement , just as there 's no formal requirement that [ nato 's secretary general ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_general_of_nato ) be from europe . 
  it 's just always been that way . 
  wan na go 1:1 on spending and swap the positions on alternate terms ? 
   you do understand that you folks are promoting axis soldiers , right ? 
  as in hitler 's allies and such ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axis_powers see the sidebar `` co-belligerants '' section . 
  finland , iraq , and the soviet union were all co-belligerants with hitler , not allies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/co-belligerence  co-belligerence is the waging of a war in cooperation against a common enemy without a formal treaty of military alliance . 
    co-belligerence is a broader and less precise status of wartime partnership than a formal military alliance . 
  co-belligerents may support each other materially , exchange intelligence and have limited operational coordination . 
  the aims of war in which co-belligerents participate may differ considerably . 
  finland was n't out attacking us or bombing london or trying to create a european empire or whatnot -- their concern was karelia . 
  i think that most people did n't see that as an unreasonable expectation . 
  there was no international support for and quite a bit of international opposition to the ussr 's invasion of karelia , though no country formally-allied with finland . 
  france and the uk even had ( admittedly , somewhat self-serving in that the goal would have been to seize and cut off from germany resources in other scandinavian countries ) promised troops to finland if sweden would permit them transit . 
  the british commonwealth declared war on finland at the soviet union 's insistence and then did absolutely nothing to them . 
  the us refused to even declare war on finland . 
  they were n't seen as enemies or their complaints as unreasonable . 
   big freaking freedom fighters those were ... well , given that the [ overwhelming bulk of karelia 's population had left karelia when the ussr seized it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evacuation_of_finnish_karelia ) , i suppose that they could n't be called `` freedom fighters '' in that they were n't fighting for the freedom of those people . 
  they were fighting for their homes back , though ... 
  we went into korea . 
  [ greece and estonia are also above the threshold ] ( http://www.defenseone.com/politics/2015/06/nato-members-defense-spending-two-charts/116008/ ) . 
   maybe i 'm wrong , but compared to the 80b $ the us is spending ... [ the us spends $ 597.5 b/year , atm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) . 
  though there are obviously other commitments around the world besides the european region , and while a war in europe would probably trump other things and result in available resources being pulled in , maintaining some base on a tropical pacific island also does n't have much to do with europe . 
   france lasted 6 weeks while trying to hold their own ground ( never mind trying to advance into germany ) and the uk were a few bad days away from losing the battle of britain , and this was after having the time since the polish invasion to prepare in fully fledged war-mode . 
  while hindsight is 20/20 , the analyses that i 've read have generally felt that france would have been in a much stronger position had they honored the alliance agreement with poland to attack with n divisions within t time . 
  in world war i , the advantage was with the defender , thanks to machine guns and barbed wire . 
  in world war ii , the advantage was with the attacker , thanks to increases in mobility ( tanks , aircraft , motorization ) that let forces concentrate rapidly against one point . 
  france 's military did n't want to fight germany at the time because she felt that her military was n't prepared . 
  that was true , but neither was germany 's . 
  and while invading poland , germany 's army was split , instead of being concentrated against france . 
  of course , all this is with the benefit of hindsight . 
  nobody predicted the [ battle of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_france ) to go as well for germany as it had . 
  i assumed that this was a domestic interview for russian consumption -- even though it was foreign minister lavrov speaking -- but double-checked , and no , it was an interview with a swedish daily , so it was intended for swedish consumption . 
  beats me . 
   whatever , hopefully it will not fully alienate the few non-kremlinbot russians this subreddit has . 
  `` russia '' can refer to the present state of government . 
  `` russians '' refers to people who happen to be born in an area . 
  `` kremlinbot '' might be a fair class to criticize , but `` russian '' does n't seem to me to be . 
  well , poland and the baltic states are in nato , so the us and canada and the european nato members are on the hook to defend them , just as they would be france or whoever . 
  finland is not , but the eu mutual assistance clause requires eu members to aid finland . 
   first : i think sweden should join nato just for showing russia the middle finger for this threat . 
  it might well be a net benefit -- i think that the eu probably gains from this in particular , since it eliminates one of the main ways that the us and canada could stand on the sidelines in a eu-russia conflict -- but that 's a really awful justification for joining a military alliance . 
  are you referencing something other than this text in the wikipedia article ? 
   russia still claims that the soviet troops did not use their weapons at all . 
    from the interview of mikhail golovatov , ex-commander of `` alpha-group '' : `` the weapons and ammunition that were given to us , were handed over at the end of the operation , so it can be established that not a single shot was fired from our side . 
  but at the time of the assault , our young officer victor shatskikh was mortally wounded in the back . 
  as we have already seized the tv tower and went outside , we came under fire from the windows of the neighboring houses , and leaving from there we had to hide behind the armored vehicles . 
  '' [ 9 ] because the citation there is to `` vpk-news . ru '' . 
  i have no idea how reliable that is , or whether it is reasonable to consider this a statement that russia has made as a country . 
  it could be the officer speaking in an official capacity , but also could just as easily be a personal interview with some soldier -- it would n't be reasonable for every us soldier to be treated as if he established official positions for the united states . 
  i 'm pretty sure that you can find some pretty batshit crazy statements that < random us soldier  has made . 
   should the law pass , foreigners from fellow eu member states will be strictly excluded from social assistance if they do not work in germany or have not acquired social security rights through previous work in germany . 
  so if i understand correctly , this would not affect people who are working . 
  hmm . 
  what about the one-income-household case ? 
  let 's say that you 've a couple where only one of the two is working . 
  does this mean that the non-working one would not receive access to medical benefits without being employed ? 
   snackbar what does that mean ? 
  there 's no obligation to use that money to purchase us-originating arms -- go through the equipment pages for the armies of europe , and you 'll notice that they tend to use europe-originating hardware . 
  and , frankly ... it 's * because * the us maintains a military budget that it can have that industry . 
  europe would increase her ability to produce arms if she had the budget for it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_equipment_of_the_german_army there * is * some us-originating stuff there . 
  the m2 browning , the m82 , the 870 , the fim-92 , the uh-1 . 
  but that 's a tiny fraction of what 's there , and i think everything else originates in europe ( mostly germany ) . 
  no member can be kicked out of nato unwillingly . 
  there 's no provision for that , just for withdrawal . 
  i mean , you could * de facto * do it by having all members but one withdraw , i guess . 
  i think that playing hardball all the time in negotiations probably is n't the most-fruitful way to convince people of something . 
  besides , do you * truly * think that the only way that the us can convince european countries to maintain viable militaries is to use the sledgehammer ? 
  i do n't buy it . 
  i think that there 's a strong tendency for one country or another to eat into military budget , because , hey , all the * other * guys are funding things . 
  that 's an issue , but something that can be solved without trying to throw as much weight as possible around . 
  it 's not as if having a functioning military is some terrible , grave thing that gravely-damages a country 's national interests . 
   it works for the french the french also maintain a conventional military . 
  nuclear weapons are a useful tool , but they 're a very limited one . 
  using them greatly lowers the bar to a nuclear world war iii , and they 're something of a `` not moving or 100,000 kmph '' solution -- the only thing short of actually using them is * threatening * to use them , and that 's very dangerous . 
  it encourages nuclear proliferation , encourages other countries to figure out a way to counter your nuclear arsenal if you keep using it as a club to batter them with , breaks a line that various countries have been slowly firming up against day-to-day use of nuclear weapons . 
  we like [ this * yes , prime minister * link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ) on this sub -- while it 's comedy , the core point is a real one , that the cost of actually making use of nuclear weapons is high , so it constrains their use . 
  the uk had nuclear weapons , and argentina still felt that annexing the falklands was a good idea , because it judged ( probably correctly ) that the uk would not send buenos aires up in a fireball over the falklands . 
  would the uk 's position have been more-influential if it had n't had a viable conventional military ? 
  are you prepared to go to nuclear war over any international dispute that ca n't be handled diplomatically ( and remember that a big part of the ability to handle things diplomatically * is * that there 's the possibility of conventional war ) , to play a `` do what i want or i end the world or at least genocide your population '' game of hardball with everyone ? 
  france has nuclear weapons . 
  there 's a conflict in mali . 
  was france 's response `` turn everything we can in the country into glass '' ?
