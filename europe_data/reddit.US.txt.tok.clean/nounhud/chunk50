  malta has 429,344 people . 
  for representation to be proportional to population , there should be a 189:1 seat ratio in the ep between germany and malta , not the actual 16:1 ratio . 
  besides , / u/kotsaki was complaining that the ratio could n't become too large before federalism broke down , not that there was disproportional representation . 
  my guess is that if the eu were to break up , member country power as independents would tend to look more like something like a function of gdp -- and given that most of the more-populous countries are also presently wealthier on a per-capita basis , a breakup would presumably tend to be disadvantageous to less-populous countries than the present eu system , which is favorable to less-populous countries . 
   79 % want fair distribution of refugees if the english word `` fair '' is at all approximated by the original polls , `` fair '' is a rather shape-shifting word -- it can mean a great variety of things to different readers . 
  it 's kind of like asking `` do you think people should eat too much chocolate ? '', 
  well , no , of course the pollee does n't . 
  after all , `` too much '' chocolate is clearly too much . 
  but the level represented by `` too much '' automatically-adjusts in the reader 's mind to fit the right level . 
  when the poll results come out , the reader of those poll results can say `` ah , yes , sounds sensible to me as well '' . 
  realistically , the eu uses english for interstate communication rather more than india . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_language_in_europe  according to a survey published in 2006 , 13 % of eu citizens speak english as their native language . 
  another 38 % of eu citizens state that they have sufficient skills in english to have a conversation , so the total reach of english in the eu is 51 % . 
  [ 1 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_english-speaking_population  india : 10.35 % english speakers i realize that that 10.35 % probably includes most of the movers and shakers , the educated and medium-large business-operating folks , but it 's still a comparatively-small chunk of the population . 
  in the ec , representation is at a per-country level , right ? 
  that tends to bias ( on a per-person basis ) towards the small members . 
  [ in the ep seat assignments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament ) , germany has 12.8 % , france 9.9 % . 
  those are the big two , but hardly seem to dramatically-outweigh italy ( 9.7 % ) , the uk ( 9.7 % ) , spain ( 7.2 % ) , poland ( 6.8 % ) , romania ( 4.3 % ) , and so forth . 
  true , cyprus , malta and estonia and luxembourg have limited clout , but on the other hand , they 're affecting relatively-few people . 
  and the us has the same structure -- a high house with per-state representation , and a lower house with per-population representation . 
  the largest seat ratio in the ep is the 6 of the smallest members to the 96 of germany , or a 16:1 ratio . 
  the largest seat ratio in the us 's house of representatives is california , with 53 seats , to the smallest ones like wyoming with only 1 seat , or a 53:1 ratio . 
  yet that seems to have a working federal model . 
   ... it has been proven that russia is funneling money to nationalist parties , and this is an indicator if i ever saw one . 
  this benefits russia , to the disadvantage of just about everyone east of the oder . 
  / u/iwillmakeyourgfcum is an fn member ; i would assume that he would n't see russian support for that party as a negative . 
  i 'm kinda lost . 
  the concern you [ had above ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45zt1k/what_is_everyones_opinion_of_a_federalised_europe/d01ilta ) sounded like your concerns were : * you want france to be able to impose protectionist policies ( i 'm assuming tariffs on agricultural imports , as i understand that this is the big french complaint ) . 
  * you did n't want to lose your culture and language ( though you were unhappy that eu leaders were n't trying to create a new , common identity across europe ? ), 
  the issues in your second comment seem to be : * you want to militarily-align with russia , militarily-disconnect with north america and turkey . 
  * you do n't want a common currency . 
  * you do n't want eu-level legislation . 
  * you want everyone to agree on immigration ( i mean , i can understand that , but i do n't see your mechanism for achieving that : it does n't seem to me to be fundamentally-connected to a stronger or weaker central government in the eu ) . 
  * the wealthy parts of the eu do not subsidize the poorer parts . 
  ( to me , that would seem to create greater intra-eu mass population movement into the wealthy areas . ), 
  * you * do * want hefty eu spending ( but , i assume , in a revenue-neutral fashion across states to fit with your fund transfer requirement ) . 
   and there was a political will to create an american nation , a community of destiny , a group of people who did not apologise for being proud of themselves . 
  that sounds kinda grandiose and abstract . 
  i do n't think people moved around quite as much when most people were involved , one way or another , farming and kinda bound to their land . 
  i think that things like erasmus and a very-mobile population are more a modern-day sort of thing . 
  afaik , none of the states had border control then anyway -- if you wanted to move from one to another , you just did it . 
  and my understanding is that it was n't until something like 40 years later , after the war of 1812 , that people started to predominately think of themselves as american rather than as citizens of their state . 
  i think that the initial rationale for confederation was more a bunch of weak states deciding that they did n't like the monopoly-oriented system of trade that the british used to extract money from the colonies , and that they did n't have much hope of standing up to the mighty british empire without banding together . 
  the rationale for federation was that [ the confederation was running into major problems , and the legislators felt that a more-powerful federal government would address those issues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalism_in_the_united_states ) ( correctly , as it turned out ) :  federalism was a political solution for the problems with the articles of confederation which gave little practical authority to the federal government . 
  for example , the articles allowed the continental congress the power to sign treaties and declare war , but it could not raise taxes to pay for an army and all major decisions required a unanimous vote . 
  [ 1 ]   the movement was greatly strengthened by the reaction to shays ' rebellion of 1786 -- 1787 , which was an armed uprising of yeoman farmers in western massachusetts . 
  the rebellion was fueled by a poor economy that was created , in part , by the inability of the federal government to deal effectively with the debt from the american revolutionary war . 
  moreover , the federal government had proven incapable of raising an army to quell the rebellion , so that massachusetts had been forced to raise its own . 
    in 1787 , fifty-five delegates met at a constitutional convention in philadelphia and generated ideas of a bicameral legislature ( united states congress ) , balanced representation of small and large states ( great compromise ) , and checks and balances . 
  james madison stated in a long pre-convention memorandum to delegates that because `` one could hardly expect the state legislatures to take enlightened views on national affairs '' , stronger central government was necessary . 
  [ 2 ] this convention almost immediately dropped its original mandate and instead set about constructing a new constitution of the united states . 
  once the convention concluded and released the constitution for public consumption , the federalist movement became focused on getting the constitution ratified . 
  at least at the time , there were major security concerns [ from not federalizing ] ( http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_08.html ) :  if we are wise enough to preserve the union we may for ages enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation . 
  europe is at a great distance from us . 
  her colonies in our vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance . 
  extensive military establishments can not , in this position , be necessary to our security . 
  but if we should be disunited , and the integral parts should either remain separated , or , which is most probable , should be thrown together into two or three confederacies , we should be , in a short course of time , in the predicament of the continental powers of europe -- our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other . 
  whereas , as i understand the eu 's security concerns : * mena : european members , aside from maybe a greece/turkey matchup , can already handle themselves . 
  * russia : nato is in place and acts as an alternative . 
  * overseas : many eu members probably do n't have a lot of interest in taking part in a falklands war ii ; if anything , the members with overseas territories may be nervous about a lack of support from other members . 
  do you know what turkey 's desired outcome in syria is ? 
  that is , who does turkey want to see running the thing in the long run , if not ypg ? 
  are they currently a viable contender ? 
  things were , frankly , better for people on the western side of the iron curtain . 
  for all of the cost and the potential that western europe expended on the cold war , i 'd still far rather have been in , western europe than in eastern europe . 
  i agree that the refugee crisis is useful to russia . 
  i do not see evidence in the article that putin specifically intended this , however . 
  edit : not that there 's anything wrong about * theorizing * that this might have been an intent , but then the author should have used the title `` i think that vladimir putin * might * be ` making the refugee crisis worse to undermine europe . ' '',

  competition is heating up . 
  there is no way in which doctors without borders could know that this was intentional . 
   msf said its hospital in maarat al-numan was hit by four missiles within minutes of each other . 
    this `` leads us to believe that ... it was n't an accidental attack , that it was deliberate , '' said sam taylor , the spokesman for msf operations in syria . 
  multiple hits is n't evidence for that . 
  it does n't mean that the bomb was simply stray ; it could be that an error was made in targeting . 
  no worries . 
  the submission ui is confusing . 
  it 's a pretty common error to make on reddit ; probably most submitters who have put up a lot of posts have done this at least once . 
  me either , but [ this was interesting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasqsotxkhk ) . 
  you have to submit * either * a text post * or * a link . 
  if you try both , you get a text post . 
  it 's also ridiculous to type out `` bosnia and herzegovina '' every time . 
  i 'd be all for the country coming up with a new ( short ) combined name , but for the interim , outside of formal diplomatic situations , i 'm pretty sure that most people around the world are just going to say `` bosnia '' . 
  same reason people say `` north korea '' instead of the `` democratic people 's republic of korea '' and `` south korea '' instead of the `` republic of korea '' . 
   eu citizenship is a meaningless concept anyway . 
  it 's meaningless : * outside of the eu . 
  within the eu , it provides important rights , including right to labor and free movement . 
  * * for the moment * . 
  if the eu federalizes , it 's very likely that eu citizens will become citizens of the new federal country . 
  suriname : application accepted , neighbor !, 
  canada : application denied , not directly connected to the eu !, 
  edit : also , if you count hans island , canada is directly-connected . 
   you know nothing about the us if you believe there are n't large problems within the hispanic community . 
  the [ worst-off ] ( https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acsbr11-17.pdf ) racial/ethnic groups in the us are native americans , followed by african-americans , only then followed by latinos . 
  same sort of deal with homicide -- african-americans have about eight times the white homicide rate , latinos only about twice . 
  asian-americans are the golden boy ( though also have been subject to the largest effect from merit-based immigration policy , since they were blocked from open immigration for much of the time before the merit-based era , so we kind of got the cream of the world 's crop there ) . 
  also , by setting up bidding and taking the low bidder , the eu can place people in the most-economically-efficient location . 
  relocating people there from countries like germany and sweden as * well * as greece will also mean that it cuts off the hope of `` maybe i can dodge the obstacles in my way and get to the promised land of high pay and good welfare '' .
