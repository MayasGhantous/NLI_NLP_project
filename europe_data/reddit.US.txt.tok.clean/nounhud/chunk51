   germany 's the one who makes the decisions hmm . 
  in what manner ? 
  all eu members have equal representation on a per-country basis in the ec , and while germany is the largest single eu member in population , it 's still only ~ 13 % of the ep . 
  if that 's the metric you 're going to use , i think i 'd head to french guiana . 
  the member states establish the rules of the eu . 
  if they want different rules , there 's no particular reason why different rules could n't be established .

  no particular reason to upend a successful system to move to wind . 
   a wildly undemocratic bureaucracy who seem more concerned with funding their pensions than listening to their people so fix it ? 
   i would rather say greenland part of north america , not europe . 
  statements like that start wars . 
  fucking over greece and italy is also not great from an eu standpoint , because member countries should n't feel like they 're going to get boned by the others . 
  i still have n't seen a proposal that seems more-conducive to eu stability than the pacific solution . 
    they join terrorist organizations like isis and al qaeda   yeah , to usa organisations , lol . 
  i 'm pretty sure that isis and al qaeda are not `` two usa organizations '' . 
  well , to be fair , turkey probably has some pretty profound political concerns -- the countries in question are her neighbors , and i 'm guessing that she 's concerned the long-term prospects of having a hostile bordering country trying to carve away part of her land , which seems understandable . 
  turkey may not be part of the european union , but unless you retake [ east thrace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_thrace ) , it 's in europe . 
  the us definition is actually out-of-whack with the international definition . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_liberalism_in_the_united_states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberalism i suspect that this is for historical political reasons -- because those who self-described as `` liberals '' in the early 1900s were generally-speaking espousing progressive ideals ( though , one might add , these were much-less of a shift to government-centric approaches than radical-left movements at the time would have had ) . 
  for a european equivalent , i 'd point out how a number of advocate-for-the-worker parties in europe have not changed their old `` socialist '' names , despite the fact that they have not advocated for actual socialist policies for many decades now . 
    the root of the problem is why every public sector entity is dying of in ( most ) of eastern europe : too much bureaucracy , and people in leadership positions hire their friends/family as employees so their quality of work is way below zero , because they simply miss the proper qualifications for their positions . 
  huh . 
  i just tried searching online for nepotism statistics , and i do n't really see this data being gathered , though the theory that it might be an important one driving problems in government is an interesting one . 
  it seems like it 'd be viable to measure family relations within an organization . 
  if that data is n't being gathered , at least to do things like extrapolate based on surname weighed by frequency of surname in the area the worker lives .

  my guess is that even stripped of nato , if there were sufficient need , the eu could probably put up somewhere between the second and fourth most-militarily-powerful showing of any political entity in the world . 
  it 's also economically the largest political entity in the world . 
  the bulk of europe , five years after the close of world war ii , was not in the best condition to be off waging war . 
  well , let me rephrase . 
  eulas are intended to be binding , whereas toses are not . 
   your countries trade deal i think that you 're thinking of ttip rather than tpp . 
  i like reading them , but i suppose that you could make an argument that the tpp directly-involves non-european countries ( though i assume that its size will have an indirect impact on europe as well ) . 
  ttip seems like it could be expected to be more-relevant for this forum . 
  did n't say that it did . 
  i 'm assuming that this is mean , not median ? 
   the whole region could be stabilized with ten billion euros . 
  https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/rl33110.pdf  except for a one-time appropriation of $ 20 billion for iraq reconstruction in fy2004 , war-related annual foreign aid and diplomatic operations funding hovered between $ 4 billion and $ 5 billion each year until fy2011 with one exception in fy2010 . 
  when the state department began to designate spending as oco , funding levels rose to $ 11 billion in fy2012 and $ 9 billion in fy2013 , partly due the budgetary advantage of the designation which exempts this funding from budget limits . 
  state/usaid funding fell to $ 6 billion in fy2014 if y' all over there on the other side of the atlantic can pull it off on the cheap , that 'd be great , but we threw rather more money at just iraq without a lot of luck . 
  the total bill ( including security , combat , the above reconstruction , and so forth ) was ~ $ 1.6 t ; that 's also just us spending , not uk , polish , etc. 
  it 's a separate service . 
  somewhat-confusing , admittedly . 
  the `` department of the navy '' is the civilian organization in the federal government that oversees * both * the united states navy and the united states marine corps . 
  however , at the non-civilian , military level , the two services are separate -- they just report to the same civilian office . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_armed_forces  the united states armed forces [ 1 ] are the federal military forces of the united states . 
  they consist of the army , marine corps , navy , air force , and coast guard . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_marine_corps#united_states_navy  the marine corps ' counterpart under the department of the navy is the united states navy . 
  as a result , the navy and marine corps have a close relationship , more so than with other branches of the military . 
  whitepapers and promotional literature have commonly used the phrase `` navy-marine corps team '' , [ 87 ] [ 88 ] or refer to `` the naval service '' . 
  both the chief of naval operations ( cno ) and commandant of the marine corps report directly to the secretary of the navy . 
  how about weighting on a per-capita basis , though ?

  american companies should be aware by now that writing something in your tos does n't mean people actually have to follow it . 
  that might work in the usa but that shit wo n't fly in continental europe . 
  toses are n't , afaik , intended to be binding . 
  they simply enumerate things that the service might choose to boot you off for . 
  eulas are binding , and they 're a lot more controversial , and some of them have not been held up in the us as well . 
  going further back , the antecedents to the medieval christian concept of hell are : * the hebrew [ * sheol * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheol ) and equivalent of the greek [ * hades * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_underworld ) -- underground , a dark place with pale spirits flitting around .

  political influence is the same reason that the award is granted to other people . 
  granting it to a democracy activist in china might just make it politically-unacceptable to kill them ; different form , but it 's the same sort of thing . 
  no , my point is that the awarding was an attempt to provide him with political aid . 
  i 'm afraid that i can not agree . 
  the debate on the ban has no legal impact -- it just uses the weight of the parliament 's image to present trump as being outside of the norm and distasteful . 
  however , obviously obama doing this has no legal impact either . 
  all it does is has political figures condemning things that they see as a negative , and trying to add what weight they can with their image . 
  and just as you might consider this objectionable , so i 'm sure that trump 's supporters ( and probably trump himself ) found parliament 's statements to leave a rather unpleasant taste in their mouths . 
  my guess is that parliament felt that it would be in the best interests of the uk were trump not elected , and thus felt that any negative statements could only help . 
  on the other hand , i also expect that obama sees the possibility of the eu falling apart as being a negative for the us . 
  both probably see themselves as having an official justification for making their arguments . 
   banning trump does n't interfere with american domestic politics .
