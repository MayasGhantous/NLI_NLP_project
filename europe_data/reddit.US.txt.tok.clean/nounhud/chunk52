  surely it would be preferable for greece to -- even if it were a * massive * inconvenience -- set up sealed zones with checking and customs on the borders of greek areas that can be directly-reached , and relocate greeks out of those areas , than it would be to have all of greece act as a holding area ? 
  and surely this would be in the interests of other european countries as well ? 
  just letting greece fill seems to be worse for everyone involved . 
  i imagine that only ~ 10k people is a relatively small problem for europe to find a solution to one way or the other .

  the point is that ukraine was n't a member of nato .

  luxembourg was n't in the group that was being described as `` hard '' , though .

   1 ) people who are very qualified will leave to the western europe , because the wages are so much higher . 
    2 ) people from southern europe will not come to the czech republic ( except for well-paid positions in prague or brno ) , because who would want to work here for czech wages when they can go to germany and get german wages ? 
    3 ) on the other hand western companies will like to invest here , because the do n't have to pay that much to the employees . 
    the employers then will whine about how they do n't have enough skilled people , they will try to force the state to promote technical education in the schools , they will give some interviews to the press , how they really really want more skilled people , but ca n't get any , but the main problem - very low wages will not go away . 
  all three of these points will tend to increase wages in the czech republic . 
  1 and 2 tend to decrease supply of labor . 
  3 tends to increase supply of jobs . 
  both of those tend to cause wages to rise .

  twitter : helping people massively-publicize low-content kneejerk reactions . 
  well , i must say that the idea of `` backfilling '' addresses my concern about international incidents : if the us goes off to fight conflicts being fought by eu members somewhere and frees up eu military members to deal with the eu , that avoids the awkward possibility of us soldiers in a policing role in the eu , so i do like that . 
  and using nato for detection capability was one of the few areas that i thought really made sense -- that * is * something that nato can do well and might be useful . 
  aside from people blaming nato for failing to detect boats , there does n't seem like much potential for problems . 
  so , that 's smart . 
  that being said , this * still * does n't answer the question of what is going to be done with all the people intercepted , which i think is the real problem . 
  and that 's not a problem that nato can solve , but a political issue . 
   oh and do n't forget the agreement we had of not pushing nato more east . 
  http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111767.htm  claim : nato leaders promised at the time of german reunification that the alliance would not expand to the east   fact : no such promise was ever made , and russia has never produced any evidence to back up its claim . 
    every formal decision which nato takes is adopted by consensus and recorded in writing . 
  there is no written record of any such decision having been taken by the alliance : therefore , no such promise can have been made . 
    moreover , at the time of the alleged promise , the warsaw pact still existed . 
  its members did not agree on its dissolution until 1991 . 
  therefore , it is not plausible to suggest that the idea of their accession to nato was on the agenda in 1989 . 
    this was confirmed by former soviet president mikhail gorbachev himself . 
  this is what mr gorbachev said on 15 october 2014 in an interview with rossiiskaya gazeta and russia beyond the headlines :    `` the topic of ` nato expansion ' was not discussed at all , and it was n't brought up in those years . 
  i say this with full responsibility . 
  not a single eastern european country raised the issue , not even after the warsaw pact ceased to exist in 1991 . 
  western leaders did n't bring it up , either . '', 
  russia could do what the cia does and [ require video logged of the use of the munitions ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syrian-sniper-us-tow-missiles-transform-cia-backed-syria-rebels-into-ace-marksmen-fight-against-1526468 ) to ensure that the use is against a target that russia would support . 
  also , as a side-effect , helps guarantee that people are running around with cameras and we wind up with all this first-rate footage available to the public , like this one of the [ fsa destroying the mi-8 russian sar helicopter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/v/f2fmr1xxqpo ) . 
   implying that russia could at back at turkey by supplying the kurds with modern weapons certainly sounds like putin style machismo , especially because its such a stupid idea . 
  might as well just say `` russia stronk '' i agree with him -- i assume you do n't think that i 'm a paid putin supporter ? 
  if turkey , in particular , funds militants , one weakness that turkey has ( and which i could very plausibly see russia exploiting ) is that there are a lot of not-particularly-well-controlled people running around pissed off at turkey who are largely-limited by access to arms . 
  the us has had a history of backing the afghans and other groups with arms ( as is happening now in syria ) . 
  russia ( well , ussr ) dumped ak-47s around the world to try to break colonial powers . 
  the policy is a cost-effective one . 
  supplying weapons probably wo n't expose russia to nato military retaliation , is cheap , low-risk , and hard to stop , and could be damaging to turkey .

  do you believe that eu attempts to strengthen the credit of eurozone countries were done with the intention of facilitating corruption in greece that could then be exploited by german companies ? 
  i have a difficult time with that , even if companies did attempt to involve themselves in corruption once that situation was present . 
  and , further , while some countries * have * made at least some effort to restrict involvement in corruption by multinationals that operate from their territory ( in the us , the [ foreign corrupt practices act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_corrupt_practices_act ) is an example ) , at the end of the day , realistically the bulk of the onus must be on the people of the country buying products to not permit corrupt leadership into power -- it is the money of those people that corrupt leadership steals , and it is the interests of these people who are most-directly violated by such corruption . 
  not really -- i mean , i certainly understand germany and sweden and other eu members pulling large numbers of migrants through greece , but it seems to me that that would happen even if greece had never joined the eu -- it has also affected , say , serbia . 
   the refugee crisis could , with immense effort and courage , have been a collective triumph for europe . 
  instead , it has become a collective failure . 
  throwing in my usual comment about us-based publications making moral criticisms of europe not taking in even more migrants that do n't involve calling for the us to take in a lot of migrants . 
  because it would mean throwing military in to force russia out ? 
  for better or for worse , nato does not admit countries with unresolved territorial disputes . 
  this means that nato members ca n't be dragged into wars by adding members with ongoing conflicts -- it helps ensure that one is signing up for a defensive alliance rather than offensive . 
  while i am certainly sympathetic to the * reasons * that ukraine is in that spot -- it 's not as if ukraine reasonably * could * have joined nato at a point before the invasion -- there are also the existing members of nato to consider . 
  they did not sign up for a `` let 's save everyone who russia is treating badly '' pact , but a `` let 's all agree to a one-for-all-and-all-for-one '' pact . 
  could those members decide to do something like that ? 
  sure , nothing stopping them , but you also ca n't simply sign them up for it . 
  finally , there are some good reasons to not want to increase the conflict in ukraine . 
  the us and the eu have been applying economic pressure to russia . 
  there is , i think , reason to believe that there is a point where russia will say `` this is simply not worth it '' . 
  maybe it 's simply continuing to drain resources further , or maybe it requires some additional pressure . 
  if that can be made to work , it has some real benefits over fighting it out . 
  in korea , there was fighting back-and-forth over the country . 
  it [ seriously damaged a lot of the country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aftermath_of_the_korean_war ) :  according to u.s. estimates , about one million south koreans were killed or went missing in the conflict , 85 % of them civilians .
