  according to figures published in the soviet union , around 1.13 million people , or 11.1 % of the total population , were killed in north korea ( with the total casualties of some 2.5 million ) . 
  more than 80 % of the industrial and public facilities and transportation infrastructure , three-quarters of all government buildings , and half of all housing was destroyed . 
  both south korea and north korea were bombed , but the damage was far greater in north korea . 
  many north koreans took to living in caves , or other shelter . 
  midway through the war , american pilots found that they had no more targets to bomb , every significant target had already been destroyed . 
  in the long run , yeah , south korea was able to rebuild and reconstruct itself . 
  but consider something like that happening in donbas and crimea , which is what would happen if nato went to ( conventional ) war against russia instead of just scaring russia off . 
  you are going to wind up fighting over a blasted landscape of rubble . 
  you 're going to have massive rebuilding efforts , a lot of dead people lost , years of unexploded munitions to clean up . 
  ukraine already has a lot of problems , and if ukraine is aiming for eu accession , trashing a big chunk of the country is not going to help that process along . 
  in the long run , would nato membership for ukraine make sense ? 
  yeah , i think so , and the ukranian population is in favor , and my guess is that nato would grant it . 
  but i think that it would be vastly better for ukraine if russia could be convinced to pull out * without * having to trash the crimea and donbas regions of ukraine severely and probably other regions to a lesser extent . 
   putinbot / u/zurfur75 is pretty critical of the kremlin , frankly . 
  he 's rather-more-cynical about it than i am . 
  * and * he 's an / r/europe mod . 
  if he wanted to astroturf , he probably would n't have a russian flair up . 
  there might be people who are honestly paid to post in support of putin on / r/europe ( though i doubt that this is the case , certainly on any large scale -- the kind of discussion that shows up here tends towards back-and-forth rather than simple spamming of comments ) . 
  there are certainly ( some ) people here who are * supporters * of an aggressive russia or current policies , though i 've seen fewer of them since russia 's economy has started heading downhill . 
  but i have a hard time swallowing that / u/zurfur75 is either , frankly . 
  feel free to read his comment history . 
  just as there are different people and political positions within germany , so there are within russia . 
  he 's explicitly stated that he supports the political opposition in russia a number of times , and has argued a number of times in its support . 
  does he agree with all critics of russia on here ? 
  i 'm sure not . 
  i 'm sure that he does n't agree with the people who say that all russians , as a national characteristic , are out to clobber other countries , and i 'm sure that he 'd like sanctions on russia to end . 
  but that 's very different from being an astroturfur paid to support putin or * even * supporting putin on one 's own ( which is n't what `` putinbot '' would mean , anyway ) . 
  he 's still asserting that that 's the reason that it 's happening * now * . 
   putin 's aim is to foster the eu 's disintegration , and the best way to do so is to flood europe with syrian refugees . 
  i think that a rather-large and not-justified-in-the-article jump has been made from `` russia bombing in syria causes pressures on the eu '' to `` putin * planned * to cause pressure on the eu by bombing in syria '' . 
  russia has straightforward reasons to be bombing in syria without trying to cause pressures on the eu -- to support a russian-allied regime . 
   fiscal union means the countries in it complete lose ability to influence their economy ( they already partially did by forfeiting their national currencies ) , which would be governed by unelected and unquestionable beaurocrats in brussels . 
  it 's easy to see how such policy would lead to a disaster and dissolution of eu . 
  why ? 
  the us has n't seen a disaster and dissolution of the us . 
  all right , but again , i 'm not seeing how eu membership is creating a cost there -- if greece were n't part of the eu , it seems like they 'd still be facing the same issue . 
  your argument is that creditors should not be able to collect on greek bonds if the creditor is outside of greece but within the eu ? 
   are you joking ? 
  http://www.statista.com/statistics/253712/eu-budget-expenditures-by-member-state/ after poland , the second-largest net recipient . 
  i do n't see how debt service would count against that . 
   katanas are actually very fat blades compared to european swords . 
  seems like kind of a broad statement . 
  http://www.sword-buyers-guide.com/sword-thickness-whats-it-do.html  most samurai swords have an average of .28 '' thickness . 
  ( 7.1 mm ) http://www.thearma.org/essays/2hgs.html  the width of the blade is 46 mm , and its thickness is 7.5 mm . 
  i understand that greece is a net recipient of eu funds . 
   australia is 2000 miles from anywhere else in the world . 
  they look like they 're about 100 miles from indonesia and 50 from papua new guinea . 
  that sounds kind of like our post-9 / 11 `` i need policy x that i 've always wanted immediately because terrorists '' justification frenzy . 
  never quite understood why people get upset about * incorporated * businesses but not about * unincorporated * businesses myself . 
   the us federal government has more money yet is also far more bought than any individual state government . 
  how are you measuring this ? 
   for example germany , the netherlands and austria could have a unified fiscal policy , but when you get for example italy in the boat it already is hard | country | [ gdp per capita ( $ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) | index | | - | - | - | | netherlands | 44,333 | 1.00 | | austria | 43,547 | 0.98 | | germany | 41,267 | 0.93 | | italy | 29,847 | 0.67 | well , there is a difference ... | state | [ gdp per capita ( $ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_gdp_per_capita ) | index | | - | - | - | | delaware | 61,183 | 1.00 | | new jersey | 49,430 | 0.81 | | wisconsin | 39,308 | 0.64 | | mississippi | 28,944 | 0.47 | ... yet i 'm not sold that it would block having common fiscal policy . 
  while i am skeptical about the idea of trans-atlantic responsibility for border control -- not that interests conflict , but that there is n't a great deal of interaction between them -- there are some areas in which i do think there could potentially be cooperation . 
  if there * were * to be a guantanamo bay-type holding facility to hold people while their status is being evaluated , that might see `` bursty '' load , and it might be the sort of thing which could be set up as a shared operation to avoid having to just keep an empty camp operational when not needed by one country . 
  could even divvy up space based on current requirements . 
  also , evaluating whether-or-not someone has anything known about them that might cause them to represent a security threat could probably benefit from trans-atlantic cooperation , but i 'd assume that that sort of cooperation already exists . 
   i would consider it a failure not being the first on the us `` black list '' well , you 've failed to have bosnia invade ukraine before anyone else . 
  no meritorious action , no award . 
  sorry , dude . 
  well , the us coast guard is a wing of the military , and a great deal of what they do is stopping ships . 
  i still think , though , that this is not at all a good idea for nato . 
  if european countries want to request aid from other nato members , great , but i do not think that it should be under the aegis of nato . 
  reasons i can think of for the two to want to go through nato would be : * nato has the ability to quickly deploy ships and track other ships . 
  * maybe * , as a stop-gap , nato could be used in a detection role here . 
  i 'm a bit doubtful that turkey and greece do n't have the ability to monitor the space between each other , though . 
  * a quick way for both turkey and greece to get funded , capable-of-operating-on-the-ocean , capable-of-quickly-deploying people from other countries , which have at least some functioning history of interoperation . 
  frontex is * supposed * to be able to pull border patrol resources from other countries , but recently has had poor success in quickly being able to obtain resources . 
  i * really * think that it would be better to fix frontex , though . 
  * an organization that involves turkey already . 
  turkey is non-eu , and not a member of frontex . 
  turkey will have a direct say in nato operations , and will not in frontex ; this might make nato more-appealing from turkey 's standpoint . 
  by involving turkey at a fundamental , decision-making level , turkey winds up in a strong position to avoid being a dumping ground . 
  i 've listed reasons why i do not think that nato makes sense for this and should not be used before , but to recap : * nato 's strong points are that it 's a military organization and is geared up around moving a lot of resources to a point for a limited period of time effectively . 
  frankly , illegal migration from mena is going to be a long-term issue for europe -- it may wax or wane , but it is unlikely to go away . 
  i think that europe probably needs a long-term solution . 
  * i personally do not want the us military in a law-enforcement role in europe . 
  it 's bad for the us , because of the potential for international incidents , and because by-and-large , the us military ( i do n't think that the coast guard typically does work with nato ) is not trained for law enforcement . 
  what you want is some guy with years of diffusing tension , maybe language knowledge , and knowledge of local customs , not some nervous kid with a rifle . 
  even if nothing goes horribly-wrong , the same objections people have to law enforcement are going to be magnified by foreign military . 
  i do not particularly want to force the us to be attached to specific eu domestic policies . 
  * i think that even aside from the us role there are good reasons not to use militaries in a domestic law enforcement role . 
  the [ us prohibits this domestically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/posse_comitatus_act ) , and i understand that at least some european countries have comparable restrictions . 
  * i do not think that the eu suffers from resource limitations on border control , but from political difficulties . 
  i am opposed to using nato as a way to force through policy that * should * be owned by the eu but is unpopular with member states because nobody 's put together a policy acceptable to all the stakeholders . 
  * i do not think that the eu suffers from an inability to identify and stop ships , but difficulties over what to * do * with people once they are stopped . 
  nato probably can not do much to solve that ( admittedly , in the us , the military has [ used guantanamo bay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_sea_signal ) to store people trying to illegally boat into the us , a legally-most-useful place that is controlled by the us military but to significant degree outside legal difficulties imposed by letting people onto us soil -- i do n't think that that applies well here ) . 
  * my guess is that modern naval ships are not generally-geared-up for carrying sketchy people . 
  you probably do n't want a lot of people that you just pulled out of the med wandering around your warship . 
  * my guess is that a lot of the ships available to nato are vast overkill and expensive to operate relative to what is necessary . 
  you do n't need or want an armored destroyer with a huge crew stopping a handful of inflatable boats . 
  * if the eu honestly needs help from specifically the us military , i 'd * still * rather have it be outside nato channels , to keep nato within the proper scope . 
  nato member states do this sort of thing all the time -- the current north african operations are not nato operations , even though they involve nato members . 
  * i think it 's bad for europe , because it allows deferring proper establishment of something that europe needs in the long term -- functioning , eu-level ( okay , schengen-level , whatever ) border control . 
  * i think some people see a parallel to the horn of africa piracy issues , which * was * dealt with by nato . 
  the problem was that nobody expected somalia to be permanently unstable and piracy to just keep running . 
  overpopulation and poverty in africa and in the middle east will probably not end any time soon . 
  edit : wikipedia says that as of december 15th , [ the eu has proposed to transform frontex ( which was intended to coordinate between member nation border control organizations ) into a real eu coast guard and border patrol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex ) :  on 15 december 2015 the european commission presented its proposal for a new european border and coast guard agency that would replace and succeed frontex , having a stronger role and mandate and forming a [ european border and coast guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_border_and_coast_guard ) along with national authorities for border management . 
  that does n't solve the political question of what to do with the people being intercepted , but it addresses the issues of having easily-deployable resources to do the interception , which is i think covers most of the reason for trying to wedge nato into the role . 
   ... men in skirts can have a clue about what is a correct sex life there are some scots and romans that want a word with you !, 
   lecturing the fucking pope not this one .
