  [ some others , though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sexually_active_popes ) . 
    ok , then which court is the one which sets a precedent ? 
    technically none . 
  germany apparently has a civil law system . 
  common law is the system that the uk and the us use where precedent is a relatively-bigger deal . 
   refugees in bulgaria were faced with the risk to remain homeless in the streets and were practically left without medical care i 'd think that that criteria would apply to large numbers of the world 's poor . 
   greece is on standby mode as nato prepares to discuss a joint call from germany and turkey for the atlantic alliance 's involvement in curbing migrant flows in the aegean . 
  ugh , this is not something that i am enthusiastic about . 
  i do n't think that military force is required . 
  i think that it is outside the scope of nato , and that nato is n't * necessary * in that member nations can and do already do things outside nato . 
  i * do * think that it is plunging into highly-politicized european domestic affairs and has strong potential for future political backlash . 
  say a boat stop is botched and a bunch of people drown , say . 
  or say some * other * ship objects to migrants being taken to wherever they 're being taken and tries to play chicken with a nato ship ( as happened with the israel blockade-running attempt ) . 
   the expanded u.s. efforts come at a time when european governments have finally stopped cutting their defense spending and actually begun to increase their investment . 
  :-)  the new u.k. strategic and defense review included a commitment to keep spending 2 percent of gdp on defense , including by increased procurement of much needed equipment . 
  after years of holding spending steady , germany announced a modest increase , much of it going to new procurement . 
  :-d  countries in eastern europe are also making major commitments to boost capabilities , with most of the frontline states pledging to achieve the nato 2 percent level by the end of this decade , if not before . 
  8-d ( though to be fair , eastern europe has already been generally at the forefront ) . 
   merkel is childless so his comment probably hit a bit too close to home . 
  pope francis has taken an vow of celibacy ... 
  well , i suppose that it 's a valid concern -- after all , if the us was upset about ukraine and had a reason to do so , it would have an interest in potentially trying to make false claims that would reflect poorly on russia . 
  i 'm not particularly concerned about that for several reasons ( though , hey , maybe it 's the fact that i 'm from the us that skews my take on things ) : * outside of the russian military , the us ( and nato as a whole ) is probably the source of the most-extensive intelligence on russian military movements . 
  they 've spent immense resources building systems -- satellites , automated image analysis , image enhancement , signals intelligence , intelligence services that can combine the data , and so forth -- specifically to monitor the russian military . 
  * there are three sources of knowledge there : russia , ukraine , and the us ( well , to be fair , nato -- i was just listing numbers provided by the us military ) . 
  russia obviously knows how many soldiers it sent to ukraine . 
  russia claimed that it had zero soldiers in donbas and made a number of other claims about russian involvement that were not very credible -- most people did not buy into the idea that russia did not have military involvement in donbas -- if you recall , there were quite a few people poking fun at the idea of soldiers going `` on vacation '' with heavy artillery , as well as various leaked stories from soldiers who were deployed . 
  ukraine provided an estimate -- they 're obviously fighting and i 'm sure that there are people who support kyiv who will send information about military hardware and soldiers . 
  for things like recording the number of tanks in a column , my guess is that kyiv probably had information available ; i saw plenty of footage on youtube of people with cell-phone recorded video of russian military hardware moving , and i 'm sure that ukraine had people counting up numbers . 
  the us has surveillance data and a lot of resources to do analysis and provided an estimate . 
  ukraine 's and the us 's were broadly in-line with each other . 
  mind , i do n't know if the ukranian estimate and the us estimate were on the same date . 
  * the us benefits from having a reputation of reporting as-accurate-as-it-can accurate data . 
  if it simply lied about what russia was doing , it would be harder to make statements about what russia does in the future . 
  so there is some cost to the us that gives it an incentive to provide accurate data . 
  * there 's little benefit that i can see from claiming particularly high or low numbers here . 
  i imagine that if the benefit were absolutely overwhelming , it could outweigh credibility benefits -- e.g. 
  if the us thought that it could forestall unwanted nuclear war by reporting false numbers , i 'm sure that it would . 
  broadly-speaking , i would say that the us information plan is to highlight things that it finds useful , but not to falsify the material . 
  so there 's inherently some bias -- if russia does something bad , you 'll probably hear about it -- but i am not very worried about * intentionally * wrong troop numbers being posted . 
  opposition to the current government ( and potentially its sanctions ) , i suppose . 
  more-likely to fragment the eu . 
   one in four greeks do not have job quality editing work there , * independent * . 
  well , it 's an estimate , but it 's in-line with others . 
  maybe a bit conservative , but it was given as a lower bound : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_donbass  9,000 -- 12,000 regular russian soldiers ( ukraine & u.s. estimate ) [ 30 ] [ 31 ] the us :  berlin , march 3 ( reuters ) - the u.s. military estimates around 12,000 russian soldiers are supporting pro-moscow separatists in eastern ukraine , u.s. army europe commander ben hodges said on tuesday . 
    the russian forces are made up of military advisers , weapons operators and combat troops , hodges said in a speech in berlin , adding that a further 29,000 soldiers were stationed in the crimea peninsula that moscow annexed from ukraine last year . 
  but my point is that it 's at least ballpark with the number involved earlier . 
   why is it not great to have as big a trade surplus as possible ? 
  let 's say that you adopt a [ mercanitilist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) like policy to try to restrict imports . 
  you send the rest of the world bulgarian-made products without restriction and and slap on high tariffs on imports from the world to bulgaria . 
  now bulgarians are working for `` free '' . 
  they 're not getting anything in trade for the goods that they are producing . 
  bulgarians accumulate , say , gold or some other store of wealth , but their standard-of-living does n't rise . 
  wages for bulgarians become prohibitively-high -- trying to get a burger or something will be very expensive -- but everything they could purchase * also * rises in price . 
  so bulgaria is n't getting more steel to build buildings with or more coal to fire power plants or more personal computers to do computation with . 
  at some point in the future , sure , bulgarians * could * go cash in their earnings ... but then they 're running a trade deficit . 
  and because , in the interim , they were n't able to select the most-efficient option and were forced to always choose the home-grown product , even if it were less-optimal for the purpose they wanted , they suffer from economic inefficiency : everyone is somewhat worse-off . 
  / u/taure describes [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) , which is behind the reason you want to permit trade for efficiency . 
  then what `` should '' a country do ? 
  produce whatever it can best relative to the rest of the world as well as it can , then trade that -- whether it be with domestic or foreign producers -- for other things that it wants . 
  i like the [ milton friedman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em ) explanation of why the us should n't impose import tariffs on steel , which i think can apply nicely to free trade in general . 
  i certainly do n't see what putting soldiers into ukraine would buy russia at the moment . 
  point is , though , 7,500 was n't insignificant two years ago in eastern ukraine . 
  not as russia 's exercises have gone , but it 's also at least comparable to the [ number of russian infantry that were involved in donbas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_military_intervention_in_ukraine_%282014%e2%80%93present%29 ) :  in donbass : 7,500 + russian infantry, 
  i mean , he must have learned to type on a non-german keyboard . 
   that said , it 's likely that the key reason why us acted the way it did in instigating the putch in ukraine is because eu and russia were getting far too close both politically and economically . 
  the us was n't particularly prominent in ukraine , and did not `` instigate a putch '' . 
  the run-up to euromaiden was eu-ukraine-russia , where russia unsuccessfully tried to buy ukraine off from cutting trade deals with the eu : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement  the same day president yanukovych stated ukraine will `` do its best '' to satisfy the eu 's requirements . 
  [ 45 ] at the time president yanukovych was also in negotiations with russia to `` find the right model '' for cooperation with the customs union of belarus , kazakhstan and russia . 
  [ 45 ] but also on 25 february 2013 president of the european commission jos\u00e9 manuel barroso made it clear that `` one country can not at the same time be a member of a customs union and be in a deep common free-trade area with the european union '' . 
  [ 45 ] [ snip ]  on 21 november 2013 the verkhovna rada failed to pass any of the six motions on allowing the former prime minister yulia tymoshenko to receive medical treatment abroad , which was an eu demand for signing the association agreement . 
  [ 55 ] [ 56 ] the same week tymoshenko had stated that she was ready to ask the eu to drop the demand for her freedom if it meant president viktor yanukovych would sign the association agreement . 
  [ 57 ] the same day a ukrainian government decree suspended preparations for signing of association agreement ; instead it proposed the creation of a three-way trade commission between ukraine , the european union and russia that would resolve trade issues between the sides . 
  [ 55 ] prime minister mykola azarov issued the decree in order to `` ensure the national security of ukraine '' and in consideration of the possible ramifications of trade with russia ( and other cis countries ) [ 58 ] if the agreement was signed on a 28 -- 29 november summit in vilnius . 
  [ 55 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] according to ukrainian deputy prime minister yuriy boyko ukraine will resume preparing the agreement `` when the drop in industrial production and our relations with cis countries are compensated by the european market , otherwise our country 's economy will sustain serious damage '' . 
  [ 58 ] some eu diplomats were more skeptical of the reasons put forward . 
  [ 61 ] later on 21 november 2013 , the russian presidential press secretary , dmitry peskov , called the ukrainian decree `` a strictly internal and sovereign decision of the country , and we think we have no right to comment on it '' and stated that russia was prepared to have tripartite negotiations with ukraine and the eu on trade and economic issues . 
  [ 62 ] the european parliament 's monitoring mission in ukraine stated ( also on 21 november 2013 ) that there was still a possibility to sign the eu-ukraine association agreement . 
  [ 56 ] the same day ukrainian president viktor yanukovych stated `` an alternative for reforms in ukraine and an alternative for european integration do not exist ... we are walking along this path and are not changing direction '' . 
  [ 63 ] [ b ]   in the following days , euromaidan , the biggest protests since the orange revolution , were being held in kiev by opposition parties . 
  [ 65 ] [ 66 ] on 26 november 2013 the ukrainian government admitted that russia had asked it to delay signing the eu association agreement and that it `` wanted better terms for the eu deal '' . 
  [ 67 ] `` as soon as we reach a level that is comfortable for us , when it meets our interests , when we agree on normal terms , then we will be talking about signing , '' president yanukovych stated in a televised interview . 
  [ 67 ] the same day russian president vladimir putin called for an end to the criticism of the ukrainian decision to delay the association agreement , and that the eu deal was bad for russia 's security interests . 
  [ 67 ] putin was responding to statements by the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , and the president of the european commission , jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , that had stated they `` strongly disapproved '' of russia 's actions . 
  [ 67 ] on 26 november 2013 prime minister azarov stated during a government meeting `` i affirm with full authority that the negotiating process over the association agreement is continuing , and the work on moving our country closer to european standards is not stopping for a single day '' . 
  [ 68 ] [ snip ]  the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , added that `` we may not give in to external pressure , least of all from russia '' . 
  [ 73 ] barroso reiterated that the eu 's offer to ukraine in terms of signing an association agreement remained on the table . 
  [ 75 ] [ c ] simultaneously , president yanukovych stated that he still intends to sign the association agreement at a later date `` once we get down to work and find solutions for economic problems , when we get the opportunity to sign a strategic partnership agreement with russia and everything else that we need to do , so that normal relations can be established between the european union , russia , and ukraine ... this is our responsibility '' . 
  [ 78 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan the eu deal had popular support :  according to an august 2013 study by a donetsk company , research & branding group , [ 139 ] 49 % of ukrainians supported signing the association agreement , while 31 % opposed it and the rest had not decided yet . 
  however , in a december poll by the same company , only 30 % claimed that terms of the association agreement would be beneficial for the ukrainian economy , while 39 % said they were unfavourable for ukraine . 
  in the same poll , only 30 % said the opposition would be able to stabilise the society and govern the country well , if coming to power , while 37 % disagreed . 
  [ 140 ]   authors of the gfk ukraine poll conducted 2 -- 15 october 2013 claim that 45 % of respondents believed ukraine should sign an association agreement with the eu , whereas only 14 % favoured joining the customs union of belarus , kazakhstan , and russia , and 15 % preferred non-alignment . 
  full text of the eu-related question asked by gfk reads , `` should ukraine sign the eu-ukraine association agreement , and , in the future , become an eu member ? 
  '' [ 141 ] [ 142 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_december_2013_ukrainian%e2%80%93russian_action_plan putin cuts a deal with yanukovych instead of the ukraine-eu association agreement :  the 17 december 2013 ukrainian -- russian action plan is a de facto defunct [ 1 ] [ 2 ] treaty between the president of ukraine viktor yanukovych and russian president vladimir putin on 17 december 2013 whereby it was agreed that russia would buy $ 15 billion of ukrainian eurobonds and that the cost of russian natural gas supplied to ukraine would be lowered to $ 268 per 1,000 cubic metres ( the price was more than $ 400 at the time ) . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] the deal relinquished ukraine 's kerch peninsula to the russian navy , granting russia highly desirable warm-water ports and strategic access to the mediterranean and beyond . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] the treaty was signed amid massive , ongoing protests in ukraine for closer ties between ukraine and the european union . 
  [ 7 ] the interest rate on the loan would be renegotiated every three months , based on a verbal agreement between the two leaders . 
  [ 5 ] this does not go over well with the public :  the decision to put off signing the eu association agreement lead to massive , ongoing protests in ukraine ( for closer ties between ukraine and the eu ) that began in the night of 21 november 2013 when up to 2,000 protesters gathered at kiev 's maidan nezalezhnosti . 
  [ 7 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] and that had risen to 400,000 -- 800,000 protesters demonstrating in kiev on the weekends of 1 december [ 36 ] and 8 december 2013 . 
  [ 37 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_euromaidan#18.e2.80.9331_december_2013 over the next month-and-a-half , protests become much more-substantial . 
  the prime minister cashes out and runs at the end of january , the remainder of the government vanishing and running over the next three weeks .
