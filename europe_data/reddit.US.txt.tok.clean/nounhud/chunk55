  online publications are often extremely lax about listing corrections that they 've made . 
  why are all `` y `` s in your post written with a `` z '' ? 
  i think that having the eu having a stronger collective identity relative to the current country-level identity is . 
  but that could also involve things like having eu-level symbols with more popular or emotional draw . 
  i mean , i guess spunik , paid astroturfing , * possibly * stuff done by domestic state-controlled russian media like tass that gets translated , and maybe other sources that i 'm not aware of , but are you aware of anything specific that 's in dutch ? 
  it was news that last year rt cut their planned french - and german-language targets because of the ruble 's decline which killed their in-ruble-terms budget increase , and i have a hard time believing that russia would n't try to fund that as a higher priority . 
  they 'll probably wind up entering other professions in cities . 
  broadly-speaking , this happens every time the needs of the market shift , and even narrowly-confined to agriculture , [ this is not a new process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization ) :  from the development of the earliest cities in mesopotamia and egypt until the 18th century , an equilibrium existed between the vast majority of the population who engaged in subsistence agriculture in a rural context , and small centres of populations in the towns where economic activity consisted primarily of trade at markets and manufactures on a small scale . 
  due to the primitive and relatively stagnant state of agriculture throughout this period the ratio of rural to urban population remained at a fixed equilibrium . 
    with the onset of the agricultural and industrial revolution in the late 18th century this relationship was finally broken and an unprecedented growth in urban population took place over the course of the 19th century , both through continued migration from the countryside and due to the tremendous demographic expansion that occurred at that time . 
  in england the proportion of the population living in cities jumped from 17 % in 1801 to 72 % in 1891 ( for other countries the figure was : 37 % in france , 41 % in prussia and 28 % in the united states ) . 
  [ 7 ]   as labourers were freed up from working the land due to higher agricultural productivity they converged on the new industrial cities like manchester and birmingham which were experiencing a boom in commerce , trade and industry . 
  growing trade around the world also allowed cereals to be imported from north america and refrigerated meat from australasia and south america . 
  spatially , cities also expanded due to the development of public transport systems , which facilitated commutes of longer distances to the city centre for the working class . 
    urbanization rapidly spread across the western world and , since the 1950s , it has begun to take hold in the developing world as well . 
  at the turn of the 20th century , just 15 % of the world population lived in cities . 
  [ 9 ] according to the un the year 2007 witnessed the turning point when more than 50 % of the world population were living in cities , for the first time in human history . 
   anti-dumping price applied at european scale it 's not actually an anti- [ dumping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dumping_%28pricing_policy%29 ) policy unless the competition is selling below cost . 
  agriculture produces commodities , and there are many producers -- it seems like one heck of a stretch to believe that all of these are colluding to intentionally keep price below production costs to try to force french farmers out of business , after which they plan to increase prices and take advantage of cartel pricing . 
  much , much more plausible to me to believe that french farmers have convinced french non-farmers to subsidize their businesses and would like to continue that situation . 
  but unless there 's some major positive externality to french non-farmers in maintaining a lot of inefficient small french farms , the french citizen is better-off with letting those small farms go out of business and producing a globally-competitive french agriculture industry . 
  and i 'm not saying that there are * no * cases where positive externalities exist . 
  maybe in the sense of a museum , it 's nice to have picturesque small farms somewhere , so that they can be visited . 
  maybe it 's possible to have small farms act as a tourist draw , which other businesses then benefit from . 
  but surely , that does n't require blanketing the whole country for them , and surely in that case , it would make more sense for the specific city or region being benefited to provide the subsidy ? 
   this is about desertifying villages and small towns . 
  happened in the us -- less labor required for a given amount of agriculture . 
  all countries have seen an urbanization as agriculture has become more-efficient and people move to the cities . 
  i agree that it 's change , but there 's nothing inherently-negative there , and it will make france as a whole better-off . 
   the germans got their way with imposing austerity on greece did france actually ( i do n't mean the public position that politicians took : once it 's been established what policy will go through , they can take the most domestically-popular stance available ) have different views on the matter ? 
  my understanding was that french and german banks had similar serious exposure and that the losses were transferred to the public . 
  both presumably have the same concerns about the possibility of other countries unsustainably spending on their tab . 
  my guess is that french and german interests are fairly similar wrt greece , but that germany has politicians who can afford to be seen being tough on the matter . 
   next we 've got the migrants crisis where hollande 's just letting the germans do what they like even though schengen is going down the bin . 
  what is it that germany is doing that france would want done otherwise ? 
   to be fair to hollande , it 's not entierly his fault , it started way before him . 
  our politicians have been in adoration in front of the german miracle , miracle that consists of lowering employees wages to crush other eurozone countries industry . 
  is that a french-german conflict of interest or a domestic political dispute in france ? 
  like , i think that it 's easy to say `` i do n't like x '' , where x is some policy in a country , and to then just kind of assume that one 's own political representation is * also * opposed to x , and that the answer is that it 's somehow cowed . 
  my guess is that france and germany ( as well as other european countries ) probably coordinate and decide on policy privately between bureaucrats , and that when politicians make public pronouncements on matters , these are mostly due to domestic political concerns . 
  in the us congress , yes , politicians give nationally-televised speeches -- but these wo n't have much to do with the actual meat of policy , wo n't be used to convince other legislators . 
  they 're full of flowery speech , aimed at one 's constituents . 
  and they hold votes , but after there has been opportunity for private discussion where representatives can coordinate on how they should vote -- they 're not a surprise . 
  these are choreographed for the public , part of the popularity contest of democracy . 
  how confident are you that the french bureaucracy has actually been thwarted on what the government feels should happen on the above policy points -- greek austerity , migrant policy , and wages ? 
  `` need '' is hard to quantify , and often gets abused . 
  for example , in the us , the society of civil engineers , which lobbies for civil engineering spending , consistently puts out an `` american infrastructure report card '' and manages to get it cited in many publications that simply shows the us has having poor `` grades '' for `` crumbling '' infrastructure . 
  looking at the [ world bank 's 2014 logistics infrastructure ratings ] ( http://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global?sort=asc&amp;order=infrastructure ) , of the top twenty countries , the majority are european ( bolded ) : | rank | country | infrastructure index | | - | - | - | | ** 1 ** | ** germany ** | ** 4.32 ** | | 2 | singapore | 4.28 | | ** 3 ** | ** netherlands ** | ** 4.23 ** | | ** 4 ** | ** norway ** | ** 4.19 ** | | 5 | united states | 4.18 | | ** 6 ** | ** united kingdom ** | ** 4.16 ** | | 7 | japan | 4.16 | | ** 8 ** | ** belgium ** | ** 4.10 ** | | ** 9 ** | ** sweden ** | ** 4.09 ** | | 10 | canada | 4.05 | | ** 11 ** | ** switzerland ** | ** 4.04 ** | | 12 | australia | 4.04 | | ** 13 ** | ** france ** | ** 3.98 ** | | 14 | hong kong , china | 3.97 | | ** 15 ** | ** luxembourg ** | ** 3.91 ** | | ** 16 ** | ** ireland ** | ** 3.84 ** | | ** 17 ** | ** denmark ** | ** 3.82 ** | | 18 | korea , rep | 3.79 | | ** 19 ** | ** italy ** | ** 3.78 ** | | ** 20 ** | ** spain ** | ** 3.77 ** | i 'd say that europe 's doing pretty well from an infrastructure standpoint , to be honest . 
   the data from trading platform tradeweb showed roughly 2.9 trillion euros ( $ 3.2 trillion ) worth of sovereign bonds have a negative yield , suggesting investors are willing to pay for the privilege of lending to the most trusted borrowers . 
  it looks like europe * is * borrowing -- it 's just that lenders are desperate for safety . 
   if you do n't have an army what else can you do ? 
  what would germany having a more-substantial military do here ? 
  france , the uk , the us , canada , australia , the netherlands , turkey , and so forth are involved in the air conflict in syria . 
  it 's not as if that 's causing russia to refrain from offensives in syria or as if those countries are trying to * use * it to cause russia to refrain from offensives in syria . 
  if germany had more jet fighters or tanks , it might get some benefits from it , but i do n't see how it would be relevant specifically to russian military involvement in syria . 
  the comments here seem to all criticize france rather in the abstract : / u/titoulamaison :  hollande is weak or  make france 's voice heard on the european stage ... it 's hollande 's responsability to stand up to merkel , he 's got allies , but he does fuckall . 
  / u/freakzilla149 :  challenge meaningfully germany / u/cannyobserver :  france is a basket case i assume that these people do n't simply want france to have the * image * of arguing with germany -- that is , merkel says something and hollande jumps up and yells a bunch of criticisms in french . 
  are there actual , concrete french interests that you feel are n't being addressed ? 
  what specific policies do people here want promoted that they feel were not promoted ? 
  farm subsidies ? 
   the last thing you need are foreign millionaires/billionaires buying out all of the property and inflating the value to the point that no common person that needs it can afford it . 
  remove height restrictions on construction and when prices rise , you 'll have more construction pushing those prices back down . 
  shortage of housing ? 
  produce more housing . 
   yeah !, 
  again we are at the front of russian propaganda !, 
  i dunno ... rt does n't presently do dutch-language material . 
  i guess some of that might be bang-for-the-buck , but [ it does n't seem to have really caught on much in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt_%28tv_network%29 ) :  according to internal documents submitted for kremlin review , rt 's viewership amounts to less than 0.1 percent of europe 's television audience , except in britain , where 2013 viewership was estimated at approximately 120,000 persons per day . 
  good point . 
  russia has an interest in wanting to be able to pressure a single member without nato as a whole becoming involved , and nato has an interest in not allowing that . 
  the us and the eu have , for better-or-for-worse , decided to go the economic pressure route , and apparently feel that this is working . 
  from their standpoint , it would be nice to keep things in that realm if it 's the most-preferable route . 
  the same is true for russia -- none of the major parties involved currently feel that a direct shooting war is in their interest . 
  i do n't think that turkey was particularly * desperate * in any way . 
  turkey would probably rather not have russian warplanes present and certainly not entering turkish airspace , particularly after repeated warnings . 
  if russia intentionally-attacked turkish forces in turkey in response to turkey shooting down a plane violating turkish airspace , i have little doubt that it * would * result in a response from nato . 
  do n't get me wrong -- i think that the article makes wrong assertions about russia , but that 's entirely-different from thinking that nato would leave turkey dangling . 
  this sounds like a positive feedback loop in that it appears to be increasing your satisfaction about living in vilnius . 
   will europe and the united states gang up on china ? 
  probably not , since just as the us and the eu have economies that are important to china , so too is china 's economy important to the us and the eu . 
   now he 's seen a reputable poll giving `` out '' a nine point lead . 
  [ eu referendum poll tracker and odds ] ( http://whatukthinks.org/eu/opinion-polls/poll-of-polls/ ) : the average of the last six polls -- to smooth out outliers -- is currently at ~ 52 % remain . 
   i think it 's because it 's practically impossible ( or at least very difficult ) to make the system secure enough while still maintaining voter anonymity . 
  it permits selling votes and the like too ( since someone can prove who they are voting for to someone else ) . 
  it conflicts to some degree with the secret ballot , which i think was a pretty significant improvement . 
  well , it was in the context of talking about setting up russian sams ... it seems kinda hard to do anything with them but establish no-fly zones . 
   i think it applies to most conflicts until napoleon . 
  the [ golden horde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_horde ) comes to mind . 
  i also suspect that there was substantial genocidal warfare in human history . 
  [ * deuteronomy 20:10 -16 * ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut+20 ) :  when you march up to attack a city , make its people an offer of peace . 
  if they accept and open their gates , all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you . 
  if they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle , lay siege to that city . 
  when the lord your god delivers it into your hand , put to the sword all the men in it . 
  as for the women , the children , the livestock and everything else in the city , you may take these as plunder for yourselves . 
  and you may use the plunder the lord your god gives you from your enemies . 
  this is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby . 
    however , in the cities of the nations the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance , do not leave alive anything that breathes . 
  completely destroy [ a ] them -- the hittites , amorites , canaanites , perizzites , hivites and jebusites -- as the lord your god has commanded you . 
  otherwise , they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods , and you will sin against the lord your god . 
   no justification for using a 13-year-old girl for `` political propaganda . '' [ thirteen is so old ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phan_thi_kim_phuc ),
