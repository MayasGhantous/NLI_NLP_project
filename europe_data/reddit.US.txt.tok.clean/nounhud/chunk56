   russia has taken full control over syrian airspace ( and a big chunk of turkish airspace , too ) um . 
  [ numerous non-russia countries have been fighting from syrian airspace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american-led_intervention_in_syria ) , and russia has n't threatened them . 
  and russia has certainly not attempted to impose a no-fly zone in turkish airspace . 
  small correction : * [ fair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fair ) * [ fare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fare ), 
   you can have sub-replacement birth rates or you can have a welfare state , but you ca n't have both in the long-term . 
  i do n't think that the long term is actually that relevant , at least as welfare goes -- the window that matters is probably only about one lifetime . 
  if a 30 % reduction in the population over a lifetime does n't crash one generation 's welfare , it probably wo n't crash the next either -- the two do n't really combine to become worse . 
  maybe , but they were burdened with the previous generation . 
  looking at it another way , we have n't done much of a job of managing to produce a developed state with a sustainable fertility level . 
  light drinkers compared to europe , in fact . 
  us homicide commission is skewed towards being male , towards being young , and towards being black , and away from being female , elderly , and east asian . 
  * [ a male in the us is about 8.4 times as likely to murder as a female is ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2013.xls ) . 
  * the fbi does n't provide specific categories other than black and white , but [ a black person in the us is about 6.3 times as likely to murder as a white person ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2013.xls ) * [ about half of all us murderers are below age 35 , with the peak frequency being 20-24 ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2013.xls ) . 
  well , that 's consistent , but it also comes with some significant baggage . 
  let 's say that we allow countries to take chunks of other countries as long as it is for the purpose of ethnic reunification . 
  we establish some sort of new treaty and require countries to sign on that requires them to give up territory for this purpose on request . 
  * countries probably do n't want to have other countries taking chunks of their land . 
  if a lot of people living in italy who were separatists decided to cluster in one spot , they could split that piece of italy off . 
  so now , countries have a sudden and abrupt interest in limiting internal movement of ethnic groups in countries : freedom of movement of countries , something that 's valuable for a flexible labor market and other things , gets axed . 
  * it might even be in a rather-important bit , like through a mountain pass , or where an important river or mine or oilfield or dam is . 
  maybe militarily-important bits could suddenly be lost . 
  countries tend to build infrastructure with the expectation that pieces of that country wo n't suddenly blip out of existence . 
  if they ca n't rely upon that expectation , it makes it tough for them to perform such construction -- they do n't want to put that kind of risk in place . 
  * in particular , people could potentially be bought off to `` turn over '' part of the country to another country , if that bit is particularly important and valuable . 
  * how small is the unit of people that can be the target of such acquisition ? 
  i assume that you 'd feel that one person is too small -- after all , i 'm sure that you can find people in any country today who might prefer to be part of another country , and having a city split up into lots of little pieces of countries would probably run into a fair number of problems . 
  a village ? 
  a town ? 
  a county ? 
  a city ? 
  a region , for some value of region ? 
  * you 've said that there is no american nationality -- that 's been around for 240 years . 
  what 's the cut-off point , where people can start taking chunks of land ? 
  could european jews from the diaspora say `` i 'd like to remove this chunk of the city i 'm in and attach it to israel '' ? 
   i support national reunification , a concept that an american ca n't understand since you are not a real nation . 
  would you also have [ supported hitler 's demand for the sudetenland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suxoerkjcey ) ? 
  whether it would have been a good idea or not , i think that / u/koelkastmagneet was simply talking about whether that was a realistic political scenario . 
  i think that most people can agree that such a proposal would probably not meet with enthusiasm today . 
   of its four access points to the sea , one is controlled by denmark , one is controlled by turkey , and the other two ( north sea and pacific ocean ) have a tendency to freeze during winter , which makes them inoperable . 
  you 're looking at it in terms of russia fighting a conflict . 
  let 's say that for political reasons , russia was n't seriously at risk of a conflict with any of these . 
  the same , after all , could have historically been said of the nordic countries and access to the pacific , and nobody today thinks `` sweden 's great weakness is that because of norway , her shipping must travel through the baltic . 
  in commercial terms , russia gets port access to all of the major trading areas . 
  checking online , rajin is currently the northernmost ice-free port in asia -- just south of russia . 
  while currents may play a role , that 's also just across the border from russia , and global warming is moving temperature bands by [ about half a mile per year ] ( http://io9.gizmodo.com/5437258/outrun-global-warming-by-moving-5-miles-north-in-the-2010s ) . 
   one of the reasons why russia is so aggressive in its foreign policy ( and consequently why it 's so hated in the west ) is that through its history it had to contend with large borders with hostile states , and no meaningful defensible land to speak of on many of them . 
  canada and the us are in the same position , but much more so , yet canada is much wealthier on a per-capita basis than russia . 
  many european countries face similar issues . 
  they 've taken the political route to accommodate each other and thus do n't have the constraints imposed by facing a military conflict . 
   the huge amounts of land to cover and very inhospitable land in between were a nightmare to defend and is completely incomparable to any to usa by canada or mexico . 
  i 'd say that canada faces pretty nearly the same constraint that does russia , and with a smaller population to deal with it .

   yes , not all . 
  but likely most .

  i 'm not absolutely sure what you 're saying , but if you 're comparing the bbc to sputnik or rt , yeah , i think that it 's safe to say that the bbc is less-flagrantly-biased than rt or sputnik . 
  if each country simply closes its borders , it increases transit and transaction costs on the eu . 
  if a border can be closed surely it seems like it makes more sense to secure the schengen area edge ? 
  given that most illegal immigrants probably are n't daily commuting across member borders within the area ( or could choose not to do so if those borders were closed ) , it does n't seem like there 'd be a great deal gained by closing the internal borders and not the external borders . 
   british/american/turkish / jewish arab spring contrary to popular opinion , not * all * revolts around the world are set up by the cia , particularly when they disrupt countries that the us would rather like stable , like iraq , kuwait , and saudi arabia . 
  schengen ought to push for a schengen ii summit * also * held in schengen in which the schengen area is revised to address security concerns . 
  i am extremely skeptical of the idea that the crash was a russian assassination . 
  assassination of heads of states makes little sense for the heads of major powers -- all they 're doing is choosing a battlefield on which they are unusually weak and vulnerable . 
  it 's disadvantageous for them to start something like that . 
  the [ litvinenko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko ) assassination made the news because it was so unusual and high-profile and unlike other extraterritorial russian actions , and that was of a defector from an intelligence agency , something that [ the cia had assessed as a possibility for the ussr some time back , at least under notable circumstances ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol19no3/html/v19i3a01p_0001.htm ) . 
  it would be a tremendous jump for the * other * objectionable assassination that russia did recently to be to a head of state of a major bordering country in nato and the eu .

  i do n't think that the cause-and-effect times are set up correctly for your theory . 
   this was all foreseeable at the start , but nothing was done . 
  no time like the present . 
   border protection is a basic element of a state . 
  we did n't have controlled borders when we got going . 
  it got added as a result of unpopular , large-scale immigration 150 years after the country was created . 
   such an incompetent lack of foresight . 
  to be fair , it was n't an issue at that point in time , and it 's possible that the whole thing would have never gotten * going * if it came with a huge glob of integration and restrictions and whatnot . 
  also , i think that there 's something to be said for letting the issues that come up shape legislation . 
  that being said , now it * is * a problem , and it * does * seem like something other than just watching as a lot of people show up in greece and trudge to germany would probably be a good idea . 
  there are substantially-varying degrees . 
  rt and sputnik both rank pretty high on the totem pole . 
   i do n't see erdogan giving up power by choice , he 's practically copied putin 's playbook and will likely keep up the charade by swapping between pm and president at leisure . 
  a great deal better than when attaturk was starting to reform things , yes ? 
   also turkey pisses russia off which is a plus i suspect that 's not actually the logic behind us diplomacy . 
   russia has a ton of potential soft power , but it is rapidly decreasing as russia 's economy collapses and the culture becomes more stagnant and fascist . 
  that is the reason russia has become so militaristic lately , its soft power has all but collapsed . 
  the order seems wrong . 
  russia 's economic woes started with international pressure resulting from attacks on ukraine , yes ? 
  risks being kind of unstable . 
   it really is screwed geopolitically . 
  from a geographical standpoint , russia has a lot of things that most countries could only dream of -- loads of resources , access to the med , pacific , and atlantic , vast amounts of land , fresh water ... a bit cold , yeah , but not the end of the world . 
  it 's kind of where its leadership has put it .
