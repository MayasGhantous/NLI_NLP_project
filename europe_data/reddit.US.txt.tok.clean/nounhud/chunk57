  i wonder if a kid comes in and is classified as `` unaccompanied '' whether that then also blocks use of future family reunification with his parents if they abruptly show up .

   that 's one ridiculous argument against forcing a higher wage if i ever heard one . 
  it 's a reason why the policy might be ineffective . 
   and if a robber baron force his employees to hand back their wage , you do n't lower minimal wage , you put the culprits in jail . 
  the problem is that it 's difficult to catch this : the employees and the employer have an interest in colluding in this case , and without one of them having an interest in exposing it , it 's harder to identify . 
  the employer does n't want to be caught because it screws up his business and he suffers whatever penalties are there . 
  the employees do n't want the employer to be caught because the employees would be out-of-a-job and deported . 
  this same process happens all the time with illegal employment -- an employee * could * turn in his employer for illegal employment , but then he 's screwed himself . 
   this is n't a maximal wage . 
  this is a minimal wage . 
  right . 
  i was using the maximal wage at the beginning of the paragraph to show how perks and wages can be converted between each other with a real-world example . 
  i then go on to talk about a wage floor later in the paragraph . 
  edit : you added more , so responding to that as well :  2 lines above you are arguing they will steal their employees even their wage , not providing them more . 
  right . 
  i 'm providing a concrete example of where a wage ceiling was put in place , and employers converted wages into perks/working conditions/etc . 
  in turn , when a wage floor is put into place , employers can convert perks/working conditions/etc into wages . 
  honestly , i suspect that it 's possible to retrofit existing cars with some sort of filtration system ; while that may be expensive to add and maybe annoying to maintain , i have a hard time believing that it 's `` polluted air or nothing '' . 
  [ i understand that daimler constructed a working system for reducing diesel emissions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bluetec ) .

  there will start being an improvement immediately , and things will slowly-and-steadily get better . 
  while i can understand this being politically-objectionable ( and thought that it was probably politically-unwise at the time ) , i thought that the funds were used in a way that made the uk 's money relatively low-risk compared to that of the funds the other countries were putting in . 
  note that `` nuclear de-escallation '' as russia described the doctrine does n't involve nuclear use being used * first * -- it 's after a conventional conflict is not going well . 
   strange how we have not had terrorist attacks since the refugee `` crisis '' started in earnest .

   some scholars consider the wars in afghanistan -- starting with the soviet invasion back in 1979 -- and the resulting outflow of millions of afghans over their country 's eastern border to have been a major factor in neighboring pakistan 's deepening political polarization . 
  it 's not unreasonable to worry that something analogous could happen in turkey and that the ripple effects could be huge , given the country 's roles as a major nato member and a bulwark of stability on europe 's southeastern flank . 
  [ snip ]  that means more fairly divvying up the responsibilities of giving refugees homes ... those two snippets together are n't really making a very compelling argument for more immigration . 
  i do kind of like the simplicity of using some sort of income level as a flat `` is there demand for this profession '' metric . 
  that being said , it * does * seem like it 's prone to kickbacks , where someone would be making $ 40k/year and their employer pays them $ 50k/year and expects them to , via various mechanisms , pay $ 10k/year back . 
  and constraining how compensation works can cause unexpected shifts in how compensation is provided . 
  in the us , it used to not be the norm for employers to offer various types of insurance . 
  however , during world war ii , wage caps were imposed ( arguably not a very good idea , but they sold well to the public at the time ) . 
  companies responded by providing non-wage compensation , like health insurance , dental insurance , etc , to dodge the wage ceiling . 
  if someone puts a wage floor in place , it 's possible to trade perks or working conditions into wages . 
   after the united states gobbled up california and half of mexico , and we were stripped down to nothing , territorial expansion suddenly becomes a crime .

  yes , that it 's a fragmented set of languages : you ca n't just `` learn arabic '' . 
   arabic is actually a very complex language that is in increasing demand . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabic  some of the spoken varieties are mutually unintelligible , [ 5 ] both written and orally , and the varieties as a whole constitute a sociolinguistic language . 
  this means that on purely linguistic grounds they would likely be considered to constitute more than one language , but are commonly grouped together as a single language for political or religious reasons ( see below ) .

  with a traditional ira , you can place money in an ira account before paying taxes on it . 
  this lowers your taxable income , and reduces the percent at which you are taxed .
