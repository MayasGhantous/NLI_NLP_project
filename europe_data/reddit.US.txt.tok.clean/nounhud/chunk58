  * roth ira : you pay income tax normally before putting funds into the account , but any money placed into a roth ira account can grow without being taxed -- so , for example , i could put money in a roth ira account , purchase stock in apple during their dark days , have it grow a hundred times , sell it , and pay nothing in taxes due to the capital gains from the stock . 
  iras basically create tax incentives to encourage people to save money themselves for retirement . 
  there are limits on how much one can contribute and how much money one can make , so it 's not an unlimited way to reduce taxation . 
  [ isis threatened saudi arabia : islamic state says it will destroy prisons holding jihadis after executions ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-threatens-saudi-arabia-islamic-state-says-it-will-destroy-prisons-holding-2251341 ) :  the islamic state group , also known as isis , threatened saudi arabia , saying it will destroy the kingdom 's prisons holding jihadis after riyadh executed 47 people last week , reuters reported . 
  saudi arabia executed four shiite muslims , including prominent cleric nimr al-nimr , and 43 convicted al qaeda militants saturday . 
    isis has previously claimed responsibility for several attacks in saudi arabia and has also beefed up its operations in neighboring yemen . 
  in the statement tuesday , isis mentioned the al-ha ` ir and tarfiya prisons where many al qaeda and isis supporters have been detained . 
  saudi arabia has faced severe criticism following saturday 's mass execution , escalating tensions with shiite power iran . 
    `` the islamic state always seeks to free prisoners , but we calculate that the ending of the issues of prisoners will not happen except with the eradication of the rule of tyrants , and then destroying their prisons and razing them to the ground , '' isis reportedly said in an article posted online tuesday . 
    despite differences between isis and al qaeda , the two terrorist groups are united in their enmity towards saudi arabia . 
    al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) reportedly threatened saudi arabia in december with shedding `` the blood of the soldiers of al saud '' if its members were executed . 
    isis has claimed responsibility for several bombings and shooting in saudi arabia since late 2014 . 
  the attacks have reportedly killed over 50 people .

   dude , uk is n't even in schengen area . 
  read the latest response from eu commission will you ? 
  he 's talking about the fact that any other country can provide citizenship , and then freedom of movement and labor would let a person come to the uk . 
  while i think that the uk and the eu would both be better-off with a remain , i do agree with him on that particular policy . 
  the current state of affairs is legitimately-objectionable . 
  if any member country can grant eu citizenship , then the eu probably needs to have some ability to at least set upper limits on citizenship grants , even if naturalization is n't unified across the eu . 
  that does n't make sense to me . 
  surely eu members could levy taxes on gasoline as easily as on diesel ? 
  it 's * possible * for the government to provide immunity , i believe -- that is rare , but was part of the [ tobacco master settlement agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobacco_master_settlement_agreement ) :  the tobacco master settlement agreement ( msa ) was entered in november 1998 , originally between the four largest united states tobacco companies ( philip morris inc. , r. j. reynolds , brown & williamson and lorillard -- the `` original participating manufacturers '' , referred to as the `` majors '' ) and the attorneys general of 46 states . 
  the states settled their medicaid lawsuits against the tobacco industry for recovery of their tobacco-related health-care costs , and also ** exempted the companies from private tort liability regarding harm caused by tobacco use ** . 
  [ 1 ] :25 in exchange , the companies agreed to curtail or cease certain tobacco marketing practices , as well as to pay , in perpetuity , various annual payments to the states to compensate them for some of the medical costs of caring for persons with smoking-related illnesses .

  hmm . 
  what ground does it break ? 
  it seems like it 's mostly summarizing the various issues . 
  not that there 's anything wrong with that , but it is n't what i was expecting when i heard `` groundbreaking speech '' . 
     the issue with is n't with the arrival 's `` entitlement '' , the issue is with the inefficiency of the bureaucratic mechanisms that leads to this stuff lasting years . 
  i remember reading something about people in the camps trying to go through regular channels and having to wait years just for their first hearing . 
  this is being used as a rate-limiter , which the refugee convention never created a mechanism for . 
  plus , you are n't allowed to hold people granted asylum status , but you are allowed to hold people who have n't yet been processed . 
   usa to move aside italian influence huh . 
  what happened there ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/13/north-korea-vacations-yes-they-re-possible-though-very-structured.html ) . 
  that being said , vacationers have been grabbed by the regime there , and the [ department of state tells people in the us that they probably should n't be going ] ( http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/north-korea-travel-warning.html ) . 
  to be fair , i suspect that a lot of people heard about the influx and thought `` this is my chance '' , rather than spending years planning and being able to make preparations . 
  also , remember that until * very * recently ( well , maybe still ... ) , the eu was talking about redistribution . 
  as a migrant , you 've no idea where you might be redistributed -- you might spend a year learning german and then be dumped in france , so you probably do n't want to commit many resources to it . 
   1 ) do n't spend anything close to the ~ 4.5 % of gdp the us does , or even the 2 % of gdp vastly smaller nations with only recent independence and economic development as sovereign polities seem to be able to manage . 
  * there is no expectation to spend ~ 4.5 % . 
  the us spends what it does because it believes that that amount makes the most-sense for the us . 
  * the us [ spent 3.5 % in 2014 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc ) , not ~ 4.5 % . 
  this does represent a reduction -- it 's at [ about the lowest point as a percentage of gdp since the us entered world war ii ] ( http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/defense_spending ) : * in peace time , the us government used to spend very little on defense , about one percent of gdp . 
  but that changed after world war ii when the united states found itself in a global contest against communism . 
  ever since , defense spending has never been less than 3.6 percent of gdp . 
  * i think that it would be a good idea to either change the targets for nato or fix spending -- agreeing on a target does n't mean much if the agreement is then ignored -- but i also legitimately think that europe could have reasonable military budgets below 2 % that would achieve what europe wants , for some visions of the world . 
  i do think that it * does * suck that , say , estonia is having to pull rather more weight in relative terms than , say , germany is . 
   therefore do n't have any money for either high troop levels , or modern and force inter-operable hardware what do you mean by interoperable hardware ? 
  nato uses standardized ammunition and fuel . 
  what is it that does n't interoperate that you want interoperating ? 
   cynically just dump any security responsibilities off onto the us when it comes to large international nato efforts well , there have [ only been a few of those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_operations ) . 
  which are you unhappy about ? 
  the us may have done a disproportionate amount in some of these , but i think that it 's inaccurate to say that `` any security responsibilities '' were dumped off on the us . 
  that 's insulting and inaccurate . 
  canada could invade the us along the undefended border and seize detroit pretty quickly too , but ( a ) i 'm also pretty confident that we could take it back and ( b ) canada probably does n't see temporarily-taking detroit as a net benefit to canada . 
  not having militaries already in place at point x on the border really is n't the same as losing the war . 
  i do n't think that that 's the best way to look at it .

  afghanistan is exporting services in the form of illegal labor to the eu . 
  the eu is paying money in the form of remittances to afghanistan . 
  at some point , afghanistan will use that money to purchase things from the eu , or they 'll buy something from , say , china which will buy something from the eu . 
  the illegal labor could cause problems , mind -- i just do n't think that the specific fact that money is leaving the eu is something to get upset about . 
  summary : asia is significantly better-off than it was fifty years ago . 
  africa still is n't doing so well .
