  most national leaders go around with a security detail . 
  i 'm not sure that that 's the best measurement . 
  if you have hungarian numbers available , please put them up -- but my point is that i think that few people in the us would describe upwards of a quarter-million dollars as `` not super expensive '' . 
  that 's a lot of money for most people . 
  and i doubt that the us is specially , particularly-inefficient in raising children , so even if we imagine that all of the costs there scale with ppp it 's probably taking an at-least-as-hefty-in-proportional-terms chunk of someone 's income in hungary to raise a kid . 
  this is n't an argument that people should n't have children , but that treating them as if they are n't really expensive seems a tough sell to me . 
   on their account , raising a children is not that super expensive as people claim , unless you give them new york steaks for dinner . 
  not hungary , but the us has figures available , and they place it [ as being a fair chunk of change ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090415/cost-raising-child-america.asp ) :  in total , once a child reaches adulthood ( age 18 ) , parents will have spent an average of $ 245,340 . 
  that 's $ 4,260 , or an increase of 2 % over the calculation for the previous year . 
  [ snip ]  none of these numbers take into account the cost of a college education . 
  the average annual cost of a public college comes in at $ 18,390 , and for a private college , $ 40,920 per year . 
  if parents do n't want to see their child becoming the next graduate with a staggering amount of student loan debt , they will have to save an average of $ 109 monthly for a public school and $ 215 for a private school from the time that child is born , provided the money is invested in a 529 plan . 
  now keep in mind that women in a society need to average about 2.1 children just to keep the population from shrinking -- and not everyone chooses to have children or can have children . 
  keep in mind that they 're probably listing the * sticker * price of college education -- that is , the highest price that anyone will be charged . 
  colleges do price-discriminate and charge people different amounts , structuring the thing such that people get `` discounts '' from a very high rate rather than `` extra charges '' from a very low rate . 
  colleges tend to charge the well-to-do more ( `` need-based financial aid '' to the less-well-to-do ) or subsidize the meritorious to bring their numbers up ( `` merit-based financial aid '' ) , so the actual price paid will be lower . 
   unfortunately the only solution is one europe is not ready to take - make it expected of women to stay at home and give birth/take care of the family . 
  that worked in the past , but : * we also managed to wring more productivity out of the workforce by having two-working-parent households . 
  sending women back to the home would lose productivity gains there . 
  * it 's possible that there were other social changes that were contemporaneous with women entering the workforce that were more-important in reducing the number of children ( e.g. 
  the pill ) . 
  * i would n't say that it is the * only * option : i can think of a handful of other social changes that also might plausibly make having a kid more appealing . 
  it is * an * option . 
   a one-time grant of 32k is far from enough to cover the expenses of raising a child . 
  it will defray it , though . 
  some people were maybe * thinking * about having a kid but while they were close , decide not to do so , and the amount tips them over the edge . 
  one possibility might be just putting people in camps : if their goal is economic return , at some point , they probably will volunteer to return . 
  this is apparently no longer constitutional in the us as of [ * zadvydas v. davis * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zadvydas_v._davis ) : two lithuanians had a kid in germany . 
  that kid grew up and became a criminal in the us , without citizenship in the us , lithuania , or germany . 
  neither germany nor lithuania would accept him . 
  up until this case , the us [ apparently simply kept some of these people locked up ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/13/us/constitutional-case-of-a-man-without-a-country.html ) :  the immigration service still holds about 2,800 deportable immigrants who have completed their jail sentences , but whose home countries will not take them . 
  some have been locked up since the early 1990 's . 
  a few are stateless , like mr. zadvydas . 
  but many are from vietnam , laos , cambodia and cuba , which do not have repatriation agreements with the united states . 
    federal law requires the service to detain immigrants whose convictions for '' aggravated felonies '' make them deportable . 
  the government argues that holding these immigrants beyond the 90-day federal limit is warranted to ensure public safety so long as the agency reviews the cases periodically and continues to seek through diplomatic channels a country to accept them . 
  in a 5-4 decision , * zadvydas v. davis * said that , unless there were exceptional circumstances or hope of deportation , there 's a six-month cap on detention . 
  the numbers there were n't huge , but germany 's dealing with larger numbers . 
  i suspect that from afghanistan 's standpoint , larger concerns center around remittances , not religious goals . 
  i do n't know about from the eu , but [ take this snippet ] ( http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=29218 ) :  [ as of the end of 2008 ] afghans working in iran send home some $ 500 million annually , equivalent to 6 per cent of afghanistan 's gross domestic product ( gdp ) , according to a new study commissioned by the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) and the international labour organization ( ilo ) . 
    most afghans working in iran are doing so illegally , with some 360,000 of them having been deported last year , said the new report , which examines the migration of afghans under irregular conditions and for employment purposes to iran . 
    `` the potential for afghans to succeed financially in iran is significantly higher than in afghanistahn , nassim majidi of altai consulting , which was commissioned to conduct the survey by unhcr and ilo , told reporters today in kabul . 
    afghans send two-thirds of their salaries in iran back to afghanistan , she said . 
  also , monthly wages in iran are four times higher than in afghanistan , with an afghan earning $ 320 each month on average in iran compared to $ 80 back in their home country . 
  so that means that having a migrant illegally in iran earning a not-particularly-impressive-by-european-standards $ 320/mo increases afghanistan 's gdp by 2.6 times what it would if he were working in afghanistan . 
  that 's a big win for afghanistan , and taking people back kills that income . 
  fwiw , the [ us has since net reforestation since the late 1800s as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deforestation_in_the_united_states ) . 
  well , if you 're measuring cheap stuff like pine , which probably makes up the bulk of wooden items , the transport costs are probably pretty significant relative to the cost of obtaining logging rights and logging . 
  you really want to buy locally to avoid those transport costs . 
  if you were moving something rare like sandalwood , the percentage of the cost that becomes due to shipping goes way down relative to the cost of obtaining rights and logging the wood , and i suspect that shipping costs become much less of a concern . 
  there , you might expect to see more woods from abroad . 
  there 's a really interesting effect in economics driven by this called the [ alchian-allen effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alchian%e2%80%93allen_effect ) , where the place to get the best-quality examples of a good may be a long distance away from where the good is produced . 
   the alchian -- allen effect was described in 1964 by armen alchian and william r allen in the book university economics ( now called exchange and production [ 1 ] ) . 
  it states that when the prices of two substitute goods , such as high and low grades of the same product , are both increased by a fixed per-unit amount such as a transportation cost or a lump-sum tax , consumption will shift toward the higher-grade product . 
  this is true because the added per-unit amount decreases the relative price of the higher-grade product . 
    suppose , for example , that high-grade coffee beans are $ 3/pound and low-grade beans $ 1.50 / pound ; in this example , high-grade beans cost twice as much as low-grade beans . 
  now add a per-pound international shipping cost of $ 1 . 
  the effective prices are now $ 4 and $ 2.50 ; high-grade beans now cost only 1.6 times as much as low-grade beans . 
  this reduced ratio of difference will induce distant coffee-buyers to now choose a higher ratio of high-to-low grade beans than local coffee-buyers . 
  ( prices are illustrative only ) . 
    the effect has been studied as it applies to illegal drugs and it has been shown that the potency of marijuana increased in response to higher enforcement budgets , [ 2 ] and there was a similar effect for alcohol in the u.s. during prohibition . 
  [ 3 ]   another example is that australians drink higher-quality californian wine than californians , and vice versa , because it is only worth the transportation costs for the most expensive wine . 
  [ 4 ]   colloquially , the alchian -- allen theorem is also known as the `` shipping the good apples out '' theorem ( thomas borcherding ) , [ 5 ] or as the `` third law of demand . '' [ 6 ], 
   it 's `` its '' the common way to make a noun possessive in english is to attach an apostrophe and then an `` s '' . 
  unfortunately , pronouns do n't do this -- the possessive form of `` he '' is `` his '' , of `` her '' is `` hers '' , of `` it '' is `` its '' . 
  `` it 's '' is a contraction for `` it is '' , rather than the possessive form of the pronoun `` it '' . 
  it 's a common error with native speakers . 
   france had less trees than today . 
  a correction : `` fewer trees '' . 
  most nouns are [ `` count '' nouns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/count_noun ) -- these are things where there 's some sort of fundamental unit associated with the thing which you can attach a number to , where you can have `` one tree '' or `` two trees '' or `` three trees '' . 
  with these , you use `` fewer '' . 
  there are some nouns that do n't do this , known as [ mass nouns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_noun ) . 
  an example would be `` honey '' . 
  it 's a substance . 
  you ca n't have `` one honey '' or `` two honies '' or `` three honies '' . 
  for mass nouns , you 'd use `` less '' rather than `` fewer '' . 
  it 's also a not-uncommon error by native speakers , so not something to get too worked up about . 
  i would think that this would run into two significant problems : * `` extremist * is not very well-defined , and is in fact a rather-politicized term . 
  folks here currently tend right , and `` extreme-left '' shows up here in the title : my guess is that they view a broader range of people on the left as being extreme left . 
  * the guardian * is generally-considered to be center-left . 
  when i do a google search for ` site : guardian.co.uk `` far-left '' ` i get 1,680 hits ; for far-right , i get 5,810 hits . 
  that 's a ratio of 0.289 : well below 1 , with much more talk of the `` far-right '' . 
  doing the same for the center-right * telegraph * , site : telegraph.co.uk yields 130,000 and 151,000 , or a ratio of 0.861 ; much-more-equal . 
  * the economist * , also center-right , yields 20,500 and 7,520 , or 2.72 -- much more discussion of the `` far-left '' . 
  depending upon how `` extreme '' is defined , it can rather skew statistics . 
  * similarly , if there are only a very small number of people in a movement , even if the movement is very violent , it may not show up much . 
  if you want to know the overall impact , that may be fine , but if you 're trying to measure how violent a political movement is , that may not be the best metric . 
  in , say , the 1950s , in the united states , the bar for sexual harassment would have been lower ; a guy pinching a woman 's rear end in an office might have maybe not been great , but would have been less of a deal than it would have been today . 
  i think that someone could reasonably expect that a society that they did n't grow up in could let them get away with more or less than it actually does . 
  my impression is that hazing rituals saw a crackdown at some point . 
  it 's only [ in the 1980s that corporal punishment of children stopped being the norm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporal_punishment#history ) in the us and the uk . 
  the age of consent only comparatively-recently recently rose in most-places ; a hundred years ago , what is statutory rape today was normal in many places . 
  polygamy * is * legal in a number of these countries . 
  so , yes , i think that it 's possible for social expectations for sexual behavior to vary quite a bit from place to place . 
  to a finn , a mixed-sex sauna might be no big deal -- they grew up with it . 
  to an american , it might have rather-more sexual overtones , until accustomed to it . 
  and furthermore , some of these people are coming from environments without the best picture of what other places in the world are like . 
  the third world is modernizing , yes -- and even its remote places are less-remote than it once was , but there are still places in africa where informal slavery exists . 
  the un has a wing to deal with cases in where [ albinos are attacked or killed ] ( http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=50772 ) because people think that they are ghosts . 
  there 's a big difference between the world views and experience of people here .
