  no -- france had that as an option and discarded it because it was n't a very good one . 
  that would potentially be a way of addressing it . 
  but : * remember that nato and eu do n't perfectly overlap . 
  * that means mandatory collection of money . 
  obama ca n't be out advocating for that . 
  what i 'm pretty sure would happen is that you 'd have a lot of people saying `` the us has bought off brussels to take our money and take control of our military '' . 
  you 've got a few people in this thread already up in arms , who feel that just trying to convince nato members to maintain their own militaries at an agreed-upon spending level is suspicious in some way or another . 
  i ca n't even * imagine * what it would be like if obama went over and said `` okay , you guys should all have brussels control your military and collect a ton of taxes '' . 
  and , honestly , i 'm pretty sure that * we * would n't much like someone arguing for that either over here . 
  it 'd be like cameron coming over here and saying `` hey , canada and the us have military ties ... washington or ottowa should collect taxes from the other side of the border and then control the budget to a combined military '' . 
  pretty sure that that would n't go over very well . 
  * i do feel that it 's possible to have a loose collection of states working together too . 
  it 's got some challenges , but europe already is a collection of loose agreements that is unique in the present-day world , and i 'm certainly not going to claim that solving tragedy-of-the-commons here is n't possible . 
  and given that that 's the case , obama should n't be advocating for anything more than what 's necessary for nato to function well as a military alliance . 
  leave the implementation up to the people involved -- if they choose to do some sort of single budget , that 's just one of a number of available options . 
  the us concern is that the other partners in an alliance remain militarily-viable , so the us should halt after encouraging that . 
  welp , the article that was submitted was discussing the current breakdown of people arriving and registered in italy ( which is , admittedly , currently outweighed by greece , as you point out ) : 18 % nigeria , 12 % gambia , 9 % senegal , 8 % guinea , 8 % ivory coast , 8 % somalia , 8 % mali , 4 % morocco , 4 % sudan . 
  while conflict does exist in a few of those places , a lot of them are just plain really poor . 
  also , unless africa sees a strong economic improvement in the near future , i have a hard time seeing that changing . 
  south africa is probably the best-off populous country , and gdp-per-capita is on par with the early 1980s : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_south_africa  high levels of unemployment , income inequality , growing public debt , political mismanagement , low levels of education , reliable access to electricity , and crime are all serious problems that have negatively impacted the south african economy . 
  [ snip ]  south africa has an extreme and persistent high unemployment rate of over 25 % , which interacts with other economic and social problems such as inadequate education , poor health outcomes and crime . 
  [ 59 ] the poor have limited access to economic opportunities and basic services . 
  [ 60 ] according to a 2013 goldman sachs report , that number increases to 35 % when including people who have given up looking for work . 
  [ 9 ] a quarter of south africans live on less than us $ 1.25 a day . 
  [ 61 ]   south africa 's mass unemployment dates back to the 1970s , and continued to rise through the 1980s and 1990s . 
  [ 62 ] unemployment has increased substantially since the african national congress came to power in 1994 , going from 15.6 % in 1995 to 30.3 % in 2001 . 
  [ 63 ] in the second quarter of 2010 , the jobless rate increased to 25.3 % , and the number of people with work fell by 61,000 to 12.7 million . 
  the biggest decline in employment was recorded in the manufacturing industry , which shed 53,000 workers . 
  agriculture lost 32,000 jobs , employment in the construction industry fell by 15,000 . 
  [ 64 ] in the third quarter of 2010 , 29.80 % of blacks were officially unemployed , compared with 22.30 % of coloureds , 8.60 of asians and 5.10 % of whites . 
  [ 65 ]   the official unemployment rate , though very high by international standards , understates its magnitude because it includes only adults who are actively looking for work , excluding those who have given up looking for jobs . 
  [ 66 ] only 41 % of the population of working age have any kind of job ( formal or informal ) . 
  [ 66 ] this rate is 30 % points lower than that of china , and about 25 % lower than that of brazil or indonesia . 
  [ 66 ] the relatively generous social grants reduces the political cost of unemployment . 
  [ 67 ] there is some evidence that households view paid employment and social grants as substitutes at the margin : households that lose a pension-eligible member subsequently report increased labour force participation . 
  [ 67 ]   the unemployment problem is characterised by its lengthy duration : in the mid-1990s nearly two thirds of the unemployed had never worked for pay . 
  [ 62 ] the 2005 labour force survey found that 40 % of unemployed individuals have been unemployed for more than three years , while 59 % have never had a job at all . 
  [ 62 ] the unemployment rate has fuelled crime , inequality and social unrest . 
  the global economic downturn has made the problem worse , wiping out more than a million jobs . 
  in september 2010 , over a third of south africa 's workforce were out of work , and so were more than half of blacks aged 15 -- 34 , three times the level for whites . 
  [ 68 ] [ snip ]  there has been a large degree of human capital flight from south africa in recent years . 
  [ 70 ] [ 71 ] south africa 's bureau of statistics estimates that between 1 million and 1.6 million people in skilled , professional , and managerial occupations have emigrated since 1994 and that , for every emigrant , 10 unskilled people lose their jobs . 
  [ 70 ] if i live in a poor african country , i can either : * face what will statistically almost-certainly be a low standard of living by global standards for the rest of my life , leaving my children in the same boat . 
  * hope for a great across-the-board industrialization and improvement in wealth that has not happened thus far . 
  * i can take a gamble and emigrate . 
  of the available options , i 'd say that europe is by far the most-viable and - appealing destination -- it 's looking better than places like the above-described south africa . 
   without centralised command , `` 1 + 1 '' is not 2 , and our overall military is a lot weaker than it might seem . 
  i 'd agree ( nato mitigates * some * of that via cross-service training and europe has her own , additional forms of international cooperation ) but it 's not even what he 's talking about . 
  right now , it 's that 0.5 + 0.5 is not 2 . 
  even if europe 's militaries do a phenomenal job of doing more-with-less and cooperate and manage to operate on every level as well as a single combined military , no issues at all ... they 're still having to work with difficult constraints placed upon them by their governments . 
  there 's only so much that can be done with a severely-constrained budget . 
  and it obviously makes it politically-tough for the few countries that * do * meet the bar to continue to meet the bar if they see other countries free-riding -- i expect that it 's frustrating for , say , poland or the uk to pull their weight at the 2 % level and then look around and see other countries not doing so . 
  and 2 % of gdp is not , by global standards , a terribly-large number or something that would be crippling for europe to manage , and it scales with the size of an economy . 
  if there is n't some form of line , then invariably individual countries will dip below the line , as there 's no form of centralized funding of europe 's militaries . 
  yes , it does cost something . 
  but i truly think that it is in europe 's interest to maintain a competent military capability . 
  it 's not binding , but i 'd say that it 's stronger than `` recommendation '' -- various members said `` yes , it 's not a membership condition , but we will do this '' and never even attempted to do anything but move it further and further from the 2 % level . 
  [ tragedy of the commons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy_of_the_commons ) -- national security is a standard example of a [ public good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_good ) . 
  the problem is that when you start making military contributions mandatory , you run the risk of getting into abuses like the end of the [ delian league ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delian_league ) . 
  would be preferable to avoid that sort of awkward situation entirely . 
  while i 'll grant that eritrea has governmental problems , i 'm trying to make a broader point -- that the standard-of-living alone , even ignoring the government , is going to be a sufficient draw . 
  let 's say that eritrea , tomorrow , had a more-acceptable-by-international-norms government . 
  hey , might well even improve the economy . 
  but it 's still going to be incredibly poor compared to europe . 
  when the economic distance is that large , it 's just not that difficult to make the decision to roll the dice and try to get in . 
  and as long as that gap remains , unless some sort of dramatic change happens , there 's going to continue to be an inflow . 
  / u/bristlerider is saying that , okay , illegal immigrants get lies and rumors that make europe look gilded . 
  and , yeah , i 'm sure that there is * some * degree of misinformation floating around . 
  but the reality is a strong-enough pull . 
  even working in europe under-the-counter is going to be a better deal than what the bulk of the population is getting in africa at the moment . 
  fair enough , but : * that 's still a smaller divide than that for first-gen immigrants . 
  * even if the divide never closed , it 'd still be a wealthier future than that in africa . 
   any of these `` refugees '' are 5-8 years away from a well paid job by eritrean standards , `` well-paid '' is also going to mean something a bit different . 
  remember that in making the decision to come to europe , that 's the comparison being made -- do you want the kind of money being made in eritrea ( gdp per-capita $ 593 ) or in germany ? 
   i doubt a majority of europeans are pro- importing more migrants . 
  more people in africa than in europe at the moment . 
   ah but of course you could n't have heard their prayers , since the `` omniscient '' allah only understands arabic . 
  well , the same guy kinda-sorta is the head honcho in christianity , judaism , and islam . 
  dear professor hatefact : thank you for praying to express your support for a low level of immigration between north africa and europe . 
  i appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond . 
  in 2014 and 2015 , i helped millions of migrants safely pass across the mediterranean . 
  when storms arose , i said `` quiet !, 
  be still !, 
  '' , and the wind died down and it became completely calm . 
  the lives of many people who would otherwise have died were saved . 
  over that time period , the number of prayers i received in favor of safe passage and entry into europe greatly outweighed those against . 
  i anticipate continuing to help assist those people who are in need across the mediterranean . 
  while we do not necessarily agree on this issue , be assured that your views are important to me , and i will keep them in mind as i guide humanity in the future . 
  your creator and friend , allah, 
  i am not saying that this happened here , and i have no familiarity with how the austrian political system works . 
  but at least in the us , and , i suspect , many countries , legislation can be `` pre-drafted '' if it is believed that it might be able to be passed at a later time or that there is an important time to put it out . 
  the patriot act was ready-to-go very quickly -- someone had already written it up and was waiting for a politically-opportune time when the public was concerned about terrorism . 
  i am sure that there are many other , similar pieces of would-be law out there that await their moment . 
  at least from a technical standpoint , it 's viable for the legislation to be related to how political parties do -- the legislation does n't have to be drafted in that time period for the proposal to have been contingent upon an event in that time period . 
  one policy fix might be to mandate a certain set of conditions -- you say `` any software product that i purchase in this environment must meet the following set of conditions '' . 
  if i had to propose something off-the-cuff : * the vendor must store a copy of the source code ( or hardware description material ) with some archival organization where it must be accessible to companies registered as security testing companies . 
  there 's an obvious concern with leaking intellectual property , since one thing that people have relied on somewhat in the past has been the fact that much software has a compiling or obfuscation stage , and that it 's harder to figure how the software works once it has been compiled or obfuscated -- that would need to be solved . 
  * the vendor must offer a bounty ( perhaps with some kind of cap -- unbounded liability is n't really realistic ) on security holes found in their software , where security holes meet some sort of criteria . 
  because the vendor might go out of business or something like that and be unable to pay the bounty , they 're required to have insurance that financially-backs this bounty . 
  * insurers issue `` safe '' rates that they know that they are n't going to lose money on .
