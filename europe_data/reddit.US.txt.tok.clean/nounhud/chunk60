  so , yeah , i think that it 's possible that people could have a very different expectation of what they could get away with . 
  that does n't mean that germany 's guides would be helpful -- since someone could reasonably think that what they can get away with , like feeling someone up , would be * officially * not okay but winked at . 
  think of , say , how recreational drugs are often treated . 
  say you take a bunch of young men who are a long ways from any wife or other people in their society , in the midst of a big celebration , and plenty of alcohol in ready abundance -- which is at least officially-prohibited in a number of the countries that people are coming from . 
  yeah , i do n't think that it 's implausible for someone to think that they could viably get away with pushing limits . 
   a day after the poll came out , merkel said she expects syrians to return home once their country 's conflict is over -- perceived by some as sign of a liberal policy reversal . 
  but even that did n't significantly effect how she was viewed by syrian asylum seekers posting online . 
  `` what merkel said is perfectly fine and it is very natural , '' muhammad hatib , a syrian asylum seeker in munich , wrote in response to merkel 's remark . 
  `` there is so much pressure on her . 
  i 'm sure it is just lip service . '' this should be interesting down the line . 
   no shit , when you 're germany and you export 4-50 % of gdp .

  it 's not `` better '' to export than to import -- after all , do you really want to do work and never get anything in exchange ?

  those are less-mutable . 
  additionally , note that in this case , the guy is objecting to being in a refugee camp , which is a higher bar than what you 're pointing out -- it provides housing and food , but not much by way of economic potential for him relative to working in europe 's wealthier countries . 
  you could make the presently-wealthy part of the world also poor , and say that now nobody is poor , i suppose . 
  i liked the part where they focused on europe 's moral failings for not providing more-favorable employment conditions but avoided suggesting that the us take in a great deal of migrants and do the same . 
  i felt that really encapsulated the article 's concerns in a nutshell . 
   `` i felt so disappointed , they 'd tricked me . 
  i was seeking help , why did they do this to me ? 
  they treated me like a fool , '' said mohamed . 
  now he lives in an overcrowded refugee camp 27 miles from budapest , surviving on $ 108 a month . 
  they did provide help -- he 's not at risk of his life . 
  ah , fair enough .

  admittedly , that 's not a very exciting place to be , but ... 
   perhaps the most useful comparison is a sober political one . 
  iowa is like the particular constituency in the northeast of england that rushes to be the first to count its votes during a british general election . 
    `` it 's all very exciting as the ballots are being counted but the impact on the overall election result is minuscule , '' the bbc concludes . 
  that 's not really comparable , because in the us , the primary vote happens and the result is visible * before * everyone else is voting , which means that it can meaningfully-influence later results .

  http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/630138/norway-immigration-migrants-refugees-rules-crackdown-europe-crisis  norway is pushing for a crackdown on asylum rules after it was revealed 30,000 migrants entered the country this year ... the move comes after more than 30,000 asylum-seekers sought shelter in the country , which has a population of 5.1 million people , this year . 
    immigration minister sylvi listhaug , of the right-wing progress party , said the country 's influx of migrants was one of the highest numbers in europe in relation to its population size . 
   this demonstrates the vulnerability russia faces due to its lack of access to oceans and waterways . 
    it also reveals why russia is , for all intents and purposes , a landlocked country . 
  this is why switzerland , a fully-landlocked country , is known for its extreme aggression against other countries . 
   last week , the iranian option was at the forefront of many europeans ' minds , as president hassan rouhani visited rome and paris to jumpstart economic relations after the end of sanctions . 
  in france , rouhani signed off on a deal to purchase 118 airbus aircraft . 
  this is clearly pretty good economic news , with potentially positive strategic side effects , but it highlights the ways in which european politicians are now addicted to injections of cash from their middle eastern and asian partners . 
  iranian oil being dumped onto the market , as happened with the lifting of sanctions and lots of purchasing , also happens to whack oil prices and thus russia . 
  iran is , notably , one of the handful of countries with a [ marginal cost of production of oil lower than that of russia ] ( http://knoema.com/vyronoe/cost-of-oil-production-by-country ) . 
  i 'm not entirely-sure that this purchasing would be best-described as uncoordinated or a sign of weakness .

   questions asking people if there are too many jews in france ( 13 percent said yes , rising to 18 percent among muslims ) and how they would react if their daughter married a muslim ( 56 percent said they would react `` badly '' ) were blasted on social media for being unnecessarily inflammatory and divisive . 
  i think i 'd rather have the data than pretend that it is n't there , frankly .

  [ judge rules man had right to shoot down drone over his house ] ( http://www.cnet.com/news/judge-rules-man-had-right-to-shoot-down-drone-over-his-house/ )   a kentucky judge dismisses all charges against william merideth , saying the drone was an invasion of privacy . 
  [ snip ]  should it have temporarily escaped your pressured memory , william merideth in july said he saw a drone flying above his property in hillview , kentucky . 
    he believed it was spying on his 16-year-old daughter who was sunbathing in the garden . 
  so he took out his shotgun and blasted the drone out of the sky .

   the question of whether the kyiv rebels will be given an amnesty is also still open . 
  `` only after legal examination , '' says the ukrainian foreign minister , pavlo klimkin . 
  moscow wants a general amnesty . 
  the argument has been going round in circles for months at the negotiating tables in the belarusian capital , minsk . 
  honestly , an amnesty is probably a good thing to grant from ukraine 's standpoint . 
  it decreases the incentives of rebels -- who , having rebelled , are in the position of serious penalties if they lose out at the moment -- to try and hold on longer .

  apparently , [ sweden and romania were going over this earlier in the year ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/half-swedes-want-ban-begging-319327 ) :  a new survey has revealed that almost a half of all swedes want to ban begging ... this result is is a marked increase from september when the same question was posed and 36 % said they would ban begging . 
  [ snip ]  in february last year the romanian ambassador to sweden wrote an article in the swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter saying that the country allowing people to beg `` does not facilitate romania 's efforts to achieve social inclusion and increased employability '' , indicating that he was in support of a ban on begging . 
  [ snip ]  the swedish prime minister stefan l\u00f6fven was quick to offer assurances that such a ban on begging would not be implemented under his government , saying `` legislating against poverty is a waste of time . '' in the us , while it 's never reached the supreme court of the united states , lower federal courts have ruled in the past that begging is a form of speech protected by the first amendment . 
   the most common misconception people in bulgaria and romania have about beggars in sweden is that swedes take pity on them and give them lots of money . 
  the roma beggars are everywhere here in stockholm but i have hardly ever seen anyone give them money . 
  i bet that the people running these do the math and would n't do it if they were n't making money .
