   if the uk leaves liberal ideas will have a much harder time keeping the more protectionist ideas at bay , which will still influence you greatly . 
  that 's pretty much my position , but i suppose to the brits it looks like huge numbers of people advocating for protectionism swamping their comparatively-small influence . 
   britain is staying in nato and remains committed to the national democracies and sovereignty of all of its nato partners . 
  this does not include defense of eu-but-not-nato members like sweden and finland , where conflict would heavily rely on france . 
  [ wikipedia : romanian submarine * delfinul * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_submarine_delfinul )  the submarine successfully accomplished 67 missions , with 2000 hours of immersion . 
  [ 5 ] during these missions , delfinul launched 23 torpedoes and 2 naval mines . 
  [ 5 ] in 1996 , the submarine exhausted the resources of the initial batteries and is kept in reserve since then . 
  after 2001 , the submarine was transferred to the `` mircea cel b\u0103tr\u00e2n '' naval academy , being used as a training ship .

  institutions that want to keep cameras off generate a public-private keypair , and get their certificate signed ; they do short-range broadcasts that the phone can receive within a limited vicinity . 
  when the phone receives it , it flips off certain functionality .

   cell phone cameras that 's a good point -- we have ever-present cameras and microphones in society now , and i am not really enthralled about all the effects of that .

   just like the us leaving ukraine . 
  [ that would be popular in russia ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/10/key-findings-from-our-poll-on-the-russia-ukraine-conflict/ ) , but probably [ not in ukraine ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/1-americas-global-image/ ) , where us involvement has been popular :  in conflict-ridden ukraine , 69 % have a positive opinion of the u.s. , although there are notable differences between the western ( 78 % ) and eastern ( 56 % ) regions of the nation . 
  the us does n't have combat forces holding ukraine , just a [ small number of us military instructors providing military training ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-usa-iduskcn0py28a20150725 ) . 
  the us also sent over some [ police officers ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-replace-kiev-traffic-police-force-america-trained-officers-bribery/ ) , but again that was a small number providing training :  the first phase replaced the old traffic police with a new 2,000-strong patrol team trained by ukrainians who had themselves received instruction from american officers . 
  certainly the us has n't attempted to annex part of ukraine or anything on that level , and if the ukranians vote for the us to leave , then that is what will happen . 
   your first link does n't seem to be working . 
  it works here , but maybe * the economist * has some sort of ip-based restrictions ? 
  the article is `` entrepreneurship : what 's so great about small business ? 
  '' :  catherine rampell is writing a series of posts on the state of small business in america . 
  today , she describes how the climate for small business in america is quite good relative to that in other countries . 
  and yet , she worried yesterday , large businesses are much more important to america 's economies than they are elsewhere . 
  [ consider this chart ] ( https://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/economix-29smallbiz2-custom3-v3.jpg ) :   [ chart removed ]   in america , just under 80 % of enterprises employ fewer than 10 people . 
  in italy , by contrast , very nearly the entire economy is composed of firms of that size . 
  but small business is the lifeblood of a dynamic economy , right ? 
  surely america ought to be doing better on this score than laggardly italia . 
    well , a recent [ special report ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/18780841?story_id=18780841 ) on the italian economy explains why it 's italy that has something to learn from america , and not the other way around :    italy is a wild forest of little privileges , rents and closures . 
  each has its own lobby group ; together they conspire to make reforms close to impossible . 
  this is particularly evident in the service sector . 
  the government is reinstating minimum charges for lawyers , a group not normally considered to need protection from unscrupulous employers . 
  at the other end of the labour market , barriers to entry in jobs that might attract immigrants are high . 
  in britain pharmacies are often staffed by bright young asians . 
  in italy until recently the law set minimum distances between pharmacies , handing a huge advantage to incumbents and blocking new entrants . 
  if the owner of one of these shops died , his heirs had the right to run the business for ten years even if they were not qualified pharmacists . 
  these laws were tweaked in 2006 , but three years later the desired competition had still not materialised and only 64 pharmacists in italy had more than one shop . 
    in america , the retail sector is dramatically freer than in much of europe . 
  successful retailers can grow and grow and grow into national or global chains . 
  that may make the high street a little less quaint , but it makes for higher productivity , more rapid growth , and more job creation . 
  and less corruption . 
  the italian rules that protect small businesses and keep them small are a major reason why the italian economy struggles so mightily to manage positive growth . 
    why are small businesses important to an economy ? 
  not because small itself is beautiful . 
  rather , it 's because the best small firms become big , spreading good ideas across the entire economy and creating lots of jobs through expansion . 
    the presence of large businesses in america could become a problem if those businesses use their size to quash competition , through anti-competitive practices or political rent-seeking . 
  but in general , america 's large businesses are a testament to the fact that in the american economy , the successful are allowed to grow . 
  and grow and grow and grow . 
  * the economist * likes cheering on economic liberalization . 
  not that i 'm opposed to it in any way , but i personally think that they are very ready to take the first explanation for any problem that involves economic liberalization that they run into . 
  the chart stands on its own , on the other hand . 
   but more concerning is the ever-rising level of abuse , trolling and `` astroturfing '' ( propaganda posting -- an artificial version of a grassroots campaign ) currently polluting what are often illuminating and stimulating discussions . 
  the migrant stories have more astroturfing than the ukraine stories ? 
  that 's impressive . 
  re : the comments : might be preferable to make use of a more-sophisticated commenting system that provides , say , some sort of tagging to let people who do n't want to see particular comments filter them out . 
  heh , they shut down comments on the submitted story too . 
  all that being said , i do n't read comments on news story sites -- the commenting systems are usually really-primitive . 
  much better to submit to reddit and discuss there . 
   as to non-food resources , yes , the developed world obviously consumes more than its fair share . 
  define `` fair '' . 
  the countries that sell , say , minerals do so in exchange for something ( be it manufactured products , services , or whatnot ) that they consider a beneficial exchange . 
   `` it 's a chilling thought that plague might have once been hiding right around the corner throughout europe , living in a host which is not known to us yet '' explains johannes krause because it might still be there ? 
  i 'm not all that concerned . 
  first , due to the lack of outbreaks since , but second , we already underwent natural selection to develop resistance to its mechanisms . 
   and scattered  about it , some in their overturned war-machines , some in the now rigid  handling-machines , and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a  row , were the martians -- _ dead _ ! -- slain by the putrefactive and disease  bacteria against which their systems were unprepared ; slain as the red  weed was being slain ; slain , after all man 's devices had failed , by  the humblest things that god , in his wisdom , has put upon this earth . 
    for so it had come about , as indeed i and many men might have  foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds . 
  these  germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of  things -- taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here . 
   but by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed  resisting power ; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle , and to  many -- those that cause putrefaction in dead matter , for instance -- our  living frames are altogether immune . 
  but there are no bacteria in  mars , and directly these invaders arrived , directly they drank and  fed , our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow . 
  already  when i watched them they were irrevocably doomed , dying and rotting  even as they went to and fro . 
  it was inevitable . 
  by the toll of a  billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth , and it is  his against all comers ; it would still be his were the martians ten  times as mighty as they are . 
  for neither do men live nor die in vain .

   i find europeans are a lot less likely than americans to go start a business [ businesses in the us tend to be larger than those in most of europe ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/06/entrepreneurship-0 ) . 
   in america , just under 80 % of enterprises employ fewer than 10 people . 
  in italy , by contrast , very nearly the entire economy is composed of firms of that size . 
  not only that , but [ ( see p. 42 in `` entrepreneurship at a glance '' ) ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/3014031e.pdf?expires=1454286811&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=944f6300e93576924d849d3237975fbc ) the rate of new enterprise creation in the us has been trending down , nor is the absolute level as high as in a number of eu members ( see p. 47 ) . 
  broadly-speaking , factors like more trade have , in recent decades , * tended * to reduce poverty around the world , including in africa , at least in percentage-of-the-population terms ( not necessarily in absolute terms ) . 
  http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/poverty-rising-africa-poverty-report  `` the main messages which emerge from this effort to assess poverty in africa are both encouraging and sobering , '' said kathleen beegle , world bank program leader and co-author of the report . 
  `` although the data show that the share of the african population in extreme poverty did decline , major poverty challenges still remain , especially in light of the region 's rapid population growth . ''   according to latest world bank estimates , the share of africans who are poor fell from 56 % in 1990 to 43 % in 2012 . 
  the report argues that the poverty rate may have declined even more if the quality and comparability of the underlying data are taken into consideration . 
  however , because of population growth many more people are poor , the report says . 
  the most optimistic scenario shows about 330 million poor in 2012 , up from about 280 million in 1990 . 
  poverty reduction has been slowest in fragile countries , the report notes , and rural areas remain much poorer , although the urban-rural gap has narrowed .
