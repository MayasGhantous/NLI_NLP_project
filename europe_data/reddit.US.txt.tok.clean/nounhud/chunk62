   roughly speaking nobody is getting educated or wealthier when each women has 10 kids . 
  well , i guess if you could educate people efficiently-enough ... 
  africa ( well , regions of africa ) do not produce enough to trade for the food that it requires ; as a result , famines have been an issue . 
  singapore 's population density is high , but it has no problem producing enough in trade that it can have another part of the world specialize in food production . 
  broadly-speaking , the [ law of diminishing returns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diminishing_returns ) means that at a certain point , as population increases , per-capita production will tend to decrease . 
  put simply , this is because the first people will use the most-productive resources ( be it land , access to water , etc ) , and each additional person will have to use a slightly-less-favorable set of resources . 
  thus , increasing population is n't great if you 're trying to have africa sustain itself .

  :-( also , while i do n't know if i 'd have had the presence of mind , it 's too bad that only two cars that i saw had had their their hazard lights turned on before the driver jumped out . 
  i also keep road flares in my trunk , and i did n't see any of those thrown back either . 
  the drumming going on at about 6:00 is kind of weird . 
  not what i 'd think of people taking to a protest . 
  that graph is a bad visualization . 
  first , it expresses total 2014 migration with a bracket . 
  okay , fair enough . 
  then it expresses total 2015 migration with a line -- which really looks like the height in a month -- not so good . 
  then it uses another line to indicate the amount in a single month . 
  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/463dc7a0-982b-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html  in spite of months of encouragement from the eu , it has declined to call in frontex 's rapid intervention team , as it did in 2011 to help on its land border with bulgaria . 
  greece showed more openness over invoking this so-called `` rabit '' mechanism during mr asselborn 's visit , according to officials familiar with the talks . 
  [ snip ]  `` the red line for the germans was not allowing frontex to come in and help them , '' said one eu ambassador in brussels . 
  `` the germans are furious and that 's why people are talking about pushing greece out . '' i do n't * blame * greece , mind -- i think that it 's incumbent upon the eu to say `` greece will not be penalized in terms of migrant load for registering people '' if it wants greece to cooperate . 
   spending years telling a country to go full austerity and then demanding to know why they have n't had more money to spend on border guards ? 
  not an issue of budget . 
  the eu offered frontex 's services in intercepting migrants , which greece declined . 
  the issue is that if frontex stops and registers migrants in greece , greece gets stuck with them . 
  greece , not surprisingly , does n't want the whole migrant load . 
   capitalism says no not really a function of capitalism . 
  you can have privately-owned and operated industry and still have high taxes . 
  at * least * within schengen , i think that it 's reasonable to say that the issue is one of all countries involved . 
  if you want to break down internal borders , all members benefit from this . 
  it 's the norm for members to foot the bill for costs associated with the external border . 
  it 's not as if your counties say `` well , the channel tunnel goes through kent , so the county of kent should bear all costs associated with uk border security '' . 
   european commission vice president valdis dombrovskis told the german newsmagazine `` der spiegel '' saturday that he agreed with sch\u00e4uble that fresh ideas , such as a fuel tax , were needed to deal with refugee crisis gripping europe since september . 
  i imagine that europe 's auto companies are less-than-enthralled and her train companies delighted . 
   `` the aim is not just to play with the way society is organised , but instead to demolish the existing order and build something new in its place , '' said martin schulz . 
  `` the internet lost its innocence long ago . '' eh . 
  while people like using terms like `` disruptive '' , i do n't think that there 's anything fundamentally new here . 
  technology has always reshaped society , and typically not in any kind of planned way . 
  whether it 's the automobile or the phone or the firearm or printing press , technology has impacted and changed human society . 
   `` we can not leave debating ` internet issues ' to the nerds . 
  it is a debate in which all must have their say . '' sure , though i think that a broadly `` hands off until actual issues arise '' default is a useful one with law . 
  data privacy i 'm more sympathetic on ( though i 've also concerns about enforceability ) , as i think that the public has a real stake in it but lacks the expertise to understand what 's being done or the implications . 
   the european data protection supervisor , or edps , is the eu 's smallest entity but also one of its most ambitious , and immediately followed schulz 's address by announcing a new ethics advisory group . 
  ehhh ... i dunno how enthralled i am about ethics groups . 
  for example , my understanding is that under modern us standards , ethics restrictions would today block the [ milgram experiment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milgram_experiment ) , and i think that that was an important piece of work where the benefits outweighed the costs . 
  i 'm also dubious about things like animal rights , another point of ethics contention . 
  i 'd be much happier to have some broad rule proposed for , say , privacy , and then to have technical experts evaluate viability than to have some group of self-proclaimed ethicists try to come up with new moral rules . 
   six individuals have been selected to spearhead what is initially a two-year investigative , consultative and report-writing initiative : iconoclastic american computer scientist and writer jaron lanier ; this is already not sounding that great . 
  i have seen a few articles by him and associate [ lanier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaron_lanier ) with rather broad proclamations on society that i 'm skeptical about . 
  example snippet :  in his book you are not a gadget ( 2010 ) , lanier criticizes what he perceives as the hive mind of web 2.0 ( wisdom of the crowd ) and describes the open source and open content expropriation of intellectual production as a form of `` digital maoism '' . 
  [ 19 ] lanier argues that web 2.0 developments have retarded progress and innovation and glorified the collective at the expense of the individual . 
  he criticizes wikipedia and linux as examples of this problem ; wikipedia for what he sees as : its `` mob rule '' by anonymous editors , the weakness of its non-scientific content , and its bullying of experts . 
  lanier also argues that there are limitations to certain aspects of the open source and content movement in that they lack the ability to create anything truly new and innovative . 
  for example , lanier argues that the open source movement did n't create the iphone . 
  in another example , lanier claims that web 2.0 makes search engines lazy , destroys the potential of innovative websites like thinkquest , and hampers the communication of ideas like mathematics to a wider audience . 
  lanier further argues that the open source approach has destroyed opportunities for the middle class to finance content creation , and results in the concentration of wealth in a few individuals -- `` the lords of the clouds '' -- people who , more by virtue of luck rather than true innovation , manage to insert themselves as content concentrators at strategic times and locations in the cloud . 
  he left a distinct bad taste in my mouth by simply making rather-controversial assertions in his interviews and articles and not really supporting them -- i recall using the phrase `` it sounds like stuff i 've read before from acid enthusiasts '' . 
  as soon as i saw his dreadlocks , i immediately remembered him . 
   aur\u00e9lie pols not familiar with her . 
  the first phrase i see [ online ] ( http://mobilemarketingmagazine.com/the-trillion-euro-question-whose-data-is-it-anyway/ ) does n't make me really hopeful , though :  `` certain industries , like advertising , have this weird sensation that giving customers choices will make them lose money , '' she told mobile marketing . 
  `` that 's not really the case . 
  and the industry does n't seem to know how to ask for consent : ` no let 's not ask them , let 's just take the data and say nothing ' . '' of course it will cause them to lose money . 
  there 's nothing inherently * wrong * with that -- regulation in the name of internalizing externalities commonly does this . 
  claiming otherwise sounds suspiciously like trying to sell the way she wished the world was at the cost of rigor . 
   peter burgess [ this summary ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/cultural-politics-political-culture-postmodern/ ) as well as that of his other writing sounds like what i do n't really like in humanities writing : `` fluffy '' , low-content , opaque material that spends most of its time trying to claim that it 's introducing some sort of new paradigm , some `` new way of thinking '' about things , while hitting as many currently-hot buzzwords as possible and throwing in allusions to a canon of literature . 
  there 's a herd of people doing this in some fields , without actually contributing useful , pragmatic output . 
  same thing with his blog . 
   antoinette rouvroy her stuff is french , so i ca n't evaluate it , but sounds like it 's in a similar vein . 
   luciano floridi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luciano_floridi  according to floridi , it is necessary to develop a constructionist philosophy , where design , modelling and implementation replace analysis and dissection . 
  shifting from one set of tasks to the other , philosophy could then stop retreating into the increasingly small corner of its self-sustaining investigations and hence reacquire a wider view about what really matters . 
  slowly , floridi has come to characterise his constructionist philosophy as an innovative field , now known as the philosophy of information , the new area of research that has emerged from the computational/informational turn . 
   jeroen van den hoven http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03605310701397040 or https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3275721/ ditto . 
  i 'd rather have people more in the field of , oh , law or policy-making , someone who is familiar with historical trade-offs and concerns in policy and has spent a while arguing about policy , not spending their time arguing abstractions . 
  if a philosopher has done that , great , but these people do n't look all that promising . 
  to my way of looking at things , the online world 's issue is that people who could make a decision about their privacy tradeoffs simply are n't able to do so because they do n't understand the implications of data-mining , or of what is being captured . 
  you do n't need a `` new ethical framework '' to address that . 
  you need people with an understanding of the technologies involved , maybe someone familiar with data-mining and privacy , and people with familiarity with crafting legislation . 
  this looks unpleasantly like something that will dump some money on folks who are unlikely to turn out something that is either useful from a practical standpoint , particularly clear , or likely to be applicable to putting out policy . 
   sigmar gabriel has called for the right-leaning alternative for germany ( afd ) party to be watched by intelligence services . 
  using intelligence agencies against your political opponents is a dangerous precedent . 
   russia has been sending conciliatory signals to kyiv , but many ukrainians are skeptical . 
  the general consensus among ukrainians is that a revival of the old friendship with moscow will be difficult . 
  russia leaving donbas and crimea would probably be a good start , though .

   home automation i 'm pretty dubious about this one . 
  i 've definitely seen 1980s material talking about home automation being the future , and / r/retrofuturism has examples going back much further , to world war ii at least . 
  in practice , though , i do n't think that we 've really seen any mainstream home automation taking off beyond the labor-saving devices of the 70s or so . 
  computerized thermostats that let a house not be as cool/warm when people are away during the day is probably the best example , but the idea of sensor and fancy lighting , door control , and hvac integration really has not taken off . 
  ditto for most proposed home robotics -- the roomba is commercially-available , but not something that 's really become a widely-used item . 
  * this article is seven months old . 
  * zerohedge has a tendency towards exaggeration of content it covers : it strongly favors prediction of apocalyptic scenarios . 
  generally-speaking , if it covers something , i 'd suggest finding a more-reputable source covering the same thing and submitting that instead . 
  tear gas or other riot-control measures are probably preferable if you 're concerned about overrun and want a crowd to disperse . 
  it 's not like the police have considered themselves in danger to date . 
  as far as i can tell , both sides go in for black masks and black outfits . 
  seems like that would get confusing pretty quickly if a fight breaks out .
