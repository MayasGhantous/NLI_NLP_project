  [ rt : turkey says su-34 violated airspace , moscow shrugs off report as ` propaganda ' ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/330723-turkey-russia-jet-envoy/ ) :  the russian ministry of defense said that ankara could n't have determined which country the jet belonged to under the circumstances they described ... he stressed that the airspace controlling radar stations that turkey has can only determine the altitude , flight line , and speed of an aerial vehicle , but not its type or state affiliation . 
  to determine which country owns the jet requires visual contact from another aircraft , konashenkov emphasized , adding that no visual contact had been reported . 
   i think turkey and russia are already quite short from declaring war on each other . 
  i disagree . 
  i 'm pretty comfortable saying that even if if russia flies another plane into turkey 's airspace , turkey wo n't declare war ( though it might shoot it down ) , and even if turkey shoots it down , russia wo n't declare war . 
   nobody in europe wants turkey in nato , nor is willing to put their neck over for it ... 
  when you sign up for nato , you also sign up for a responsibility to defend other members if they are attacked . 
  when a new member joins , every existing member agrees to defend them if they are attacked . 
  whether-or-not turkey is taking the best diplomatic route on this ( and i 'd note , they did not shoot down the plane this time ) , they certainly do have right to control their airspace , and if russia is flying warplanes into their country , it 's russia in the wrong .

  as per the article text :  officials in meaux said the man told investigators that he was keeping the weapons and ammunition with him because he was moving from one residence to another and did not want the weapons to be picked up by someone else .

  if you 're talking about the green dots , i suspect that those are just locations with radiation detectors used as source data for the map , since there 's a dot for `` radiation up to x '' , and you should always have some background radiation .

   with the z\u0142oty hitting its 4-year low relative to the euro , it remains unclear how pis plans to get there . 
  one of pis 's key deliverables is `` 500 pln for each child . '' the new program , which was at core of the party 's campaign , will hand each family , irrespective of its income , a subsidy of roughly $ 125 a month for their second child and every additional child -- until they all reach the age of 18 . 
  the party also promised to more than double the tax-exempt share of household income . 
  the annual cost of these programs has been estimated at around $ 11 billion . 
  on the other hand , if that guarantees future taxpayers , is that a long-term loss or not ? 
  i bet that the average taxpayer in poland pays a lot more than $ 27,000 over his lifetime .

  `` lie '' down . 
  native speakers also get this wrong a lot , so usually i ignore it , but folks on / r/europe in the past have wanted corrections , so ... 
  in english , in the present tense , `` lay '' is a transitive verb -- you use it when you 're doing something * to * something -- and `` lie '' is intransitive -- you do it when you 're just doing something , not * to * anything else . 
  `` i want to lie down . '', 
  `` lay the ball down . '', 
  this is complicated by the fact that in the * past * tense , `` lay '' is the intransitive form : `` i lay in bed all yesterday . '', 
  you can bypass the ft.com paywall by searching google for the url and then following it . 
  google blocks websites if they return a page to google users other than the one that google has indexed . 
  this avoids google returning lots of paywall spam , but since it hits website traffic so much , many website operators will special-case google . 
  so if your browser says that your host-referrer is from google , you 're good . 
   ** greece can not become a holding pen for migrants **   europe 's schengen system permitting passport-free travel across 26 countries is on the brink of collapse . 
  following the arrival of 1.8 m refugees on the continent last year , several eu states -- hungary , austria and sweden among them -- set up temporary border controls to process migrants and assuage the anxiety of voters on immigration . 
  however , barring a dramatic change in syria , a further 1m asylum seekers are expected to arrive in europe in 2016 . 
  this is forcing eu leaders to consider more drastic action . 
   one idea that looks likely to be implemented is the suspension of schengen for two years from may . 
  the restoration of frontier controls would undermine one of the bloc 's biggest political achievements , yet even this will not stem the tide of migrants coming from the eastern mediterranean . 
  about 45,000 made their way from turkey to greece this month , 30 times the figure for january 2015 . 
  it is for this reason that the eu has the status of greece 's borders in its sights . 
    on wednesday , the commission threatened to suspend athens from schengen , arguing that it is not properly processing migrants on its territory . 
  some eu leaders are going further , suggesting the bloc should assist macedonia , a non-eu state , to seal its border with greece , the main route north for many refugees . 
  the greeks have responded furiously , saying this would turn the country into a `` cemetery of souls '' . 
  their anger is largely justified . 
   greece can be criticised for failing to effectively manage the refugee influx . 
  the eu has given athens funds to set up five resettlement camps but only one has been built . 
  instead of registering asylum applicants , the greeks have allowed many to travel into europe . 
    in most other respects , however , athens can hardly be blamed . 
  some 850,000 migrants last year came to greece , a country of 11m . 
  no government could cope with arrivals on this scale using peaceful means . 
  germany , the eu 's richest state , has struggled to manage an influx of a few hundred thousand more . 
   athens can also argue that the eu has done little to help in its hour of need . 
  the commission last year identified 160,000 migrants located in italy and greece who needed resettling across the bloc , but only a handful have been relocated . 
  the commission called for the eu 's external border to be strengthened so as to save schengen but resources invested have been minimal . 
  the eu needs to provide significant financial support to syria 's neighbours -- turkey , jordan and lebanon -- as they cope with millions in refugee camps , but even the $ 3bn the eu has promised for ankara is held up in squabbling over who will pay . 
    it is because europe has lacked unity and political will throughout this crisis that it now has no option but to contemplate crude measures . 
  brussels should be under no illusion over how politically dangerous the sealing of the macedonia-greece border would be . 
  the eu would be helping a non-member state to build a physical frontier in defiance of one of its own . 
  it would heighten the impression that wealthy europeans regard greece , turkey , jordan and lebanon as little more than vast holding pens for migrants . 
  nor will a fence do much to deter desperate people who will find other ways to travel to europe . 
   the refugee crisis is the biggest the eu has faced in its history . 
  the challenge has been exacerbated by europe 's inability to act collectively and decisively . 
  kicking greece out of schengen will make a few eu leaders feel good . 
  it is nowhere near providing the answers that europe needs . 
  pacemakers showed up . 
   vikings have 0 % things in common with nazis iconic outfits ? 
  attacking france ? 
  russia * does * try to exacerbate splits in the eu : you can see * rt * and friends highlighting any form of political discontent in the eu or or disagreement between eu members . 
  that being said , i agree that letting migrants in does n't require any sort of rationale as regards messing with the eu -- russia has no more reason to retain migrants than greece does , and if they pass out of russia , they become someone else 's problem . 
  same thing with turkey . 
  russia 's doing exactly what plenty of other countries are doing -- no need to dig for some sort of plan .
