  europe has a pretty long history of art containing political statements . 
  ancient greece 's plays were not disconnected from politics . 
  not exactly bane 's left-anarchism . 
  i 'm not an expert , but i do n't think that it is hdr . 
  hdr would compress the range such that there are no areas lost in shadow or areas blown out . 
  this has both -- areas lost to shadow on the statue , and areas blown out in lights . 
  i think that it 's just a long exposure , which makes areas at night look brighter than would otherwise be the case . 
  plus , you can see the characteristic `` light trails '' left by cars traveling by that would show up with a long exposure . 
  ankara has a fair amount of air pollution , and i expect that the bright sky is light reflecting off smog . 
  [ here 's an example of hdr ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xmidhg_c65y/usj24pg50zi/aaaaaaaa4ge/cy0vm9qf7na/s1600/hermosos-paisaje-hdr-un-pueblito_imagenes-hdr.jpg ) .

   and as free movement of people is a founding principle of the community , the end of schengen probably means the end of the eu itself . 
  that seems like a bit of a stretch . 
  certainly it would be an * inconvenience * . 
  but california , in the us , [ maintains inspection stations at checkpoints on its borders ] ( https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/plant/pe/exteriorexclusion/borders.html ) to identify plants or animals that might contain pests that would impact agriculture in california , and that does n't seem to have caused the us to disintegrate . 
  here 's an [ example picture of the border protection station at needles , california ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@34.9139519,-116.792272,3a,75y,260.31h,87.65t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1so2vgi4d9kw0xn1hgl3shua!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  now , to be fair , the california borders are lower-population-density and probably substantially-lower-traffic than , say , the border between austria and germany . 
  and the checks are probably more-cursory . 
  but i do n't see anyone seriously proposing that the us is dying as a result of california maintaining border inspection stations . 
  mind , i think that the eu has better options in the long term than just permanently creating traffic jams at the borders , but i do n't see this as a death knell for the eu . 
   after a five-month free-for-all that ended in november , macedonia started to only allow in migrants whom it deems to be bona fide refugees -- syrian , iraqi and afghan nationals . 
  all others are considered economic migrants and left trapped in greece , where they are told to seek asylum , agree to voluntary repatriation or be deported . 
  i dunno about `` trapped in greece '' . 
  i 'm assuming that any migrant who was planning to travel through macedonia is simply going to travel through albania instead . 
   tony blair essentially took the left-wing party he led in a right-wing direction which they can never recover from this is the party that is currently headed by corbyn , right ? 
   i view this article as being a legitimate attempt by the telegraph to stop blair fucking up a movement they support , which is exactly what he is doing . 
  fair-enough -- thanks . 
  hard for me to distinguish between `` ah hah , an opportunity to take a shot at the opposition '' and legitimate recommendations . 
  does the unhcr have an alternative proposal that does n't involve large-scale , uncontrolled immigration to australia that australia would find compelling ? 
  pointing out that it is n't perfect is one thing . 
  proposing something that addresses the same concerns and is preferable is another . 
  i 'd call it the best of the available options that i 've seen . 
  the pacific solution provides an escape hatch for people who are in fear of genocide or the like , but it also disincentivizes misuse of the refugee system for economic immigration . 
  i do n't really see another competitive solution that handles those two issues . 
  if australia wants to permit more immigration and sees asylum as a way to do that , fine , but surely then it would make more sense to adjust its naturalization program intended for non-refugee-status migration , lower the bar or raise the limits on it ?

  he said that he did n't have a problem with any ukranians working , not just refugees . 
   the proposals stop short of creating an independent eu-wide regulator along the lines of the u.s. environmental protection agency , which uncovered volkswagen 's wrongdoing . 
  that was n't my understanding . 
  i thought that it was the european commission that first turned up the problem . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkswagen_emissions_scandal  in 2011 the european commission 's joint research centre published a report which found that all tested diesel vehicles emit 0.93 \u00b1 0.39 g/km , the tested euro 5 diesel vehicles emit 0.62 \u00b1 0.19 g/km . 
  this substantially exceeds the respective euro 3-5 emission limit . 
  [ 42 ] in 2013 the research center then warned :    sensors and electronic components in modern light-duty vehicles are capable of ` detecting ' the start of an emissions test in the laboratory ( e.g. , based on acceleration sensors or not-driven/not-rotating wheels ) . 
  some vehicle functions may only be operational in the laboratory , if a predefined test mode is activated . 
  detecting emissions tests is problematic from the perspective of emissions legislation , because it may enable the use of defeat devices that activate , modulate , delay , or deactivate emissions control systems with the purpose of either enhancing the effectiveness of these systems during emissions testing or reducing the effectiveness of these systems under normal vehicle operation and use . 
  while the use of defeat devices is generally prohibited , exceptions exist in cases where it is necessary to protect the engine against damage and to ensure safe vehicle operation ( ec , 2007 ) . 
  these exceptions leave room for interpretation and provide scope , together with the currently applied test procedure , for tailoring the emissions performance [ ... ] . 
  [ 43 ] whereas the us involvement seems to start in 2014 :  * 2014 international council on clean transportation asks wvu cafee to help demonstrate the benefits of us diesel technology , hoping to have europe follow suit   * may 2014 instead , cafee finds discrepancies showing poor on-road emissions . 
  results presented at public forum and published , getting attention of epa, 
  as i recall , the * telegraph * is politically-opposed to blair ? 
   and we uniquely run a trade deficit with the uk i.e. 
  we import more from them than we export to them . 
  it 's not inherently `` good '' or `` bad '' to run a trade deficit -- money just acts as another good here . 
  if a is a net exporter to b , b a net exporter to c , and c a net exporter to a , neither a 's trade with b nor c is `` better '' for a. 
  you 'd require a whole lot of government tracking of purchasing habits . 
  okay , let 's go over this step-by-step . 
  p_n -- market price now in 2016 eur p_t -- market price then in 1970 eur p_d -- price currently being demanded in 2016 eur , everything else being factored in . 
  / u/droznig -- `` wow , p_d seems high relative to p_n . '', 
  inflation has no impact on his statement . 
  you are correct that p_t is lower than p_n , but it does n't matter , because he 's not bringing up p_n . 
  if we went back , p_t would be lower in nominal terms , sure , but it would also be pretty similar to p_n in real terms . 
   why is russia sowing discontent among russians living in germany ? 
  * among russians living in germany * with germany over greece * with ties to turkey in the eu * with ties to the us in the eu * among other members over migrants * with the uk in the eu * probably with other individual members . 
  rt provides quite a bit of coverage of any sort of political discord or uncontented people in the eu . 
  because placing political pressures on the eu is probably the most-realistic-chance-of-real-success counter russia has available to the eu . 
  russia does n't have enough economic clout to force the eu around . 
  nukes are extremely high-risk and running around making anything more than veiled threats runs extreme risks to russia . 
  conventional military threats tends to make countries hostile to russia and do n't work well against anything but isolated countries . 
  if i were russia , i 'd probably work on the same point . 
  russia 's interests would be in having independent countries that russia has enough clout to dominate ( whether-or-not a ussr-type situation comes up or not ) on her border , not a much-more-powerful political union that tends to provide a compelling alternative to other countries that russia presently has influence over . 
  breaking up the eu would be in russian interests , and that will only become harder over time , given the shift in political views with age . 
  this is probably the right time to expend resources on it . 
  that being said , the political battleground is probably a lot preferable to fight wars than other potential battlegrounds , yes ? 
  there are n't large-scale numbers of people becoming assassinated or the like going on . 
  ships are not being sunk . 
  as conflict goes , this seems like it 's relatively-lightweight . 
  / u/droznig is pointing out that 300k for a volvo is high at today 's price . 
  if so , that eliminates inflation from the equation , unless you 've some reason to believe that volvos have become massively-cheaper in real terms in the interim . 
  you are correct that the number in terms of euros would have risen since then . 
  my point is that instead of expecting a volvo to be , i do n't know , 30k eur , it would have been , say , 10k eur then . 
  if you 're comparing the current eur bill to the current eur price , the fact that the original price would have been lower cuts inflation out of the equation . 
  yup , but just because `` nuclear icbm development '' ranks above `` feed the population '' on nk 's priority list , i still suspect that `` paying for volvos '' is n't going to rise above either one . 
  yes , she was attempting to address the problem of getting greece to cooperate by converting `` greece cooperates '' from a `` greece gets screwed '' issue . 
  the issue was that she also believed that non-involved eu members would be willing to take in redistributed migrants , which they were not , at least in any kind of meaningful numbers . 
   they would not be killed , merely be sent back . 
  the now-deleted post i was responding to was advocating that they be intentionally left to drown . 
  i 'm not arguing that they have a right to stay . 
  personally , i think that it is probably in the eu 's interests * not * to extend citizenship or permanent residency , and quite possibly not even temporary residency outside of a camp . 
  but i 'm not comparing `` take in everyone who wants to come '' to `` kill them at the border '' , but rather deportation to `` kill them at the border '' . 
  i 've seen people advocating either gunning migrants down at the border or letting them drown . 
  i can not see a case in which doing so is preferable to deportation for the eu . 
  that 's not an argument based on touchy-feeliness , just that it buys the eu nothing that i can see to kill people . 
   this sub finally has went full nazi . 
  strictly-speaking , hitler originally wanted to deport the jews via the [ madagascar plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) , not execute them , and it was due to pressures of war blocking that approach that the [ final solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/final_solution ) was taken up . 
  advocating for killing off the migrants on the spot in preference to the viable-if-politically-difficult-but-no-more-difficult-than-killing-people option of deportation would kinda be outdoing hitler in bloodthirstiness . 
  i understand that people are pissed off ( `` this frustrates me , so send in the military !, 
  '' ) , but i 'm just saying , have perspective : i ca n't see a way in which the eu winds up better off in killing people than in deporting them .
