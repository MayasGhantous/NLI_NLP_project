  if that 's the case , there 's really no point in advocating for killing people . 
  that 's true -- there 's a legitimate disincentive . 
  but even greece is still better-off than many of the places in mena , and it 's not clear that it would be sufficient . 
  from greece 's standpoint , there 's a cost ( everyone that * does * get intercepted ) plus massive risk ( the disincentive is n't sufficient to stop migration ) being placed on it , whereas the rest of the eu is unloading their costs and risk on greece . 
  that 's actually not the limitation -- the eu * has * offered more resources in the form of frontex , which greece declined . 
  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/463dc7a0-982b-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html  in spite of months of encouragement from the eu , it has declined to call in frontex 's rapid intervention team , as it did in 2011 to help on its land border with bulgaria . 
  greece showed more openness over invoking this so-called `` rabit '' mechanism during mr asselborn 's visit , according to officials familiar with the talks . 
  that 's because presently , the goal behind frontex coming in is to get migrants registered in * greece * so that other members have somewhere that they can deport them to if they subsequently illegally leave greece , and greece wants responsibility for gobs of migrants about as much as any other eu member does . 
  if frontex could make use of the [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) or had some country other than greece that it could reliably deport migrants to , greece might cooperate . 
  but as long as `` frontex coming in and working to secure greece 's sea border '' is equivalent to `` dump all migrants coming through on greece '' , greece simply has no reason to cooperate . 
  my own view is that the eu probably * should * adopt something like the pacific solution or otherwise ensure that a non-eu deportation target is available , because it 's probably harder to track down large numbers of people illegally hiding out in the eu than it is to intercept them at the border . 
  but at the moment ... it 's not . 
  the same costs that you are worried about with respect to taking on gobs of migrants also apply to greece . 
  would you agree to have france accept responsibility for all the migrants that try entering the eu illegally for the same amount of money ? 
  if not , it 's probably worth seriously asking whether greece would either . 
   greece has `` seriously neglected '' its obligations to control external borders , the european commission has said in a draft report ... it found failures to register , check and fingerprint migrants arriving in november . 
  that 's true . 
  however , i also suspect that another eu member in greece 's position would do the same , since registering migrants would simply dump them on greece , and eu members are running around trying to avoid having to take them on * themselves * ; that 's why they 're trying to * get * greece to do this . 
  if you want greece to have any sort of an interest in doing so , you almost certainly have to provide greece with an option for processing people * other * than `` let 's dump everyone in greece '' . 
  the eu tried redistribution , and it suffered from the expected failure -- uninvolved countries have no interest in this . 
  you want greek registration , you 've got to be able to credibly tell greece that registering migrants is n't going to just create a massive migrant problem for greece . 
  either some other eu member makes a * credible * guarantee that they will take responsibility within some specified period of time ( whether for permanent or temporary residence ) , the pacific solution is used , migrants are deported to the country that they are believed to have left from or migrants are deported to the country that they originate from . 
  you do n't do that , you 're just whacking greece with a stick for not stabbing itself in the face . 
  it 's not going to work . 
  and , frankly , there 's no * point * to whacking greece over it , because it is n't going to accomplish anything . 
  it just stirs up ill will between members . 
  maybe it covers some politician 's ass ( `` it 's greece 's fault , not my policy ! '' ), 
  but it is n't going to solve anything from an eu-wide standpoint . 
  i have a hard time seeing a scenario where killing is preferable to deportation . 
  yes , right now migrants are not being deported home because they 'd be at risk of their lives -- but letting people drown obviously poses a rather-larger threat to life . 
  and there is n't political will to ship people back home ... but surely , you 'd agree that the bar to kill someone must be far higher ? 
  no , i ca n't see much sense to scenarios involving having the military letting people drown , and i 've seen a number of people suggest this . 
  i think that that is frustration and anger talking : i ca n't see a real case for it being preferable to deportation . 
  nah , i understand that they get shipped home on request . 
  just ca n't come to australia . 
  well , if the labor * itself * were profitable , sure . 
  but i think that / u/2 -4601 is describing the window where ( 1 ) the value produced by unskilled labor in the hotelling country is somewhere above the cost of wages without hotelling costs but below the cost of wages plus hotelling and ( 2 ) the wages are high enough to encourage illegal immigration to australia to abuse the system . 
  in that scenario , it would be in the interest of immigrants to keep coming to australia * intending * to be deported and have australia subsidize their labor . 
  that 's a legitimate hypothetical case -- however , it 's also one that has n't actually arisen in australia 's implementation today . 
   it 's not your job to interpret that . 
  he 's not claiming to be doing so in an official , binding capacity . 
  he 's saying that this looks wrong to him and raising it as an issue . 
  and that * is * the point of having a written code of laws -- so that they can not be arbitrarily-applied by the government . 
   * give me your tired , your poor , *   * your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , *   * the wretched refuse of your teeming shore , *   * send these the tempest-tost to me , * this is an allusion to the plaque on the statue of liberty . 
  while i think that a lot of people view it as some sort of ethos associated with the us since time immemorable ( and the author is presumably here using it to present denmark in an inhospitable light in comparison ) , that 's not exactly the case . 
  that poem was intended by the poet to be a criticism of contemporary us immigration policy : it was written the year after the [ immigration act of 1882 was passed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_act_of_1882 ) , which imposed the first ban on immigration of people likely to `` become public charges '' . 
  the us had just started the beginning of more-or-less banning people who would do the then-equivalent of promptly `` going on welfare '' . 
  that is a policy that continues today : us immigration policy has many elements expecting people to have the financial ability to provide for themselves . 
   there are unconfirmed suspicions that the zika virus might be responsible for some cases of congenitial malformation . 
  this is considered credible enough that [ el salvador has asked women to hold off on pregnancies for two years ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/as-zika-virus-spreads-el-salvador-asks-women-not-to-get-pregnant-until-2018/2016/01/22/1dc2dadc-c11f-11e5-98c8-7fab78677d51_story.html ) and the us advised its pregnant women not to visit the country . 
  that 's pretty significant . 
   we 'll see , but the eu cant expect ireland to adopt a border in ni again . 
  it * can * , as long as ireland values eu membership more-highly than the lack of a border . 
  it may or may not be in eu interests to have such an expectation , but ... 
   this is not how it works . 
  the way it works is that if the citizen has two nationalities , french and another one , the french one can be stripped . 
  that occurs in the scenario i described . 
  it would leave them with one citizenship , so they would n't be stateless . 
  north korea could n't even afford to feed its citizens and had [ famine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_korean_famine ) as recently as 2000 . 
  the [ entire country 's gdp today ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_north_korea ) is just $ 11b - $ 15b . 
  you 're talking about 2-3 % of the gdp . 
  three hundred million euros is probably not something that north korea would turn over casually . 
  i suspect that volvo real prices in the 1970s were comparable to real prices today , which means that the initial price would also have been roughly-lower wrt inflation . 
  i 'd be inclined to blame interest payments . 
  it 's a fair question . 
  i do n't see polls on the subject in a quick google search . 
   taubira 's ultimate showdown with hollande and his prime minister , manuel valls , was over the president 's controversial plans to strip convicted french-born terrorists of their citizenship if they have a second dual nationality . 
  the measure -- known as the `` loss of nationality '' plan -- was to be written into the constitution next month . 
  < raises eyebrows  depending upon how that 's worded , seems exploitable . 
  a country anywhere in the world can confer citizenship upon a potential citizen whenever it wants . 
  `` sir , < terrorist  is possibly planning on conducting an attack on our glorious france ! '', 
  `` very well . 
  activate the yemen contingency . '', 
  `` yemen , we need you to grant citizenship to < terrorist  . 
  here 's the usual payment . '', 
  < terrorist  commits act . 
  `` due to recent emergency legislation , we 're stripping him of his french citizenship and sending him to yemen . '', 
  `` here you go , yemen . 
  france has no responsibility for this guy any more , so feel free to execute him . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution edit : i did n't write up a description because the term has been used a number of times by different people on this subreddit in previous months in discussion over the crisis , i 've already done the explanation several times over , and it 's been mentioned in major news sources . 
  did you intend to post this to / r/europe ? 
  i 'm sure some bostonians read it , but ... 
   also , you apparently need no qualifications . 
  [ according to wikipedia , she was minister of labour and social affairs before that , and minister of senior citizens , women , and youth before that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ursula_von_der_leyen ) . 
  she 's run ministerial positions before . 
  the rifle probably also can not make a sandwich for you . 
  i do n't think that that breaks its basic functionality too badly . 
   the ombudsman also said that the refugee crisis should not become a `` permanent mission '' for the army . 
  agreed . 
   minister of defense ursula von der leyen intends to invest some 130 billion euros ( $ 141 billion ) in army infrastructure and equipment over the next 15 years , according to the news agencies . 
  it 's not clear from the article -- is this an increase over the current annual budget ? 
  if so , is it in real or nominal terms ? 
  i am not familiar with peter sutherland . 
  which of his positions do you object to ? 
  his views on immigration , specifically ? 
  [ wikipedia has ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_sutherland ) :  sutherland strongly advocates liberal immigration policies and mass immigration into the european union . 
  sutherland gave his opinion to the uk 's lords home affairs committee on 21 june 2012 as being ( a ) that `` at the most basic level individuals should have freedom of choice '' about working and studying in other countries and that eu states should stop targeting `` highly skilled '' migrants ( and , conversely , placing restrictions on low-skilled migrants ) . 
  sutherland also argues ( b ) that migration is a `` crucial dynamic for economic growth '' and that this is the case `` however difficult it may be to explain this to the citizens of those states '' . 
  sutherland 's stated opinions on policy were ( a ) that `` it was fundamentally important for states to cooperate on migration policy rather than developing their own policies in isolation as ` no state is or can be an island ' '' [ 39 ] ( b ) that multiculturalism is both inevitable and desirable : `` it 's impossible to consider that the degree of homogeneity which is implied by the other argument can survive because states have to become more open states , in terms of the people who inhabit them '' and also ( c ) that `` the european union , in my view , should be doing its best to undermine '' any `` sense of our homogeneity and difference from others '' . 
  an ageing or declining native population in countries like germany or southern eu states was the `` key argument and , i hesitate to the use word because people have attacked it , for the development of multicultural states '' , he added .
