   the eu average `` fertility rate '' is about 1.6 per childbearing woman , but it needs to be 2 just to maintain current population levels . 
  ~ 2.1 in developed countries . 
  there 's also a mortality rate . 
  nice !, 
   you know , eu and nato never forced anyone to join them as opposed to russia/cccp . 
  more-importantly -- because there could always be one unpopular leader who did something objectionable , or a period of time when people labored under some misconception -- both the eu and nato have always defined a process for leaving . 
  nato takes a year ( dunno what the eu process is ) . 
  to date , no country has ever chosen to leave nato ( though france was n't actively doing a lot with nato for a while ) or the eu . 
  zerohedge is imho a fairly-poor source of information -- it has a bad habit of making misleading , wildly-over-the-top claims . 
  if you think that my concern is disconnected from merit , i assure you , i 'm very enthusiastic about merit-driven immigration . 
  if someone is a notable researcher from africa , hell , bring him in and try to do so before anyone else gets ahold of him . 
  but we both know that that 's not what the demographics look like here . 
  [ 37.8 % of somalia 's population is even * literate * ] ( https://www.care2.com/causes/10-countries-with-the-worst-literacy-rates-in-the-world.html ) -- and that 's not in english , french , german , or what-have-you . 
  these are mostly people who have passed school age , which means both that any attempts at further education provide a lower return and that it 's harder to teach things -- adult education has never met with the kind of success that childhood education has returned . 
  they lack familiarity with many customs and basic social norms , things that are n't part of a formal education , but which are part of getting along in a society . 
  on top of this , unless you plan to reweave european society to be less-secular and more-religious ( which is n't fundamentally-unworkable , mind , but i think many people would object to ) , you 're facing trying to alter fundamental teachings about the way the world and universe works . 
  in any event -- it 's countries like france that we are talking about . 
  if you think that pulling 1.6 m + people without a skill filter out of africa and the middle east per year into europe is desirable , well , it 's ultimately your country at stake , not mine . 
  but i think that this is inadvisable from the standpoint of france 's well-being , and i would n't advocate for my own country to do the same . 
   but i ca n't stand this pretentious reductive notion that puts them all at fault and beneath our contempt . 
  it has nothing to do with fault -- fault 's irrelevant here . 
  it deals simply with what the impact on bringing people in would be . 
  from the standpoint of greece and italy , that 's similar to `` register them in the country that they have landed in and leave them there '' , just without requiring registration . 
  i assume that the following would happen : * you 'd wind up with people breaking through ( non-eu ) borders heading northward . 
  * if somehow you could afford to build and man a wall along greece 's northern border capable of blocking humans ( not cheap or easy and greece again has a good reason to not want to cooperate , since that wall is just screwing it over ) , then i assume you wind up with a calais-type situation at the border . 
  * if people eventually give up on going north and do n't manage sea crossings or similar and register , greece is * still * preferable to somalia or eritrea . 
  * if greece does n't provide employment or any benefits , you probably wind up with an increasingly-desperate number of criminals trying to get by . 
  i really do n't think that `` stuff everyone in greece '' is a solution that can be made viable , simply because it 's so overwhelmingly against greece 's interests to cooperate and because it would be so hard to do it without greece cooperating . 
  furthermore , i think that it sets a bad precedent for the eu to throw member countries under the bus . 
  i 'd say that depends on whether your definition of `` institutions '' includes skillset and culture . 
  if so , those are correlated : bring in the population of the third world , and you bring in those institutions . 
  if not , then i 'd disagree with you -- i 'd say that the shape of society is dramatically-dependent upon those two factors , which you would n't consider institutions . 
  the [ refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) is n't an eu agreement , though , suffers from the same flaw , and the overwhelming bulk of the countries in the world are signed up for it . 
   they can work in construction kind of a catch-22 problem : not a lot of demand for construction . 
  factories , maybe . 
  i 've actually suggested setting up [ sezs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_economic_zone ) outside the eu to * intentionally * do this as well , to create alternate economic opportunities , but i do n't think that they 're likely to grow fast-enough to have a major short-term impact . 
  yes , this is what i was trying to get across . 
  similar to hungary 's `` you can lift them up with a stick and slide under '' razor-wire fences working because croatia is next door and people can simply be redirected through there . 
  i wonder if the uk is pressuring the redistribution system not to send people to ireland ? 
  i assume that it 's pretty easy to get anywhere in the uk from ireland . 
   so , basically , rent out another country to contain the refugees for us ? 
  more-or-less . 
   is n't that open to abuse by a country wanting cheap labour ? 
  well , it 's a market , so various countries do compete , and you can take the low bidder -- that protects australia , though i guess if all poor island nations around the world colluded , they could establish a cartel and raise the global price of hoteling slots . 
  cross that bridge when we come to it . 
  :-) given sufficiently-large numbers , that is a fair concern , i suppose -- it could break the economic disincentive that is important if suddenly niue winds up with a booming industry based on low-cost labor subsidized by australia , enough to make it worthwhile to pay migrants enough to illegally immigrate to australia with the * hopes * of being deported to niue . 
  thus far , though , these countries do n't seem to have suffered from huge economic booms and the disincentive appears to hold . 
  i suspect that eastern europe is also probably still too wealthy to be particularly discouraging -- you can still make much more money in poland than you can in eritrea or somalia . 
  might not be as wealthy as germany , but poland is no camp in niue . 
  use a new outbreak of the [ spanish flu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic ) if you prefer . 
  something that would be widely-agreed upon as being catastrophic and requiring an immediate response . 
  in the long run , yes , it would be expected that removing the economic pull factors would dominate , but in the short run , you still have to find slots for a very large number of people . 
  australia hit a peak of about 14k migrants that they had housed in other countries before the numbers started declining due to people giving up and being willing to be returned to their country of origin . 
  yeah , the eu has more resources to work with , but the migrant crisis already involves something like a hundred times that and 2016 is expected to be worse . 
   those countries have different interests , which causes the slowness . 
  it will stay being slow until every country gets on the same page ( currently not happening ) . 
  yup , which is why a proposal needs to be mutually-advantageous to the members involved . 
  personally , i kinda favor something involving a pacific solution-type approach , along with creating an alternative ( helping to develop at * least * one non-eu country in africa , maybe via special economic zones , to provide alternate employment opportunities ) . 
  addressing the issue outside of the scope of the eu does n't help from the standpoint of the collection as a whole , since if individual countries could address the issue themselves , they would have done so already by themselves . 
   i 'm not sure what other war you are talking about ... 
  if , tomorrow , russia attacked poland , would the eu members collectively sit around proposing the creation of a committee to investigate the matter and start multi-year-political campaigns ? 
  of course it would n't be paralyzed , because it would know that this is important . 
  right now , the migrant crisis has n't hit that level of importance . 
  it 's not consensus issue for support in a not-important-to-them issue that i described , but consensus vote on a not-as-important-to-them issue for a majority vote on something that * is * important to them , like redistribution of migrants . 
  and i 'm sure that they would n't do it unless they 'd lined up just enough votes to make the majority vote flip . 
  that being said , i think that we all can agree that both eu and international rules are probably badly-crafted on that point , and do not reflect reality . 
  there * is * a practical cap , even if countries hope that real-world applications do n't come near it . 
  if massive china had a civil war , and half of china 's population applied for asylum in ireland , there would simply be no way that ireland could let them in ( or , well , ireland could , but it would then immediately collapse ) . 
  the numbers are just too large . 
  yes , ireland has signed treaties that say it * must * , but in practice , it 's not going to happen . 
  that does n't mean that the present crisis is at or near that level , mind . 
  [ wikipedia 's list of country gdp per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) : you think of poland as poor only because germany , which is wealthier , is right next door . 
  but people are coming from much , much poorer countries . 
  you 're bringing in somalians and eritreans , among others : | country | per-capita gdp in dollars , 2014 | | - | - | | germany | 47,966 | | poland | 14,111 | | eritrea | 755 | | somalia | 131 | think of how many people from poland have gone to work in other places in europe , how many years of labor in poland equate to one year of labor in germany , and now imagine the strength of that draw being multiplied many times over . 
  plus , nobody in poland is * starving * . 
  you 're talking about maybe some luxuries being foregone ; things that are nice to have , but not something that anyone * needs * . 
  https://www.wfp.org/stories/10-facts-about-hunger-somalia starvation is an actual real concern in somalia : the population exceeds what the current national economy can support , and it 's only really food aid that keeps some people alive ... and just keeping yourself from starving still leaves a lot to be desired . 
  yes , today migrants are going to germany , because the return is bigger . 
  and , true , for some portion of the migrants going to germany , poland would n't be worth it -- there 'd be some migrants who were really on the fence about going and * just * barely decided to go . 
  but `` less '' does n't mean `` none '' . 
   the eu can not do anything in four months . 
  it is institutionally incapable of acting quickly and to instead amend , extend and pretend . 
  the eu is a collection of european countries which i am confident * can * act quickly if they actually feel that their bacon is in the fire . 
  if war broke out , would it take a couple years of arguing to respond , or would governments * immediately * start taking action , however-imperfect it might be ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution it 's what australia 's been doing with its own ( much smaller ) migrant crisis , which in many ways parallels that of europe . 
  basically , people from nearby ( poor ) countries kept illegally boating into australia and claiming asylum . 
  under the [ refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) , australia can not keep them in concentration camps and prevent them from working -- it must provide freedom of movement and freedom to work and equal welfare . 
  this also creates a huge economic pull : if you can manage to swing a successful asylum application , you suddenly become a whole lot wealthier . 
  australia 's government said `` okay , but without withdrawing from the refugee convention , we * can * send asylum-seekers , willing or not , to a safe country that will accept them '' . 
  now , countries wo n't just accept a lot of poor , unskilled people from third world countries without some sort of incentive , but australia agrees to pay small island countries like papua new guinea or niue to house them . 
  that * sounds * like it could become an unbounded expense if many people actually wanted asylum to protect their lives , but in fact , most asylum-seekers * were n't * honestly seeking asylum , but better economic opportunities , simply using the asylum system to provide a legal gateway into the country . 
  in australia , once the pacific solution was put in place , arrivals dramatically fell off , since there are n't any high-paying jobs or benefits available in the camps in png or niue , killing the economic pull factor . 
  existing housed asylum-seekers began to agree to be returned home , and numbers inbound to australia collapsed . 
  this met with some political resistance from people who are unhappy facing up to the fact that their country has laws in place protecting the standard-of-living of existing residents at the cost of the standard-of-living of people of people in poorer places in the world . 
  tears away some pleasant illusions . 
  on the other hand , it * has * been effective . 
   eu did n't give eastern europe billions of dollars in aid just to have access to their markets . 
  they did so with the goal of creating a larger and more-powerful union in the long run . 
  this would be mutually-advantageous . 
  good deal for both , in my opinion , though more-so for poland .
