  that did n't entail later letting one member offload undesirables on another member , however , and if it had been proposed ( '' ... in the future , we want the ability to place people that we do n't want in your country without bound ... '' ) , i 'm not sure that poland would have signed on . 
  in a welfare state , where immigration is a wealth transfer , control of immigration is important . 
  in a democracy , where long-term residents may be able to get citizenship and citizenship is a grant of political power , control of immigration is important . 
  now , granted , it 's not fair to simply treat this as `` germany unloads undesirable migrants on poland '' : germany * is * trying to find a solution that also resolves things for greece and italy . 
  and at least at some point , if the eu federalizes , naturalization will probably need to become unified . 
  but that also has n't happened yet , and more-to-the-point , i 'd be worried that redistribution to poland would ( 1 ) not be effective in discouraging more migration , ( 2 ) might be unbounded , with more redistribution on the way , ( 3 ) if migrants refuse to remain in place , poland is going to continually get flak from germany for poor policing , and ( 4 ) any taking of responsibility is going to be levered by migrants via lawyers as far as possible towards permanent residency and citizenship . 
  basically , accepting migrants looks like it has a whole lot of downsides , some of which are pretty severe , and few upsides for poland . 
  i 'm not following . 
  / u/perkel666 is proposing that a country in the eu could swap votes on an issue that they do n't care as much about ( and potentially a vote on an issue with a consensus requirement ) for votes from other countries here . 
  that seems very , very likely to me , and very difficult to prevent . 
  i would assume that it 's a normal part of eu negotiations . 
   this is merkel 's mess , not europe 's and definetly not poland 's . 
  i disagree -- i think that this is an issue for europe . 
  ** europe as a whole is still a destination ** germany is one of the most-desirable destinations , but europe is still much a vastly-better place to live and work than eritrea or somalia . 
  if germany addressed the issue on a germany-only level ( e.g. 
  frequent checks of identity papers , severe punishment for employing people present illegally , pacific solution ) , it would mean that migrants would head for france or the netherlands ; not * quite * as good , maybe , but still much better than the country of origin . 
  ** the current eu citizenship can be granted by any country unilaterally , but provides right-to-live-and-work in any eu member ** right now , the eu has negotiated eu citizenship rights , where citizens can live and work in other eu members . 
  however , eu members can not block another member granting citizenship to arbitrary groups of people -- naturalization policy has not been unified across the eu . 
  this means that , for example , malta could sell legal work rights to berlin and london . 
  ** for federalists , merged citizenship ** if you want to see a federal european union -- and , mind , not everyone does -- then anyone who winds up with citizenship in another eu member is going to wind up with citizenship in your country if the eu federalizes . 
  ** eu funds are something of a shared resource ** it may not * formally * come from the same pool , but if germany and sweden have to dump lots of funds onto taking care of unskilled migrants , they obviously can not do as much for places like poland . 
  ** the labor market involves competition ** while citizens of europe probably have a much-better education on average ... particularly for anyone doing unskilled work , if someone in poland or greece wants to work in berlin or stockholm , they are competing with mena migrants working in the same market ( whether legally or illegally ) . 
  i 've heard people complaining about competition depressing wages , and those people will also be impacted . 
   we are only waiting for politicians to catch the wind finally . 
  i do n't claim any knowledge of what 's going on in eu politics , but i assume that politicians in the eu know how to politick with their electorates . 
  there have been a lot of claims floating around about politicians being blind or unwilling to do anything ... maybe . 
  australia developed and implemented the pacific solution in four months . 
  it 's not as if the eu does n't have diplomats who could manage the same degree of effectiveness . 
  one possibility is that it would be not-politically-viable to actually take such a move until public discontent with migration hits a certain level and the public very strongly wants to adopt such a position , at which point it becomes politically-safe . 
  and that bar may be surprisingly-high : as i 've pointed out , the us has shown no interest in taking in a substantial chunk of the people involved , but has a number of publications that like publishing articles with moral condemnations of europe , since it lets them take the moral high ground at no actual cost . 
  it may be that some countries in the eu are unwilling to take migrants in themselves but will still have activists seize upon the action as a political weakness to portray a politician as cold or heartless and someone who should be replaced by * their * favored politician . 
   i have no idea how any sane person can think schengen zone could ever work when it is unable to protect its border . 
  the schengen zone is n't unable to protect its border . 
  it 's unwilling . 
  it 's viable to intercept people at the waterline , but then it has to * do * something with the people intercepted . 
  right now the options that i see are : * ** return them to the country of origin ** ( if it can be identified ) . 
  depending upon the country , doing so may violate treaties , and in some countries , may pose an actual threat to the lives of people involved . 
  while withdrawal is an option to avoid treaty violation , that or simply violating the treaty may introduce other problems ( e.g. 
  enabling future genocides ) . 
  * ** return them to the country they were passing through ** ( tunesia , turkey , russia , etc ) . 
  those countries do n't particularly want them * either * , probably are n't going to accept them , have a worse problem than the schengen zone does , with fewer resources . 
  additionally , if it 's cheap enough to do so , people may keep trying . 
  * ** register them in the country that they have landed in and leave them there ** . 
  that country ( italy , greece ) does n't want that at all , as it 's much worse for it than the * status quo * , so it 's not going to cooperate . 
  you * might * be able to make this work if the eu guarantees ( a ) to cover the full cost * and * ( b ) places a guaranteed time limit , where if a migrant has not exited the country another country will take responsibility for them ( this would buy some time to set up a pacific solution approach or a war to end ) but not as things stand . 
  realistically , there 's also the issue that migrants probably do n't want to stay in greece or southern italy , so you 're probably looking at concentration camps or imposing some * serious * penalties for leaving . 
  * ** redistribute them within the eu ** . 
  uninvolved countries do n't want this , so i do n't see how you 'd sell them on it ( as is the case with poland here ) and migrants probably wo n't cooperate , so again ... concentration camps or imposing * serious * penalties for leaving . 
  * ** pacific solution ** . 
  i think that this is one of the more-viable options , as it provides all of the factors that one wants ( barring , perhaps , the desire to increase the wealth of the people involved , and the fact that it is not free ) : it keeps people truly fleeing for their life safe in the short term , eliminates the economic pull factor , and does n't violate the refugee convention . 
  there would be a question of scale -- the crisis is growing and a pacific solution becomes more-expensive the larger the numbers involved . 
  this also has the merit of having been tested in the real world and having been shown to actually work . 
  it 's not a matter of manpower . 
  iirc , the eu has already offered to send people , [ which greece has declined ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/463dc7a0-982b-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html ) . 
   in spite of months of encouragement from the eu , it has declined to call in frontex 's rapid intervention team , as it did in 2011 to help on its land border with bulgaria . 
  the problem is that if someone is caught , they get registered in greece , which greece obviously does n't want any more than the other eu members . 
  the outcome of catching someone has to be something other than `` dump them on greece '' or greece simply is n't going to cooperate , for the same reason that germany objects to having people simply flood through europe to berlin and that the uk objects to having migrants redistributed to the uk . 
  whatever plan is proposed , it has to be mutually-advantageous to all the parties who need to cooperate to make it work . 
   that 's not a good way to look at things , statistically . 
  sure it is : i 'm trying to measure the impact that the crisis would have had on demand for police , not rank sweden as a country . 
  the metric you 're suggesting would factor in people around the country . 
  if sweden had a population that had nothing to do with any of this up north with 300m people that did n't make use of the services of a single police officer , they 'd dominate the statistics , though they would n't be relevant to the crisis . 
  yes , i 'm talking about the requirement for an increase , not the overall result , as the officers are presumably being requested to deal with the present situation . 
  sounds like the arrangement [ might involve buying part of saab ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tai_tfx ) :  during a state visit of turkish president abdullah g\u00fcl to sweden on march 13 , 2013 , turkish aerospace industries ( tai ) signed an agreement with sweden 's saab ab , which stipulates : [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]   * saab ab will provide technological design assistance for turkey 's tfx program . 
    * tai has the option to purchase saab ab 's fighter jet design unit . 
  [ citation needed ]   on 8 january 2015 turkish prime minister ahmet davuto\u011flu announced that the tfx program will be an entirely indigenous platform with no international support shelving any cooperation with korea , sweden , brazil or indonesia .

  this is a dutch law , not an eu law . 
   sweden 's national police commissioner , dan eliasson , has requested 4,100 additional officers and support staff to help fight against terrorism , carry out migrant deportations and police asylum facilities , swedish news agency tt reports . 
  [ snip ]  sweden accepted more than 150,000 asylum applications last year and , along with germany , is a prime destination for refugees and other migrants entering the eu illegally . 
  i guess that asylum seekers might commit crimes at a higher rate , but that seems like a lot of officers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_number_of_police_officers sweden currently has 208 police officers for each 100k people , or 2.08 officers per 1k people . 
  if 4100 officers are required for 160,000 migrants , that 's 25.6 officers per 1k migrants , or over ten times as many officers per migrant as per swede . 
  no country in the world except for vatican city maintains a ratio that high . 
  monaco is the next-highest , at 13.7 officers per 1k citizens . 
   the west ( and japan for that matter ) is going through a transformation , where people live longer and differently , population is no longer growing ... 
  living longer does n't neutralize sub-replacement fertility levels . 
   you mentioning australia reminded me of this article i read back in 2011 about a young guy making $ 200,000 a year working in a mine in australia . 
  that was due to the chinese economic boom demanding resources . 
  not only was that mitigated as companies figured out how to lug labor in , but the chinese economy is slowing .

  if it were n't this , it 'd be the next episode of war or hunger in africa . 
  at some point , the eu is going to have to either accept a high rate of immigration or be willing to adopt some policy that blocks that immigration . 
   the solution is first of all to disillusion people from africa and middle east about life in europe . 
  we need to come out with a campaign saying that nobody gets free house , free car and free women . 
  [ digging up some quick figures ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=67 ) : gdp per capita in germany is $ 39,500 . 
  gdp per capita in somalia , one of the countries sending people , is $ 600 . 
  that 's a 65-fold increase . 
  granted , it 's not disposable median household income ( somalia does n't have that data , probably because it ca n't afford to gather it ) , but the point is that that puts an upper cap on what income could be . 
  yeah , the skill difference will probably put someone at the low end of society , but even there , your income is more than $ 600/year , particularly if you count in benefits . 
  people do n't need illusions to want to come to europe . 
   greece was the main gateway to europe for more than a million refugees and migrants who reached the eu last year . 
  it has been criticised for a failure to control the flow of arrivals , which has shown little sign of easing over the winter . 
  give greece a preferable alternative to having to be responsible for the people it catches , and it will catch people . 
   ... i do n't see european societies ready to cope with a truly pluralist poltical culture anytime soon . 
  parliamentary systems and proportional representation are generally more-friendly to more parties . 
  the us electoral system results in two centrist ( for some metric of centrist ) parties . 
  china is one-party .
