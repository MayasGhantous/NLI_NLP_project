   ... greatly improve our tourism appeal . 
  [ you never know ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slum_tourism ) ...  ghetto tourism focuses on slums known as ghettoes , especially in developed countries . 
  ghetto tourism was first studied in 2005 by michael stephens [ disambiguation needed ] in the cultural-criticism journal , popmatters . 
  ghetto tourism includes all forms of entertainment -- gangsta rap , video games , movies , tv , and other forms that allow consumers to traffic in the inner city without leaving home . 
  [ 14 ] [ 15 ] as stevens says , `` digital media achieves more detailed simulations of reality . 
  the quest for thrills mutates into a desire , not just to see bigger and better explosions , but to cross class and racial boundaries and experience other lifestyles . '', 
  international tourists to new york city in the 1980s led to a successful tourism boom in harlem . 
  by 2002 , philadelphia began offering tours of blighted inner-city neighborhoods . 
  after hurricane katrina , tours were offered in flood-ravaged lower ninth ward , a notoriously violent and poor section of new orleans . 
  [ 14 ] ghetto or `` urban tourism '' often encompasses travel to destinations made famous by direct or indirect mention by popular artists . 
  travel to certain parts of detroit that include 8 mile road , known for the role the travel route played in the similarly titled 8 mile film starring eminem , or to crenshaw boulevard in south central los angeles , a metropolitan area that inspired an entire generation of pioneering musical influence , could potentially be included as urban tourism . 
  the jane-finch area of toronto , canada is gaining notoriety as another area in transition . 
  where there 's someone with an entrepreneurial spirit , there 's a way . 
   i 'm all for helping out our former colonies/protectorates with aid and trade gib money ? 
  we do n't know where it or related filoviruses live , though . 
  theories , yes . 
  it 's not a smallpox , where we believe that we 've exterminated it . 
  the * current * outbreak just ended . 
   one thing is for sure , though -- history is n't quite done with europe yet . 
  i 'm glad that the author cleared * that * up . 
  partly , but the english channel is no wider than the mediterranean between tunesia and sicily , and italy still gets a lot of people . 
  i think that a bigger factor is simply that france is actively-attempting to not let people through -- that is , the uk owes her position to a friendly and cooperative france -- plus italy and greece can not deport people that they intercept . 
  north korea took almost all of south korea , too . 
  they just did n't get to keep it . 
  we * could * do that anyway . 
  shame , i suppose . 
  maybe loss of credibility on future signed treaties . 
  i think that single-issue voting is pretty normal in a democracy if one issue becomes particularly prominent in needing addressing .

  if russia is no longer a safe country , norway is going to have to stop rejecting refugees if it is to conform to the refugee convention . 
  ah , sorry , thanks !, 
  i understand that some languages do n't distinguish between them , but : [ ** block ** ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/block ) : * a substantial , often approximately cuboid , piece of any substance . 
  [ ** bloc ** ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bloc ) : * a group of voters or politicians who share common goals * a group of countries acting together for political or economic goals , an alliance : e.g. , the eastern bloc , the western bloc , a trading bloc, 
  wait , why would the brits be punishing them ? 
  would n't it be the french , if the laws being broken were french laws on french soil ? 
   it would be a great idea if we had a similar standard of living in all countries . 
  if you open borders , i imagine that you * would * wind up with a similar standard of living in all countries : if large chunks of the undeveloped world 's population are plonked into europe , you 'd effectively turn europe into the undeveloped world . 
   french and british taxpayers are to pick up the bill for building the `` security tunnel '' over the tracks , expected to cost tens of millions of pounds . 
  honestly , even though the french would own it , it should probably be the brits paying for it , as they 're the ones who primarily benefit . 
  i doubt that the french are really-enthusiastic about building structures to keep migrants in france . 
  eh , that looked like a handful of people pushing people . 
  not all that big a deal . 
  i understand that there are sanctions associated with each . 
  i 'm assuming that all of them will not be lifted unless there is a withdrawal from both .

  invading countries in europe has historically been a signal characteristic of european countries . 
  yes , but that 's not incompatible with being european .

   `` the citizens of the bosnia-herzegovina federation have a good life . 
  what 's more , they have money to waste , '' mr novalic said , citing figures on what people bought at bosnia 's main supermarket chain , bingo . 
  `` the best-selling item was coffee , then cigarettes , the fourth was beer , the eighth wine , '' he said . 
  `` of the first 10 items on the list , only three are essential . '', 
  it might be more interesting to compare spending categorized a bit differently . 
  for example , let 's say that i purchase $ 5 of coffee , $ 3 of cauliflower , $ 2 of carrots , $ 2 of corn , $ 4 of potatoes , and $ 1 of garlic . 
  the top item there is going to be coffee , yes -- but because my drink luxury was placed in a single category and my food spending in a variety of categories , not because i spent more on coffee than food . 
   russia has around $ 360 billion in foreign currency reserves and some $ 120 billion in two rainy day funds , down from just under $ 160 billion a year ago . 
  at current spending rates , however , the two funds are expected to last only 18 months . 
  it might also sell significant stakes in state-run companies like the oil giant rosneft or sberbank , and it will not increase military spending . 
  https://theweek.com/articles/596822/russias-military-dont-believe-hype  in 2010 , the russian government announced an ambitious program to replace 70 percent of cold war-era equipment with new weapons by 2020 . 
  the spending program would cost at least $ 700 billion and included a new generation of tanks , a new class of aircraft carriers , and new generation of heavy bombers . 
    international sanctions , brought on by russia 's annexation of the crimea as well as plunging oil prices have quickly taken a heavy toll on the economy . 
  the russian economy has slipped into recession , with gdp alone slipping 4 percent in the past 12 months . 
    a falling economy has affected military spending . 
  in 2015 , russia 's defense budget increased by a staggering 33 percent . 
  however , before the year was over some of that spending had to be taken back , and the increase was revised downward to 25 percent . 
  unable to forecast an end to russia 's economic problems , the defense budget is slated to go up less than 1 percent in 2016 . 
    needless to say , russia 's ambition to spend $ 700 billion on armaments is as dead as julius caesar . 
  beats shooting at each other as a way to neutralize military hardware increases . 
   there are no easy answers , only a few predictions : jihadism will not be defeated in 2016 , and war and misery in the middle east and africa will send ever more people across the mediterranean -- around 2,000 still arrive in europe by sea every day . 
  in the longer run , hunger -- though it may drive and manifest itself in the form of war -- will be a bigger issue , and [ that is a larger issue in sub-saharan africa ] ( http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/ ) , not in north africa or the middle east . 
  open discussion and debate and all that is a good thing . 
  yup . 
   are n't you tired of seeing every space exploration movie/book ever taking nasa to mars ? 
   would n't it be awesome to see esa there instead , leaving the world shocked and in awe as the first human on mars planted the eu flag on its red surface ? 
  if the eu wanted the esa to do so , it could . 
  i do n't dispute the merits of robotic exploration over manned -- i certainly tend to favor the former -- but you 're also perhaps not evaluating this with the right metric . 
  what if you treated this as a political effort rather than a purely-scientific one ? 
  some sort of major achievement that required common effort and was a source of public pride ? 
  the space race did have substantial political impact , after all . 
  that 's not to say that highways and sewage processing facilities are n't * important * , but they are perhaps harder to hold up as a source of common pride . 
  maybe that 's a flaw in human psychology , but it is what it is . 
  that 's not to say that collaborations are n't * efficient * , but it 's nice to be able to point to a few trophies one has done oneself . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_megaprojects megaprojects are an area that the european union enables , because of scale . 
  [ gaia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaia_%28spacecraft%29 ) , the [ herschel space observatory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herschel_space_observatory ) , the [ large hadron collider ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/large_hadron_collider ) , and [ galileo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galileo_%28satellite_navigation%29 ) are all neat megaprojects , but they make for less-memorable footage ( not that herschel does n't make for pretty pictures of other things , mind , but you ca n't wedge an eu flag in there somewhere ) . 
  apollo is n't even terribly-recent , but politically , i believe that it casts a longer shadow than many more-recent ( and perhaps more-useful ) megaprojects . 
  < four thousand years later , after falls and rises of civilizations , future archeologists are examining the surface of mars  `` why would the ancients have done such a thing ? '',
