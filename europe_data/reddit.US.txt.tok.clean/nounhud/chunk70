  and that was an era that took a dimmer view of physical disabilities . 
   you just want only the benefits and none of the other stuff . 
  the uk also did n't receive the benefits of making use of the euro -- things like avoiding currency interchange overhead , and more price stability in trade with europe . 
  surely those would be the corresponding benefits that they decided to forego by not adopting the euro , rather than * all * forms of eu interaction ? 
   openly hostile to europeans has the uk been hostile to the peoples of europe ? 
  i certainly have n't been following the uk 's relationship as much as i suppose most of you folks have , but it does n't seem like it has been . 
   if the uk leaves , there 's going to a debate in some other countries too , at least for a short time immediately afterwards . 
  that 's a cost of having the option to leave the eu for member countries , and it was a cost that eu members decided was outweighed by the benefits . 
  the eu * could * have imposed that `` we punish members for leaving '' clause back when and choose not to do so . 
  if this is truly broken in design , it seems hard to blame the uk more than the eu for it . 
  regardless of the outcome , it seems to me that in the future , the eu might benefit from avoiding situations ( e.g. 
  lisbon ) where people feel that they do n't have control over integration . 
  could be done by integrating more-slowly , forming individual unions on items and expanding them as individual countries want in , or doing a better job of explaining and marketing changes to the european public beforehand . 
  not to say that that wo n't change in the long run , but if we 're comparing sizes of economies as some other posters in the thread are ( i suppose that `` power '' is kind of ambiguous ) i have a hard time seeing poland being in a trifecta with france and germany as the largest european economy for at least some time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_%28nominal%29 listing only eu members : | rank | country | gdp ( in billions of dollars , 2014 ) | | - | - | - | | 1 | germany | 3.86 | | 2 | united kingdom | 2.95 | | 3 | france | 2.85 | | 4 | italy | 2.15 | | 5 | spain | 1.41 | | 6 | netherlands | 0.87 | | 7 | sweden | 0.57 | | 8 | poland | 0.55 | i 'd assume that poland will tend to catch up , but it 's simply not going to happen overnight -- italy 's economy is four times the size of poland 's . 
  i doubt that . 
  it is in the interest of any one company to want to block competing imports , but not of the interest of the country in which the company resides . 
  since the era when europe still bought into [ mercantilism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) , though , the idea that a country should try and maintain a net trade surplus and stockpile money is not the norm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/co-belligerence  co-belligerence is the waging of a war in cooperation against a common enemy without a formal treaty of military alliance .

   but since 2001 there 's been a strong latent political pressure on many nato members to use a terrorist attack as a reason to invoke article 5 and legitimize an intervention in the middle east hmm . 
  the issue there was n't that a non-state actor attacked the us , but that a non-state actor attacked the us , with a state then refusing to arrest them or let them be arrested , where there was every reason to believe that the same thing would happen again ( bin laden had already arranged a number of terrorist attacks against the us in the past ) . 
  finally , the attempt was to knock out either the white house or legislature with flight 93 ( the one that failed ) , to hit the us military headquarters , and to knock out the world trade center . 
  this was n't a matter of someone just bombing an airplane somewhere . 
  i 'm not so sure that that 's a matter of reliability . 
  back in the early cold war , the us and the uk would have been facing extremely rough odds against the ussr . 
  nuclear first use was a core element of fighting the ussr , and no non-first-use guarantee was extended . 
  [ russia promised no nuclear first use until 1993 , when it dropped the guarantee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_first_use ) ; russia was now weak enough in conventional forces that it needed to raise the possibility of nuclear weapons use against conventional weapons to present a convincing threat . 
  in contrast , the us avoided a no-first-use guarantee against even non-nuclear states ( ones using biological or chemical weapons ) up until obama , when the us gave a no-first-use guarantee to all non-nuclear powers . 
  the us still retains the possibility of nuclear first use against nuclear powers . 
  the uk takes a similar stance . 
  i personally wonder a bit about how credible a no-first-use guarantee is -- the problem is that a nuclear first strike is something one would use when worried about losing a nuclear war . 
  there 's no cost that could be imposed after avoiding losing a nuclear war that would remotely come close to the cost of having lost . 
  that makes me skeptical that a no-first-use-against-nuclear-powers state would actually follow their guarantees . 
  maybe greater political stability ? 
  i mean , remember that a couple of years ago , [ the finance minister was strongly advocating for default on debts ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2012/02/08/greece-should-default-within-the-eurozone-on-cnbc/ ) . 
  i 'd be sensitive about lending money to a country that was in that position too . 
  as far as i know , that 's not happening at the moment . 
   even if we were to sign up with swedes , will it really be enough to stop russia if they really wanted to come and liberate all the oppressed russian citizens living in these horrible conditions ? 
  i doubt . 
  well , some of the idea is providing a deterrent , not just winning . 
  even * if * country a could beat country b in a war if it gave it its all , it might be a lot more willing to get into a conflict with country b if b was defenseless than if b could credibly say `` i will make your victory long , bloody , and costly if you try it '' . 
  my guess is that the us could win a one-on-one war against any other country out there , but it definitely treats the prospect of a conflict with , say , china differently than a conflict with , say , libya . 
   nato does n't need more members who do n't spend at least 2 % of gdp on modern military hardware and troop training , though . 
  in terms of bang-for-the-buck , finland has shown a higher degree of effectiveness in fighting russia than just about anyone else out there . 
  just saying . 
  i think that the more-interesting question is what risks it has and what benefits from the standpoint in nato . 
  * from the standpoint of many nato-and-eu-both members , i think that finland-in-nato is probably advantageous , since if finland is not in nato but * does * get into a war , the eu alone would be required to provide defense -- the us , canada , turkey , norway ( possibly-important for the case of a russia-finland conflict ) , iceland , and albania are cut out . 
  if the eu did not act , it would harm the credibility of the eu 's defense guarantees . 
  if the eu did act , it would forced into fighting a conflict on substantially-worse terms than would likely otherwise be the case . 
  * from a us standpoint , i do n't know what the us government 's position is . 
  however , it * does * conduct joint exercises with finland , and i assume that if it were opposed to membership , it would refrain from doing this . 
  * if nato wants sweden to join , it might discourage sweden from joining ( if nato is already obligated to defend finland , for cases in which sweden is threatened by russian-finnish war , the situation is already addressed . 
  why expose sweden to a war at all ? ), 
  * i 'm not sure how-important the land position is , whether it would dramatically affect nato military options . 
  estonia is already in the vicinity of st. petersburg . 
  * it would create a very long land border with russia , longer than that of all existing nato members with russia . 
  while i 'm not sure how much of an actual risk that area is -- as seen in the winter war , it 's hard to move ground forces through -- it 's still an area that it 's easier for russia to get ground forces to than it would any other nato members , even norway . 
  nato would be on the hook to defend this area . 
  * i 'd guess that it would expand the area that nato would need to provide air defense in by a good deal , though it would also permit more control of airspace in the region . 
  no idea whether that would be a positive or a negative . 
  my guess is that nato would generally be in favor of finnish membership , given that it arranges joint exercises with the finnish military . 
  i 'd guess that it is instead the finnish public 's positions that would block this . 
  skimming some online articles , i see that after the last two years , [ the swedish public has swung in favor of nato membership ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/leaders/2015/09/17/new-poll-shows-sharp-shift-nato-support/32549641/ ) , whereas the [ finnish public apparently remains opposed ] ( http://famagusta-gazette.com/finland-remains-unenthusiastic-on-nato-membership-p30492-69.htm ) . 
   russia can go fuck itself . 
  this is none of their business . 
  it kind of * is * a pretty direct interest of russia 's , given that it would determine whether russia would whack into the eu 's mutual defense clause or both the mutual defense clause and nato 's article 5 . 
  i could see arguments that finnish interest would be best served by joining nato despite russia 's complaints . 
  but saying that russia should not care about the outcome is n't really reasonable . 
  of course russia cares . 
   for anyone no longer come as a surprise the fact that russia allowed finland to join nato . 
  i 'm getting the feeling that google translate is n't capturing everything here , given that finland has n't joined nato ... 
   * the 28 member states have not agreed on an eu-wide mechanism for relocating migrants , meant to ease the burden on greece and italy . 
  only small groups have been relocated so far - and several states in central and eastern europe refuse to accept migrants [ snip ]  * the dublin regulation is not working effectively . 
  countries are no longer sending back migrants to their first point of entry to the eu you 'd think that the second issue would somewhat mitigate the first issue . 
   i know i sound nuts whether intentional or not , the [ hundred flowers campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hundred_flowers_campaign ) under mao :  the hundred flowers campaign , also termed the hundred flowers movement ( simplified chinese : \u767e\u82b1\u8fd0\u52a8 ; traditional chinese : \u767e\u82b1\u904b\u52d5 ; pinyin : b\u01ceihu\u0101 y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng ) , was a period in 1956 in the people 's republic of china [ 1 ] during which the communist party of china ( cpc ) encouraged its citizens to openly express their opinions of the communist regime . 
  differing views and solutions to national policy were encouraged based on the famous expression by communist party chairman mao zedong : `` the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is designed to promote the flourishing of the arts and the progress of science . 
  '' [ 2 ] [ 3 ] after this brief period of liberalization , mao abruptly changed course . 
  the crackdown continued through 1957 as an [ anti-rightist campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-rightist_movement ) against those who were critical of the regime and its ideology . 
  those targeted were publicly criticized and condemned to prison labor camps . 
  [ 4 ] mao remarked at the time that he had `` enticed the snakes out of their caves . 
  '' [ 4 ] [ 5 ]   the first part of the phrase is often remembered as `` let a hundred flowers bloom '' . 
  it is used to refer to an orchestrated campaign to flush out dissidents by encouraging them to show themselves as critical of the regime , and then subsequently imprison them . 
  this view is supported by authors clive james and jung chang , who posit that the campaign was , from the start , a ruse intended to expose rightists and counter-revolutionaries , and that mao zedong persecuted those whose views were different from the party 's . 
    mao 's personal physician li zhisui , suggested that the campaign was `` a gamble , based on a calculation that genuine counterrevolutionaries were few , that rebels like hu feng had been permanently intimidated into silence , and that other intellectuals would follow mao 's lead , speaking out only against the people and practices mao himself most wanted to subject to reform . 
  '' [ 6 ] only when criticisms began shifting toward him personally did mao move to suppress the hundred flowers movement and punish some of its participants . 
    the ideological crackdown following the campaign 's failure re-imposed maoist orthodoxy in public expression , and catalyzed the anti-rightist movement . 
  if you buy into something with problems and the problems go away , what you bought is worth more . 
  hmm . 
  is supporting stalin really the same thing as being stalinist , though ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalinism  stalinism is the means of governing and related policies implemented by joseph stalin . 
  stalinist policies in the soviet union included : state terror , rapid industrialization , the theory of socialism in one country , a centralized state , collectivization of agriculture , cult of personality , and subordination of interests of foreign communist parties to those of the communist party of the soviet union -- deemed by stalinism to be the most forefront vanguard party of communist revolution at the time . 
  [ 1 ] that definition is n't much like `` supports the person of stalin '' . 
  well , outside of the `` cult of personality '' bit , maybe . 
   propaganda does n't have to be a lie to be propagdanda . 
  in the more-common modern sense of the word , though , that ( or at least dishonesty/misleadingness ) is implied . 
  you 're correct that the original sense of the word did not have that connotation :  [ propaganda ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/propaganda ) ( usually uncountable , plural propagandas )   a concerted set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of large numbers of people .
