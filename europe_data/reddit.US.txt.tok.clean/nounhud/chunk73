  [ birth tourism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birth_tourism ) is one quirk of [ * jus soli * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) . 
  europe mostly dodges it , since it 's mostly [ * jus sanguinis * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ) . 
  iirc , the uk 's are vaguely-similar : heavy emphasis on skilled immigration . 
  that was tongue-in-cheek in that german jews obviously would have a hard time qualifying for refugee slots , as i doubt that a judge would buy that they are truly endangered . 
  there are a limited number of immigration slots available in the us : just as me saying `` i live in the us and want to migrate to germany '' does n't automatically cause germany to let me in , religion be damned , so the opposite is true . 
  categories are almost invariably oversubscribed , and there are a limited number . 
  [ us immigration numbers ] ( http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/how-united-states-immigration-system-works-fact-sheet ) : ** family reunification ** * no limits : spouses of us citizens . 
  children ( under 21 ) of us citizens . 
  parents of non-child us citizens . 
  * however many are left over after the above out of a pool of about half a million : adult children of us citizens , brothers and sisters of us citizens . 
  ** skill/notable ability ** * 40k : `` persons of extraordinary ability '' in the arts , science , education , business , or athletics ; outstanding professors and researchers , some multinational executives . 
  * 40k : members of the professions holding advanced degrees , or persons of exceptional abilities in the arts , science , or business . 
  * 40k : skilled workers with at least two years of training or experience , professionals with college degrees , or `` other '' workers for unskilled labor that is not temporary or seasonal . 
  * 10k : certain `` special immigrants '' including religious workers , employees of u.s. foreign service posts , former u.s. government employees and other classes of aliens . 
  ** ~ ~ temporary work visa ~ ~ ** * do n't have the numbers here , but it 's possible to get a temporary work visa , and there 's some route to get citizenship starting from this . 
  h1-b skilled workers ( i run into software engineers working on this on a regular basis from around the world ) are 65k/year . 
  edit : nope , looks like even temporary visas are purely temporary and do n't buy you any way to bypass the other categories towards citizenship . 
  people getting in via work visas professionally try to get in via the `` advanced degree '' or `` extraordinary ability '' route , though i suppose you could also use the time in the country to try and get a citizen to marry you . 
  ** wealth ** * 10k : persons who will invest $ 500,000 to $ 1 million in a job-creating enterprise that employs at least 10 full time u.s. workers . 
  [ sometimes called the `` millionaire visa '' . ], 
  other countries may have similar programs : [ canada ] ( http://www.immigration.ca/en/2014/160-canada-immigration-news-articles/2014/december/1110-canadian-millionaire-visa-program-to-accept-only-50-applicants-per-year.html ) , [ australia ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/world/asia/australia-china-immigration/ ) , etc. 
  ** refugee ** * 70k : refugees , with per-region caps . 
  there are presently only 2k allocated for europe : there are very few people fleeing europe in fear of their lives . 
  ** luck ** * 55k : random lottery . 
  requires high school education , two years of professional experience . 
  being german alone wo n't qualify someone for a slot , though the fact that a german almost-certainly has a higher degree of education and viable work experience than the bulk of the global population obviously provides a statistical benefit . 
  the us does have substantial illegal immigration of its own , but that 's not a direct route to citizenship ( though if they have children in the us , those children will always automatically receive citizenship and can potentially pull their parents in a few decades later via family reunification ; see [ `` anchor baby '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anchor_baby ) ) . 
  vaguely-related trivia : i recall reading that in the [ finnish civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_civil_war ) , there were red guards dealt with by the white guards by lugging them to the russian border and heaving them over . 
   thank god we have moved on from this state of affairs and enacted polices so that sort of thing can not happen again . 
  we started dumping haitians and cubans in guantanamo bay concentration camps in the 1990s , so that 's kind of ensuring that it does n't happen again , even if it 's not exactly up to the humanist ideal . 
  this has been a long-term and core concern of israel and a source of political debate since its founding : it 's not new or specific to this issue . 
  you 've got a combination of an ethnic conflict in israel , a lot * more * non-jewish people who got brought in when israel conquered their lands , and a relatively-low israeli jewish fertility rate . 
  in some countries , the answer might be `` everyone just assimilates and the ethnic split goes away '' , but aside from raw wounds from a series of recent recent conflicts '' , judaism managed to exist as a cohesive entity in diaspora precisely by * not * assimilating . 
  if you pushed hard to establish a jewish state after two thousand years of maintaining a distinct identity , promptly dropping it on the floor is a tough political sell . 
  i would be pretty gung-ho on allocating refugee slots over here for german jews . 
  best-performing ethnic group in terms of education and wealth in the us . 
  ` course , for israel , jewish immigration also provides a stopgap solution to their own demographic concerns and there are already policies in place to permit and encourage immigration , so german jews have got existing competing options . 
   i 'd also advocate propping up the greek costs of rebuffing these people before they enter the continent . 
  what does greece do with people that it catches ? 
  turkey is n't going to accept people back . 
  dumping them in libya resulted in italy being fined by the european court of human rights . 
  redistribution -- what 's currently being promoted -- is not popular with other members . 
  drowning people is not going to be politically-viable . 
  you have to provide greece with a viable-to-greece thing to do with migrants that it intercepts if you want greece to intercept them . 
  either terminate the legal doctrine that would fine greece , accept redistribution , accept drowning , set up overseas camps , or come up with some acceptable-to-greece solution other than the ones that i 've listed above . 
   they ship them in because they know the migrants want to head north and wo n't be italy 's problem the way they 'd see it , their position is as justifiable as yours . 
  berlin/london/etc does n't want to get stuck with gobs of refugees , so you want them stopped , they do n't want to get stuck with gobs of refugees , so they let them through . 
  any solution is going to need to be something that can be sold to all of the parties who will have to cooperate for it to function . 
   honestly , the most likely scenario at this point is germany losing patience and paying the 3 billion alone just to get things started already . 
  the eu could plausibly be able to hit the us up to add funds for refugee camps overseas ; if the us matched eu funds , that 'd increase the impact . 
  that would almost certainly be more-politically-viable in the us than accepting refugees . 
  if the eu can deal with the political side of deporting intercepted people to said camps from the eu , that might be a step in the right direction . 
   help greece build up an efficient border control to stop boats from turkey what does greece do with the boats they 've stopped ? 
  you already have people sinking their boats so that the greek coast guard does n't have a way to turn them back . 
  greece is going to work with you on this * if * you do n't stick greece with all the people they stop . 
  if you do n't stick greece with 'em , you 've got a limited set of options : * drown them . 
  pretty sure that this will not be politically-acceptable in the eu , and i think that it 's a much-worse idea than deportation . 
  * redistribute them within the eu . 
  this appears to be what the eu is presently aiming for . 
  * use the pacific solution -- find a non-eu country that is willing to be paid to store people in camps , as australia did . 
  this will cost something substantial as well , and the scale is already quite large , about 100 times what australia had to deal with . 
  it may be difficult to unload everyone . 
  * deport them . 
  italy tried this [ and was fined for it by the european court of human rights when it sent somalians and eritreans back ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/court-fines-italy-for-deporting-migrants-to-libya/a-15761455 ) . 
  italy ( and every other member country ) is n't going to keep doing this and keep being fined , so unless you 're going to change the rules that the european court of human rights is operating by , this is n't an option . 
  personally , i think that the most-reasonable option would be a combination of the following : * restrict things like residency clocks that ultimately grant citizenship in such a way that member countries can credibly-treat this as a temporary rather than permanent housing of people . 
  i do n't think that blocking family reunification , as you suggested , is the best way to do this , but it 's in the same vein . 
  eu members might be willing to house some number of would-be migrants temporarily , if they can be given a credible guarantee that they do not need to extend citizenship or permanently deal with them . 
  if there is a chance of this being levered into citizenship , i think that redistribution is going to remain in a state of paralysis . 
  i think that if the * real * concern is people getting killed , this should be an acceptable trade-off for people concerned about the humanitarian side . 
  * start looking for a pacific solution option . 
  * ensure that existing overseas camps are properly funded . 
  maybe try and hit the us or japan up for more funds -- europe , the us , and japan were over 75 % of the unhcr 's annual budget in 2012 , and maybe europe could cut some of the funds that it has to put in somewhat . 
  1.2 m immigrants in total . 
  that is not `` big random swath of penniless , unskilled , uneducated people from the middle east and africa '' , and includes family reunification , skilled worker immigration , and the like . 
  the federal government agreed to take 10,000 syrians in 2016 -- less than 1/85th the total number the eu had flood in -- and it 's generated huge friction . 
  [ already the majority of the us state governments have refused to cooperate with the federal government in doing this ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/world/paris-attacks-syrian-refugees-backlash/ ) . 
  since 2011 , only 1,500 syrians have made it in . 
  i would not support taking in a substantial chunk . 
  we * did * use gitmo for a few similar crises in the us , like the [ haitians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haitian_refugees_held_at_the_guantanamo_bay_naval_base ) and the [ cubans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuban_refugees_at_the_guantanamo_bay_naval_base ) . 
  i understand that most cubans were ultimately admitted ( `` sending someone back to the commies ? 
  '' ) , most haitians ultimately returned to haiti . 
  the scale , though , of the present european crisis is on the order of 50 times larger than the ones that we dealt with . 
   true but then again the us is already heavily involved in european issues via nato and other such relationships . 
  yes , but not , as i understand it , generally domestic issues . 
  this is perhaps important . 
  were the us to become deeply-involved in europe 's domestic politics , it would invariably wind up attached to some unpopular ideas or efforts -- a politician that goes down , some sort of reform initative , etc. 
  if there 's one thing that members of the public dislike than a domestic political movement that they are opposed to , it 's a large foreign country * backing * a domestic political movement that they are opposed to . 
  i do not pretend to understand long-term us goals wrt europe , but i 'd guess that they look something like `` establish strong trade ties , maintain military alliance '' , as for the forseeable future , this bloc is economically and militarily more-influential than anything else likely to show up . 
  europe and the us have had relatively-few conflicting concerns : they do not compete for land , do not compete much ( if at all ) for natural resources , and so forth , so there 's not much to unseat that relationship . 
  if the uk winds up within the us , things like north sea fishing rights suddenly become conflicting interests between the eu and the us . 
   presumably if it got to the stage that the uk chose to join the usa then the british public would be more than willing to surrender most central government powers to washington . 
  there are other posts in this submission that explicitly talk about how some users here are unhappy about the idea of surrendering sovereignty at * all * , to the us and the eu ... and the us is a federation , whereas the eu is ( presently ) a confederation . 
  i do not know how representative either group is , but my guess is that there would be substantial groups concerned about at least some of these . 
   we need a good clean up in that department and we permanently have commissions combing through our laws in an attempt to weed out redundant/non-sensical legislation . 
  i suppose that 's true of everyone , but it 's still disruptive -- people have built business policies , contracts , and all of that on top of the existing legal code . 
   agreed but then that 's a large part of why the uk public would theoretically vote to join . 
  it would spark an immigration invasion that would put the germanic tribes to shame . 
  i 've no objection to that , but my point is that you can see people on these forums describing the impact of the eu freedom-of-movement and freedom-of-work rights on their members . 
  greece , the poland , and other countries are drained of some population , and well-to-do urban centers ( berlin , london ) have people flood into them .
