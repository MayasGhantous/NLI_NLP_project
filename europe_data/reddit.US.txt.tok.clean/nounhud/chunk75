  ukraine is a giant unknown , if it joins , with a huge number of people , and serious corruption issues . 
  it 's * hard * to fix corruption . 
  this a real concern that i 'm somewhat sympathetic to . 
  however , i also think that there are a lot of options available to the eu , like establishing an eu-level anticorruption organization -- the fbi and treasury department were used occasionally when local law enforcement became captured by organized crime in the us . 
  greece hit problems , but there 's also every reason to believe that people will learn from what went wrong there and avoid them next time . 
  as long as many people have the will to change things -- and at least on this forum , certainly this seems to be the case -- i do not believe that things will go unresolved . 
  it may be that the eu will become the world leader in formalizing a process for cleaning up states . 
  * language : i think that in the long run , the eu is probably going to wind up using english , anyway . 
  * the eu structure not-effectively solving problems . 
  the us had all sorts of crises in its early days as well . 
  over time , people figured how to change government structure to address them . 
  the eu will certainly fine-tune and polish its own . 
  * loss aversion , with risk . 
  something like this : `` the us more-or-less works -- it 's been tested by some time . 
  maybe the eu will go do something really dumb and fall apart . 
  if the uk ties herself to the eu and things do n't work out , it might be disastrous for the uk . '', 
  i do n't think that it will . 
  as long as there are competent people who want the thing to work , they can change it in whatever way is required . 
  the people in europe are just as able to come up with fixes and solutions as the people over here , and all members have an interest in things not sucking for themselves . 
  remember , too , that while there may be discontent with eu policy -- that 's because it is here , now , and in the uk 's face . 
  were the uk to become us states , friction there would show up right in front of its face . 
   this can only be done by sealing off the outer borders . 
  if you do that , a decision needs to be made about what to do with people you catch at the sea borders , whether it 's simply let in ( wo n't solve the issue that tusk is talking about ) , redistribute ( not sure that it 's sellable to other member countries ) , keep in concentration camps locally , [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) , return to origin of sender ( would need to stop fining countries , like italy , which do this ) , or simply let drown ( i do n't think that that is going to be politically-sellable to the people of the eu ) . 
   nothing to do with the fact holland is one of the biggest tax havens in the eu and is stealing taxes from almost every other state in the eec as well as in usa and beyond . 
  if so , it 's due to flawed eec or usa tax laws . 
   crimea is now unimportant to russia except as navy base . 
  i thought that it was relatively-warm and thus a place to retire to . 
   i 've read the web forum of crimean pro-russian activists . 
  were ethnic russians physically-afraid of post-euromaidan violence ? 
  that was certainly something that russia tried to play up , but i do n't know how dominant a concern that was . 
  if you close europe 's land borders after migrants have made it into greece and italy , you burden those countries with the migrants . 
  if you close the sea borders into greece and italy , you must also decide on what to * do * with the people you catch . 
   if we do n't disperse the crowds , but try to hold back through brute force , then the angry crowds simply get too big and they will storm the fence ( s ) . 
  ceuta has shown that . 
  if you disperse crowds at border checkpoints , they will presumably look into crossing the border somewhere other than a checkpoint . 
  many european borders can be crossed without * that * much difficulty outside of checkpoints . 
  as i have pointed out a few times , hungary has been in the news for their `` hard line '' approach of putting up razor wire ... but someone can honestly just lift it up and slip under . 
  i think that dealing with internal borders across europe is simply going to be phenomenally-expensive . 
  i 'd be more-interested in one of the following : ** create preferable alternatives ** . 
  hungarian fences , as i mentioned above , do not work because they pose much of a barrier . 
  they work because it 's easier to go around hungary -- there 's a preferable alternative . 
  that reduces the gap between europe and the rest of the world . 
  if there were somewhere * other * than europe that migrants would like to go to find viable work , like an [ sez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_economic_zone ) on the libyan coast or similar where european factories could set up shop , there 'd be somewhere else to place people . 
  the downside to that would be that there 'd still be a depressing effect on factory wages , which may kill political viability -- but that 'd happen due to trade with china and the like anyway . 
  that could be economically advantageous for europe . 
  ** make europe less-favorable as a destination for illegal immigration ** . 
  right now , if you can get into , say , the uk , you can work illegally and not much will stop you . 
  if you can get into sweden or germany and get some form of legal residency , you can start the clock on citizenship . 
  those are powerful pull factors . 
  it would be possible to change policy to cause asylum status to not count in time towards citizenship -- in this case , asylum is seen as only a temporary sanctuary , until someone can be returned . 
  it would be possible to raise penalties for employing someone illegally , or make it harder to escape being caught when doing so . 
  ** remove the disincentive to identify and register migrants ** there are a couple of ways to do this . 
  if -- perhaps via at least greece and italy in particular withdrawing from the refugee convention -- countries stated that they would no longer honor [ article 31 of the refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) :  article 31 . 
    refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge   1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  the contracting states shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularized or they obtain admission into another country . 
  the contracting states shall allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country . 
  this one of the two elements ( the other the inability to deport people who claim to come from an unsafe country ) which has caused the breakdown of much of europe 's law enforcement system wrt illegal immigration -- if law enforcement actually caught someone illegally traveling through , that person would then probably claim asylum in the country in question . 
  if they do * not * catch the illegal migrant , they will pass through and become another country 's problem . 
  in that situation , there 's only one reasonable thing to do -- ignore illegal passage . 
  that would eliminate much of the disincentive for countries to catch people passing illegally into or through -- simply catching someone would be grounds for fingerprinting/dna recording and deportation . 
  i do n't think that countries are unable to catch people coming in -- they 've just been * penalized * for doing so to date in that situation . 
  in that case , there would still be a question of needing to provide a way for the country to get the migrant off its hands . 
  merkel tried redistribution , and , not surprisingly , that failed : countries did not want to take in a lot of penniless , unskilled people from the middle east and north africa . 
  italy tried returning people to libya : that did n't work in that italy was fined . 
  it would , i think , be possible , to change things such that italy is * not * fined ; that 's one route , though the destination should * actually * be safe . 
  another possibility would be setting up the [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) , where the eu takes responsibility for ensuring that a third party country accepts and houses an identified illegal migrant for the duration of a conflict ; this avoids the refugee convention 's restriction on freedom of work and labor , and in the case of australia , dramatically slashed illegal immigration . 
  however , this can only scale up to certain levels , and it might be best to implement this sooner rather than later if it is to be done . 
  the levels of people involved now are a hundred times greater than the numbers in australia . 
  this does n't require withdrawing from the refugee convention , is sure to not endanger people , and avoids the citizenship issue that is upsetting people and perhaps pressuring the uk to leave . 
   the response was characterised by nobody having any idea what to do and every country trying to shift the problem to someone else . 
  fair enough . 
  what would your preferred response be ? 
  and congrats to her . 
  corruption is a hard problem to beat which many countries have had no luck dealing with . 
  i 've a few indian friends who describe corruption as the biggest barrier to business development in india . 
  realistically , has the us ever intervened to block a likely war between two nato members ? 
  i think that you 're crediting the us for something that it had little role in . 
   last month , trump provoked controversy with his comments that muslims should be banned from entering the united states , after 14 people died in a shooting spree in california by two muslims , whom the fbi said had been radicalised . 
  [ snip ]  `` there is no reason why we should n't admire america and admire her history and admire her contribution to democracy over many centuries , but also object to particular individuals , '' said mp paul flynn . 
  hmm . 
  well , i 'm a big fan of free speech , but i guess that some people might be offended by his criticism of people based on their religion . 
  i guess maybe mr. flynn is willing to live with some restrictions on speech to avoid religious-based criticism of people . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_flynn_%28politician%29  in november 2011 , he expressed concern about the appointment of matthew gould as the uk 's ambassador to israel , asserting that as a jew , gould had `` divided loyalties '' and that the position should be given to `` someone with roots in the uk '' . 
  flynn claimed `` there has n't been a jewish ambassador to israel and i think that is a good decision -- to avoid the accusation that they have gone native . 
  '' [ 1 ] these comments drew criticism from middle east minister alistair burt , who stated that `` paul flynn should take some time to consider his comments , which could easily be misconstrued . 
  there is absolutely no reason why our ambassador to israel should not be jewish . 
  any allegations about matthew gould 's conduct are utterly unsubstantiated . 
  he is a first-class ambassador . 
  '' [ 1 ] hmm . 
  how long did you expect the uk to maintain make-work mining capacity ? 
  forever ? 
  that does n't make sense to me -- it 's no less-real to transfer wealth via a variable tax rate and fixed spending rate than via variable spending and a fixed tax rate . 
  * [ saudi oil exports climb to seven-month high as refineries return ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-18/saudi-oil-exports-climb-to-seven-month-high-as-refineries-return ) * [ cooperation among oil producers will take time , says saudi minister ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/cooperation-among-oil-producers-will-take-time-says-saudi-minister-1453029634 )  riyadh -- oil-market stability will be achieved through cooperation among major producers but this will likely take time , saudi oil minister ali al-naimi said sunday , signaling the world 's top petroleum exporter is still not prepared to take sole responsibility for propping up the oil price . 
  [ snip ]  saudi arabia , a member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries , led the group in 2014 on a new course of pumping more oil in the face of declining prices . 
  that was a historic departure for a cartel that produces a third of the world 's oil and had historically used its muscle to keep supply scarce enough to support desirable prices . 
    with american production flooding the market , the saudis no longer believed a production cut would be effective . 
    opec in december failed to reach any agreement to restrain production , leaving members to continue pumping crude at near-record levels into an already oversupplied market . 
    the group abandoned its production ceiling of 30 million barrels a day , which it had breached routinely . 
  [ snip ]  last week , nigerian oil minister emmanuel ibe kachikwu said some opec nations were pushing for an emergency meeting .
