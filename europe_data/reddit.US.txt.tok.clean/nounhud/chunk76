  but the united arab emirates ' oil minister , suhail bin mohammed al-mazrouei , moved to quash talk of a potential emergency meeting , saying any action by opec would be an `` artificial move . '', 
  good nab , turkey . 
  i wish i did n't have to hear about any us presidential candidates until a month before the election . 
   this is really childish behaviour . 
  i doubt it . 
  both of them are politicians . 
  they can take a high-profile stand like this and make a powerful political statement and affect votes without having to actually set policy as a result . 
  in contrast , nobody cares about the work you did on improving utility bonds and that * does * constrain the policy you set . 
  it * is * pretty nice-looking !, 
  that choropleth map shows ratio of spending to tax . 
  you 'd have a varying ratio regardless of whether spending varied or taxation varied . 
  how does that conflict with the paper i linked to that describes the difference from state-to-state being overwhelmingly due to taxation decreases ? 
  the article body has it right ; the title is the only part in error . 
  the linked article analyzes each statement . 
  these were just reasons that people preferred the uk to france . 
  i wonder if that projection is actually equal-area ( which would make the most sense , given that it 's comparing relative areas ) . 
   if russia had properly invaded ukraine this is the second comment i 've commented on in the last day ) saying that something does n't count as an invasion ( last time it was the allied invasion of normandy ) . 
  the [ war in donbas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_donbass ) involved :  40,000 -- 45,000 fighters [ 29 ]   ( 3,000 -- 4,000 russian volunteers ) [ 30 ]   9,000 -- 12,000 regular russian soldiers ( ukraine & u.s. estimate ) [ 31 ] [ 32 ]   42,000 russian soldiers ( rusi estimate of combined rotation ) [ 33 ] [ 34 ] if the [ bay of pigs invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bay_of_pigs_invasion ) is considered an invasion , it 's kinda hard to see how donbas was n't an invasion . 
  i mean that the migrants are reasonably-concerned that they would be forced to apply for asylum in france . 
  the french do n't determine the uk border entry , but they do determine whether-or-not to try to arrest/process the people in the squatters ' camps , and i expect that at the moment , france has the same disincentives that greece and italy do : once they start processing them , they run the risk of simply getting stuck with them . 
  ergo , no processing . 
  it looks like china ( which i 'm not familiar with ) [ has a similar high conviction rate to japan ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/11/china-scored-99-9-percent-conviction-rate-last-year/ ) :  of the 1.16 million people put on trial last year , chinese courts returned a guilty verdict for all but 825 of them . 
  you did the math right : that 's a 99.93 percent conviction rate . 
  either these countries are conservative in their decision prosecution , more-effective at preventing someone who is guilty from gaming the system , or have a habit of convicting the innocent or a combination of the above ; take your pick . 
  in japan , i 've read that this is considered to come in significant part from conservative prosecution ( the system provides better incentives for a prosecutor to get a high conviction rate than to get a high absolute count of convictions ) . 
   lastly , i just want to say that i do n't have an education in jurisprudence , i 'm merely interested in it . 
  i might very well be wrong in my assumptions . 
  [ this paper ] ( http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/38975/bsa32_eu.pdf ) says that it 's less-so than other countries , but trending slowly up . 
  from table a1 : percent in the uk who consider themselves `` european '' : | year | percent | | - | - | | 1996 | 10 | | 1997 | 9 | | 1998 | 12 | | 1999 | 17 | | 2000 | 11 | | 2001 | 12 | | 2002 | 12 | | 2003 | 12 | | 2004 | 11 | | 2005 | 12 | | 2006 | 16 | | 2007 | 12 | | 2008 | 14 | | 2009 | 12 | | 2010 | 11 | | 2011 | 12 | | 2012 | 14 | | 2013 | 13 | | 2015 | 15 | that 's a positive correlation ( 0.365 ) between the two , albeit not a strong one . 
  most of these describe introducing new state spending targeting low-income areas . 
  [ fwiw , in the us , it sounds like it 's more reduced taxation from poorer people that creates the difference ] ( http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/december/taxes-transfers-redistribution-us-federal-government-states/ ) ; federal spending among states remains more-or-less constant as wealth changes . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion  an invasion is a military offensive in which large parts of combatants of one geopolitical entity aggressively enter territory controlled by another such entity , generally with the objective of either conquering , liberating or re-establishing control or authority over a territory , forcing the partition of a country , altering the established government or gaining concessions from said government , or a combination thereof . 
  does n't matter who starts a fight as regards it being an invasion or not . 
  the [ invasion of normandy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_normandy ) was an invasion . 
  i 'm not much of a china-watcher , but i 've seen changes come by in the form of property and other rights that seem pretty fundamental in recent years . 
  there * are * reforms happening there . 
  doing a quick google , it sounds like china * does * have such a right ... it 's simply that the implementation is n't too hot . 
  http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1252146/presumed-guilty-china  once considered a concept of the bourgeoisie , the presumption of innocence was not accepted by the people 's republic for almost 50 years . 
  however , in 1996 , the criminal procedure law was revised to incorporate an important new provision , stating that nobody shall be declared guilty without being judged as such by a court according to the law . 
    the chinese version of the presumption of innocence has been hailed as great progress in chinese criminal procedure , although its wording differs from that in international conventions . 
  thus , prosecutors are not allowed to bring any charges , and judges can not affirm the guilt of the accused and mete out punishment , unless there is clear and convincing evidence . 
    the purported goal of the principle is to afford better protection to the accused ; however , its practical significance remains highly limited . 
  in reality , the presumption of guilt continues to be the rule , as confirmed by shen 's article . 
  it 's no secret that police officers , prosecutors and judges on the mainland , although working in different agencies , are all members of one big family - the zhengfa jiguan , literally , the `` political-legal authority '' . 
  i agree with the idea that the refugee convention was not well-crafted for the present world , but it makes no mandates regarding citizenship grants ; not granting citizenship would not conflict with its requirements . 
  as far as i know , the eu itself does not require members to grant citizenship due to refugee residency . 
  i know that the criteria for granting citizenship certainly varies member-by-member . 
  as far as i know , there would n't be any eu-based restrictions on the eu specifying that time under refugee status does not count towards minimum residency requirements for naturalization . 
  perhaps there are members who have pre-existing country-level law on the matter -- for example , constitutions encoding naturalization requirements . 
  however , i do not see how barriers would be established at the eu level . 
  as of [ october 2015 ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/186209/europeans-negative-toward-immigration.aspx ) , immigration was quite unpopular across-the-board in the eu . 
  i doubt that it has become more-popular since that time . 
  i do not think that this is a `` quick patch '' , but a worthwhile long-term change . 
  unless the eu is to fully take on the naturalization process , it presumably must place at least some minimum bounds , since eu citizenship is a shared resource in a pool that all members have access to grant . 
   imams , social conservatives and the like around the world like to paint the west as a chaotic den of hedonism ... even in places like china and korea which are less extremist , the same image prevails . 
  if you 're talking about western europe ... i 'd say that they 're not completely wrong , at least compared to east asia .

  edit : well , i guess i do have turkey , and if they think that the eu is more hedonistic than turkey , they * are * going to be disappointed . 
   they should all be deported you have to identify a location that will accept them if you 're going to deport someone . 
  some countries are at war . 
  others are n't considered safe . 
  some migrants will have false or no documents . 
  that was to try and reduce lorry break-ins to lorries stuck at the channel tunnel . 
  that still leaves open small boats on the channel , ferries , and probably other routes , like false id . 
  if solving the migrant crisis as a whole could be done for # 12m and some prefab barriers , i 'm pretty sure that it would have been done a while back . 
   i really do n't understand why are they so hell-bent on going to the uk . 
  [ bbc : would calais migrants really be better off in the uk ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33268521 ) lists some thoughts from various individuals on why it makes sense to try to get into the uk illegally :  * housing : `` in england i can get a house very quickly . 
  england is a very good place to have a good life . '', 
    * healthcare and education : `` i speak the language and i respect the education system in england . 
  it 's a civilised country . '', 
    * illegal work : `` britain says , ` we do n't want immigrants , ' but does nothing to prevent the black economy . '', 
    * existing communities : `` i want to go to england because i have relatives and my father in england . '', 
    * the economy : according to the eu 's own figures , the unemployment rate in france in may was 10.3 % . 
  in the uk it was 5.5 % for the period from february to april , according to the office for national statistics . 
    * likelihood of gaining refugee status : last year , 38.8 % of uk decisions ended in a grant of asylum or an alternative form of protection . 
  for france the rate was 21.7 % . 
    * detection : `` there are no id cards . 
  they can easily find work outside the formal economy , which is not really controlled . '', 
   the migrants are also concerned that if they move into the new facility , they will be forced to apply for asylum in france , according to volunteer aid workers . 
  the french government has denied that migrants , who are mostly from warzones such as syria , afghanistan and iraq or are fleeing persecution and poverty in african countries such as sudan and eritrea , will be compelled to do so . 
  i suppose that it 's a reasonable concern from their standpoint , but as long as france sees only disadvantage from doing so , i doubt that france will do this . 
  also , to be fair , note that the bottom data is relatively-old : from 2002 , and the very article was talking about how there had been large shifts towards greater processing and sewage access since the 1980s , so one can assume that those shifts continued after that . 
   no pan-european sense of identity but heading in that direction , based on polls of different age groups . 
  additionally , polls over time seem to show a steadily-increasing european identity : [ here 's a paper looking at views on identity over time in hungary ] ( http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/budapest/10840.pdf ) : ** looking into the near future , how would you identify yourself ? 
  ** * ( the distribution of hungarian responses in % , eb62 , eb64 , eb73 , eb76 , eb77 ) * | date | only hungarian | hungarian and european | european and hungarian | only european | | - | - | - | - | - | | autumn 2004 | 64 | 32 | 2 | 1 | | autumn 2005 | 51 | 44 | 4 | 0 | | spring 2010 | 47 | 47 | 5 | 1 | | autumn 2011 | 50 | 41 | 6 | 2 | | spring 2012 | 45 | 47 | 4 | 2 | | * spring 2012 ( eu27 ) * | 38 | 49 | 6 | 3 | that 's over the course of just eight years . 
   we 'd have to change the rules so it 's nigh impossible for refugees to get citizenship but that will never happen . 
  why is that ? 
  it seems like a policy like that would probably be popular at the moment . 
  many european countries , as well as the us , have different `` tiers '' at the country level . 
  there are various sorts of overseas territories , [ associated states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/associated_state ) , countries with defense agreements , countries with trade agreements , countries with visa agreements , etc. 
  none of these seem to water down the country itself from existing . 
  though i am no expert , i do not think that the uk is best-off leaving the eu `` tier 1 '' -- that is , i think that it would benefit from shaping the eu and that the eu would benefit from a liberalizing influence . 
  however , if that is not politically-viable or if the uk deeply disagrees on something that can not really be compromised on , i do n't see the * point * of trying to force it in . 
  it sounds like your concern is one of setting precedent . 
  let 's say , for example , that down the like , ukraine says `` we want a defense agreement and a trade agreement and freedom of movement and freedom to work but we do n't want to adopt your sewage and food safety standards '' ... you 're worried that the eu will need to accept some undesirable collection of policies . 
  i do n't really see that as the case -- it 's always possible for a member not to accept that , and there 's no way in which it binds future decisions . 
  the question should , it seems to me , whether what the uk is asking for is itself reasonable . 
  i do n't know , because all of the things i 've seen described as being uk-requested changes ( i think i 've seen about four different lists now of desired changes ) are mostly too-vague to evaluate . 
  okay , do n't get me wrong -- i 'd say that / u/spacepilotx has frustration talking .
