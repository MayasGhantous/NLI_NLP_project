  but would you advocate for a world without borders ? 
  you understand that it would have a significant impact on the world you live in ? 
  globally , inequality has steadily been decreasing , but presently the world is still quite unequal . 
  if you can not establish a disincentive to cross the border , and simply bind all countries together , you will generate immigration at a massive scale -- people are no fools , and would prefer to live in the nicest place -- and simply swamp much of the first world . 
  i remember [ seeing a short visualization that someone did with gumballs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ) a while back to show the scale of what people are talking about when they aim to address poverty via immigration to developed nations . 
  if you do not deport or otherwise take action to discourage illegal immigration , you 're stuck with some pretty stark economic realities : if you put a large piece of the third world into europe , you wo n't have europe ... you 'll just have a relocated third world . 
  you mean that they would work illegally in , say , germany , and that would create a vector into the uk ? 
  then the uk would n't need to extend them legal work or residence permits . 
  the uk would still be vulnerable to people sneaking in on trucks or ferries and then working illegally in the uk , but that would be the case even if the uk were n't in the eu ( since presumably the uk would retain the same transport links that exist today ) . 
  would it make more sense to push for a common eu policy limiting grants of citizenship based on refugee status ? 
  the `` legal residency requirement '' clock for citizenship does n't start while someone holds refugee status ? 
  edit : for that matter , i kind of think that if eu citizenship includes the right to work and move throughout the eu , establishing some common limits on citizenship grants probably * has * to happen -- else , for example , some tiny eu member could make gobs of money by selling magic legal work right licenses to the uk/germany/etc . 
  i did a handful of google searches , because i was wondering myself . 
  you could require a supermajority . 
  the changes in eu power are roughly-comparable to changes that would be made by us constitution being amended , and that requires a two-thirds vote by ( presently , elected ) federal representatives and * then * three-quarters of the ( presently , elected ) state legislatures signing off on it . 
  that 's a lower bar than a `` one state can veto '' situation , but a higher bar than a `` 51 % can run everything '' . 
   but that way half the countries would leave , hurting the eu in the process . 
  i do n't know whether `` let 's try and * force * countries in by blocking them from having other options '' is a great idea , though . 
  it seems to me that producing a federal system that works well such that other countries * want * in would be the most-reliable way of promoting federalism . 
   a shame , but predictable given the ongoing refugee crisis . 
  i 'll still vote to stay in , but it 's becoming less appealing as time goes on . 
  i do n't really see the connection between the migrant crisis and eu membership . 
  the uk is an eu member now , and it has not resulted in migrants showing up in the uk . 
   most americans use septic tanks do n't they ? 
  that seems unlikely to me . 
  my experience has been that they 're common with people living outside of towns . 
  outhouses would be very uncommon , though i 've used all three ( septic , outhouse , municipal ) in my life . 
  let 's go looking for some numbers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/septic_tank  in north america , approximately 25 percent of the population relies on septic tanks , including some suburbs and small towns as well as rural areas . 
  [ as for outhouses ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/23/1-6-million-americans-dont-have-indoor-plumbing-heres-where-they-live/ ) :  according to the latest american community survey , nearly 630,000 occupied households lack complete plumbing facilities , which means that they are without one or more of the following : a toilet , a tub or shower , or running water . 
  the census bureau says that the average household contains 2.6 individuals , which means that today , in 2014 , in the wealthiest nation on earth , upwards of 1.6 million people are living without full indoor plumbing . 
  that 'd be about 0.5 % of the population . 
  http://www.right2water.eu/sites/water/files/stockholmreportseminarsanitationwecf.pdf i dunno about romania in particular , but :  the who figures presented in brussels indicated that 150 million europeans use some sort of decentralised sanitation system , often without any treatment of the faeces . 
  [ cities in both the us and europe tend to make use of municipal sewage ] ( http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/3%20overview%20of%20the%20european%20and%20asian%20practices%20on%20dewats%20needs,%20drivers,%20trends%20and%20technologies.pdf ) : | region | population with sewerage connection in large cities , % | portion of wastewater treated to secondary level , % | | - | - | - | | northern america | 96 | 90 | | europe | 92 | 66 | | asia * ( incl .

  the highest percentage ( 80-90 % ) is in northern and central europe and these countries also have the highest levels of tertiary treatment , which efficiently removes nutrients and organic load . 
  it has been estimated that more than 70 % of the wastewater in the nordic countries undergoes tertiary treatement . 
  in southern and eastern europe , only around half of the population is currently connected to any wastewater treatment plant and only about 30 - 40 % of wastewater is subjected to secondary or tertiary treatment ( data source : eea-etc/wtr based on member states data reported to oecd/eurostat joint questionare 2002 ) . 
   that 's how it became a great power i do n't really agree . 
  [ the us became a massive economic power in an era when it was dramatically more inward-looking than it is today . ] ( http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&amp;psid=3158 ) . 
  that economic power ( and not getting gutted in the world wars where europe , the source of the other world 's powers at the time , twice disemboweled herself in a few decades ) eventually translated into tremendous global influence . 
   by 1890 , the united states had by far the world 's most productive economy . 
  american industry produced twice as much as its closest competitor -- britain . 
  but the united states was not a great military or diplomatic power . 
  its army numbered less than 30,000 troops , and its navy had only about 10,000 seamen . 
  britain 's army was five times the size of its american counterpart , and its navy was ten times bigger . 
  the united states ' military was small because the country was situated between two large oceans and was surrounded by weak or friendly nations . 
  it faced no serious military threats and had little interest in asserting military power overseas . 
  the us did n't kick off world war i , and rather-rapidly withdrew from the world after world war i. 
  it was n't until after world war ii -- where the us saw a real global threat of communist revolution and a possible takeover of western europe by the ussr -- that the us really wound up with its current status . 
   russia is truly eastern european !, 
  i mean , [ by any definition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe ) , it really is . 
   analysts have noted how russia today , the kremlin-controlled television channel which operates in britain , gave extensive and very positive coverage of mr corbyn 's leadership campaign . 
  it covered six of his public rallies and speeches , which it did not do for rival candidates . 
  eh , it does that in the us too . 
  ron paul -- quite noninterventionist -- got gobs of coverage from both russian and chinese state-run media . 
  one of the funnier things i 've seen in political tv is ron paul , who is very fiscally right-wing , earnestly espousing the merits of a * laissez-faire * market economy to a young chinese woman interviewing him . 
  she is employed by state-controlled media in a one-party system by a party that at least in * name * is communist and still has state-owned enterprise making up a not-insignificant ( if decreasing ) chunk of the economy , and she was enthusiastically nodding and agreeing with him . 
  was glorious . 
  was n't there [ just a submission about how iran was funding podemos ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41e165/theory_on_possibility_of_spains_leftist_party/ ) ? 
  dunno if the right is a special snowflake in that regard . 
  we * will * be investigating that investigation . 
   we only just hit peak coal utilization we have an abundance of cheap natural gas from hydrofracking that is being flared off because we do n't have the infrastructure to ship it anywhere that could use it . 
  i 'd be using that for power generation too . 
  iirc from a paper a few years back , the us has ~ 400 years of known coal reserves at present us usage levels . 
  i 'd be quite surprised if that were just ignored and left to lie in the ground , assuming that cheaper alternatives were n't available . 
  the [ decrease in us coal usage corresponded to an increase in natural gas usage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_electrical_generation_1949-2011.png ) . 
  the nwf is n't really a rainy-day fund in that it appears to finance the russian pension system as well as other infrastructure projects . 
  it 's not as if burning through it wo n't have consequences . 
   what should have been done should have been collective well , i agree there . 
  if you have the political will to kill people at the border , i 'm pretty sure that you have the political will to just deport them to somewhere else in the world . 
  from the photos i 've seen , away from the official crossing points it looks like just loose coils of razor wire . 
  [ you can take a stick and lift it up ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ejucizcpptw/ved7z2eltyi/aaaaaaaa7dg/yitqgnf_ogg/s1600/migrants-hungary-eu-fence.jpg ) . 
  you do n't need to push it over . 
  it 's fine for delineating a border , but it wo n't stop a human who wants to cross . 
  whether-or-not adopting that policy is a good idea , willingness to revise one 's opinions in the face of new evidence is not a flaw . 
   [ the jamestown foundation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_jamestown_foundation ) is a washington , d.c.-based institute for research and analysis , founded in 1984 as a platform to support soviet defectors . 
  not saying that they 're wrong about said influence , but it 's worth noting that the source probably trusts russia about as far as it can throw it : they 're probably going to provide a critical view . 
  sounds like the plastic surgeon lobby is mighty indeed !, 
   what the hell ? 
  i knew podemos was a bit extreme , but this almost borders on treason would n't be the first . 
  the founding fathers in the us worked with france , knowing that france wanted to destabilize the british empire . 
  lenin did n't object to germany taking him to russia in the sealed train during world war i , knowing that the intent was to destabilize russia .

  if you were italy and greece , what would you do differently ? 
  i think that they 've acted fairly-reasonably . 
  italy tried returning some people to libya and the european court of human rights [ fined them ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/court-fines-italy-for-deporting-migrants-to-libya/a-15761455 ) . 
  what are they expected to do , keep soaking up fines ? 
  take the entire quantity of migrants that the eu as a whole feels it ca n't handle on themselves ? 
  while i personally think that keeping defense jobs is a silly rationale , he 's probably not talking about keeping the trident missiles without warheads . 
  i assume that he 's talking about doing what the us has done to a handful of her [ * ohio * - class ballistic missile submarines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohio-class_submarine ) : the [ * uss ohio * , * uss michigan * , * uss florida * , and * uss georgia * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ohio-class_submarines ) : refitting them to carry conventional-warhead cruise missiles like tomahawks rather than ballistic missiles . 
  there are a limited number of situations where nuclear ballistic missiles can be used , and rather more where tomahawks can be used . 
  that being said , i 'd have a hard time swallowing unilateral nuclear disarmament . 
  that 'd probably cost permanent unsc status and make the uk reliant on france or the us for a nuclear deterrent . 
   jeremy corbyn has suggested the uk could keep its trident submarine fleet but without carrying nuclear warheads . 
    the labour leader told the andrew marr show that protecting defence jobs was his `` first priority '' and there were `` options '' for doing this while taking a lead in global nuclear `` de-escalation '' . 
  not the most friendly-to-a-flexible-labor-market policies , i must say .
