   turkey is replacing america as enemy # 1 . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   costing 26 $ $ 29.7 . 
  well , this is from 2012 , but [ pew shows everyone polled but greece as having high favorability for germany ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/05/29/chapter-4-views-of-eu-countries-and-leaders/ ) . 
  [ related ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/article/25034/8-countries-fascinating-baby-naming-laws ) :  ** germany **   in germany , you must be able to tell the gender of the child by the first name , and the name chosen must not be negatively affect the well being of the child . 
  also , you can not use last names or the names of objects or products as first names . 
  whether or not your chosen name will be accepted is up to the office of vital statistics , the standesamt , in the area in which the child was born . 
  if the office rejects your proposed baby name , you may appeal the decision . 
  but if you lose , you 'll have to think of a different name . 
  each time you submit a name you pay a fee , so it can get costly . 
  when evaluating names , the standesamt refers to a book which translates to `` the international manual of the first names , '' and they also consult foreign embassies for assistance with non-german names . 
  because of the hassle parents have to go through to name their children , many opt for traditional names such as maximilian , alexander , marie , and sophie . 
    rejected names : matti was rejected for a boy because it did n't indicate gender . 
    approved names : legolas and nemo were approved for baby boys . 
    ** sweden **   enacted in 1982 , the naming law in sweden was originally created to prevent non-noble families from giving their children noble names , but a few changes to the law have been made since then . 
  the part of the law referencing first names reads : `` first names shall not be approved if they can cause offense or can be supposed to cause discomfort for the one using it , or names which for some obvious reason are not suitable as a first name . '', 
  first names must be reported to the tax agency , and they allow multiple first names , but if you later change your name you must keep at least one of the first names that you were originally given , and you can only change your name once . 
  for instance , if you 're named john and want to change it to jack , your new first name will be jack john , keeping the original first name . 
  any further changes must be made through the swedish patent and registration office . 
    rejected names : `` brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116 '' ( pronounced albin , naturally ) was submitted by a child 's parents in protest of the naming law . 
  it was rejected . 
  the parents later submitted `` a '' ( also pronounced albin ) as the child 's name . 
  it , too , was rejected . 
    also rejected : metallica , superman , veranda , ikea , and elvis . 
    accepted names : google as a middle name , lego . 
    ** denmark **   denmark 's very strict law on personal names is in place to protect children from having odd names that suit their parents ' fancy . 
  to do this , parents can choose from a list of only 7,000 pre-approved names , some for girls , some for boys . 
  if you want to name your child something that is n't on the list , you have to get special permission from your local church , and the name is then reviewed by governmental officials . 
  creative spellings of more common names are often rejected . 
  the law states that girls and boys must have names that indicate their gender , you ca n't use a last name as a first name , and unusual names may be rejected . 
  of the approximately 1,100 names that are reviewed each year , 15-20 % of the names are rejected . 
  there are also laws in place to protect rare danish last names . 
    rejected names : anus , pluto , and monkey . 
    approved names : benji , jiminico , molli , and fee . 
    ** iceland **   the iceland naming committee , formed in 1991 , is the group that decides whether a new given name will be acceptable . 
  if parents want to name their child something that is not included on the national register of persons , they can apply for approval and pay a fee . 
  a name has to pass a few tests to be approved . 
  it must only contain letters in the icelandic alphabet , and must fit grammatically with the language . 
  other considerations include whether it will embarrass the child in the future and how well aligned it is with icelandic traditions . 
  it must have a genitive ending or have been previously adopted . 
  also , names should be gender specific , and no one can have more than three personal names . 
    surnames in iceland usually follow an interesting tradition . 
  they are not family names , but are rather patronymic , or occasionally matronymic , with part of a person 's last name including their father 's name . 
  if a father 's name is erik , then his son 's surname would be eriksson ( or erik 's son ) , and his daughter 's surname would be ericsd\u00c3 \u00b3 ttir ( or erik 's daughter ) . 
  [ note : according to one of our icelandic _ flossers , since ` c ' is not an icelandic letter , the correct spelling is ` eir\u00c3kur ' and his offspring would be eir\u00c3ksson / eir\u00c3ksd\u00c3 \u00b3 ttir , e.g. 
  leifur eir\u00c3ksson ] occasionally , there are true family names in iceland , that are passed down to each generation . 
  but they are usually in families originally from other countries , or in families where a family name was adopted at one point . 
    approved name : bambi   rejected names : harriet ( it ca n't be conjugated in icelandic ) and duncan ( there is no c in icelandic . ), 
    ** norway **   you are not allowed to use a first name that is traditionally a last name or a middle name , unless you come from a culture that does n't make that distinction . 
  you 're also not allowed to change your name more than once every ten years . 
  apart from that , parents are not allowed to give a child a name that would be a major inconvenience . 
  but the real fun comes in changing surnames . 
  if you want to change your last name to something more than 200 people have , go for it !, 
  if 200 or fewer have it , you need to ask for permission from everyone with that name . 
    previously rejected names : `` gesher '' was rejected as a boy 's first name to the point where the child 's mother was jailed for refusing to pay the $ 420 fine . 
   south ossetia was ugly and unlawful . 
  however it is ten times less relevant than crimea and even further away from europe . 
  there has to be a point where we stop caring unfortunately or we would constantly be sanctioning a large number of countries . 
  yes , i agree . 
  however , i 'm bringing it up in that you were saying that you believed that there would be no further annexations . 
  my point is that people also felt the same way after south ossetia . 
   which has been a mistake in my opinion . 
  given the benefit of hindsight , i ca n't disagree : there would have been better ways for both the eu and russia to have gone about ukraine . 
  however , it 's also much easier to see things in hindsight . 
   it 's not just merkel . 
  the european leaders are afraid of being pulled into a proxy war . 
  that 's certainly a potential risk , and it would need to be weighed against benefits . 
  it is running a military conflict , however -- ukraine has specifically been asking for anti-tank weapons -- and i suspect that it would also come with military information . 
  south ossetia was in 2008 . 
  donbas/crimea in 2014 . 
  further , the eu ( via barroso ) pressured ukraine to make a choice between the eu and russia , which triggered euromaidan , which triggered the attack by russia ; it 's also a bad precedent , in my eyes , for the eu to accept entering into association with a country to result in that country being attacked . 
  obviously , this is the eu 's backyard , and merkel has been opposed to use of force , and the eu speaks with a pretty loud voice on things in europe . 
  if the eu is dead-set against it , then i have a hard time seeing the us going forward against the eu 's wishes . 
  but the us administration 's position has been that an annexation in europe raises the bar to one where facilitating force is acceptable where other options fail , and i think that i 'd agree with that . 
  edit : mind , i do n't think that other options * have * failed yet . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nasa_missions for good measure : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_projects_of_the_european_space_agency, 
   nobody is going to wager war against russia to ensure that a peninsula irrelevant to europe is going to return to ukraine . 
  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/obama-ukraine-crisis-150209185919308.html that being said , i think that the precedent being set is a bigger concern than the land . 
  i kinda doubt that . 
  the candidates are politicking right now -- they wo n't be making their political statements based on conversations with the bureaucracy yet . 
   but it is in nobody 's interest to keep sanctioning over this topic forever there is two important milestones that i can think of . 
  the one is the return of crimea . 
  i think that this is achievable and should be the goal . 
  the us was willing to start moving weapons in if that was required and non-violent efforts were not successful , and merkel referred to `` other options '' , which may include other non-military options . 
  if germany truly and honestly does not want that -- and i think that it would contribute to the eu 's credibility in future international dealings -- a second milestone ( not very interesting for ukraine , but interesting for establishing a credible reputation for future situations ) would be making sure that russia , as a country , regrets having annexed crimea -- that having done so was not worth the cost . 
  the us did this to cuba -- the sum of the lost trade , in the end , exceeded the value of the seized property . 
  discourages the next island over from confiscating a lot of property . 
  either case involves pain . 
  less painful than world war iii , but pain . 
  the phrase is `` losing face '' rather than `` losing his face '' . 
  in [ that sense ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lose_face ) , `` face '' acts like a [ mass noun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_noun ) . 
  competition * does * seem to generate support for things . 
  also , i think that the eu could use some sort of eu-wide thing to cheer about , something to have on tv sets with a big eu flag up . 
  sports does n't really do it , because the eu is so big that there would n't be many teams if teams represented the whole eu . 
  but space accomplishments would be different . 
  also , it 's something that 's easier for the eu as a whole to do . 
  politically , space achievements were clearly powerful in the past . 
  the downside from my standpoint is that i dunno if team cheering might tend to produce a us-eu rah-rah-rah wedge in the public ... but , eh , acceptable risk in my view . 
  also might decrease cooperation on prestige projects . 
  also , if you want more funding for space travel , this might be a good way to do that .
