  the last time [ nasa got gobs of funding was when we were in a dick-waving war with the soviet union ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/feb/01/nasa-budgets-us-spending-space-travel ) . 
  dunno how well this works with the privatization of space travel -- easier if it 's a publicly-owned rocket and astronauts and program going up , i think , for the public to identify with .

  is there something about `` pre-crisis '' that should be considered the norm rather than a bubble that was generated ? 
  it dun be busted ? 
  it 's part of the united states , at least in us parlance . 
  it 's an incorporated territory rather than a state , and i do n't know how that maps to the uk and her concept of overseas territories , though . 
   yes , what other options are there ? 
  gender-segregated swimming pools . 
  closing the swimming pool entirely . 
  adding cctv and imposing penalties for harassment . 
  not saying that these are preferable , just that there are multiple options . 
  one reason i could plausibly think that you might want to attack a bit after is to survey the impact of the first attack after the dust has cleared . 
  i 'd believe that rescue workers say and feel that they 're being targeted , but they 've also no way to see inside the planning rooms or the heads of the pilots bombing them , and i 've noticed a tendency in past friendly-fire ( or attacks that hit neutrals ) to believe that people are intentionally-being targeted . 
  the us has had bombs hit hospitals and red cross locations , embassies and friendly soldiers . 
  us forces that have been hit by friendly fire have [ blamed the attacker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_liberty_incident ) or even their own leaders as having intended the attack . 
  i believe that there 's a tendency to believe that attackers have a clearer picture of what 's going on and more-intent to cause the specific effects than they actually do . 
  that is n't saying that russia * is n't * trying to hit rescue workers , but that i do n't think , as hammond stated :  if you go back for a second strike you know what you are doing . 
  ... that that alone is sufficient to conclude that russia is intentionally hitting rescuers . 
  oooh , sweet . 
  we should open up immigration slots for european jews . 
  best-educated ethnic group in the us today , quite successful . 
  the folks i know who have immigrated from europe tend to speak english better than monolingual people born in the us . 
  some errors , like using adjectives in place of adverbs , seem to be quite common here , but i 've never heard it from ( the admittedly well-educated ) people who have come over from romania , greece , italy , etc. 
  i never thought about that . 
  `` good morning '' : greeting `` good day '' : farewell `` good afternoon '' : greeting `` good night '' : farewell that 's kind of confusing , actually . 
  i ca n't understand [ all of the 98 % that speak english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahhlmhchlru&amp;t=10s ) . 
  it is the official language of some states , though . 
  also , spanish is one of the official languages of [ puerto rico ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rico ) . 
   warren described the fight as `` a first world war-style situation . '' that 's not a phrase i thought that i 'd hear again . 
   surely facebook is one of the harder targets to prosecute , it being a massive multibillion dollar corporation with almost limitless money for legal proceedings . 
  disagree . 
  if germany wanted to , it could order german isps to simply block facebook . 
  if facebook does business in germany , it 's got ta conform to german law there . 
  the police are trained in not escalating situations . 
  i do n't see why the military would do a better job here . 
   so it is working very well , by simply giving denmark a bad reputation amongst refugees . . that does n't seem like a long-term solution . 
  that works ... as long as there 's a more-appealing neighbor nearby that people can be shunted to . 
  but i do n't think that europe can wipe out its image as a nice place to be as a whole . 
  people are n't * stupid * -- they 'd rather be in germany than in eritrea . 
  whatever is done in the long term probably ca n't be a [ beggar-thy-neighbor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beggar_thy_neighbour ) solution . 
   not to mention whole of this chaos will assure brexit more realistic . 
  britain exiting the eu does n't really seem like a long-term solution to illegal immigration to me . 
  if france honestly becomes overrun by people who want to get into the uk , all they need is a small boat willing to cross the english channel , which i 'm sure is already happening . 
  i 'd say that even if merkel had spoken as harshly as possible , you 'd still have hit the same issue -- maybe ten , twenty , thirty years down the road , but you 'd still have an increasingly-wealthy europe , an africa with a growing population and decreasing ability to support that population , and an ever-easier-to-traverse mediterranean . 
  maybe she inadvertently accelerated things earlier than would have been the case , but i do n't really think that she was a fundamental cause . 
   close the external border . 
  that 's only the first step , though . 
  there 's necessarily one more step to that . 
  if you close the external border -- and by this , i assume that you 're mostly talking about the waters off greece -- you need to do something with the people you intercept . 
  you could let them in , could shoot 'em , could pay off some country to hotel them , could try and guess where they 're from and force them on a country that will not accept them , or put 'em back into a dictatorship or war zone . 
  and you have to be able to sell the population of europe on doing one of those things . 
  maybe there are some other solutions -- i dunno . 
  i 'm just saying that it 's not the first step that is the difficult bit , and if that was the only barrier to overcome , there would n't be a migrant crisis right now . 
  it 's the second step that poses difficult questions . 
  yup , but the reason it does n't have people there now is because there 's no economy for people to go to . 
  no water or topsoil to support agriculture , even assuming that people were willing to settle for living in a much poorer place than europe . 
  in fact , [ things are n't looking really good for topsoil in africa in general ] ( http://mgafrica.com/article/2015-01-08-2015-is-the-year-of-soil-10-reasons-why-every-african-should-care ) , across-the-board :  the most productive ( fertile ) part of the soil is only a couple of centimetres thick , this is usually the part that is eroded first . 
  2.5 cm of topsoil takes between 500 - 1000 years to form . 
  [ snip ]  half of the topsoil on the planet has been lost in the last 150 years . 
  in africa , soil erosion has reduced africa 's grain harvest by 8 million tons , or roughly 8 % . 
  this is projected to double to 16 million tons by 2020 if soil erosion is not reduced . 
  ethiopia alone loses one billion tonnes of topsoil every year . 
  [ snip ]  population pressure is going to exacerbate this issue as more and more marginal soils are put into cultivation ; current trends predict that almost 2 billion babies will be born in africa in the next 35 years . 
  [ snip ]  african farmers have traditionally cleared land , grown a few crops and then moved on to clear more land . 
  this results in `` nutrient mining '' which affects 95 million of africa 's 220 million hectares of farmland , losing at least 30kg of nutrients per hectare ( ha ) every year . 
  these losses , combined with soil erosion , have led to soil degradation and now more than 80 % of africa 's soils having chemical or physical limitations that impede crop production . 
  the highest rates of nutrient depletion -- more than 60 kg/ha yearly -- are in guinea , the democratic republic of the congo , angola , rwanda , burundi and uganda . 
  the impact has been a declining trend of per capita food production in africa over the past 40 years . 
    the rate of deforestation in africa is accelerating - in just ten years , 9 % of forest cover was lost across sub-saharan africa . 
  slash and burn agriculture ( putting down areas of forest and moving to other areas ) was actually sustainable in the past but is not anymore due to population pressures . 
  the main threat however is charcoal production - in africa 90 % of wood consumed is used for wood fuel and charcoal . 
  in central africa alone between 1990 - 2000 , approximately 91,000 km2 was lost to deforestation . 
  as seen in the image below , without tree roots to anchor soil and with increased exposure to sun , soil can dry out , leading to problems like increased flooding and inability to farm . 
  [ snip ]  overgrazing is responsible for about half of the soil degradation in africa   overgrazing leaves soils bare of vegetation , at the mercy of the elements , it also compacts the soil , inhibiting water infiltration in the ground - meaning water runs off on the surface and does not recharge groundwater . 
  combine a decreasing ability to produce food in africa with an increasing population , and ability to relocate people to africa becomes even-more difficult -- people are going to be wanting to be leaving these places in africa for places like europe in the future , not wanting to accept more people . 
  we managed to [ stave this off for the last 80 years or so with technological advances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_revolution ) , but unless someone comes up with better fixes , there 's trouble in the future . 
  well , canada has the atlantic or pacific oceans between it and the non-american poorer portions of the world , and the us between it and latin america . 
  that 's probably going to be hard to reproduce , dutch hydroengineering or no . 
  australia uses the [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) , which is a possibility ... but the size of their peak illegal immigrant detainee population is also about 1 % the present numbers in europe . 
  i do n't know how many hard-to-leave island nations in the world willing to accept detainee camps there are . 
  certainly it would drive the market price of `` hotel '' slots in island nation camps up , at any rate . 
  scale might also be an issue . 
  for example , [ nauru ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nauru ) has only 10k people and made money from australia by [ accepting camps equal to a ( currently ) 6 % increase in their population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nauru_regional_processing_centre ) , some six hundred people . 
  the peak number of [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) illegal immigrants that australia [ ever had to deal with at one time in detention was ~ 14k ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:immidetentionpop2014-12.png ) . 
  europe is presently dealing with numbers one hundred times larger . 
  that 's not to say that it could not be done -- but the scale of the problem is a bit different . 
  if there are large flows of illegal immigrants into the eu , it 's certainly a problem for the eu in that sense . 
  furthermore , it 's a reasonable expectation , unless all of africa and the middle east suddenly stop having dictators and conflicts and poverty and population growth in excess of the land 's carrying capacity and other issues in the future , that illegal immigration will be an ongoing issue in the future . 
  so whether it 's integration or managing to distribute people elsewhere in the world or producing a viable economic alternative elsewhere or making a society where it 's impractical to work illegally or simply continuing with the * status quo * , some sort of action will need to be taken . 
   once leading proponents of democracy and freedom , disillusioned former members of the soviet bloc are returning to authoritarian rule . 
  [ snip ]  jaroslaw kaczynski , the law and justice party leader , and former prime minister , drives the government 's agenda with a steady purpose : to fashion poland into a state guided by catholicism , free from foreign influence -- whether from the western european states , or from russia . 
  rejecting as much of modern liberalism and western european influence as possible . 
  i do n't know much about kaczynski or orban or zeman , but i doubt that any of the three could reasonably be presented as being comparable to the soviet era . 
  and describing europe as `` the presently fading continent '' sounds kinda apocalyptic to me . 
   these camps should be finances by un , not just eu . 
  the un coordinates government actions and funding -- it is n't a magic well of money . 
  aside from maybe pulling in more money from the us or japan , [ you 're looking at pretty much the same thing ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c1a.html ) , as europe is a major source of funds for the un .
