   unhcr is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions , with 86 per cent coming from governments and the european union . 
  six per cent comes from other inter-governmental organizations and pooled funding mechanisms , while a further six per cent is from the private sector , including foundations , corporations and the general public . 
  in addition , the agency receives a limited subsidy ( 2 per cent ) from the un regular budget for administrative costs , and accepts in-kind contributions , including items such as tents , medicines , trucks and air transport . 
    unhcr was launched on a shoestring annual budget of us$ 300,000 in 1950 . 
  as its work and size have grown , the refugee agency 's expenditure has soared . 
  its annual budget rose to more than us$ 1 billion in the early 1990s and reached a record us$ 4.3 billion in 2012 , compared to us$ 1.8 billion in 2008 . 
    a new annual high of us$ 5.3 billion had been reached by the end of june 2013 , including almost us$ 4 billion for the annual budget and us$ 1.3 billion for supplementary appeals . 
  unhcr 's yearly budget includes annual programmes - supporting continuing regular operations - and supplementary programmes to cover emergencies such as the syria crisis or large-scale repatriation operations . 
    the top five donors in 2012 were the united states , japan , the european commission , sweden and the netherlands .

  europe was the largest single unhcr contributor for 2012 -- combined with the us , that 's over 75 % of the unhcr 's budget . 
  i 'm also guessing that japan , which has fertility and demographic and economic problems worse than europe 's , is n't going to be able to do as much in the future . 
  there are n't any other police or firefighters you can call to solve things in the international world -- you 're a pretty substantial chunk of the small group that * gets * called when things are on fire . 
  well , i mean , they do if they 're to be used to extrapolate how many people are actually getting through illegally . 
  else you run the risk that someone can figure out the pattern and avoid it , and then you 'd get artificially-low numbers . 
  i kind of wish that someone would make a 2d graph with countries that are more-or-less bidirectionally friendly placed near each other . 
  there are [ algorithms to do this sort of thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/force-directed_graph_drawing ) . 
   the head of the district ( peter dreier ) asked them and they volunteered/didn \u00b4 t object . 
  one does wonder if they speak german . 
  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dick&amp;allowed_in_frame=0  `` fellow , lad , man , '' 1550s , rhyming nickname for rick , short for richard , one of the commonest english names , it has long been a synonym for `` fellow , '' and so most of the slang senses are probably very old , but naturally hard to find in the surviving records . 
  the meaning `` penis '' is attested from 1891 in farmer 's slang dictionary ( possibly british army slang ) . 
  meaning `` detective '' is recorded from 1908 , perhaps as a shortened variant of detective . 
   your country will be fine , it 's croatia that might end up in a bad spot .

  the actual set of complaints he wrote is linked in the article and [ i 'll link here -- i think that that 's probably more-interesting than the summary that was submitted ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12098372/chris-grayling-calls-eu-disastrous-for-britain-in-clearest-signal-yet-he-plans-to-back-leave.html ) :  i was 10 years old on january 1 1973 when britain joined the common market . 
  i was n't old enough to understand all the nuances , but i did know that we were supposed to be joining something that would make it easier for us to sell and buy things in europe . 
    i was a student in the eighties when people started to talk about the single market . 
  why , it was said , would we ask manufacturers to make umpteen different varieties of lawnmowers to sell in different european countries ? 
  it seemed obviously easier to accept that we should have a single standard for lawnmowers across the common market , to make it easier to do business across borders . 
    but somewhere along the road everything changed . 
  instead of a common market , we had a european union . 
  instead of sensible rules to encourage trade , we had european laws telling us how many hours we could work , or how to manage our countryside . 
    and then the talk turned towards creating an economic union , and then a political one . 
  the rights of the `` european citizen '' became a mantra in brussels . 
  every problem that affected the continent was greeted with a cry for `` more europe '' . 
  along came a european single currency , a european system of justice and home affairs -- even serious talk of a european army . 
    the problem was made much worse by tony blair and gordon brown 's decision to sign up to the lisbon treaty and the charter of fundamental rights , without even giving the country the referendum they had promised us . 
  those two vaguely worded documents gave much freer rein to the concept of `` ever closer union '' -- giving the eu more and more scope to involve itself in matters that were once the preserve of national governments . 
    what 's more , when there is a dispute over the meaning of a part of the treaty , it 's for the european court of justice to decide what is right and what is wrong . 
  all too often , it 's `` more europe '' that wins the day . 
    and so we have reached what i believe is a crucial crossroads for the united kingdom . 
  the crisis in the eurozone and the migration challenge have led to calls for still more integration and a move towards much greater political union . 
  it is a path that the uk will not and should not follow . 
    we are a sovereign nation . 
  but thanks to changes to the lisbon treaty , countries like ours can now be outvoted every time by members of the eurozone on new european laws . 
  we can not be left in a position where we have no ability to defend our national interest . 
  nor can we simply accept endless migration from across europe with no ability to slow or stop the resulting growth in our population . 
    most people in westminster know that i hold strong eurosceptic views . 
  it is time for britain to vote again on its future in europe . 
  but i also strongly believe that david cameron is right to seek new terms for our membership before that vote happens . 
    i am someone who believes that simply staying in the eu with our current terms of membership unchanged would be disastrous for britain . 
  that 's why i have always believed that it is imperative that his renegotiation takes place and delivers as much potential change as possible . 
  it is in the interests of all eurosceptics and of our country . 
  i want britain to choose between a changed relationship and leaving , and not between the current situation and leaving . 
    in a few weeks ' time that renegotiation will almost certainly reach a resolution . 
  we will know then how far other eu states are willing to go to meet the prime minister 's demands for change and how much difference that renegotiation can make . 
  the cabinet will decide the government 's formal position -- but the prime minister has also made it clear that each of us in ministerial office will be free to campaign for the future we ourselves believe is best for the country . 
  it 's a sensible decision , and one that all parties should adopt . 
    and then the debate will begin properly . 
  it will be a defining period for our country . 
  there will be strong arguments made for leaving , as well as those who will argue that we should stay . 
  many of us who are normally political rivals will line up to make the same arguments . 
  i think people will respect our democracy the more because of that . 
    for us as conservatives , there will also be an intense debate . 
  there will be conservative politicians and members on both sides of the argument . 
  there are strongly held and differing views from the cabinet room downwards . 
    but we must also remember our duty to the country . 
  we are the government . 
  we are delivering crucial changes to help secure all of our futures . 
  we have to continue the work of putting our economy on to a secure footing . 
  we have to work to protect the nation 's security . 
  we have to continue to strive to improve opportunities for people across our society . 
  we must not allow the european debate that we will have in the coming months to halt the other good work we are doing for britain . 
    so we need to continue to act as a team , and to debate the europe issue in a grown-up and mature way . 
  regardless of our views on the eu , we need to be supportive of the prime minister and the broader work he is doing as the head of this government . 
  the idea that a vote for leave means he has to go is simply wrong -- and no more logical than suggesting that a vote to remain would mean all eurosceptics had to quit . 
    as conservatives on different sides of the argument , we need to treat each other 's views with respect and good grace . 
  we need to remain friends and colleagues . 
  the country will expect no less of us . 
  it wants grown-up politics , with authenticity , honesty and decency . 
  we need to make sure that is what we deliver . 
    we must also remember the alternative . 
  britain today has the most left-wing and extreme opposition that i have known in my lifetime . 
  we can not and must not let them anywhere near power . 
    and so , as we debate the issue of britain 's future in the eu , we must also remember that above all we are a conservative team . 
  we will all argue our case vigorously . 
  but when the referendum is over , we must reunite and work together as a team to make absolutely sure that we win the next election in 2020 . 
  this country deserves no less . 
  the immediate question : what policy will replace it ? 
  i guess by extrapolating by the number of `` passport violating '' hits , if taken randomly , they can get an approximation of how many people are getting by , even if the random checks are n't common enough to act as a deterrent . 
   the mcdonalds case is taken out of context very often https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liebeck_v._mcdonald's_restaurants i disagree with people who try to treat that lawsuit as reasonable : i 'd call it pretty indefensible . 
  i agree that pointing out that there was a reduction is valid , but all the arguments about fault are absurd : everyone else serves their coffee in comparable ways and it had no impact on mcdonalds business practices -- they shrugged it off as `` crazy jury , cost of doing business '' and just factored it into their pricing . 
  do they have standing ? 
  it 's not clear to me that they are harmed , unless their governments are penalizing them for ownership of the vehicles . 
   first , cyber spies start by gathering information about the target via sources like social media , public websites and internal phone directories . 
    second , they choose a few employees to whom they send emails which include a link to an apparently interesting website , which appears to be connected somehow to the targets everyday life or area of specialization . 
  the hackers have however embedded malware in the site concerned . 
    third , when the employee visits the site , the malware ends up on his or her computer .
