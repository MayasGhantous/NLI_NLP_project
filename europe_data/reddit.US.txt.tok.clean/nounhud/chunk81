  it 's kinda too bad that we do n't have more-general defenses against this sort of thing . 
   that and obviously the influence that the uk has globally is n't magnified by being part of the eu hmm . 
  i was reading [ this brexit analysis yesterday ] ( https://dgap.org/de/article/getfullpdf/25764 ) . 
  the authors take the general position that a brexit would tend to weaken the international influence of both the eu ( one of the two major eu members that involves itself internationally would be out ) and the uk . 
   this reminds me of someone [ lots of someones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_book-burning_incidents ) !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_atheism  studies on the demographics of atheism have concluded that self-identified atheists comprise anywhere from 2 % to 13 % of the world 's population , whereas people without a religion comprise anywhere from 10 % to 22 % of the world 's population . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] several polls have been conducted by gallup international : in their 2012 poll of 57 countries , 13 % of respondents were `` convinced atheists '' and in their 2015 poll of 65 countries 11 % were `` convinced atheists '' . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] in scandinavia , the netherlands and east asia , and particularly in china , atheists and the nonreligious are the majority . 
  [ 5 ] ... according to pew research center 's 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories , 16 % of the world 's population is not affiliated with a religion , while 84 % are affiliated . 
  awww , that 's nice of you . 
  but , seriously ... i thought that you and the uk had a lot of common interests too ? 
  i was just reading an article about brexit , and it was talking about how poland has a strong interest in the uk staying in because the uk advances a lot of things that poland also wants . 
  [ this week , the road crossing canada split , splitting the country into two road systems ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/nipigon-river-bridge-closed-transcanada-1.3397831 ) . 
  canadians are just coming through the us until it can be fixed . 
   i do n't think that most people from any given country actually wants strangers to breathe on their necks . 
  i think that there 's more to it than that . 
  standing way back in some cultures is seen as cold and unfriendly . 
  talking to an italian friend , even trying to adjust for the difference , is definitely a bit disconcerting for me . 
  when he grew up in italy , i guess it was rude not to make some contact when speaking to someone in a friendly fashion -- putting a hand on a shoulder or something like that when thanking someone or being friendly or speaking earnestly is normal , and not doing so would indicate that you are being a bit standoffish . 
  on the other hand , where i grew up in the us , something beyond a handshake or possibly a momentary backslap with a friend or a hug with a relative is seen as something decidedly intimate , even sexual , and it 's very distracting . 
  the body language really does differ . 
  are you serious or pulling my leg ? 
  i could n't just go buy 10 kg of fertilizer in denmark without a permit ? 
  [ not true !, 
  ] ( http://www.snopes.com/muslims-in-japan/ ), 
  to be fair , soldiers are pretty hard to attack . 
  we 've pretty much figured out how to keep our soldiers from being killed by the bad guys . 
  look at the [ coalition combat casualties as a whole for all of the conflicts involved with isil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_intervention_against_isil ) . 
  outside of the kurds , egyptians , and military forces native to the lands that are attacked , if you just consider foreign military forces that have been shipped in : * 101 chadian soldiers * 48 nigerian * 35 iranian * 6 cameroonian * 4 nigerien * 3 saudis * 2 russian * 1 canadian * 1 turk * 1 jordanian * 1 american those are n't very favorable numbers if you want to fight a stand-up , knock-down fight against military . 
  you 're going to be wiped out and do very little damage in return . 
  on the other hand , civilians likely are n't armed , are n't expecting an attack , and it 's tough to truly secure a whole country . 
  intelligence agencies can only go so far and ( particularly in europe ) border security has had difficulties . 
  the twin stripper factories of pastafarian heaven and pastafarian hell have apparently caused some friction and theological debate :  q : are there male strippers in fsm heaven for women ?

   is that going to be a thing ? 
  [ beats me ] ( http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-does-puerto-rico-really-want-to-be-51st-state.html ) . 
  also , it looks like they * have n't * requested it -- they have had polls in favor , and they 've had federal funds allocated for a referendum , but no successful referendum has gone through yet . 
  i 'm guessing that you 're referring to the uk , but in the us , canada ( apparently a larger personal distance ) is normally what people mean when they use `` the 51st state '' , and the currently-actually-requesting-to-be-the-51st-state puerto rico is apparently a smaller personal space . 
  unleash a single italian in a crowd of finns with a drone above to record the fascinating patterns . 
  those measurements are for the us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proxemics  personal space is highly variable , and can be due to cultural differences and personal experiences . 
  the united states shows considerable similarities to that in northern and central european regions , such as germany , the benelux , scandinavia and the united kingdom . 
  the main difference is that residents of the united states of america like to keep more open space between themselves and their conversation partners ( roughly 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) compared to 2 to 3 feet ( 0.6 -- 0.9 m ) in europe ) . 
  [ 10 ] greeting rituals tend to be the same in these regions and in the united states , consisting of minimal body contact which often remains confined to a simple handshake . 
    those living in a densely populated places tend to have a lower expectation of personal space . 
  residents of india or japan tend to have a smaller personal space than those in the mongolian steppe , both in regard to home and individual spaces . 
  difficulties can be created by failures of intercultural communication due to different expectations of personal space .

  i 'm not sure that referring to ammonia and nitrous oxide as `` nitrogen emissions '' is a great idea .

  i saw the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patria_pasi ) with an image of the xa-185 and dismissed it when i saw the image because it lacks the horizontal band , but looking at [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43_zo3yk8uy ) , the xa-188 has it .

  lotta gattaca-style questions about the future structure of society to figure out down the road , though . 
  the cv90 is tracked . 
  they put ice chains on the stryker to give it enough traction . 
  edit : actually , there are at least three ifvs in that shot , not just a cv90 and a stryker . 
  whatever they show at the very beginning is a six-wheeled piece of light armor of some sort , and thus not a stryker . 
  the eight-wheeled stryker is visible at 6:25 ( also with ice chains ) . 
  edit2 : beats me what it is . 
  the straight vertical band between the top and bottom angled sides appears to be unusual on ifvs . 
  [ in nations with significant muslim populations , much disdain for isis ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/17/in-nations-with-significant-muslim-populations-much-disdain-for-isis/ ), 
  a similar argument to the one that / u/truuy made was also made [ here ] ( http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/us-china-war-asia-could-america-win-by-blockade-11733 ) . 
   having concluded that the potential threat of oil blockade is serious , i then investigated the effectiveness of china 's counterstrategies to such hypothetical threat . 
  i classify china 's counterstrategies to a us oil blockade into two categories : vulnerability-reduction strategies aiming at the protection of oil supply ; and conflict-prevention strategies aiming at the avoidance of us blockade via the prevention of conflict with the us . 
    the two most discussed vulnerability-reduction strategies are the development of the pla navy to safeguard the seaborne oil imports and the construction of overland oil pipelines . 
  but because of the large volume of china 's oil imports , and the distance between china and the oil producers in the middle east , naval convoys would hardly be practical as a means for ensuring secure supply . 
  a hundred-ship oil convoy , either during its 35-day trip , or during its fuelling and refueling , is an easy target for air/missile/submarine attack . 
  likewise , thousand-mile pipelines connecting china with russia and kazakhstan could be cut off by a single air strike . 
  the protection of pipelines is virtually impossible . 
  and complex oil refineries -- difficult to rebuild -- could also be targeted . 
  thus , i conclude that vulnerability-reduction approaches are costly and largely ineffective . 
  i really do n't think that the personal attack in your response should have shown up . 
  / u/truuy 's response was polite , and you responded with a lot of venom . 
  my general experience has been that people who open up flamethrowers in a response are often unsure of and concerned about having their own arguments examined and hope to scare off the other poster . 
  some would say that artillery in general is outdated , and that producing new artillery would n't be a good buy . 
  [ artillery : the end of history for the big guns ] ( https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htart/articles/20150416.aspx )  in the 1990s it became obvious that smart bombs ( jdam ) first used in the 1991 gulf war , were more effective than artillery and that led to a major shift away from using artillery . 
  there are no peoples in europe that have not both wronged and been wronged at some point in the past . 
  if you go digging , you 'll find untold piles of bones in everyone 's backyard . 
  or alternatively , maybe that seal is just lazy and would like to take advantage of a conveniently-chainsawed hole , instead of having to scratch a new one . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_united_kingdom#core_theory  however , the status of the regency acts is not so clear . 
  in them , a regent acting during the infancy , incapacitation or absence of the monarch can assent to bills but can not do so if they relate to changing the nature of monarchical inheritance or amending the protestant religion and presbyterian church act 1707 , which protected that church in scotland . 
  [ 14 ] if a regent did assent to a bill of these kinds , it may not be held to be a valid law even if it gainied the approval of both houses and royal assent . 
   the documents show that leaders of the european movement and others who played a key role in the creation of european community were treated as hired hands in washington 's cold war strategy , receiving half their budget from the us . 
  the eu has always been an american project , even if it later slipped us control . 
    america prefers to deal with a unified europe as a matter of convenience and its anti-brexit rhetoric should be taken with a pinch of salt . 
  i 'm kinda dubious about a rationale of `` convenience '' . 
  i have n't read anything about the matter , but it seems to me that a more-plausible rationale would be that a fragmented europe would make it easier for the ussr to play off countries against each other -- particularly starting with promoting communism in poorer countries -- and that a unified europe would be a tougher nut to crack . 
  it would be more-likely to trade within members , [ one of the major elements that the us promoted in europe during the marshall plan to develop europe 's economic strength ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan#development_and_deployment ) . 
   whether the eurozone can ever be made to work , or whether it is a doomsday machine well , obviously it * can * be made to work -- there 's nothing magical about two countries in europe that means that they can not share currency in the way that two regions in any country do . 
  it may or may not be desirable , but ... 
   full-on conflict with the us that 's odd , since both the us and the eu have explicitly said that they 're interested in dealing with the ukraine situation economically rather than militarily . 
  edit : well , i guess they [ did suggest going further at one point ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/02/09/german-chancellor-merkel-visit-obama/23115859/ ) , without any specifics :  at a joint press conference following their morning meeting in the oval office , obama said he was `` very encouraged about the extent to which we 've been able to maintain u.s.-european unity on this issue . '', 
    `` we are in absolute agreement that the 21st century can not have us stand idle and allow the borders of europe to be redrawn by the barrel of a gun , '' obama said . 
  but then he also suggested that there may be `` tactical disagreements '' about what happens if diplomatic efforts fail . 
    those disagreements stem from the possibility of military aid to ukraine to fend off pro-russian separatists . 
  `` the possibility of lethal defensive weapons is one of those options that 's being examined , '' obama said .
