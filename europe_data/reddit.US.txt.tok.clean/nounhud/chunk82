  merkel opposes that course . 
    both obama and merkel said no decision has been made about military options . 
    `` i 've always said i do n't see a military solution in this conflict , but we have to put all our efforts behind a diplomatic solution , '' merkel said , speaking in german . 
  `` but if , at a certain point in time , one has to say that a success is not possible , even if one puts every effort into it , then the united states and europe have to sit together and try and explore further possibilities , what one can do . '',

  edit : okay , mid-2024 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_france a big chunk of this was tied to the fact that christianity , for a long time , prohibited charging someone interest on debt ( '' [ usury ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usury ) '' , which today refers only to the charging of * high * interest rates on debt ) . 
  jews were not so-prohibited , so they entered the ultimately-rather-lucrative field of finance , and some of what can be described as `` jews '' in the middle ages could be somewhat thought of as `` bankers '' today , along with some of the same popular stigma . 
   the first crusade led to nearly a century of accusations ( blood libel ) against the jews , many of whom were burned or attacked in france . 
  immediately after the coronation of philip augustus on 14 march 1181 , the king ordered the jews arrested on a saturday , in all their synagogues , and despoiled of their money and their investments . 
  in the following april 1182 , he published an edict of expulsion , but according the jews a delay of three months for the sale of their personal property . 
  immovable property , however , such as houses , fields , vines , barns , and wine-presses , he confiscated . 
  the jews attempted to win over the nobles to their side , but in vain . 
  in july they were compelled to leave the royal domains of france ( and not the whole kingdom ) ; their synagogues were converted into churches . 
  these successive measures were simply expedients to fill the royal coffers . 
  the goods confiscated by the king were at once converted into cash . 
  [ snip ]  the practice of `` retention treaties '' spread throughout france after 1198 . 
  lords intending to impose a heavy tax ( captio , literally `` capture '' ) on jews living in their lordship ( dominium ) signed treaties with their neighbours , whereby the latter refused to permit the former 's jews entry into his domains , thus `` retaining '' them for the lord to tax . 
  this practice arose in response to the common flight of jews in the face of a captio to a different dominium , where they purchased the right to settle unmolested by gifts ( bribes ) to their new lord . 
  [ snip ]  although he declared that from 8 november 1223 , the interest on jews ' debts should no longer hold good , he at the same time ordered that the capital should be repaid to the jews in three years and that the debts due the jews should be inscribed and placed under the control of their lords . 
  the lords then collected the debts for the jews , doubtless receiving a commission . 
  louis furthermore ordered that the special seal for jewish deeds should be abolished and replaced by the ordinary one . 
  [ snip ]  in 1234 , louis freed his subjects from a third of their registered debts to jews ( including those who had already paid their debts ) , but debtors had to pay the remaining two-thirds within a specified time . 
  it was also forbidden to imprison christians or to sell their real estate to recover debts owed to jews . 
  the king wished in this way to strike a deadly blow at usury . 
  [ snip ]  later , after having discussed the subject with his son-in-law , thibaut , king of navarre and count of champagne , louis decided on 13 september 1268 to arrest jews and seize their property . 
  but an order which followed close upon this last ( 1269 ) shows that on this occasion also louis reconsidered the matter . 
  nevertheless , at the request of paul christian ( pablo christiani ) , he compelled the jews , under penalty of a fine , to wear at all times the rouelle or badge decreed by the fourth lateran council in 1215 . 
  this consisted of a piece of red felt or cloth cut in the form of a wheel , four fingers in circumference , which had to be attached to the outer garment at the chest and back . 
  [ snip ]  in march 1273 , gregory x formulated the following rules : relapsed jews , as well as christians who abjured their faith in favor of `` the jewish superstition '' , were to be treated by the inquisitors as heretics . 
  the instigators of such apostasies , as those who received or defended the guilty ones , were to be punished in the same way as the delinquents . 
    in accordance with these rules , the jews of toulouse , who had buried a christian convert in their cemetery , were brought before the inquisition in 1278 for trial , with their rabbi , isaac males , being condemned to the stake . 
  [ snip ]  toward the middle of 1306 the treasury was nearly empty , and the king , as he was about to do the following year in the case of the templars , condemned the jews to banishment , and took forcible possession of their property , real and personal . 
  their houses , lands , and movable goods were sold at auction ; and for the king were reserved any treasures found buried in the dwellings that had belonged to the jews . 
  that philip the fair intended merely to fill the gap in his treasury , and was not at all concerned about the well-being of his subjects , is shown by the fact that he put himself in the place of the jewish moneylenders and exacted from their christian debtors the payment of their debts , which they themselves had to declare . 
  furthermore , three months before the sale of the property of the jews the king took measures to ensure that this event should be coincident with the prohibition of clipped money , in order that those who purchased the goods should have to pay in undebased coin . 
  finally , fearing that the jews might have hidden some of their treasures , he declared that one-fifth of any amount found should be paid to the discoverer . 
  it was on 22 july , the day after tisha b'av , a jewish fast day , that the jews were arrested . 
  in prison they received notice that they had been sentenced to exile ; that , abandoning their goods and debts , and taking only the clothes which they had on their backs and the sum of 12 sous tournois each , they would have to quit the kingdom within one month . 
  [ snip ]  nine years had hardly passed since the expulsion of 1306 when louis x of france ( 1314 -- 16 ) recalled the jews . 
  in an edict dated 28 july 1315 , he permitted them to return for a period of twelve years , authorizing them to establish themselves in the cities in which they had lived before their banishment . 
  he issued this edict in answer to the demands of the people . 
  geoffrey of paris , the popular poet of the time , says in fact that the jews were gentle in comparison with the christians who had taken their place , and who had flayed their debtors alive ; if the jews had remained , the country would have been happier ; for there were no longer any moneylenders at all ( bouquet , xxii . 
  the king probably had the interests of his treasury also in view . 
  the profits of the former confiscations had gone into the treasury , and by recalling the jews for only twelve years he would have an opportunity for ransoming them at the end of this period . 
  it appears that they gave the sum of 122,500 livres for the privilege of returning . 
  [ snip ]  on 17 september 1394 , charles vi suddenly published an ordinance in which he declared , in substance , that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors which the jews committed against christians ; and that the prosecutors , having made several investigations , had discovered many violations by the jews of the agreement they had made with him . 
  therefore , he decreed as an irrevocable law and statute that thenceforth no jew should dwell in his domains ( `` ordonnances '' , vii . 
  [ snip ]  in the beginning of the 17th century jews began again to re-enter france . 
  this resulted in a new edict of 23 april 1615 [ 33 ] which forbade christians , under the penalty of death and confiscation , to shelter jews or to converse with them . 
    alsace and lorraine were the home of a significant number of jews . 
  in annexing the provinces in 1648 , louis xiv was at first inclined toward the banishment of jews living in those provinces , but thought better of it in view of the benefit he could derive from them . 
  on 25 september 1675 , he granted these jews letters patent , taking them under his special protection . 
  this , however , did not prevent them from being subjected to every kind of extortion , and their position remained the same as it had been under the austrian government . 
  this ran more-or-less until the catholic ban on usury stopped being applied : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vix_pervenit  in france , the ban on usury persisted until the french revolution of 1789 , the same year in which turgot 's m\u00e9moire sur les prets d'argent , a defense of usury , was allowed to be published . 
  in the uk , [ charging interest became legal in 1545 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usury ) , but jews , which [ had been prohibited from england since 1290 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edict_of_expulsion ) , were not permitted back in until 1657 . 
  in the islamic world , for a long , long time , non-muslims were required to pay a tax , the [ * jizya * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jizya ) . 
  the tax itself was certainly not a plus for jews , but in practice , it had the interesting side effect of making local rulers unsupportive of attempts to convert or lose the jews , since it would impact their tax revenue . 
  the graphic is ppp-adjusted . 
  you have a [ particularly high cost of living ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity#oecd_comparative_price_levels ) , so you will pay less on that graphic than you would in nominal dollars . 
   and it 's very hard to do anything about it . 
  i 'm sure that it 's possible , with fancy-enough processing of the output and being willing to throw out some sort of filter/wastewater/whatever , to trap particles . 
  the table that / u/awesomelove posted appears to include both used and new cars , though -- he was saying that there were relatively-low levels of ownership . 
   not in the food market . 
  i do n't really care about the price of food ( i already buy most of my food directly from local farmers with biological certificates , healthier and of higher quality , i 'm glad to pay a bit extra ) < shrug  all right . 
  i do not do that myself , but i know people who purchase locally-grown/organic/heirloom / etc food . 
  barring the market for that becoming so vanishingly small that there are n't enough people to make it available , it should continue to exist : if people like that sort of thing , there 's a market for someone to produce it . 
   bottom line is that capitalism is an awful system for food distribution , it should be about quality , health , environment all miles before we think about a dollar . 
  two points : first , what i 'm describing and ( i think ) what you 're criticizing is n't really [ capitalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capitalism ) , but a [ market economy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/market_economy ) . 
  a capitalist economy is simply one where industry is privately-owned , and whether a producer is a small farmer outside reims working a few acres or a vast array of fields somewhere in the us great plains , both wind up being privately-owned . 
  i do n't believe that you 're talking about having the government move to [ communal farms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_farming ) , for example . 
  a market economy would simply let individual producers and consumers select what they want and let each propose prices , and i believe that this is your concern -- you 'd rather not have someone down the block saying `` hey , i 'd rather buy product x than y '' and have x be an option to them . 
   it should be about quality , health , environment all miles before we think about a dollar . 
  well , a market can certainly optimize for some form of quality metric , just as it can for price or any other characteristic of the product -- if i want only vegetables with no bruises , i can select only those and ignore the others . 
  it 's hard to know what you mean by `` health '' , though i guess you could restrict sale of fatty or sugary goods . 
  a market alone would n't do that , though it would be possible to have a regulated market in which you say `` only pastries with less than n sugar per gram may be sold '' . 
   environment environment is an externality , and it 's true that you 'd need to internalize this in one way or another , but it 's hard to see why use of genetic engineering would conflict with the environment . 
   i also strongly believe we should produce our own food , in sufficient quantities to feed ourselves , such that we ar enot reliant on anybody for our primary need in life , and that we determine the standard . 
  well , you 've two issues there . 
  first , there 's some benefit to imports , as it provides more disconnection from seasonal restrictions and more variety . 
  i can import summer foods from the southern hemisphere in winter -- i regularly eat food that comes from south america when it 's out-of-season . 
  it 's hard to grow pineapple in finland , but if you trade for pineapple grown in the tropics , it becomes an option . 
  second , doing so means that you 'll require constraining land use in areas where the land might be more-usefully used for something else . 
  for example , perhaps france could grow wine grapes on land , and sell that wine to china , and this would provide the most-efficient use of that land . 
  instead , requiring that all consumed food be grown domestically would mean eliminating that wine production , and grow a less-useful crop that could serve as a food source for europeans . 
   many farmers are completely opposed to gmo 's , some industries ( like the beer producers , a big industry here ) have even said they do not want gmo at all . 
  ( and they label their products as ` gmo free ' already ) sure -- in the sense that it would facilitate somewhat-more-direct competition for the eu market , i 'd always expect a producer to want to throw up barriers , either via tariffs or via [ non-tariff barriers to trade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-tariff_barriers_to_trade ) , like this one . 
  a us manufacturer of chocolate would most-assuredly prefer that as many barriers as possible be thrown up to eu chocolate manufacturers selling to the us . 
  however ... from the standpoint of a consumer rather than a producer , one * does * want a competitive market , as much as possible . 
  i 've no interest at all in letting a us chocolate manufacturer establish those barriers to trade : it will only hurt me by giving me worse options . 
  the economy does n't exist to guarantee a particular incumbent businessman who owns a business money -- it exists to try to as-efficiently-as-possible produce resources as they are required by consumers . 
  to the degree that more-permissive trade policy will not decrease and will tend to increase economic efficiency , on the net , it tends to make all economies involved better-off . 
  i think that a number of people have the vague idea that it 's advantageous to try to maximize exports of products and then stockpile money -- e.g. , that the eu 's interests would be best-served by preventing us sales into the eu and trying to encourage eu sales into the us . 
  the idea would be , i guess , that this would make eu business stronger and make the eu better-off . 
  this policy is called [ mercantilism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) -- it 's been dead for a couple of hundred years . 
  trade permits one to leverage [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) , which is where the wins from that trade come from , and establishing barriers to imports interferes with this .
