  in the long term , a country will maintain a zero [ balance of trade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balance_of_trade ) . 
  i rather like this [ very brief explanation of maintenance of balance of trade by milton friedman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em ) . 
  when ttip is passed , it will drive companies out of business . 
  this will happen in both the eu and in the us . 
  this will happen because it will change what the market is asking for and what is available , and some companies wo n't or can not adapt . 
  it will , however , also create new opportunities for both to meet the new needs : new companies will be able to spring up and sell to those new needs . 
  any time a us producer exports something to the eu under ttip , it will be doing so in trade for something that the eu produces . 
  it might be in trade for something produced by the eu directly , or it might be that the eu will export something to china , which will then export something to the us . 
  but either way , the us producer is n't going to export that thing for free -- it would make no sense to do so . 
  because it does this export , any time that a us company moves in on an eu company 's market share , there will be a corresponding move in on a us company 's market share -- possibly in another industry -- elsewhere . 
   we 've a lot of small scale farming , we do n't have any dangerous plant diseases , our soil is of good quality , and we do not have insect plagues . 
  that 's fine -- if the only thing that was produced via genetic engineering were organisms that were disease-resistant or insect-resistant or could deal well with poor soil , then there 'd be no real eu interest in gmos , and the market itself would not use them . 
  there 'd be no purpose to artificially-preventing purchase of gmos , since they would n't be purchased anyway . 
  in practice , my guess is that there will be gmos that will be of interest , perhaps in the form of greater yields or better shelf life or being more-resistant to transport , the same sort of things that are optimized via artificial selection . 
   the issue being with opening the gmo market is not that farmers are able to use them or not , but the market opening up to lower quality us subsidized gmo plants . 
  it 's hard to call the genes of something `` lower quality '' in any meaningful way . 
  if the us subsidizes gmo development -- which i 'm not aware of -- then the eu will wind up with the us giving away free r&d time at the expense of the us taxpayer . 
   and god forbid we get a common regulating authority , that 's completely incompatible with europe and the precautionary principle . 
  if one were to apply the precautionary principle to , say , anything artificially-selected via breeding , that might make sense : it would demonstrate a high level of caution , but it would be tied to the outcome . 
  but applying one set of rules to artificially-selected organisms and another to genetically-engineered organisms makes little sense . 
  you can produce the same genes via artificial selection -- it 's just much-more-expensive , since you have to tie up fields full of plants and keep identifying and selecting for the characteristics you want . 
  genetic engineering simply lets the same gene sequence be directly-inserted , so it 's a much-faster process . 
  but there 's no meaningful way in which i think that it would be reasonable to call one gene `` higher quality '' . 
  there are plants that are genetically-identical . 
  all haas avocado trees -- by far the most-popular avocado cultivar -- are genetically-identical to one californian tree produced back in the day , and all new haas trees are produced from cuttings from that tree . 
  one very conservative standard would be to mandate that all plants have undergone testing to ensure that they are genetically-identical . 
  i think that it 's unnecessary , but it would be tied to the state of the genes that produce the food -- there is a known-good state , and that is the only acceptable one . 
  but that 's not what restrictions specific to genetic engineering do . 
  they simply say `` you can keep rolling the die until you get the number you want , but you ca n't pick up the die , turn it to the right face , and then set it down '' . 
  and that does n't seem to be very compelling to me . 
  that being said , at the end of the day , i 'd approve of ttip ( or another free-trade agreement with other countries ) whether-or-not restrictions on genetic engineering are in place . 
  in practice , it would prevent some efficiency gains developed in agriculture from being applied to food production , and the eu might have slightly-more-bruised or slightly-more-expensive food than would be present in the us or australia or canada or argentina . 
  it would slightly-hamper other industries -- companies that make products based on those plants , or slightly reduce the effective wages of eu workers who need to use their salary to purchase those plants for consumption . 
  both the eu and the us would be slightly worse-off without genetic engineering being available . 
  but other than a decrease in global economic efficiency , it 's not * that * big a deal . 
   because it makes no economic sense to open the gmo market . 
  well , there are two possibilities : * gmos are not preferable to non-gmos . 
  nobody manages to produce a compelling genetically-engineered organism -- all good crops are only created via artificial selection . 
  no reason to restrict gmos , as nobody winds up using them anyway . 
  * gmos are preferable to non-gmos . 
  the market buys into them because they 're preferable -- either they have better yields that outweighs whatever the cost of paying for the development is , or they produce something that 's more-highly-valued by the end consumer . 
  in this case , there 's your economic case -- you 're generating more utility than you otherwise would . 
  in either case , restricting gmos does n't buy the eu an economic benefit . 
   protectionism is good thing north korea has a pretty isolated economy . 
  it 's not doing very well . 
  you can patent organisms produced via artificial selection as well . 
  [ jazz apples ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jazz_%28apple%29 ) are my favorite type of apple , which are a new zealand creation . 
  these were patented in 2002 , so some new zealand company ( or whoever holds the current patent ) will be getting royalties from the us until 2022 . 
  they cost a bit more than some other options , but they 're really good , so worth it from my standpoint . 
  utility patents run for 20 years in the us , and i assume that the eu has comparable terms . 
  there was , at one point , discussion of [ terminator genes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_use_restriction_technology ) , but these have not been produced -- this is trying to prevent a genetically-engineered organism from being able to produce viable offspring . 
  it may come up again one day , but even if someone manages to successfully implement it , i suspect that it will be pretty vulnerable to defeat by other genetic engineers `` patching out '' the terminator gene . 
  in any event , it 's not currently part of the equation . 
  in all fairness : while there are photographs of the soviet union 's because this was comparatively-recent , many other countries were involved in rather-worse unpleasantnesses trying to suppress countries trying to break away , whether it was the [ us and the phillipines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippine%e2%80%93american_war ) or the [ french in algeria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algerian_war ) . 
  the breakup of the soviet union was a relatively-bloodless affair . 
  it could have been far , far , far worse had the leaders chosen , and they did not . 
  that crowd is able to push at the tank because it has n't been machine-gunned from a distance . 
  the portions of the world that the british colonized/controlled wound up -- not always the natives , mind -- becoming relatively well-to-do and influential . 
  when you compare this to what happened to colonies that belonged to a number of other european nations , there 's a substantial difference . 
  also , with a few exceptions ( like the us ) , the uk had a more-or-less congenial parting with most of them -- not the case for some other colonizers who were thrown out in wars . 
  the fact that the [ queen is still the head-of-state of many of these ex-colonies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) is an indicator that there is n't a strong desire to shed attachment . 
  of the top financial centers in the world , [ seven of the top ten are located in ex-british colonies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_centre#global_financial_centres_index ) . 
  every one of the top 23 countries ( japan , at 24 , being the first exception ) in per-capita income [ in the 2015 imf rankings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) is either in europe or an ex-british-controlled country . 
  take a look at some of the colonies : * [ anglosphere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglosphere ) : united states , canada , australia , new zealand , ireland . 
  in 2014 , about 6 % of world population , and 32 % of world gdp . 
  in a number of areas , like trade ( except the uk and ireland , which need to act as eu members ) , [ intelligence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes ) ( except ireland ) , and military ( except ireland ) , interoperate quite a bit . 
  not all of these do well today , but these countries tended to have a more favorable situation than those of some other colonizers .

  or more-impressive because so * many * people were willing to place themselves in the tank 's path . 
  probably go find a log . 
  http://ar.to/2010/08/red-blood-white-snow  a third anti-tank tactic , used in combination with either the molotov cocktail or the satchel charge , was the riskiest of all ; some might even call it borderline crazy . 
  the idea was to run up to a tank and forcibly halt it by jamming a log into its treads ; done just right , this gave an opportunity to deal with the tank and its crew at a more leisurely pace . 
  one exceptionally burly finnish ski trooper was decorated for immobilizing a soviet tank with nothing but a crowbar , prying the treads off by brute force , after which another soldier came up to the tank with a satchel charge and blew it up . 
  i wonder if that has weird effects if he becomes incapacitated for any reason . 
   your pension fund pays you a certain amount ( 70 % of your last/average wage including state pension ) , so if you ever had a job , you 'll be well above the 12,000 . 
  according to the page i linked to , this does not cover all jobs , even though it is common :  the majority of pension money in the netherlands is managed by pension funds , and more than 90 per cent of employees in the netherlands have a pension scheme via their employer . 
  similarly , i might have a retirement plan with my employer in the us , or i might not : http://www.americanbenefitscouncil.org/pub/e613e1b6-f57b-1368-c1fb-966598903769  nearly 80 percent of full-time workers have access to employer-sponsored retirement plans , and more than 80 percent of these workers participate in a plan . 
  like the netherlands , that would be in addition to the state pension/social security payments . 
  i agree wrt the subsidies , particularly on health care ... though let me check the numbers . 
  the us has medicare for the elderly . 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisconover/2012/12/03/aarp-lobbies-for-100000-plus-medicare-subsidy-for-seniors/  ... a male earning an average wage over his lifetime will receive from medicare lifetime benefits in retirement that amount to $ 180,000 . 
  [ 1 ] ... the average earning male who retired in 2010 ... $ 277,000 in lifetime benefits from [ social security ] . 
  so i guess that state-subsidized medical care for the elderly is very roughly two-thirds again the cash benefits .
