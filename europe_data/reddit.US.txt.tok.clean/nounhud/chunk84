  i 'm not sure where to find total medical benefits for pensioners in the netherlands to try to get a comparison , though ; i doubt that the netherlands would naturally-segregate pensioners and the working . 
  if someone is a legal citizen of romania ( which i understand is where some of europe 's gypsies hold citizenship ) or somewhere else and is found to be illegally present , they can be deported via a legal route . 
  if they are from a warzone to which they can not legally be deported , if they claim to be from a country which has no functioning government to confirm their identity , or if they have not registered for refugee status and france does n't want them initially-registered in france , then deportation probably becomes legally more-complex . 
  france obviously has the physical ability to simply drop people off somewhere else . 
  it 's whether the government and legal system is structured in such a way that this would run into legal or political difficulties . 
  * russia has little reason to rule out granting assad asylum ( or , more likely , simply letting assad in and not bothering with formal asylum ) . 
  * the bbc is presumably looking for a title that will make assad 's position sound precarious -- the actual quote was `` it 's premature to talk about that '' , which i think is probably more-representative of russia 's position that she would like to keep assad in place . 
  [ * lybia * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lybia ) is a type of crab . 
  that 's a lot of cell phone robberies , but no wallet robberies . 
  i wonder if robberies would fall off a lot in europe if it were mandated that phones bind themselves at a hardware level to a particular pin and could n't be reset without a user 's involvement . 
  i thought that there was one american involved too from an earlier news article , but i do n't see an american listed in the table . 
  on the other hand , what is the position of , say , the cdu versus the spd on refugees ? 
  that is , is the spd advocating for more-restrictions on immigration than the cdu is or fewer ? 
   of course technically we 're still a kingdom , so we may have to go old school . 
  hmm . 
  [ wikipedia : monarchy of the netherlands : political role : the monarch and the government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monarchy_of_the_netherlands#the_monarch_and_the_government )  the second paragraph of the article , though , is what really renders the monarch powerless . 
  this paragraph states that the monarch is inviolate . 
  he is beyond any reproach , beyond the grasp of any prosecution ( criminal or otherwise ) for any acts committed or actions taken as monarch . 
  if anything goes wrong , the minister responsible for the topic at hand is responsible for the failings of the monarch . 
  this sounds like it makes the monarch an absolute tyrant , but in fact the opposite is true : since the ministers are responsible , they also have the authority to make the decisions . 
  the ministers set the course of the government and the country , the ministers make executive decisions and run the affairs of state . 
  and since the government is one , the monarch abides by the decision of the ministers . 
  in fact the monarchs of the netherlands rarely make any executive decisions at all and practically never speak in public on any subject other than to read a statement prepared by the prime minister ( since an unfortunate off-the-cuff remark could get a minister into trouble ) . 
  the practical consequence of this limit on the power of the monarch is that the monarch never makes a decision on his own . 
  every decision , every decree must be countersigned by the responsible minister ( s ) . 
  [ ext 1 ], 
   there would n't be one . 
  pvv does n't want to cooperate with the vvd until rutte is gone , vvd does n't want to cooperate with the pvv until they apologise for the anti-moroccan chant from wilders . 
  are coalitions honestly based on such relatively-minor issues ? 
  i can understand playing up various media incidents for political reasons , but i can not fathom that sort of thing actually blocking parties from taking political power . 
  i do n't think that it 's intrinsically-impossible to reduce everything to a single number . 
  after all , an individual effectively does that when mentally comparing two systems and deciding their preference . 
  it 's just that i think that the single number that infographics provide often does n't quite represent what the reader is expecting . 
  the netherlands appears to pay [ a maximum of about 12,000 eur pre-tax per year in state pension ] ( http://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-page/official-issues/pensions ) , or about [ $ 13,001.32 ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?amount=12000&amp;from=eur&amp;to=usd ) / year . 
  us social security [ has a median annual benefit of $ 14,425 for people 65 + for 2014 ] ( http://www.pensionrights.org/publications/statistic/income-social-security ) ( the `` maximum '' is substantially-more , but my guess is that us social security payout tends to vary more than the netherlands pension payout , so i 'll list median ) . 
  more-interesting factors may be amount of healthcare subsidy , for example . 
  we have a special-interest group ( the [ aarp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aarp ) ) rather than a party . 
  i think this might be because of voting system differences that lead to a two-party system here : its common to have ngos addressing this sort of thing . 
  instead of a `` pirate party '' , we have the [ eff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic_frontier_foundation ) , for example . 
  given the fact that apparently there is [ little relative difference in north korean official salaries ] ( http://www.nknews.org/2014/03/how-much-money-do-north-koreans-make/ ) and that much of what one might buy ( food staples ) are subsidized :  ... it is fair to say that in north korea of today , the average monthly income of a worker is somewhere between $ 30-40 , while official salaries are much smaller , equivalent to $ 1 at best . 
  the difference might be made up for through heavily subsidized state rations , but much more often is made up for through working in the unofficial economy ... and that the metric used by op is measuring the change between the official income of an elderly person versus the median household official income , it seems that north korea would probably rank very well here on poverty , perhaps beating all countries listed for having low poverty . 
  also , while i 'm no expert on poverty metrics ... i 've been somewhat-unhappy with a number of poverty measurements that i 've seen . 
  it seems to me that the sort of metric that one would intuitively expect would be to compare all of someone 's available income stream to some approximation of the bare minimum of what it would cost to live in an area , maybe adjusting for whether someone is renting . 
  that way , a person suffering from poverty would be a person , even a thrifty person , who would simply be forced to have difficulty making ends meet . 
  but instead , i see all sorts of strange exceptions . 
  the us census bureau does n't count capital gains income towards measuring poverty ( and thus i suspect that under the proper conditions , someone with tens of billions of dollars like mr. bill gates and perhaps an income of tens of millions of dollars a year from the sale of equities might qualify as suffering from poverty ... a rather strange outcome in my eyes ) . 
  relative poverty metrics , which show up sometimes , mean that if someone somewhere in my society becomes wealthier , i become poorer -- regardless of my absolute standard of living , and even if my absolute standard of living does n't change at all . 
  that is n't really in-line with my intuitive expectation of what poverty would entail . 
  i 've also similar issues with metrics for `` food insecurity '' , which can cover a very wide range of things , including things like [ how many different food groups a household ate in the last 24 hours ] ( http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/5/481/t2.expansion.html ) -- there have been plenty of times when i have n't ranked highly there , though it 's not been due to lack of ability to afford food or caused any sensation of hunger . 
  and when you add in the fact that the data gathered often has political implications ( e.g. 
  should a particular program be funded or not ) , it makes it even more-difficult to know exactly what the material means . 
  i 'll give the graph here a kudos for sourcing its data and for at least giving a rough idea of what 's measured ... but i 've become a bit wary of measurements of either `` poverty '' or `` hunger '' , and started double-checking to see exactly what it is that they are saying . 
  on a not-infrequent basis , infographics about these wind up not referring to what i would have intuitively-expected . 
  hmm . 
  if that metric is post-tax , which it appears to be :  the data shown are for disposable incomes ( i.e. 
  net of personal income tax and social security contributions ) . 
  ... it would seem to kinda inflate the poverty metric for countries in which the government does not provide large subsidies . 
  if i earn a sum of money and then use that money to pay for my education or off a loan for education or pay for my children 's education , that shows up as income in my pre-retirement years . 
  if the same educational spending is funded by the government via taxation , it will not show up as net income in this metric . 
  the same spending may occur , but in the latter case , it will appear to be much flatter , and thus reduce the apparent decrease in income . 
  ditto for other government-provided services , like healthcare , subsidized mass transit , and so forth . 
  thank you for the comprehensive response !, 
  people you tag as friends are n't visible to the person . 
  just makes it easier to keep track of people whose posts you might like . 
  could you source that ? 
  it seems like that 'd warrant the mods adding a comment to the submission title . 
   socio-economic deprivation hmm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osama_bin_laden  [ osama bin laden ] continued to criticize king fahd of saudi arabia . 
  in response , in 1994 fahd stripped bin laden of his saudi citizenship and persuaded his family to cut off his $ 7 million a year stipend . 
  [ 1 ] [ 103 ] [ snip ]  some african intelligence sources have argued that the expulsion left bin laden without an option other than becoming a full-time radical , and that most of the 300 afghan arabs who left with him subsequently became terrorists . 
  [ 100 ] various sources report that bin laden lost between $ 20 million [ 109 ] and $ 300 million [ 110 ] in sudan ; the government seized his construction equipment , and bin laden was forced to liquidate his businesses , land , and even his horses . 
    in august 1996 , bin laden declared war against the united states . 
  [ 111 ] looks like they 're onto something . 
  [ wikipedia : rt : criticism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt_%28tv_network%29#criticism ), 
  tell you what -- let 's just agree to disagree on this point . 
  i believe that i 'm pretty confident in my position , and i believe that you 're pretty confident in your position , and i do not believe that either one of us is likely to sell the other ... and i think that any response i give is probably going to just wind up being repetitive . 
  support for this position : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union#russia  during the preparation stages of the enp , russia insisted on the creation of the four eu-russia common spaces instead of enp participation , as it saw the enp as `` unequal '' arrangement with a dominant role of the eu . 
  [ 226 ] in the framework of the eu-russia common spaces in may 2005 , a roadmap was adopted with similar content to the enp action plans . 
  both the enp and the eu-russia common spaces are implemented by the eu through the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument . 
    among the most vocal supporters of russian membership of the eu has been former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ; in october 2008 he said `` i consider russia to be a western country and my plan is for the russian federation to be able to become a member of the european union in the coming years '' and stated that he had this vision for years . 
  [ 227 ] russian permanent representative to the eu vladimir chizhov commented on this by saying that russia has no plans of joining the eu . 
  [ 228 ] russian prime minister vladimir putin has said that russia joining the eu would not be in the interests of either russia or the eu , although he advocated close integration in various dimensions including establishment of four common spaces between russia and the eu , including united economic , educational and scientific spaces as it was declared in the agreement in 2003 . 
  [ 229 ] [ 230 ] [ 231 ] [ 232 ]   at present , the prospect of russia joining the eu any time in the near future is slim . 
  former german chancellor gerhard schr\u00f6der has also said that though russia must `` find its place both in nato , and , in the longer term , in the european union , and if conditions are created for this to happen '' that such a thing is not economically feasible in the near future . 
  i agree with you wrt russia not needing to join the eu to reform . 
  that being said , i also think that it 'd be a pretty big stumbling block to not at least be on congenial terms with the eu . 
   it does n't require leveraging of the money supply . 
  if you make use of the fact that you have an infinite supply of the currency in nominal terms , that 's what you 're doing . 
   think back to the days of quantitative easing : 375billion in the uk and 4.5 trillion . 
  was there any discussion of needing taxes to ` raise funds ' for these purchases ? 
  of course not . 
  no , but when i say `` back door to * effectively * tax people '' , i 'm talking about generating inflation and transferring the real wealth that was previously associated with the currency in question , not passing a law to create a tax . 
   bernanke outright states that money is created out of thin air . 
  yes . 
  he 's talking about the money supply being increased . 
   qe did not require money printing , because it was mostly exchanging bonds for money that had already been saved `` money printing '' is a coloquialism for increasing the money supply . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantitative_easing  a central bank implements quantitative easing by buying financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions , thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield , while ** simultaneously increasing the money supply ** . 
  [ snip ]  quantitative easing has been nicknamed `` printing money '' by some members of the media , [ 108 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] central bankers , [ 111 ] and financial analysts . 
  [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ snip ]  in the european union , world pensions council ( wpc ) financial economists have also argued that artificially low government bond interest rates induced by qe will have an adverse impact on the underfunding condition of pension funds , since `` without returns that outstrip inflation , pension investors face the real value of their savings declining rather than ratcheting up over the next few years '' . 
     the reason why it is meaningless is because the debt is denominated in british pounds , a currency that the uk government has an infinite supply of .
