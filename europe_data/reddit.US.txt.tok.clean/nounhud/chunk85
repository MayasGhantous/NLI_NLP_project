  [ snip ]  the debt could be paid instantly with no change to the money supply or effect on inflation . 
  if you 're leveraging the `` infinite supply '' of nominal pounds that the uk has , you are increasing the money supply and generating inflation . 
   the reason why it is meaningless is because the debt is denominated in british pounds , a currency that the uk government has an infinite supply of . 
  it is not meaningless . 
  the uk does have the ability to generate pounds and hand them to creditors , but it will drain real wealth that anyone holds enumerated by the pound and transfer it to creditors . 
  in the sense that the uk could pay down the debt if it did n't care about the damage it did to its economy because it has a back-door route to effectively tax people , sure . 
   rather , it 's a check on their expansion and their ability to push around their neighbors , like they have ukraine . 
  i agree . 
   shattering nato 's political unity is at the very top of putin 's wishlist . 
  to the extent that doing so is a concern , it 's because nato is a military threat . 
  addressing a military threat from a powerful military alliance by attacking it seems like kind of a bad idea . 
  it 's like saying `` that guy over there has a rifle , and that seems like it might be a danger to me if we got in a fight . 
  i 'm going to go provoke a fight . '', 
  just does n't make much sense to me . 
   so they 're trying to talk the uk into how to distribute , let 's be honest here , american resource i 'm kinda doubtful . 
  i ca n't see how the uk would be cutting deals on nato forces as a whole unilaterally . 
  i also am really doubtful that nato as a whole would be onboard with this . 
  it would simultaneously be jamming nato deep into non-military domestic politics ( which the us probably does not want to get tied up with ) and would kinda weaken the meaningfulness of nato membership . 
  if the uk is the lone holdout member , she might be offering her political support for polish basis , i guess . 
  or maybe she 's simply offering british soldiers . 
  i also really do n't think trying to swap domestic policies for defense is a good idea from nato 's standpoint ( though i 'll grant that poland and the uk both have political pressures and it might be in their individual interests from a `` eu unity '' standpoint ) . 
  that 's pretty much what i expected . 
  there 's no drawback from a consumer standpoint to buying vehicles , regardless of emissions . 
  any issues come up with externalities caused by pollution , and those will show up in fines , not in purchasing . 
  i guess it involves russia . 
  pope francis seems to be pretty active politically . 
  it 's preferable , from my standpoint , to `` no impact , and crimean acquisition goes off smashingly for russia '' . 
  however , i think that a better outcome would have been for the whole crimea situation to have not arisen in the first place . 
  let 's say that putin burns through the russian national wealth fund , which the articles i linked to described as likely once the reserve fund is dry . 
  that will clobber future russian pensions that had been depending on it . 
  now there are going to be a lot of older people in poverty down the line . 
  there are years of future social problems being generated . 
  russia is n't going to pick itself up and walk a couple hundred miles away -- it 's still going to be there , and no matter what , there 's going to be ill feeling on both sides . 
  i think that most would agree that in the long run , a russia with a healthy economy , crime and corruption reduced , and not in conflict with the eu would be in the eu 's best interests , and that will invariably now be some years further away . 
  russia probably winds up being more of a headache from the us standpoint this way . 
  if both sides had been able to credibly state what they were going to do initially , and there was enough information to foresee the outcome ( e.g. 
  russia says to the eu `` you cut a trade arrangement with ukraine , we hack off part of it '' , and the eu and the us say `` you hack off part of ukraine , we kick your economy until it gets returned '' and both sides can agree on the likely actual outcome ) , we would n't have had to have a conflict to resolve the situation , since we could have just agreed on the outcome without the costs of actually going through the conflict . 
  conflict results from a failure of diplomacy . 
  instead , a bunch of countries are now going to have to go through pain to resolve something that would have been best-resolved by some men in suits before the whole thing got going . 
  their warnings were n't credible , so we have to actually play them out . 
  issues will come up before everything there is exhausted ; russia ca n't come close to hitting zero without people fleeing the ruble . 
  http://russianomics.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-russian-reserves-how-much-is-left.html  if the nrf is gone , this is of course not the end of days for the russian state . 
  the next reserves to be tapped into is obviously the national wealth fund , which would last another two years at current oil prices ( until 2018 ) . 
  if the oil price has not recovered significantly by 2018 ( i.e. 
  after putin 's probable reelection ) the russian government might try to issue bonds ( downside : high interest payments ) or sell bonds to the central bank , effectively printing rubles ( downside : inflation will go up ) . 
  dramatic budget cuts would be another solution . 
  a combination of all three measures is the most likely outcome . 
    overall , the forecast is not looking too bright . 
  without rallying oil prices there is stormy weather ahead for russian state finances around 2018 . 
  [ some of that has already been spoken for ] ( http://imrussia.org/en/analysis/economy/2362-russias-currency-reserves-more-than-enough-or-alarmingly-low ) :  russia 's not-so-hidden problem lies elsewhere -- in the structure of its forex reserves . 
  the central bank is open about what funds are included in the reserves , but they do n't exactly advertise one key fact : the total includes most of russia 's two sovereign wealth funds , known as the reserve fund and the national wealth fund . 
  these funds were formed in 2008 out of the stabilization fund , which was created in 2004 to collect surplus revenues from energy exports . 
  each of these two caches has the equivalent of about $ 75 billion in it right now , or roughly 6 percent of gdp , and the government has started liberally dipping into this money . 
  it is using the reserve fund to cover an estimated budget deficit of 3.7 percent of gdp this year ( 2.68 trillion rubles ) , while more than 500 billion rubles from the national wealth fund has been earmarked for investment projects and to help struggling state-owned companies . 
  requests by government corporations for money from the national wealth fund far exceed the actual total in the coffers . 
  ( putin decided at a meeting in february that he personally would choose which projects get support . ), 
  and the current 2016 budget envisions a deficit of about 2.4 percent of gdp -- meaning that if there is another deficit in 2017 , the reserve fund could become tapped out . 
  economist sergei guriev recently warned that it could even run out by the end of 2016 . 
  another $ 48 billion of russia 's `` currency '' reserves is actually holdings of gold -- the value of which recently plunged 4.2 percent , part of an across-the-board drop in global commodity prices . 
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:russia_export_treemap.png https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:canada_export_treemap.jpg edit : actually , sorry , your request was for percentage of gdp rather than exports . 
   costs in canada are also at least 10-15x higher than russia ( moscow excluded ) . 
  ppp conversion factors : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/pa.nus.pppc.rf  russia 2014 : 0.5   canada 2014 : 1.1 maybe a bit over 2x . 
  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/weak-oil-prices-deplete-russias-sovereign-wealth-fund-2015-10-27  the country , which has been relying on its sovereign-wealth fund to plug gaps in its budget deficit , said its reserve fund is likely to be depleted in 2016 . 
   bild : but one can not simply challenge european state borders . 
    putin : for me , it is not borders and state territories that matter , but people 's fortunes . 
  i think that if i were putin , i 'd be providing a criteria for annexation in crimea that would n't also apply to other countries . 
  that 'd be the case even if i personally might hold that view . 
  his approach here seems like it could come off as threatening and not very diplomatic . 
   russia 's annexation of crimea in march of 2014 , putin told bild , was simply the kremlin 's way of protecting the people of crimea from being confined within the borders imposed upon them by the us and europe after the west claimed victory in the cold war . 
  i 'm pretty sure that neither the us nor the eu faked russia 's signature on the budapest memorandum saying that ukraine 's territorial integrity would be respected . 
   much of what putin says is intended for his internal propaganda , but sometimes both external and internal . 
  why would putin be trying to fan up old soviet feelings to a german publication ? 
  i would n't have thought that germany would be particularly enthusiastic about the soviet union . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eliot_higgins#bellingcat  on 15 july 2014 , higgins started a new website called bellingcat for citizen journalists to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos , maps and pictures . 
  its launch was funded by a kickstarter campaign . 
  [ 14 ] bellingcat 's self-taught open-source analysts include higgins and eight volunteers . 
  [ 15 ]   among its major projects , bellingcat has investigated the downing of malaysia airlines flight 17 in ukraine . 
  its work is being considered by the dutch police investigating the crash . 
  [ 7 ] bellingcat has suggested that the anti-aircraft missile that hit the plane was fired by a russian unit , the 53rd buk brigade , based in the city of kursk . 
  [ 16 ] on 31 may 2015 , bellingcat released a report alleging among other things photo manipulation of satellite images released by the russian ministry of defense . 
  [ 17 ] the photos concerned the location of ukrainian buk missile launchers around the time mh17 was shot down . 
  [ 18 ] bellingcat 's use of error level analysis in its report was criticized by jens kriese , a professional image analyst . 
  the outside world would probably mostly ignore most of the middle east and north africa in the way that central africa gets ignored , were it not for oil : that 's what gives it relevance .

  i 've no personal expertise . 
  i do n't think that the concern is so much the actual emissions as that there was an organized attempt to fraudulently defeat the regulatory system . 
  and i do n't think that bp or vw got exceptional attention because they 're headquartered in europe : exxon 's american , for example , and the initial ruling against them for a smaller oil spill was larger ( and that 's not inflation-adjusted , either ) . 
  i thought that the eu already had a common fingerprint database . 
  heck , i was wondering if they should go so far as to do a dna database for migrants ( given the [ obscuring-of-fingerprints that have been in the news for a while ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/dublin-regulation-european-asylum-seekers ) ) .
