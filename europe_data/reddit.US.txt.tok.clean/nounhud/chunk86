   police and media have their orders to cover it up source ? 
  the nazi card has been kinda maxed out . 
  pointing out selective enforcement of eu policy , if this is happening , seems like it 's a lot more relevant and valid . 
  well , [ you have a bunch of refugees floating around these days ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/09/turkish-refugee-camps-for-syrians-set-high-standard/ ) . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refuge  verb   refuge ( third-person singular simple present refuges , present participle refuging , simple past and past participle refuged )   * 1 . 
  ( intransitive ) to return to a place of shelter . 
  ( transitive , obsolete ) to shelter ; to protect . 
  apparently so . 
  it 's true that one individual may well not be representative of the many . 
  well , let me search startpage for some poll numbers . 
  [ the top hit for `` poll belgium migrants '' ] ( http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/news/1.2410731 ) :  the polling bureau ipsos questioned local residents from 24 countries in europe , asia and the americas about their attitude towards migrants . 
  the results are surprising : half of the respondents thinks there are too many migrants in his/her country and that these have a negative impact on the development of their country . 
    in belgium , 61 per cent of the respondents finds that immigrant numbers are too far up . 
  this puts belgium in 5th place , after turkey ( 91 % ) , italy , russia and south-africa . 
  germany , the european country accommodating the highest number of immigrants , has a figure of ` only ' 43 % . 
    does migration have a negative impact on the country ? 
  58 % of the belgian respondents answers ` yes ' . 
  this puts belgium in 4th place in the list of 24 , behind turkey , italy and russia . 
    a small majority of the belgians ( 52 % ) is convinced that it 's harder to find a job due to immigrants . 
  this puts belgium on number 7 . 
  at the same time , 56 % estimates that the burden migrants are putting on public services is too heavy . 
    only 12 out of 100 of the belgians taking part in the poll are of the opinion that migrants have a positive influence on the development of their nation . 
  this puts belgium well below the average of 24 % for the 24 countries together . 
  that does n't seem to be very enthusiastic . 
  of course , the numbers here are a bit stale : that article is about twelve weeks old . 
  but i 'm a little doubtful that the popularity of migrants rose dramatically over those twelve weeks in belgium . 
  well , there 's the * new york times * . 
  not sure if i 'd call it `` solidarity '' , though , since the us is n't going to take any substantial number . 
   under orban 's watch , hungary last year built a razor-wire barrier along its border with serbia and penned hundreds of migrants -- the majority of whom were seeking merely to transit through the country to friendlier locales -- in squalid temporary camps . 
  my understanding from hungarians here was that the policies adopted effectively let them leave those camps and head off through the borders away from hungary , if it makes the wapo happier . 
  bhutan did [ gross national happiness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross_national_happiness ) . 
  in 2014 , somalia had a per-capita nominal gdp of $ 131 ( $ 600 ppp-adjusted ) . 
  working illegally and without benefits is still going to beat that pretty handily : somalian labor can probably undersell any european labor easily at the low end of the skill scale and still come out well ahead . 
  there are non-financial factors as well , and those are harder to measure . 
  but i can tell you right now that if i were some somalian or eritrean , i 'd probably make the same move that the illegal immigrants are : there 's a pretty substantial payoff . 
   all island in the mediterranean sea are not european . 
  [ fort de br\u00e9gan\u00e7on ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_de_br%c3%a9gan%c3%a7on ) ? 
  hmm . 
  if it stabilizes libya under the new government , might be a good return on investment . 
  * there are `` record numbers of refugees and displaced people worldwide '' . 
  * some countries , like lebanon , have more than their share of refugees and need help . 
  * he advocated for the use of legal immigration to resolve refugee crises as opposed to human trafficking . 
  * if europe `` erects barriers and closes doors , the rest of the world would too '' . 
  * less than ten percent of the world 's refugees are in europe . 
  * europe is very wealthy , and the refugees have needs that are not met . 
  * solutions should be eu-wide . 
  to be fair , i think that there * is * a certain argument that the eu leadership -- less political and more bureaucratic than the governments of many member nations -- should focus on selling the public in advance of taking on policies rather than after-the-fact . 
  that 'd avoid awkward moments like this . 
   many people just prefer a western european union [ heh ] ( http://www.postaruba.com/modules/1/images/western%20union%20yes!.jpg ) . 
   how can you dismiss a 53 % vote of disapproval ? 
  because it 's not binding . 
  probably be politically-harmful to oppose it , but there 's no legal requirement . 
   a lifestyle that we simply are n't able to provide . 
  life on the bottom tier in europe is still going to be better than life in somalia or eritrea : higher standard of living . 
   if a person enters a country without a visa or even without a passport , he is illegal and should be deported . 
  this can only be prevented by claiming asylum as a refugee . 
  that 's already the case . 
  however , if greece or italy enforce this , it just means that they wind up responsible for all of the people involved . 
  not a very good incentive -- greece and italy do n't want to be on the hook any more than < random other country in the eu  does . 
  disease killed about 95 % of the indigenous population in the americas . 
  that would have happened after a 15k year separation of the continents , regardless of anything that people could have done then . 
  hell , even today with modern knowledge of microbiology and medicine , and if there were a strong desire to avoid this regardless of the resources required , i 'm not sure that we could have done much . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_straits  they are conventionally considered the boundary between the continents of europe and asia . 
   this can only guarantee these regulatory agencies will see vw in a negative light . 
  i do n't know whether there 's any reward/punishment structure in place for cooperation . 
  could be that the documents would have damaged vw 's case . 
  turkey ? 
  give it another year . 
  russia still has financial reserves left . 
  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/weak-oil-prices-deplete-russias-sovereign-wealth-fund-2015-10-27  the country , which has been relying on its sovereign-wealth fund to plug gaps in its budget deficit , said its reserve fund is likely to be depleted in 2016 . 
  i guess if russia also burns through her national wealth pension savings fund , that 'd also hold her for a while longer . 
  [ the non-mobile version ] ( http://www.heute.de/bundestag-stoppt-ausgabe-von-hausausweisen-an-lobbyisten-41736660.html ) , as well as a google translate english translation :  ** bundestag can no longer purely lobbyists **   * the bundestag tightened the rules for lobbyists . 
  immediately you will be issued no more id cards , a complete revision of access is in progress . 
  so far , the groups have more than 1,000 id cards distributed to stakeholders - and it plugged fierce criticism . 
  *   they are sent by siemens , lufthansa or greenpeace and can almost freely as a deputy in the bundestag . 
  lobbyists who have a house card can knock at the offices , waiting outside the chamber or in the canteen . 
  the bundestag is a lobbyist paradise . 
  more than 1,000 id cards have awarded the fractions . 
  whom and why : that was a secret for many years . 
    there were several court judgments necessary to the spd and the cdu / csu openly laid , whom she granted unlimited access . 
  the list includes defense and pharmaceutical companies , automobile manufacturers , airlines , but also trade unions , environmentalists and feminists . 
  the public outcry was so great that the bundestag is now responding . 
    * all requests by lobbyists to be rejected in the future *   according to information of the zdf capital studio all parliamentary groups have agreed not to issue any more id cards . 
  all requests by lobbyists to be rejected immediately . 
  simultaneously , the elders instructed a working group to regulate new access to the bundestag . 
  the mysterious encounter between politics and lobbyists to be more transparent . 
    one idea is to link the issue of press cards to the entry into a company and organizations list , so that the work of lobbyists is verifiable . 
  the number of id cards per company should be limited . 
  agreement among the parties that journalists continue to get id cards .

   ** not sure if it 's safe to visit brussels ? 
  ask a random belgian **   do you want to travel to brussels , but wish there was some way to check whether it 's safe ? 
  have you been put off by media reports describing the city as a hotbed of terror because november 's paris attacks were allegedly partly planned there ? 
    maybe a chat with a random stranger will put your mind at ease . 
  that 's what the brussels tourist board is hoping . 
  with [ its new #callbrussels ] ( https://call.brussels/ ) , you can call -- for free -- any of three phones stationed around the belgian capital and have awkward , confused conversations with ordinary passersby about what the city is like these days . 
    `` over the past few weeks , the international media has portrayed brussels as a war zone that tourists would do well to avoid , '' tourist board visit brussels said in a statement . 
  `` this has obviously had dire consequences for the tourist sector , which is currently experiencing a noticeable decline ... with the international #callbrussels campaign , visit.brussels aims to convince tourists intending to visit brussels that there is no reason to revise their travel plans . ''   so newsweek picked up the phone and asked people why they thought we should jet over to belgium . 
  it 's a strange experience . 
  those answering the phones , which are placed in three prominent locations around the city , usually initially had little idea of what was going on .
