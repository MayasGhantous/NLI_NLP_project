    ** do you worry about the perception of the city as a terror hotbed ? 
  **   * a serious response from molenbeek suburb , home to abdelhamid abaaoud , the mastermind of the paris attacks : *   `` this is a big problem here in brussels ... everybody here in brussels thinks that foreign people are terrorists . 
  they do n't like for example people who come from north africa ... it 's not right . ''   fear of extremism runs deep in the city . 
    ** why did you even pick up the phone ? 
  **   * from mont des artes , a popular tourist spot : *   `` i was like : what 's that annoying noise ? ''   inspiring   ** kiss , marry or avoid ? 
  : belgian prime minister charles michel , french president francois hollande , british prime minister david cameron ? 
  **   * the response from flagey : *   `` i would leave them all alone ... come on , man . ''   fair enough,

  the automod asks for a repost of the story contents :  ** europe sets up digital ` swat ' team for aviation cyber threats **   european aviation agency 's team would identify and combat potential hacking attacks   europe 's top air-safety official said he is hiring a group of high-level computer experts to identify and combat looming cyber threats to aviation . 
    intended to be a kind of digital swat team for hacking attacks , the initiative launched last month goes beyond u.s. efforts and is the most dramatic example of the european aviation safety agency 's increasingly aggressive approach to such risks . 
    the aim is to quickly provide technical assistance to carriers or national regulators anywhere in europe in the event of a cyber attack , patrick ky , the agency 's executive director , said in an interview . 
    the move is also part of a broader campaign by the agency , which serves 32 member states , to expand its authority beyond traditional safety regulations . 
  `` we think the aviation system is quite vulnerable to cyber attacks , '' mr. ky said . 
    aviation authorities world-wide have said there has n't been a verified instance of an individual or a group successfully hacking into a commercial airliner 's power or flight-control systems while airborne . 
  but , like many experts , mr. ky worries about growing potential threats as aircraft become more connected to ground-based computer networks , ranging from maintenance to navigation to cabin entertainment . 
    mr. ky said he has started to recruit cyber experts with the aim of reassuring political leaders and passengers that `` we are ready and we are going to help '' if aviation computer systems are compromised . 
  the team will be supplemented by staff loaned from various national regulators . 
    he added that france , the u.k. and a number of scandinavian countries have pledged to assist with the policy , and that he discussed the concept earlier this week with peggy gilligan , the top safety official at the u.s. federal aviation administration . 
    initially , the focus will be on cataloging and monitoring cyber-related hazards confronting commercial planes and other aircraft world-wide . 
  but by late 2016 , according to mr. ky , a core team of roughly a dozen troubleshooters should be ready to respond to specific incidents . 
  he envisions 50 or 60 experts will eventually be dedicated to such work . 
    leaders of easa and the faa have previously talked about cooperating on more-stringent design standards to insulate flight-controls and other safety-critical systems from potential cyber attacks . 
  each agency has asked its own phalanx of industry officials and outside experts to come up with recommendations . 
    but the u.s. and europe are at odds over some principles , especially when it comes to the best way to safeguard smaller , private aircraft . 
  even if a joint approach emerges , sweeping regulations or legislation could take years to become final . 
    rather than simply wait for that process to end , mr. ky and easa 's policy-setting management board are intent on ensuring that timely , detailed technical assistance will be available to deter or minimize the impact of any computer breach . 
    `` the aircraft when it 's flying , is quite immune '' to such threats `` at least for the time being , '' according to the easa chief . 
    but he said he is more worried about maintenance functions and other ground - based systems that can tap into onboard computers . 
  `` the risk is there , '' he said . 
    mr. ky , who took over the agency more than two years ago , is now pushing to get certain security , operational oversight and aircraft-inspection responsibilities previously reserved for aviation regulators from individual countries . 
  he has already shaken up the bureaucracy and clashed with some airline officials by moving into areas once considered strictly off-limits for the agency . 
    his campaign to broaden the agency 's purview will be debated by european legislators and politicians in coming months . 
  last year , the european commission concluded that threats to `` cyber security are increasing and may require new approaches to certification '' of aircraft and major components . 
    precisely how easa will proceed , and what additional resources it will have , are expected to be a big part of the impending debate . 
  one of my pet peeves is the lack of cryptographic authentication on [ ads-b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automatic_dependent_surveillance_%e2%80%93_broadcast ) transmissions ; hopefully if an agency is now specifically looking at computer security of aircraft , this has a chance to get more coverage .

  note that the scale on the colors used on the 1914 and 2016 maps are very different : the dark blue `` long '' time to reach a place in 1914 is 40 + days , whereas on the 2016 map is only 1.5 days . 
  if they used the same color scheme , the entire 2016 map would be the red `` less than 5 days '' color ( and well toward the short end of that period ) . 
  i will be astounded if the * mein kampf * release has any direct impact whatsoever . 
  do you object to the general thrust of the explanation , though ? 
  that is , `` turks hate greeks because greeks invaded turkey after world war ii and did some pretty horrific things to turks then '' and `` greeks hate turks because turkey messed up their society while occupying greece '' ?

  edit : if it 's because france24/dw/bbc are n't purely-internationally-targeting , and have a domestic component , it 's true that some of their expenses probably do go to that . 
  so there 's some sort of portion of that that will be eaten up by domestic material -- might be possible to identify the bbc world budget specifically , as iirc the beeb segregates those components of the organization . 
  i was n't comparing them with with rfe/rl , though -- i mean that rt is having to compete with multiple news agencies , and it 's not just `` rfe/rl versus rt '' in terms of budget , so simply a dollar value from rfe/rl and one from rt , as the article author did , is n't quite the full story . 
   unsurprisingly , aron -- who currently serves on the board of rfe/rl 's parent organization , the broadcasting board of governors -- made it clear that he believes that compared to rt , rfe/rl is woefully underfunded . 
  well , assuming that you do feel that re-igniting the ol' cold war propaganda engines is a good idea , he 's got a point .

  and for at least some expenses , like domestic labor , using ppp values probably makes more sense , which would be even more favorable to russia [ by about a factor of two ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/pa.nus.pppc.rf ) .

  also , the bbc , france24 , dw , and so forth all get a hefty chunk of pocket change of their own . 
  edit : ah , looks like ppp does n't make much sense , at least for rt : [ putin 's propaganda industry tightens its belt ] ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-01-23/putin-s-propaganda-industry-tightens-its-belt ) :  six months ago , rt had been promised a 30 percent increase to its 2014 budget so it could start broadcasting in german and french . 
  now , the 2015 allocation , 15.4 billion rubles ( $ 240 million ) , will be cut by 10 percent . 
  rt is still getting more money than last year , but the ruble 's sharp devaluation in recent months means that the dollar value of the subsidy has decreased by 46 percent . 
  that 's important for rt because it works in foreign markets and hires foreigners . 
  ** according to rt editor margarita simonyan , about 80 percent of the operation 's expenses are in foreign currencies . 
  ** plans for the german and french versions will probably be scrapped , simonyan told the daily vedomosti , at least for this year .

  [ churchill would be sad ] ( https://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/archives/selection/churchill/zurichspeech_en.asp ) :  i wish to speak about the tragedy of europe , this noble continent , the home of all the great parent races of the western world , the foundation of christian faith and ethics , the origin of most of the culture , arts , philosophy and science both of ancient and modern times . 
  if europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance there would be no limit to the happiness , prosperity and glory which its 300 million or 400 million people would enjoy . 
  yet it is from europe that has sprung that series of frightful nationalistic quarrels , originated by the teutonic nations in their rise to power , which we have seen in this 20th century and in our own lifetime wreck the peace and mar the prospects of all mankind . 
    what is this plight to which europe has been reduced ? 
  some of the smaller states have indeed made a good recovery , but over wide areas are a vast , quivering mass of tormented , hungry , careworn and bewildered human beings , who wait in the ruins of their cities and homes and scan the dark horizons for the approach of some new form of tyranny or terror . 
  among the victors there is a babel of voices , among the vanquished the sullen silence of despair . 
  that is all that europeans , grouped in so many ancient states and nations , and that is all that the germanic races have got by tearing each other to pieces and spreading havoc far and wide . 
  indeed , but for the fact that the great republic across the atlantic realised that the ruin or enslavement of europe would involve her own fate as well , and stretched out hands of succour and guidance , the dark ages would have returned in all their cruelty and squalor . 
  they may still return . 
    yet all the while there is a remedy which , if it were generally and spontaneously adopted by the great majority of people in many lands , would as by a miracle transform the whole scene and would in a few years make all europe , or the greater part of it , as free and happy as switzerland is today . 
  what is this sovereign remedy ? 
  it is to recreate the european fabric , or as much of it as we can , and to provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace , safety and freedom . 
  we must build a kind of united states of europe . 
  in this way only will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living . 
  the process is simple . 
  all that is needed is the resolve of hundreds of millions of men and women to do right instead of wrong and to gain as their reward blessing instead of cursing . 
    much work has been done upon this task by the exertions of the pan-european union , which owes so much to the famous french patriot and statesman aristide briand . 
  there is also that immense body which was brought into being amidst high hopes after the first world war - the league of nations .
