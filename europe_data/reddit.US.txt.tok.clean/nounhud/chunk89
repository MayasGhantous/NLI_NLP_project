  on a per-capita basis or an absolute basis ? 
  sweden 's population probably was n't constant over that time , and i 'd think that per-capita numbers are probably more-interesting in this context . 
   `` the proportion of emigrants in relation to the swedish population as a whole is not as great as in the 1800s . 
  i suppose it 's reasonable to say that relative to your spectrum , the democratic party might be called center-right , but in the us , normally `` left '' simply means `` democratic '' , since there are only two influential parties . 
  while at one point in time , control of detroit moved between the two parties , [ detroit has been controlled exclusively by the democratic party since 1962 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mayors_of_detroit ) . 
  broadly-speaking , i 'd say that a great deal of detroit 's problems today stem from the fact that the city did not accept downsizing , cutting spending back when to match its decrease in population , and so dug itself so deeply into debt that it had no way to ever climb back out . 
  that could legitimately be laid at the feet of city government . 
  obviously , city government did not directly cause the race riots or the overseas competition and automation that decreased the demand for manual labor in detroit ... but the same would be true of both parties there . 
  < shrug  i mean , france is in nato and did n't go . 
  it 's not as if nato said `` go '' , or as if iraq were a nato operation -- just that it included countries that happened to be in nato . 
  countries who were n't in nato could join , and countries who were in nato could sit out . 
  bush 's [ coalition of the willing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_of_the_willing ) included pretty much everyone he could sell on coming , including mongolia , angola , tiny pacific islands , and the like . 
  i mean , okay , if someone wants to leave nato , that 's their call ... but i think that `` attacking iraq '' is kinda a separate affair . 
   but he said america and russia had `` vast arsenals '' when it came to nuclear weapons while the uk and france were just `` side shows '' . 
    he said it would be `` suicide '' to launch an attack on russia , saying the uk only had `` enough to start a war , not to win a war '' . 
  i do n't really think that either the us or russia are planning on an all-out first strike in the immediate future either , but despite that , they are n't planning on getting rid of their arsenals . 
   we have a pathological aversion to id cards ( which is odd , given that we do n't seem a fuck about invasions of privacy the rest of the time ) once facebook-style automated facial recognition and tracking systems are cheap and hooked into closed-circuit television , we 're all going to be close to id cards anyway , like it or not . 
   ~ ~ miniaturized cia collaborator ~ ~ independent freedom fighter, 
  this is not favorable for russia in terms of maintaining long-term claims to the area , though . 
  not quite on par with [ white coke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_coke ) there in terms of international relations , coca-cola . 
  would your goal be to provide temporary refuge or provide for permanent immigration ? 
   they get to do their own thing , we get to have our federalism . 
  weellll ... about half of the us wanted confederation instead and had a rather violent spat with the other half over the whole matter until they lost . 
  taking a look at california as an example : http://esfandilawfirm.com/crimes/ca-penal-code-602-criminal-trespassing/  criminal trespassing can be tried as an infraction , a misdemeanor and as a felony , depending on your criminal record and the details of the crime . 
    if you are convicted/cited for criminal trespassing you will pay a fine , that 's it . 
  you will not serve any jail time or be granted a probation term . 
    if you are convicted of criminal trespassing as a misdemeanor , the most common type of conviction , then you will face :   * up to one year in county jail   * up to $ 1,000 in fines   if you are convicted of criminal trespassing as a felony , also known as aggravated trespassing then you will face :   * up to three years in state prison   * up to $ 2,000 in fines, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicholas_ii_of_russia at the end , was a source of friction , and probably contributed directly to the world war i communist revolution . 
  nicholas ii was in part german , and his wife rather-unpopularly so . 
   nicholas was of primarily german , as well as russian and danish descent . 
  [ snip ]  on 23 february 1917 in petrograd , a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities . 
  in the streets , red banners appeared and the crowds chanted `` down with the german woman !, 
  down with protopopov !, 
  down with the war !, 
  down with the tsar !, 
  '' [ 79 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandra_feodorovna_%28alix_of_hesse%29  alexander iii and his wife maria feodorovna ( dagmar of denmark ) , both vehemently anti-german , had no intention of permitting a match with the tsarevich . 
  [ snip ]  the tsar , despite his anti-german sentiments , then sent emissaries to princess margaret of prussia , daughter of german emperor frederick iii and sister of german emperor wilhelm ii , and , who was , like alix , a granddaughter of queen victoria [ snip ]  many russians took the disaster at khodynka meadow as an omen that the reign would be unhappy . 
  others used the circumstances of the tragedy and the behaviour of the royal establishment to underscore the heartlessness of the autocracy and the contemptible shallowness of the young tsar and his `` german woman '' . 
  [ 21 ] [ snip ]  for maria 's part , she did not approve of her son 's marriage to a german bride and was appalled at her daughter-in-law 's inability to win favour with the russian people . 
  [ snip ]  during world war i , with the national citizens aroused , all the complaints russians had about the empress -- for instance , her german birth , her poor ideals , her devotion to rasputin -- circled and twisted around the deadly designs that claimed her entire family . 
  her assassination , according to the daughter of the british ambassador , was openly spoken of in aristocratic drawing rooms as the only way of saving the empire . 
  [ snip ]  during the great war , her german birth further inflamed this hatred and made her the immediate and primary focus for almost any aspect of opposition to the monarchy . 
  [ snip ]  alexandra was the focus of ever-increasing negative rumors , and was widely believed to be a german spy at the russian court . 
  [ snip ]  the decision of the tsar to take personal command of the military against advice was disastrous , as he was directly blamed for all losses . 
  his relocation to the front , leaving the empress in charge of the government , helped undermine the romanov dynasty . 
  the poor performance of the military led to rumours believed by the people that the german-born empress was part of a conspiracy to help germany win the war . 
  [ snip ]  the guards in the house often heard him refer to the deposed tsar as `` nicholas the blood-drinker '' and to alexandra as `` the german bitch '' . 
  i 'm with you on the sun , but i 'm betting retirement buyers . 
  it 's very common for people in the northern part of the us ( e.g. 
  new york ) to retire to warmer/sunnier , cheaper locations ( florida , arizona ) , and this would accomplish that in europe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matriarchy  most anthropologists hold that there are no known societies that are unambiguously matriarchal . 
  [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] according to j. m. adovasio , olga soffer , and jake page , no true matriarchy is known actually to have existed . 
  [ 50 ] anthropologist joan bamberger argued that the historical record contains no primary sources on any society in which women dominated . 
  [ 56 ] wikipedia does list a number of societies which have been considered matriarchies in some ways , though . 
  bad news for men in europe . 
  good news for women , though -- makes the market more-competitive for men , less-competitive for women . 
  also good news if you 're a guy going wife-hunting off in syria , i suppose . 
  yeah , i do n't really think that scientific programs are the things with big problems on international collaboration . 
  fermilab and cern with particle accelerators or various places around the world with telescopes or telescope arrays and the like have international teams . 
  it would n't make much sense to spend time speculating on it if it * were n't * in a foreign language and had no paywall blocking it . 
  all of europe once europeans first became europeans by living in the southeastern bit . 
  well , the soviets * were * the first ones to do a moon landing ; [ * luna-2 * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luna_2 ) was the first to crash into the moon , and [ * luna-9 * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luna_9 ) the first to touch down gently . 
  the us just happened to do the first manned moon landing in [ * apollo 11 * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apollo_11 ) . 
  this will be an unmanned moon landing . 
  did the earlier luna landings make you that unhappy that it would be essential that something like that not happen again ? 
  remember that the us would still be landing a craft there , just one with work from another space agency as well . 
  i 'm really not sure how much value the typical person places on exclusive bragging rights . 
  the soviet union built the craft that made it into space first . 
  does it cause you much upset that this happened ? 
  true enough !, 
  is there some sort of tax that causes that , or is it just the lower volume/paperwork/etc , if you happen to know ? 
  that store does seem to be kinda pricy , though . 
  msrp on that rifle [ seems to be ] ( https://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/ba50.asp ) $ 5,657.25 ( $ 5,272.86 ) and a quick search shows it at $ 4,749.99 ( $ 4,427.24 ) [ elsewhere ] ( http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?i=617800 ) . 
  it sounds like the dividing line to qualify as rainforest is 80 inches of precipitation per year .

  hmm . 
  looking at the history , have been several tries at examining europa : * in 1989 nasa and germany launch [ * galileo * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galileo_%28spacecraft%29 ) , which does a flyby of europa in 2001 . 
  success . 
  * nasa plans the [ europa orbiter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_orbiter ) ; cancelled in 2002 . 
  failure . 
  * esa and nasa plan the [ europa jupiter system mission ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_jupiter_system_mission_%e2%80%93_laplace ) ; a lack of funding causes nasa to pull out . 
  combined project canceled and esa work rolled into the esa jupiter icy moon explorer . 
  failure . 
  * [ jupiter icy moon explorer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jupiter_icy_moon_explorer ) . 
  esa mission . 
  still planned , targeting 2022 for a launch and 2030 for reaching jupiter . 
  may involve some work from japan , russia , and the us . 
  has a primary focus on ganymede rather than europa . 
  this will apparently look for molecules necessary for life and map the surface . 
  * [ europa multiple-flyby mission ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_multiple-flyby_mission ) , with a europa lander : nasa ( and based on the article , potentially also esa now ) mission . 
  launch between 2022 & 2025 , arriving in ~ 2 years . 
  this will produce a map of europa 's surface . 
  while this might launch after the jupiter icy moon explorer , it looks like it would arrive sooner and will put a lander on europa , and thus will be able to do chemical analysis of europa . 
  europa , due to having water ice on its surface and liquid beneath its surface , is [ one of the best candidates in the solar system for having some form of life ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extraterrestrial_life#planetary_habitability_in_the_solar_system ) . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_trees ) , it 's the [ sessile oak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quercus_petraea ) . 
  this map says that italy has the elm . 
  wikipedia says that italy has [ both the olive and the oak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_trees ) . 
   and it 's russia that won ww2 and liberated europe . 
  all they really did was retreat for the nazis and burn everything behind them , as to not leave anything of use for the nazis . 
  when the nazis were suicidal enough to follow them into russia ( during the winter ) and git themselves killed , the russians called it a tactic and pretended to be the big victor of the entire war .
