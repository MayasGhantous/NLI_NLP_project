  well , i suppose i 'd grant birth rates as a concern , though frankly , the fact that europe ai n't at population maintenance levels is a concern to * me * , an outside observer . 
   after the night of the long knives , hitler promoted himmler and the ss , who then zealously suppressed homosexuality , saying : `` we must exterminate these people root and branch ... the homosexual must be eliminated . '', 
  taken as a whole , europe 's probably the most gay-friendly region in the world today . 
   the nazi party programme of 1920 guaranteed freedom for all religious denominations not hostile to the state and endorsed positive christianity to combat `` the jewish-materialist spirit '' . 
  [ 163 ] it was a modified version of christianity which emphasised racial purity and nationalism . 
  [ 164 ] the nazis were aided by theologians , such as , ernst bergmann . 
  bergmann , in his work , die 25 thesen der deutschreligion ( twenty-five points of the german religion ) , held that the old testament and portions of the new testament of the bible were inaccurate . 
  he claimed that jesus was not a jew but of aryan origin , and that adolf hitler was the new messiah . 
  if anyone claims that nigel farage is the new messiah with a straight face , i 'm pretty sure that they 're going to be laughed down . 
   generally speaking , nazi theorists and politicians blamed germany 's previous economic failures on political causes like the influence of marxism on the workforce , the sinister and exploitative machinations of what they called international jewry , and the vindictiveness of the western political leaders ` war reparation ' demands . 
  instead of traditional economic incentives , the nazis offered solutions of a political nature , such as the elimination of organized labour groups , rearmament ( in contravention of the versailles treaty ) , and biological politics . 
  does n't seem on the radar to me . 
  though i wish you guys would properly-arm yourself as per the nato target agreement . 
  :-p  historians ian kershaw and joachim fest argue that in post-world war i germany , the nazis were one of many nationalist and fascist political parties contending for the leadership of germany 's anti-communist movement . 
  the nazis claimed that communism was dangerous to the well-being of nations because of its intention to dissolve private property , its support of class conflict , its aggression against the middle class , its hostility towards small business , and its atheism . 
  does n't seem like there 's a communist revolution being fought against at the moment . 
   the nazis argued that capitalism damages nations due to international finance , the economic dominance of big business , and jewish influences . 
  i 'm gon na go out on a limb and say that there 's less opposition to capitalism today than in the 1930s . 
   under nazism , with its emphasis on the nation , individual needs were subordinate to those of the wider community . 
  [ 210 ] hitler declared that `` every activity and every need of every individual will be regulated by the collectivity represented by the party '' and that `` there are no longer any free realms in which the individual belongs to himself '' . 
  [ 211 ] himmler justified the establishment of a repressive police state , in which the security forces could exercise power arbitrarily , as national security and order should take precedence over the needs of the individual . 
  probably the furthest a european state has gone here is france 's state of emergency . 
  that 's a long way from a totalitarian government . 
  to be fair , only 187 of them exist . 
  how about the uk ? 
  frankly , that 's hyperbolic too , just like the parent post that you were responding to . 
  it might cause cultural pressures or force down wages in some fields , but i 'm very doubtful that people by-and-large want only handouts -- they want access to a high-paying labor market . 
   and the only thing you want is food and water and some clothes . 
  that 's hyperbole -- food and water and clothes are available outside europe . 
  what people are looking for is for high-paying jobs . 
  not that i blame them for wanting to come to europe for that , but it 's not because the alternative is starvation . 
  in some things , certainly we 've split with their positions . 
  i do n't think that there 's been a rejection of that position , though . 
  do you feel that the us is particularly easy for outside countries to subjugate ? 
  if not , why the eu ? 
  you mean the fact that anti-immigration parties are gaining in influence due to immigration ? 
  the same happened in the us at the end of the 1800s . 
  did n't result in civil war . 
  looking at what kicked things off last time around : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_of_world_war_ii  ** anti-communism **   the internationalist-minded , radical bolsheviks seized power in russia in november 1917 , with the goal of overthrowing capitalism across the world . 
  they supported communist parties in many lands and helped set up similar regimes in hungary and bavaria , azerbaijan , armenia and georgia . 
  this caused many europeans to fear that a violent communist revolution would overwhelm their own countries . 
  there is no realistic comparable political threat to europe today . 
  islam is n't even on the radar -- european countries are probably , as a whole , more stable these days than they have been in a long time . 
   ** expansionism **   expansionism is the doctrine of expanding the territorial base ( or economic influence ) of a country , usually by means of military aggression . 
  in europe , italy under benito mussolini sought to create a new roman empire based around the mediterranean . 
  it invaded albania in early 1939 , at the start of the war , and later invaded greece . 
  italy had also invaded ethiopia as early as 1935 . 
  this provoked angry words and an oil embargo from the league of nations , which failed . 
    under the nazi regime , germany began its own program of expansion , seeking to restore the `` rightful '' boundaries of historic germany . 
  as a prelude toward these goals the rhineland was remilitarized in march 1936 . 
  [ 5 ] the bulk of wealth today comes not from land , but from the people on that land . 
  war displaces people and destroys infrastructure . 
  war is n't a terribly-good way to take capital goods in europe today . 
  honestly , effectively gaining wealth via conquest was archaic by world war ii as well . 
   ** militarism **   militarism is the principle or policy of maintaining a large military establishment , with the view that military efficiency is the supreme ideal of a state . 
  [ 6 ] a highly militaristic and aggressive national ideology prevailed in germany , japan and italy . 
  [ 7 ] this attitude fuelled military advancement and expansion as well while their revolutionary motivated background were commanding an increase in propaganda , which led to increased tensions among the axis powers and their opponents in the run up to the war . 
  christ , we 're hard-pressed to cajole almost every european country to * maintain * military capability . 
  militarism is not an issue . 
   ** racism **   twentieth-century events marked the culmination of a millennium-long process of intermingling between germans and slavs . 
  over the centuries , many germans had settled in the east ( examples being the volga germans invited to russia by catherine the great , and the ostsiedlung in medieval times ) . 
  such migratory patterns created enclaves and blurred ethnic frontiers . 
  the rise of nationalism in the 19th century made race a centerpiece of political loyalty . 
  the rise of the nation-state had given way to the politics of identity , including pan-germanism and pan-slavism . 
  furthermore , social-darwinist theories framed the coexistence as a `` teuton vs. slav '' struggle for domination , land and limited resources . 
  [ 9 ] integrating these ideas into their own world-view , the nazis believed that the germans , the `` aryan race '' , were the master race and that the slavs were inferior . 
  [ 10 ] ehhh ... maybe a bit of this behind some of the concerns over immigration , but we 're an awfully long way from the 1930s . 
  decades of time , and a great intensification would be necessary . 
  ukip might want to close out some of the outside world , but nigel farage is nowhere near running an violent ethnic conflict . 
  the european union has [ free trade agreements with substantial chunks of the globe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) . 
  if you 're worried about low labor costs impacting the eu , there is already trade with more-dissimilar economies . 
  italy has nearly as many people as the uk ( 60m to 65m ) . 
  spain is at 46m , ukraine 42m , poland at 38m . 
  after that , there 's something of a drop to romania at 20m . 
  it 's true that these countries do have a lower per-capita gdp than germany , france , and the uk , so their economies are disproportionately-smaller , but in terms of population , they are not much smaller than the big three . 
  and poland in particular has seen economic growth ( though i think that splitting the eu up again would probably hinder that growth ) . 
  you mean by an outside force ? 
  [ the us 's founding ] ( http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/quotable/quote71.htm ) fathers [ felt the opposite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/join,_or_die ) . 
  i think that the eu is decidedly in the long-term interest of the eu members . 
  that being said , world war iii is not the only alternative to the eu . 
  there have been technological , economic , and social changes since then ; the fact that europe was historically often at war with itself does not mean that it must always be at war . 
  when we and the brits split , this side agreed on [ no more titles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/title_of_nobility_clause ) , particularly hereditary ones . 
  the guy who shot them was an off-duty police officer being paid to work security on this event on a private basis -- a lot of cops moonlight as security . 
  you [ give everyone else guns and shoot them ] ( http://legacy.wfaa.com/story/news/crime/2015/05/03/garland-curtis-culwell-center-swat/26848435/ ) ? 
  cash is not impervious to changing in real value -- look at the ruble . 
  in the long term , markets have [ generally provided a consistent return ] ( http://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/ ) . 
  norway does n't want to join because she does n't want to share oil money , right ? 
  oil is probably going to be low for some time to come . 
  < considers  no monarchy , free speech protection gets ramped up , guns , maltese is n't an official language , no financial transaction tax , australia and new zealand get auxiliary membership ? 
  norway , switzerland , turkey , ukraine ? 
   since when has it become acceptable to insult another person . 
  since quite some time back . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satire  satire is a genre of literature , and sometimes graphic and performing arts , in which vices , follies , abuses , and shortcomings are held up to ridicule , ideally with the intent of shaming individuals , corporations , government or society itself , into improvement . 
  [ 1 ] although satire is usually meant to be humorous , its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism , using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society . 
  [ snip ]  for its nature and social role , satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions . 
  [ 20 ] the satiric impulse , and its ritualized expressions , carry out the function of resolving social tension . 
  [ 21 ] [ snip ]  horatian satire , named for the roman satirist horace ( 65 -- 8 bce ) , playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle , mild , and light-hearted humour . 
  horace ( quintus horatius flaccus ) wrote satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and `` philosophical beliefs of ancient rome and greece '' ( rankin ) . 
  [ 28 ] rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones , he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery . 
  horatian satire follows this same pattern of `` gently [ ridiculing ] the absurdities and follies of human beings '' ( drury ) .
