  this bit is n't really fair . 
  the ussr did more fighting in europe against germany than anyone else . 
  yes , they retreated , but just about every military in europe did that at some point . 
  and retreat is a legitimate tactic . 
  they also did their share of advancing . 
  if you want to criticize the ussr , i 'd do so via saying that they were first complicit in the german annexation , swapping part of poland for their non-involvement , and later took the opportunity to seize countries for themselves . 
  however , soviets did fight very much in europe , regardless of the goals that their government had . 
  canada , the uk ( at least on their second at-bat against germany ) , the us , and the forces of some governments-in-exile entered europe only after the worst was over , and were probably more-influential in keeping the ussr from acquiring more of western europe than in blocking hitler . 
  afaik russia and armenia [ get along well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenia%e2%80%93russia_relations ) . 
  http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/2015/05/31/guided-bomb-makers-gps-jammers-battlefield-spoof-munitions-laser-jdam/28117951/ they do n't need anti-satellite capability to stop gps , and yes , gps jamming has been considered ; having backup inertial navigation on things that would use gps is one approach . 
  however , there are still reasons to want to act : ukraine was clearly reaching out to the eu . 
  if countries that do so may be stomped and this is permitted , it obviously rather discourages countries from being able to reach out . 
  furthermore , if states that get rid of their nuclear weapons are allowed to be clobbered after they dump nukes , states might in the future be less-willing to do so : ukraine trusted that were they to surrender their nuclear weapons , neither russia nor the us would clobber them . 
  even if a future country believes that the us would n't clobber them , if russia plans to do so , that 's a pretty significant discouragement to dumping nukes . 
  my suspicion is also that an economic spat was viewed as preferable to a military one . 
  an economic spat will cause damage , but it 's spread-out and limited in scope , and not to ukraine . 
  a shooting war in ukraine will depopulate chunks of ukraine , maybe dump mines and other things all over , trash cities , and so forth . 
  having a healthy ukraine at the end trading with the eu is rather better than having a devastated ukraine ( yes , i know that ukraine 's suffered damage , but nothing like what the koreas did after china/ussr fought the us/uk across them before ) . 
  let 's say that there 's a limited , conventional war in ukraine against russia in which the us and eu come out on top . 
  that 's a `` victory '' , but now ukraine is trashed and has to be rebuilt and russia 's more-firmly established a disincentive to associate with the eu . 
  that 's not exactly what the eu would most want to see . 
  well , the wikipedia page i linked to mentions that even with respect to the current russian fleet it 's an issue and cites * jane 's * :  * jane 's fighting ships * has noted in recent editions that some ships have little capability , but remain flying an ensign so that crews are entitled to be paid . 
  [ 1 ] [ * jane 's * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jane's_information_group ) is british and afaik considered to be reputable ; given their business , i 'd have a hard time buying that barring an imminent life-or-death war , the british government could convince them to intentionally publish radically-incorrect information about russian naval capabilities . 
  i do n't know if that 's what you 're looking for , or if you 're suspicious that while they might be in bad shape now , they were probably still in good shape in 1990 . 
  looking online , at midway , the us did try to commit its entire pacific fleet ; [ * uss saratoga * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_saratoga_%28cv-3%29 ) was not able to reach the battle in time as there were delays in loading aircraft in san diego ; even so , she still headed out before her captain even showed up to make it aboard in the hopes that she could reach the battle in time . 
  could you provide me with a specific , single , reliable source saying that germany could not have its gold ? 
  the [ land giveaways to russians in the far east that russia has been running ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/moscow-to-give-free-land-to-every-russian-in-far-east/514658.html ) have probably been aimed at establishing firmer claims to that land ; same as the us and land giveaways in the west a century and a half ago . 
  russia probably would n't be doing that without at least some concerns along these lines . 
   a program giving every resident of russia 's far east a free hectare of land could start this year , the minister in charge of the region said tuesday , following a nod of support from president vladimir putin the day before . 
  [ snip ]  however , the land will not be for resale to foreign citizens , an important consideration in the sparsely-populated and under-developed far east , where chinese , japanese and south korean companies are gradually making inroads . 
  china in particular is betting big on the region -- in april , beijing announced it would channel $ 5 billion into infrastructure projects there . 
    russian law currently allows foreigners to own land not zoned for agricultural purposes , as long as that land does not border a foreign country . 
  i was trying to find sites that try to estimate military rankings , and i have n't seen anything that 's really better . 
  the problem is that it depends too much on individual specifics of the conflict . 
  for example , the us could easily stomp china in a conventional naval conflict insofar as sinking ships go ... but i 'd be doubtful that the us could occupy and control china or that the us could muster the political will to do so . 
  / r/credibledefense had [ a post up last week ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/credibledefense/comments/3yg75p/is_there_a_global_ranking_of_nations_military/ ) where someone asked for this , and you can find people discussing the problems in trying to evaluate a simple rank . 
  if a nuclear power was involved and willing to go nuclear , almost any nuclear power would dominate any non-nuclear power ... but the us withdrew from vietnam rather than make use of nuclear weapons , and no country has used nuclear weapons in anger since the two dropped in world war ii . 
  in the pacific theater of world war ii , if the us had had to fight all of japan 's ground forces , it would have been rather more-costly ... but instead , the us could simply cut off islands and leave japanese forces stranded , forcing japan into naval and air battles , mostly avoiding major land battles . 
  the us could not ( particularly with current deployments ) stop russian tanks from initially rolling into estonia , but it can make it unacceptably costly to keep them there . 
  i think that you could probably separate countries into a handful of `` bands '' of approximate military strength , but any comparison between any two countries is invariably going to rely on what sort of conflict the two are in and what their goals are . 
   in 15 years china will have just begun that slow demographic death that results from an inverted population period , just as it begins to transition from industrial to modern economy . 
  ehh ... [ as of 2013 , germany had a fertility rate of 1.4 , japan of 1.4 , italy of 1.4 , and china of 1.7 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in ) , and ~ 2.1 ( possibly slightly-higher in china due to mortality ) is required for population maintenance in a developed economy . 
  that 's not to say that china does n't face a real and legitimate issue there , but it 's not the worst-off out there . 
  also , it 's easier for china to grow economically on a per-capita basis than it is wealthier economies . 
   similarly , you ca n't look at comparing single equipment totals because equipment gets used differently . 
  the us has 10 carriers because it rotates carriers in groups of three ( plus one permanently deployed in japan ) so that one is at sea while one has just come home and one is training to go replace the one deployed . 
  the same will be true for anyone with a navy -- there 's only a certain percentage of the time that the equipment is active ; it 's not unique to the us . 
  ditto for tanks , aircraft , and so forth . 
  iirc , as of world war ii , tanks spent about one-third of their life in maintenance : it 's a pretty large chunk of time . 
  so , yeah , there 's only partial availability , but the same multiplier affects the comparable militaries as well . 
  well , i do n't know whether you consider it american or not in this context , but wikipedia maintains pages with rough quantities of military equipment belonging to most countries . 
  i 'm not sure whether you 're questioning the soviet-era quantities or the current russian ones , but this will have the present hardware along with links to primary sources . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_russian_navy_ships also related : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_equipment_of_the_russian_ground_forces https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_russian_military_aircraft the `` list of active ships '' page also describes some of the issues in evaluating the count of functioning ships . 
  well , it was n't primarily driven by us concerns , but the us is involved in syria and libya . 
  there 's also some non-violent stuff going on over by china with air and water claims . 
  for any one product , perhaps that 's true . 
  but china represents such a large block ... trying to transition from china to india as a manufactured goods supplier across the board all at once would be an insane task . 
  [ looking at a gdp list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29 ) , sweden is roughly on par with the other examples : sweden is # 22 , brazil # 7 , mexico # 15 , austria # 28 , poland # 23 . 
  [ the prc and cambodia also have strong ties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambodia%e2%80%93china_relations ) . 
  keep in mind that her potential opponents have also shrunk somewhat . 
  's why i 'm saying it 'd be like the us and ussr fighting a nuclear war -- probably not going to happen , but it has that * potential * , which is pretty significant . 
  what 's your source for germany not being able to get access to it ? 
   struck by sanctions , russia 's defense production will be hampered by a lack of a domestic high tech industry , sometimes in the unlikeliest of ways : for example , modern fighters and the armata tank make extensive use of lcd displays to convey information to the crew . 
  russia , unlike the much smaller south korea , has no domestic lcd industry . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  surely east asia , which is not sanctioning russia , is the global center of lcd production ? 
  which country has gold in the united states and could n't get access to it ? 
   you 're massively overestimating them . 
  economically , the us , china , and the eu ( if you imagined that the eu would federalize ) would be roughly-comparable . 
  i agree that china does n't have the military impact of the ussr , but the ussr also did n't have economic impact on the world in the way that china does . 
  if ( and china is extremely-unlikely to do this any more than the us would to china , just as the ussr and the us did not want to get into an incredibly-destructive nuclear war ) , china were to sanction the us or the eu , it would cripple their economies . 
  that 's a substantial amount of clout . 
  wikipedia 's definitions : [ wikipedia : superpower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superpower ) : ex : us  superpower is a word used to describe a state with a dominant position in international relations and which is characterised by its unparalleled ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale . 
  this is done through the means of both military and economic strength , as well as diplomatic and soft power influence . 
  traditionally , superpowers are preeminent among the great powers ( e.g. , as the united states is today ) . 
  the term first applied to the british empire , the united states , and the soviet union . 
  however , following world war ii and the suez crisis in 1956 , the united kingdom 's status as a superpower was greatly diminished ; for the duration of the cold war the united states and the soviet union came to be generally regarded as the two remaining superpowers , dominating world affairs . 
  at the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 , only the united states appeared to fulfill the criteria of being a world superpower . 
    alice lyman miller defines a superpower as `` a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world , and sometimes , in more than one region of the globe at a time , and so may plausibly attain the status of global hegemony . 
  '' [ 4 ] [ wikipedia : great power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_power ) : ex : china , france , russia , uk , us  a great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale . 
  great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength , as well as diplomatic and soft power influence , which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers ' opinions before taking actions of their own . 
  international relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities , spatial aspects , and status dimensions . 
  sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the congress of vienna [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] or an international structure such as the united nations security council ( china , france , russia , the united kingdom and the united states serve as the body 's five permanent members ) . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 6 ] at the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the g7 which consists of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united kingdom and the united states of america . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]   the term `` great power '' was first used to represent the most important powers in europe during the post-napoleonic era . 
  the `` great powers '' constituted the `` concert of europe '' and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties . 
  [ 11 ] the formalization of the division between small powers [ 12 ] and great powers came about with the signing of the treaty of chaumont in 1814 . 
  since then , the international balance of power has shifted numerous times , most dramatically during world war i and world war ii . 
  while some nations are widely considered to be great powers , there is no definitive list of them . 
  in literature , alternative terms for great power are often world power [ 13 ] or major power , [ 14 ] but these terms can also be interchangeable with superpower . 
  [ 15 ] [ wikipedia : middle power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle_power ) : ex : austria , brazil , mexico , sweden , poland  in international relations , a middle power is a sovereign state that is not a superpower or a great power , but still has large or moderate influence and international recognition . 
  the concept of the `` middle power '' dates back to the origins of the european state system . 
  in the late 16th century , italian political thinker giovanni botero divided the world into three types of states -- grandissime ( empires ) , mezano ( middle powers ) and piccioli ( small powers ) . 
  according to botero , a mezano or middle power '' ... has sufficient strength and authority to stand on its own without the need of help from others . 
  '' [ 1 ] [ wikipedia : small power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/small_power ) : ex : albania , cyprus , estonia , moldova , slovenia  the international system is for the most part made up by small powers or small states . 
  while a small power in the international system may never equal or surpass the impact of larger powers , they can nevertheless influence the workings of the international system together with others . 
  ** finally , outside of the above spectrum ** : [ wikipedia : regional power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regional_power ) : ex : south africa , brazil , china , turkey , germany  in international relations , a regional power is a state that has power within a geographic region . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] states which wield unrivalled power and influence within a region of the world possess regional hegemony . 
    regional powers shape the polarity of a regional area . 
  typically , regional powers have capabilities which are important in the region but do not have capabilities at a global scale .
