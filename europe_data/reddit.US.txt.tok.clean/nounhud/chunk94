   unless the netherlands are willing to invoke article 5 i am pretty sure that most would not consider mh17 an attack on the netherlands . 
  the united kingdom of great britain , northern ireland , france , czech republic , hungary , poland , and slovakia . 
  / r/vexillology / lives for moments like this . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  i 've spent time in pittsburgh myself . 
  it 's not a bad place . 
  i just had n't ever thought of it as something with a lot of overseas interest , in perhaps the same way that you might not think of sunderland as something with a lot of visibility in the us . 
  hope you get a chance to go through there !, 
  we 're sitting on a thin crust on a [ ball of molten material ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mantle_%28geology%29 ) :  past episodes of melting and volcanism at the shallower levels of the mantle have produced a thin crust of crystallized melt products near the surface , upon which we live . 
  [ 15 ] about [ half of the geothermal energy we see is from radioactive decay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/earth's_internal_heat_budget ) :  the flow of heat from earth 's interior to the surface is estimated at 47 terawatts ( tw ) [ 1 ] and comes from two main sources in roughly equal amounts : the radiogenic heat produced by the radioactive decay of isotopes in the mantle and crust , and the primordial heat left over from the formation of the earth . 
  [ 2 ] ... to say nothing of the fact that we 're constantly-bathed in the radiation of a rather-large [ fusion reactor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sun ) which can [ certainly cause cancer and all that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melanoma ) . 
   you can dream but that is never going to happen in poland . 
  if ( and i 'm assuming here ) that you believe that there are countries that do have more-objective media , what is it that you believe is unique and fundamental to poland that you believe would prevent this ? 
  i am interested in the discussion that poles have been bringing up , as i had n't been aware of any of the tug-of-war over government media . 
  would you support some sort of eu generic treaty that would affect future changes from both pis and po as well as other members similarly ? 
  nov 11 , 2015 : [ berlusconi starts comeback with renzi attack ] ( http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/berlusconi-starts-comeback-with-renzi-attack-34181664.html ) i was suspecting that there was going to be a large political backlash over eu immigration based on the strength of the ~ 1880s backlash in the us . 
  [ not on the english-language wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_little_mermaid_%28statue%29 ) , though . 
   even the usa , which is a larger foreign policy ally of the uk than the rest of the eu is , did not take the uk 's side in the falklands dispute . 
  reagan opposed the uk military operation & wanted argentinian sovereignty . 
  the [ us privately-guaranteed the uk a us helicopter carrier -- comparable to the harrier platforms that the uk used -- if it lost an aircraft carrier ] ( http://news.usni.org/2012/06/27/reagan-readied-us-warship-82-falklands-war-0 ) :  lehman and then secretary of defense caspar weinberger agreed to support u.k. prime minister margaret thatcher with the loan of the amphibious warship * uss iwo jima * , he said . 
  [ snip ]  reagan approved the request without hesitation and his instructions to weinberger had been simple , `` give maggie everything she needs to get on with it , '' lehman said in the speech . 
  argentina 's best shot at winning the war would have been knocking out british naval aviation using its limited supply of exocets ; at that point , argentinian land-based air power would have dominated . 
  this nullified that possibility . 
  the us also provided satellite surveillance used by the uk . 
  http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nsaebb/nsaebb374/ this documents some of the other things , including diplomatic moves like vetoing un resolutions , including discussion of the us 's position :  though the u.s. did not formally announce support for the u.k. until april 30 , newly released documents show that washington sided with the british from the beginning , providing substantial logistical and intelligence support . 
  in a conversation with british officials at the end of march , haig declared that the u.s. diplomatic effort * `` will of course , have a greater chance of influencing argentine behavior if we appear to them not to favor one side or the other . 
   widespread urban decay , broadly-speaking , cities have been growing since sometime around the 1970s . 
  there are exceptions , like detroit , but that 's not the norm . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , why pittsburgh ? 
  i 've never thought of it as a city with a particularly-high international profile . 
  maybe for successfully restructuring a city originally-based on heavy industry or something . 
  honestly , if poland 's government is truly concerned that deeply about nato not actually acting on commitments to provide common defense , nato should be doing something independently . 
  poland should not need to be in a position of having to cut deals in order to obtain reasonable guarantees of action . 
  nato members signed up to provide a common defense , and if that guarantee is n't seen as being credible , that seems like a substantial and fundamental issue for nato to address . 
  my understanding is that it 's not uncommon for people to prefer a doctor of their own gender . 
  i certainly do n't see that as a problem . 
  i am failing to see how this serves russian interests . 
  i want to see romania . 
  crazy self-hate . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't think so .

  would n't you need to be educated in tradition to be following a tradition ? 
  i 'm no expert on turkey 's weather , but [ it looks like turkey 's prevailing wind in december is from the northwest , or inland asia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lodos ) . 
  wind coming from over land tends to hit more temperature extremes than wind coming from over water . 
  it might explain why turkey , despite being further south , is presently [ rather colder than most of europe ] ( http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/eurovor.htm ) . 
  if i were writing in swedish , i 'd certainly do so . 
  hmm . 
  i guess that 's possible -- i had n't considered the idea that some group might say `` we will attack city x on new year 's eve '' . 
  ( interesting trivia note : spanish separatists giving such a warning inadvertently started a chain of problems that resulted in [ the world 's deadliest air disaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenerife_airport_disaster ) ) . 
  i was thinking of law enforcement uncovering an attack with enough information to give a useful warning , but lacking enough information to arrest people . 
   `` i know that in their faith , there is a different view on spirituality , '' he said . 
  `` we were responsive to them but somewhere you have to use your common sense and believe in science . '', 
  i dunno if this is is a function of islam . 
  a staggering chunk of people across cultures do believe in some variant of ghosts , even in the developed world . 
  [ pew found that as of 2009 , 18 % of people in the us believe that they , personally , have seen a ghost at some point ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/30/18-of-americans-say-theyve-seen-a-ghost/ ) . 
  note that this is [ a substantial increase in recent years ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/70-more-americans-believe-in-ghosts-than-20-years-ago-2009-12 ) , perhaps because of [ paranormal tv shows ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paranormal_television ) . 
  in 2013 , [ 42 % of americans responded that they believed in ghosts . 
  52 % of britons did the same . 
  and neither of these places has the highest percentage of ghost-believers in the world . ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/why-do-people-believe-in-ghosts/379072/ ) . 
  [ this poll of britons found even slightly-higher numbers ] ( http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/more-people-believe-in-aliens-and-ghosts-than-god--xj3xftsaie ) : more than twice as many britons believe in ghosts as believe in god . 
  < shrug  [ nobody 's informed nato ] ( http://www.nato.int/ ) themselves , then . 
   elbow grease i had no idea that phrase [ was as old as it is ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=elbow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) :  phrase * elbow grease * `` hard rubbing '' is attested from 1670s , from jocular sense of `` the best substance for polishing furniture . '', 
  i 'm not saying that nato is somehow imposing expansion on other countries , just that the effect is for nato to expand . 
  point is that nato is nothing new , and it would be very strange for russia to be suddenly writing about its very existence . 
  nato 's current size is comparatively-young . 
  the article title was rather misleading , whereas the subtitle made sense . 
  just to be clear , because i think some people are not reading the article and just going off the title ... this is `` extends '' as in `` lengthen the term of an existing deal '' , not `` offer a new deal '' . 
  it is not either side making any territorial concessions . 
  it is both sides agreeing not to start a shooting war up , and to instead keep the conflict in the economic realm . 
  title of article : silly and nonsensical-sounding :  russia security paper designates nato as threat subtitle , which is much more understandable :  russian president vladimir putin has signed an updated national security paper describing ** nato 's expansion ** as a threat to the country . 
  just bad title choice from the bbc . 
  also , bbc , it should be `` nato '' , not `` nato '' . 
   inner cities are filled with smoke , noise and people specifically , drunk , ineffective people . 
  that being said , i do n't recall a public warning ever going out before an actual attack that happened , so ... < shrug , 
  hmm . 
  is that actually affected ? 
  it looks like the non-satellite marine weather forecast broadcast system is called [ navtex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navtex ) , and germany only [ appears to operate one of the stations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_navtex_stations ) . 
  germany 's navtex station appears to broadcast on 518khz , whereas this article says that 530khz-1600khz is affected . 
  i 'm kinda suspicious that they 're just talking about consumer am radio . 
  eh , they 're just moving to a more-efficient encoding , yes ? 
  i do n't think i 'd be sad about that . 
  maybe sad about the fact that building a practical radio receiver is n't a simple hobbyist project any more ... 
  you 're saying the same thing that i am . 
  as long as there 's sufficient demand to warrant construction and nothing impedes it , it will happen . 
  if the existing prices are above the price of constructing new residences , unless you expect regulation to permanently curtail development , i 'd call it a bubble . 
  great if you were a property owner pre-bubble into the bubble , though . 
  i read reddit heavily , and i am unfamiliar with both `` punching sharks '' and `` pizza rat '' . 
  well , you can defer runoff by placing it in storage somewhere , then releasing it gradually . 
  one of the major reasons for building dams . 
  i do n't know anything about flood-resistance designs , but if someone was purchasing something to actually try and withstand something like this , surely they 'd have a metal frame rather than wood ? 
  i 'm simply saying that that the previous situation is an input , a factor in distinguishing estonia from some other places in europe . 
  in the us , a far , far smaller number of refugees than in europe are being placed -- the federal government theoretically signed on for 10k in 2016 , and already the majority of state governors have [ rejected the federal government placing syrian refugees in their state ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/world/paris-attacks-syrian-refugees-backlash/ ) . 
  in addition , [ most americans are opposed ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-11-18/bloomberg-poll-most-americans-oppose-syrian-refugee-resettlement ) to any acceptance at all of syrian refugees to the us . 
  the us did n't just go through estonia 's recent history , so i certainly do n't think that that sort of situation is required to dislike refugee settlement . 
  seems to me that darwin 's already got this one well in hand . 
  only people that are affected by it are the unvaccinated , and people are disadvantaging their own gene propagation , so ... < shrug , 
  my understanding is that this long-predates erdogan . 
  i doubt that russia would be super-enthusiastic about handing over instances of her sam systems to a nato member . 
  estonia has had a recent history of people settled in estonia by another country .
