  are there any turks on here who honestly want your leadership doing this ? 
  gamma way down , saturation way up . 
  in the us ( and , i suspect , canada ) , biking is mostly a recreational thing , though , rather than someone 's primary mode of transportation . 
  and many of those trails are actually trails -- like , a place to get out into nature on your bicycle . 
  that 's not to say that people do n't ever bicycle-commute in the us -- my father biked into work for some years , and i did for some years as well -- but it 's definitely extremely uncommon . 
  things are fairly spread-out , and few places have bike trails intended for * commuting * , between residential areas and offices . 
  sure , you can bike on the road , and some places have bike lanes , but it 's always a bit disconcerting to have one 's unprotected body a foot from motor vehicles zinging by . 
  i do not think that commuter biking would catch on in most of the us -- if you can afford a car and can fit sufficient cars on the roads , i think that they 're a better option , as they work well in all weather , for people of all ages , they can travel faster , etc -- but in some high-density areas , bicycles may make sense . 
  i also suspect that self-driving cars may wind up being the death knell of a lot of non-car transportation options , both bicycles and mass transit , and those are definitely coming down the pipe soon . 
   enslaved conventionally , `` slavery '' and `` having to work '' are n't treated as the same thing . 
  ah , fair enough . 
   ... unless oil begins to turn around , it 's difficult to envision anything but a retest of the all-time intraday day set last december at 79.18 . 
  record low since ... one year ago . 
  i 'm sure that sanctioned goods will still tend to flow via the black market , but it 's also true that middlemen will tack on extra cost to compensate themselves for their risk , so it does result in reduced sales on both sides . 
  that kinda is what sanctions are all about : to see who gives in to the economic pain first . 
  there 's a polandball comic which i ca n't find showing norway running around with expensive windmills , dams , electric cars , and other trendy green tech , and poland asking norway ( an oil nation ) where all the money came from to buy these . 
  sweden and finland ranked at the top of the most-strongly opposed ? 
   why finland hates putin so much ? 
  more than even turkey ... or usa . 
  putin has , barring all-out strategic nuclear war , a limited ability to affect the us . 
  and as some others have pointed out , i suspect that a new poll would make putin pretty unpopular in turkey . 
  not often that one finds a supporter of the khans . 
  it made me impatient . 
  would have preferred a non-animated map with shading based on date . 
  if i understand correctly , you 're saying that the 2013 russia gdp numbers should be used instead of the 2015 russia gdp numbers because the ruble has dropped substantially since 2013 . 
  is n't that a true drop , though ? 
  if you 're using the nominal gdp numbers , it 's presumably because you 're interested in international economic power rather than standard of living . 
  if you continue to be interested in international economic power , i do n't entirely understand why using current nominal numbers would be inappropriate simply because that value has dropped abruptly . 
  the more ships sunk , the more need for iron ore to build more , i suppose . 
  hmm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_russia  $ 1.235 trillion ( october 2015 ) ( nominal ) [ 1 ]   $ 3.473 trillion ( october 2015 ) ( ppp ) [ 1 ] what 's the source of the $ 2t number ? 
  would you want british commitments to be limited in defense of existing french territories comparable to the falklands , like the [ french overseas departments and territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_departments_and_territories_of_france ) and the [ french overseas collectivities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_collectivity ) ? 
  if not , it does n't seem so crazy to draw a line that requires defense of existing nations but permits a member nation to operate independently outside of territories belonging to eu members . 
  gibraltar would have its own mess of questions , admittedly , since any dispute would involve two eu members . 
  < shrug  i am pretty blank as to why you 're willing to write multiple posts saying that you do n't need to write anything rather than just four sentences or so listing the policies in the article that you are concerned about . 
   continuation of policies that led to both please enlighten me . 
  that article does not explicitly talk about eu interests being violated . 
  i 'm fine with reading that as support , but i 'd like you to clearly state what it is that you feel turkey is doing that is in conflict with eu member state interests so that i know what to examine . 
  as an aside : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_mexico  the oecd and wto both rank mexican workers as the hardest-working in the world in terms of the amount of hours worked yearly ... 
  could you expand on specifically what * you * feel is a danger in turkey 's current policies to eu member interests ? 
  well , right now you 've got an administrative division . 
  you want a popular division , you got ta do the things that matter to people . 
  you got the flag , that 's cool . 
  but there 's no european equivalent of the bald eagle , bear , or panda . 
  no animal , no european nationalism , no country in the popular mind . 
  the closest is europa and [ the bull that raped europa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_%28mythology%29#abduction ) which shows up on [ your residence permits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbols_of_europe#europa_and_the_bull ) . 
  that 's just confusing : is the thing to put in cartoons to personify europe the girl europa , the bull that raped her , or both ? 
  all just kinda awkward as a national symbol . 
  how about patriotic imagery ? 
  that 's tied up with having a national identity . 
  there 's next-to-nothing . 
  let 's look at google image searches for four different things : * [ patriotic `` united states '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1247&amp;bih=1046&amp;q=patriotic+%22united+states%22 ) : eagles , monuments , flags , us constitution , military victories , mingling of religion and nationalism , super-excited stuff . 
  * [ patriotic russia ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1247&amp;bih=1046&amp;q=patriotic+russia ) : flags , parades , major leaders , military stuff , people being excited and smiling about it . 
  * [ patriotic china ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1247&amp;bih=1046&amp;q=patriotic+china ) : pro-china graffiti , military , parades , flags , glamorized art , major leaders . 
  * [ patriotic europe ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1247&amp;bih=1046&amp;q=patriotic+europe ) : aside from a few flags and one [ image ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/09/europe-gordon-brown-scotland-eu-business-britain ) , nothing on the first page could be seen as glamorous and specific to the eu ( and that was from an article on ukip ) . 
  mostly what shows up is german flags , with a bit of british stuff thrown in , and it 's mostly in a negative light . 
  i have a hard time believing that the bulk of the public are going to be excited about something being sold as maybe a sensible administrative division . 
  you worried about nationalism because of the prospect for wars or splitting up by member country , fine , but i have a hard time seeing things going places unless a new , european nationalism , a new identity is crafted . 
  yeah , / r/murica is half-tongue-in-cheek , but the point is that it 's easy to find content for that . 
  / r/yurop is kinda dry , and even that is mostly talking about member nations or comparing europe to someone else ( mostly the us ) . 
  wikipedia [ says that it 's going to be made into a port ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neum ) :  neum is planned to be a freight port . 
  there are plans to build a real seaport , rail and a motorway and thus the croatian bridge must have a high clearance according to the view of bosnia and herzegovina . 
  the main freight port for bosnia and herzegovina today is plo\u010de ( in croatia ) further north , which has a railway to bosnia-herzegovina . 
  [ future port of neum ] ( http://bosnjaci.net/print.php?pid=24398 ), 
   while receiving a tiny fraction of the effectiveness the us would receive for the same amount of money . 
  hmm . 
  that 's actually an interesting question -- how do you measure that ? 
  i mean , military budget sometimes gets used as a rough proxy for effectiveness , but to make this statement , you need to have something that could be agreed upon as better-representing effectiveness so that you could compare the budget to it . 
   nato-required well , nato-targeted . 
  nato ca n't really require anything outside of what people have signed up for in the treaties . 
   if europe wants to rake in many of the benefits of a single military before then , there 's a way to do it : much more enhanced cooperation on military r&d . this has been tried ( albeit sometimes without success ) . 
  we were [ talking about this the other day ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xpr53/germany_plans_to_develop_new_fighter_jet_to/cy76g0b?context=2 ) : the [ eurofighter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurofighter_typhoon ) and the [ french/uk aircraft carrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_aircraft_carrier_pa2 ) efforts were both collaborations that split due to disagreements over the direction of the project . 
  apparently germany and the us also collaborated on the [ leopard ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard_2 ) / [ m1 abrams ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1_abrams ) until the two disagreed on the direction as well , which i was n't aware of . 
  as / u/marktplatz pointed out , there were benefits of shared effort even where the final product was n't common : components wound up being in common and r&d could be reused . 
   but turkey 's current policies pose a significant danger to all of their interests could you expand ? 
  which turkish policies ? 
  i get what you 're saying , but : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byha3d-tvs0, 
   for the masses of conscripts no european nation can afford to stock up with tanks , artillery , aircrafts and so on . 
  are n't most conscripts trained in infantry work ? 
  i mean , you 'd be talking rifle and other gear like that ... maybe other man-portable gear like night-vision equipment or recoilless rifles . 
  afaik , peacetime conscription of , say , pilots is a rare thing . 
  second that -- what 's the point of saying `` you , you 're going to be doing job x for the next year '' if it 's something that could as-easily be done by a private company somewhere ? 
  the properties that make a government unique that i could think of being relevant for deciding whether-or-not it should do a job are that it ( a ) has a monopoly and ( b ) can internalize externalities , things that the market could n't deal with . 
  most things do n't require either of those two properties to get done . 
  it slightly shortens the headline . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boston_christmas_tree  the boston christmas tree is the city of boston , massachusetts 's official christmas tree . 
  a tree has been lit each year since 1941 , [ 1 ] and since 1971 it has been given to the people of boston by the people of nova scotia in thanks for their assistance during the [ 1917 halifax explosion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halifax_explosion ) . 
  my guess is that they were n't in the eu when they purchased them ; would kinda ruin the point . 
  there are both [ german-americans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_americans ) and [ english-americans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_americans ) . 
  however , a number of irish emigrated due to famine , and i suspect that a number of those kinda held onto that irish identity for nationalist reasons : they felt forced out rather than leaving because they were fed up ; see the [ fenian raids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fenian_raids ) or the fact that irish-americans provided [ most of the ira 's funding ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1cxsvp/how_prevalent_was_american_funding_of_the_irish/ ) . 
  also , the irish came later than a lot of english . 
  and as / u/neshgaddal points out , the first world war ( not so much the second ) represented a huge shedding of german identity , as people dissociated themselves with germany . 
  sometimes their names were anglicized ; * back to the future iii * includes a reference to this phenomenon :  marty : look , doc , maybe it was a mistake . 
  maybe that grave was n't yours . 
  there could 've been another emmett brown back in 1885 . 
  did you have any relatives here back then ? 
    doc : < shaking head  the browns came to america in 1908 , and then they were the von brauns . 
  my father changed our name in world war i. 
  i dunno if the oil price crash is necessarily all that disconnected from putin 's decisions . 
  us-aligned saudi arabia decided to ramp up production within two months after the eu and the us announced an `` economic solution '' to russia .
