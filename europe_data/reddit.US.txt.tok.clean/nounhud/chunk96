  from a comment i posted the other day , there 's been quite a spate of oil articles recently , and the us just opened up the us floodgates to oil exports , gates which had been held in place for decades : * [ is russia 's cheap oil nightmare coming true ? 
  ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/is-russias-cheap-oil-nightmare-coming-true/553010.html ) * [ russia plans $ 40 a barrel oil for next seven years as saudi showdown intensifies ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/12046185/russia-opec-saudi-arabia-bluff-40-oil-price.html ) * [ another false start for russia as oil spells longer recession ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-21/another-false-start-for-russia-as-oil-spells-longer-recession ) : the russian currency closed at a record low against the dollar as brent crude fell toward $ 36 a barrel . 
  * [ will full storage tanks crash the price of oil ? 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2015/12/16/will-full-storage-tanks-crash-the-oil-price/ ) : a number of analysts have suggested that oil prices might crater to $ 20 a barrel if storage tanks become full , which is certainly a possibility ... u.s. private crude oil inventories are higher than they 've ever been : in over three decades , they never passed 400 million barrels , and now they are approaching 500 ... this clearly suggests the world might be nearing full tanks again . 
  * [ lifting u.s. oil export ban prompts cheers , some fears ] ( http://www.omaha.com/money/lifting-u-s-oil-export-ban-prompts-cheers-some-fears/article_1cc4705d-1dd5-5d5d-ad1f-8d8d7d282f0a.html ) : the united states has ended restrictions on oil exports put in place in the mid-1970s . 
  the lifting of the embargo was part of a spending deal that was pushed through the house and senate and signed by president barack obama last week . 
  * [ u.s. overtakes russia as world 's largest producer of crude oil ] ( http://allafrica.com/stories/201512220145.html ) : the united states is now the world 's largest oil and natural gas liquids exporter and would remain so for a while , overtaking both saudi arabia and russia . 
  the recent production boom in oil that can be cheaply-produced is heavily tied to us-developed hydrofracking technology , which the [ us banned export of to russia last summer in response to the russian occupation of crimea and sevastopol ] ( https://www.cov.com/~/media/files/corporate/publications/2014/08/us_commerce_department_restricts_energy-related_exports_and_reexports_to_russia.pdf ) , which additionally makes things tougher for the russian oil industry . 
  i do n't know specifically what was targeted from the map , but two guesses : * charleston is a state capital , and thus a center of administration and control for the state . 
  * the area around charleston is a center for the chemical industry . 
  honestly , trying to do something in the aftermath of a nuclear war is probably their only realistic hope of success . 
  carl sagan thought that nukes might be the missing answer to the [ fermi paradox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fermi_paradox ) . 
  whoever bought those fake passports is probably really wanting a refund right about now if they 're just some illegal immigrant going to a forger rather than someone associated with terrorism . 
   if you let terror control your actions or determine your politics , the terrorists actually win . 
  seems kinda a broad definition . 
  by that definition , osama bin laden won by getting shot . 
  soo ... europe has a pretty hefty black market for labor ? 
  ah , okay ... was thinking of , like , a tarpaulin or something . 
   that does not mean that they have not been good allies i 've read that there has been at least one point of friction . 
  [ report : israel passes u.s. military technology to china ] ( http://defensetech.org/2013/12/24/report-israel-passes-u-s-military-technology-to-china/ )  secret u.s. missile and electro-optics technology was transferred to china recently by israel , prompting anger from the u.s. and causing a senior israeli defense official to resign . 
    the head of defense exports for the israeli defense ministry resigned after a u.s. investigation concluded that technology , including a miniature refrigeration system manufactured by ricor and used for missiles and in electro-optic equipment , was sent to china , according to the israeli newspaper maariv . 
    another israeli news site , aretz sheva , reports the u.s. is concerned the technology could ultimately find its way to iran , which last year sought to buy military equipment from china for its nuclear program . 
    ricor , on its company website , identifies a number of defense programs using its miniature cryo-coolers , including uavs , airborne enhanced vision systems , missile warning systems , hand-held thermal imagers and thermal weapons sights . 
    the maariv report identified the israeli defense official as meir shalit , and said he apologized to u.s. officials on a recent visit . 
    israel has a long record of getting u.s. military technology to china . 
    in the early 1990s then-cia director james woolsey told a senate government affairs committee that israel had been selling u.s. secrets to china for about a decade . 
  more than 12 years ago the u.s. demanded israel cancel a contract to supply china with python iii missiles , which included technology developed by the u.s. for its sidewinder missiles , the associated press reported in 2002 . 
  [ imagine : f-22 raptors for export ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/imagine-f-22-raptors-for-export/ )  in 1997 , the united states government determined that the raptor , america 's most advanced air superiority fighter , could not be exported to any foreign government , even those of close allies . 
  the unstated reason for this ban was suspicion that israel would , if it gained access to the f-22 , transfer technology associated with the aircraft to russia or china . 
  the united states can not , as a political matter of course , single out israel for a ban on the sale of advanced technology , and so the f-22 export ban covered all potential buyers . 
  the us is currently the thing keeping china from moving in on vietnamese territory . 
  the us * has * definitely pressured israel not to take aggressive actions in the past . 
  hmm . 
  this chart indicates that david cameron and barack obama should switch jobs . 
  it 's not really a thing in english . 
  i remember shaking my head at the novelty the first time too . 
  too bad [ russell means ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russell_means ) passed away recently . 
   following the non-binding united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples in september 2007 , a group of american indian activists presented a letter to the u.s. state department , indicating they were withdrawing from all treaties with the us government on december 20 . 
  means announced the withdrawal by a small group of lakota people . 
  [ 24 ] that same month , they began contacting foreign governments to solicit support for energy projects on the territory . 
  means and a delegation of activists declared the republic of lakotah a sovereign nation , with property rights over thousands of square miles in south dakota , north dakota , nebraska , wyoming and montana . 
  [ 25 ] [ 26 ] means said that his group does not `` represent collaborators , the vichy indians and those tribal governments set up by the united states of america '' . 
  the canadians are still working on integrating quebec . 
   much like washington dc is for the usa that special status has created its own mass of in-fighting over here , as [ exemplified by washington dc 's `` taxation without representation '' license plates ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/obama-to-use-dc-taxation-without-representation-license-plates/2013/01/15/f91b09ac-5f5b-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_story.html ) . 
  `` just '' ? 
  five times as many people who [ identify as irish in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_americans ) as there are in ireland . 
   self-identified `` irish '' 34,587,835 ( 11.1 % of the us population ( 2013 ) ), 
  i 'm pretty sure that there was a strong social taboo against publishing steamy love letters in the us ... but never a law against it , afaik . 
  i suspect that the same was the case elsewhere . 
  on the other hand , it 's also fair to point out that porn probably has broader appeal . 
  leaked celebrity sex tapes seem to be [ rather popular ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_photo_hack ) , but afaik spreading around copies of someone 's love letters was never really a thing . 
  if you could prove deletion of data , it would make digital currency a whole hell of a lot easier to implement than it is . 
  probably has happened more than once , but here 's an example : [ north carolina teenager charged as an adult for sexting photos of himself ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/north-carolina-teenager-charged-as-an-adult-for-sexting-photos-of-himself-10484292.html ) . 
  he was sixteen at the time . 
  in some cases , a minor can be treated as an adult for court and sentencing purposes ( not sure what the cause was here ) . 
  however , obviously , it comes off as a bit strange here , as : * the guy is facing ten years of prison time , as he is being treated as an adult for sexual exploitation of a minor . 
  had he been treated as a minor for sentencing , the sentencing would be far less-harsh . 
  * the minor being exploited is himself : he took pictures of himself * and * broadcast them to another . 
  the only reason that this is a crime at all is because he was a minor . 
  i do n't know the specifics here , and maybe there was some sort of basis for what happened ... but obviously , it does make eyebrows raise a bit when someone faces a very harsh sentence and does so only because they were treated as a minor in one aspect of the case and an adult in another , and had they been treated any other way , they would have not been punished at all or punished much less harshly . 
  we 've established [ romeo and juliet laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statutory_rape#romeo_and_juliet_laws ) which often lessen or eliminate the severe penalties for statutory rape ( sex treated as rape because the other partner was a minor ) in cases where the perpetrator is also a minor or the same in age . 
  however , similar structures have not yet been created for child pornography laws , so it 's often quite possible to create very high penalties for things that in practice , boyfriends and girlfriends of the same age are off doing . 
  actually ... you know , that makes me think . 
  this is complicated , and hard for people to understand . 
  there 's probably a decent market for putting a hard-drive destruction machine as a vending machine at retail locations . 
  have a plexiglas case so that the destruction is visible , and pass the thing through a rock crusher . 
  hmm ... though on the other hand , most people probably do n't know how to remove a hard drive from a computer , and i 'm pretty sure that running lithium-ion laptop batteries through a rock crusher is a bad idea . 
  in the us , the great depression has something of a reputation of having created the same mindset in people who lived through it . 
  a canvas ? 
  today , the trendy thing is getting rid of plastic bags and using `` environmentally friendly '' cloth bags . 
  apparently , all things go in cycles ... 
  ah , a second world problem . 
  off in the first world , the us [ funded military research to * intentionally * make chocolate bars taste unappetizing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_military_chocolate ) :  colonel logan had four requirements for the d ration bar . 
  the bar must :   1 . 
  weigh 4 ounces ( 112 g )   2 . 
  be high in food energy value   3 . 
  be able to withstand high temperatures   4 . 
  taste `` a little better than a boiled potato ''   its ingredients were chocolate , sugar , oat flour , cacao fat , skim milk powder , and artificial flavoring . 
  chocolate manufacturing equipment was built to move the flowing mixture of liquid chocolate and oat flour into preset molds . 
  however , the temperature-resistant formula of chocolate became a gooey paste that would not flow at any temperature . 
  [ snip ]  colonel logan had specified that the d ration taste only a bit better than `` a boiled potato . '', 
  this last requirement was imposed to keep soldiers from eating their emergency rations in non-emergency situations . 
  as a result , the d ration was almost universally detested for its bitter taste by u.s. troops , and was often discarded instead of consumed when issued . 
  [ 1 ] troops called the d ration `` hitler 's secret weapon '' for its effect on soldiers ' intestinal tracts . 
  [ 1 ] it could not be eaten at all by soldiers with poor dentition , and even those with good dental work often found it necessary to first shave slices off the bar with a knife before consuming . 
  [ 1 ] so whenever you see old world war ii footage of grinning us troops liberating western europe and handing out their chocolate bars to undernourished kids ... it 's not * quite * as generous as it might seem ... 
   you would be surprised at how many comunist countries failed to make toilet paper . 
  or at least enough of it . 
  [ ongoing problem ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/05/so-venezuela-has-a-toilet-paper-shortage-dont-laugh-seriously/275940/ ) . 
  i think you wanted `` luxury '' rather than `` commodity '' -- the two are almost opposites . 
   i agree . 
  russia had a great chance in the 1990s to head in a new direction , towards trade , openness and cooperation with the west . 
  it 's not just on russia 's side -- there were also some opportunities that were visible in the west , at least in retrospect . 
  i 've heard a few people point out that the us also had the opportunity to provide financial support for russia about the time that things came down . 
  one russian guy specifically said that something like that had been expected . 
  i do n't have any expertise in the field , but it 's at least an interesting idea . 
  yeah , maybe the us did n't * have * to do that , ( and i 'm sure that someone in russia would have said ` they 're trying to take over ' ) , but a `` modern-day-marshall-plan '' for russia might have helped avoid the problems that happened after the ussr breakup and resulted in something other than what wound up happening . 
  maybe today liberals in russia would be running things and relations would n't be heading downhill . 
  yeah , the us and russia had been staring at each other over the barrel of guns ... but the same had been true for post-nazi germany and italy . 
  i dunno , it 's an interesting what-if thought .
