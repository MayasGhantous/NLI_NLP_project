  my understanding is that the us playing hardball with the ussr wound up perhaps working against us interests in the aftermath of the [ cuban missile crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuban_missile_crisis ) -- the us effectively demanded that while the us would remove jupiter missiles in turkey after the soviets removed the missiles in cuba , it would be in such a way that the soviet leadership could not present this as a * quid pro quo * for removal of the missiles in cuba . 
  that was probably planned to avoid creating positive feedback for the ussr in taking hardball positions against the us ... but one result was that khrushchev , who was comparatively-mild with the us , had to basically eat what amounted to a public political loss in the ussr , which wound up aiding hardliners in kicking him out . 
  there 's a really good children 's book series , [ * little house on the prairie * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/little_house_on_the_prairie ) , which is based on the diaries of a pioneer-era american settler family on the plains -- 1870s/1880s . 
  it 's an in-depth look at what life in a rural environment just a hundred-and-fifty years ago was like . 
  one of the big `` culture shock '' things that hit me is that the big christmas present that shows up for the narrator ( a young girl ) is an orange . 
  she talks about how big a deal it was . 
  oranges are something that , today , i just go up and get in bulky bags , year-round , and do n't bother to think about it ; orange juice is something that i drink for breakfast as if it were water . 
  and yet , such a short time ago , it was a luxury . 
  it 's hard to wrap one 's mind around how much the standard of living changed for so many people in just the last century compared to most of the centuries upon centuries before that . 
  my dad described to me how when he was growing up , it was the norm to eat only in-season food -- you eat food when it would be growing . 
  but now greenhouses and shipping from the other hemisphere and genetic engineering and artificial selection for multi-harvest or early or late harvest crops and more shelf life , as well as refrigeration and controlled-atmosphere storage have resulted in pretty much year-round availability for pretty much all food that you can buy . 
  sure , it might cost a tad more or be a bit-lower quality at one point in the year relative to another , but the fact that my diet is completely disconnected from the seasons is pretty remarkable . 
  there 's a book , [ * future shock * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_shock ) , from 1970 , which has two quotes that i rather like :  it has been observed , for example , that if the last 50,000 years of man 's existence were divided into lifetimes of approximately sixty-two years each , there have been about 800 such lifetimes . 
  of these 800 , fully 650 were spent in caves . 
  only during the last seventy lifetimes has it been possible to communicate effectively from one lifetime to another -- as writing made it possible to do . 
  only during the last six lifetimes did masses of men ever see a printed word . 
  only during the last four has it been possible to measure time with any precision . 
  only in the last two has anyone anywhere used an electric motor . 
  and the overwhelming majority of all the material goods we use in daily life today have been developed within the present , the 800th , lifetime . 
  also :  it has been pointed out , for example , that in 6000 b.c. 
  the fastest transportation available to man over long distances was the camel caravan , averaging eight miles per hour . 
  it was not until about 1600 b.c. 
  when the chariot was invented that the maximum speed was raised to roughly twenty miles per hour . 
  so impressive was this invention , so difficult was it to exceed this speed limit , that nearly 3,500 years later , when the first mail coach began operating in england in 1784 , it averaged a mere ten mph . 
  the first steam locomotive , introduced in 1825 , could muster a top speed of only thirteen mph , and the great sailing ships of the time labored along at less than half that speed . 
  it was probably not until the 1880s that man , with the help of a more advanced steam locomotive , managed to reach a speed of one hundred mph . 
  it took the human race millions of years to attain that record . 
  it took only fifty-eight years , however , to quadruple the limit , so that by 1938 airborne man was cracking the 400-mph line . 
  it took a mere twenty-year flick of time to double the limit again . 
  and by the 1960s rocket planes approached speeds of 4000 mph , and men in space capsules were circling the earth at 18,000 mph . 
  plotted on a graph , the line representing progress in the past generation would leap vertically off the page . 
   the true wealth of the west imho is not what you can consume , it 's what you can make . 
  i could relatively easily live in a world where i ca n't consume much more than in the gdr . 
  but i will fight tooth and nail for the awesome options life now has for anyone making stuff , be it someone working privately on their house project or on an industrial project . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  yesterday , we had a discussion on / r/europe about eastern european housing from the soviet days , and someone mentioned that there was a problem with people stealing cement , something that sometimes impacted building quality . 
  i kind of stared blankly at that -- [ who on earth would steal cement ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xtoma/eastern_europeans_show_us_your_citys_ugliest/cy8gr1h?context=3 ) ? 
  it 's bulky and not tremendously valuable relative to its weight and volume , after all . 
  and then a response : `` to build your own house '' . 
  i kind of shrugged it off as a `` well , maybe it was just too risky to steal something more-valuable and sell that and then buy cement '' but your post finally flips the lightbulb on -- buying cement was n't an * option * . 
  well , it [ apparently runs about $ 113 to set up a receiver and attached computer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/3fscia/the_11390_adsb_receiver_for_foreflight_or_pretty/ ) . 
  if it is n't being logged ( and i suspect that it is and is put online somewhere ) , it could be . 
  mind that all systems like this , anything that is n't an active radar , are just reporting where the aircraft * says * that it is located -- if it does n't know the right spot or is intentionally mis-reporting , you 'll get a different location . 
  a sufficiently-strong magnetic field , yeah , but your refrigerator magnet is not going to be very effective at wiping a drive : just sticking it on the drive is n't going to wipe it . 
  there are also [ hamr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heat-assisted_magnetic_recording ) drives , and you are n't going to be replicating the heat there . 
  when i dispose of a personal drive , i overwrite the contents with a single pass of pseudorandom data at the block device level , open up the drive with a screwdriver , and damage the platter . 
  most data-recovery companies rely on just swapping components in a cleanroom into a working drive -- they use the original mechanism , and if it ca n't handle a physically-damaged platter , neither can they . 
  unless you 're military , that 's probably more-than-sufficient . 
  i once spent time chatting with a us department of defense guy who had to do a triple-random-overwrite followed by sending the drive through a rock crusher followed by an acid bath . 
  ( ironically , i also chatted with his soviet counterpart who worked on the same stuff on the other side and defected to the us -- now i kinda want to ask the soviet defector what soviet data security was like ... ) that 's kind of ridiculous , in my view -- at that point , you 're just reinforcing a strong point of data security , [ not the weak points that someone would actually attack ] ( https://xkcd.com/538/ ) . 
  heck , even the fact that i 'd be asking a defector would kinda be driving home that point . 
  however , if you 're honest-to-god wanting to make sure that nobody physically attacks your discarded drive , and you honestly believe that they 're willing to throw nation-state level resources at it , that 's probably the gold standard . 
   i did n't know what word to use but the way you romanticise manifest destiny and the wild west , etc fair enough ... though i think that manifest destiny is more of something for the history books and less of a live idea . 
  maybe `` american dream '' . 
  honestly , data-visualization programs should have palette-choosing algorithms that can accept constraints , things like `` try and use a ` good ' color for ` this value is high ' . 
  one constraint i 'd like is to see is to have the software package do the visualization and have that code internally generate a [ graph ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graph_%28abstract_data_type%29 ) showing adjacency of colors in the visualization , then select palette colors so as to maximize the visual distance of colors that are rendered adjacent to each other . 
  ... also , while at it , support taking into account various types of color-blindness in the psychovisual model measuring distance of colors . 
   i wonder if the linux command shred actually helps . 
  no , it does not . 
  ` shred ( 1 ) ` operates at the file level -- just opens the file and overwrites it with data . 
  this relies on the assumption that the same physical blocks on disk will be overwritten . 
  the major currently-used filesystems on linux ( the ext family since ext3 ; most linux systems are running ext4 ) do not cause overwriting data at a particular offset in a file corresponding to a block on the drive to overwrite the same physical block on disk that is currently storing data for the file at that offset . 
  this is something of a side-effect of the use of [ journaling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/journaling_file_system ) , since the filesystem must write out the new data without invalidating the old data * before * making a single atomic change that switches the data over and thus the new and old data must co-exist ; most modern filesystems make use of this technique to avoid corruption on crashes . 
  if you look at the ` shred ( 1 ) ` man page , it explicitly warns against its use on ext3 : caution : note that shred relies on a very important assumption : that the file system overwrites data in place . 
  this is the traditional way to do things , but many modern file system designs do not satisfy this assumption . 
  the following are examples of file systems on which shred is not effective , or is not guaranteed to be effective in all file sys tem modes : * log-structured or journaled file systems , such as those supplied with aix and solaris ( and jfs , reiserfs , xfs , ext3 , etc. ), 
  * file systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some writes fail , such as raid-based file systems * file systems that make snapshots , such as network appliance 's nfs server * file systems that cache in temporary locations , such as nfs version 3 clients * compressed file systems in the case of ext3 file systems , the above disclaimer applies ( and shred is thus of limited effectiveness ) only in data = journal mode , which journals file data in addition to just metadata . 
  in both the data = ordered ( default ) and data = writeback modes , shred works as usual . 
  ext3 journaling modes can be changed by adding the data = something option to the mount options for a particular file system in the / etc/fstab file , as documented in the mount man page ( man mount ) . 
  in order to clean this up on linux , you 'd need a way to `` overwrite free space '' , and afaik nothing explicitly-supports this . 
  the closest you probably have is to take advantage of the fact that ext4 supports online resizing ( and thus shrinking , and thus defragmentation ) , which gets you most of the way there : worst-case , you could fsfreeze ( 1 ) , which sends an ioctl to block further writes , resize so that there 's no free space , then overwrite the now-unused data , then resize again ( or resize incrementally as you are overwriting ) ; once you have some free space available again , you could unfreeze the filesystem . 
  you 'd also want infrastructure to cleanly recover here from power loss ; unlike , say , journaling , the filesystem would n't support recovering . 
  you can also * roughly * approximate this on any filesystem , even those that do n't support online resizing , by simply filling the drive with a file containing random data , then deleting it ... but the problem is that your filesystem is then unusuable for a window of time , since you 'll have no free space , until the writing is done ... that means that things like logging or anything else that tries grabbing more space on the filesystem will fail for the duration of your `` wipe '' operation . 
  you could minimize that window of failure by using smaller files , and deleting one after you 'd overwritten it , and further reduce that window for filesystems which support it , by using ` fallocate ( 1 ) ` rather than ` write ( ) ` to do the initial allocation of blocks . 
  still , unless you 're freezing the filesystem , you 're stuck with a window of failure . 
  also , while physical recovery from drive surface is n't my particular area of expertise , and have n't spent time working on this problem or discussing it , i 've worked with people who were probably among the few people in the world who * did * specifically work on this . 
  i do n't know how large the leakage is there , but keep in mind that it 's relatively-small : i personally would n't worry about multiple passes of random overwrites . 
  remember that a drive is storing data at data at an areal density that is as far as the drive manufacturer can push things and still reliably retain that data . 
  they can even use encodings of your data that involve multiple unreliable bits to store one reliable bit . 
  so unless the drive manufacturer is doing a crummy job , you are n't going to get a magic `` undelete '' after a single-pass random overwrite ... and the researchers at storage companies are constantly attacking that window of potential data storage that is n't actually used to store data , and have more expertise in doing so than you probably do . 
  a concern for leakage of a small amount of data is that what you see as `` block # 1 '' may well not be what is physically `` block # 1 '' on the drive : rotational drives can pick up on bad blocks and remap them , and ssd controllers normally make use of [ wear leveling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wear_leveling ) , so when you * think * that you 're overwriting a given block , you may not be doing so -- the drive may have decided that that block is unreliable and retired it from the pool of blocks that you can see and added in a reserved block , so there 's no way for you to force an overwrite of that block . 
  the name `` star-man '' sounds alarmingly like some sort of lovecraftian character . 
  i was curious , so did a google translate to english of [ the polish-language wikipedia article ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gwiazdor ) :  a character who deals gifts at christmas eve christmas present in poznan province , on earth lubuska , kujawy and warmia ( specifically those parts that were under prussian rule ) , kashubian and kociewie . 
    it comes from ancient groups of carolers , and the name of one worn by the stars . 
  it was a figure dressed in sheepskin and fur hat , his face hidden by a mask or smeared with soot . 
  star carried with him a bag of gifts and a rod . 
  poll on children with prayers , knew the good and bad deeds , and depending on the result handed the gift or beaten with a rod . 
  currently , star of character conformed to st. nicholas , while the former attributes offer him the rod , which punishes naughty children . 
  still , it is a common habit of handling their homes by people dressed as star of that fee give presents and ask family members , mostly children , to keep within a year , knowledge of prayers , poems , or christmas carols . 
  today , as a result of migration and the impact of mass media and business centers , some of the inhabitants of wielkopolska and kashubian star of abandoned tradition in favor of st. nicholas , however , still in these regions much more popular is santa claus .

  who steals cement ? 
  i mean , what on earth did people do with it in the communist era ? 
  i 'm a little surprised that nobody ever paid to paint the exterior down the line . 
  seems like a relatively-inexpensive way to add value to a particular building . 
  is n't what matters the total amount of taxation , though , and not the fact that it may be broken down over fuel/vehicle/toll roads ?
