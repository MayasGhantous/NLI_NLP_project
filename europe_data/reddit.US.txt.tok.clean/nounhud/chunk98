  also , fwiw ... the us at least imposes a fuel tax ( typically federal , state , and local ) , afaik all states have a periodic fee they charge for a vehicle to be licensed , and afaik all states have at least * some * toll roads ( though most are not toll ) . 
   why ca n't eu just close its borders outward now , so we wo n't have to close the internal borders to our neighbors ? 
  the major issue is that the `` periphery countries '' like greece and italy have nowhere to deport migrants that they identify . 
  let 's say that italy identifies that someone has illegally entered italy . 
  they say `` ah , you came from libya . 
  i 'm going to deport you . '', 
  libya says `` we do n't want them '' . 
  now the only thing that italy can do is hang onto them , which sticks them with said mgirant . 
  if italy ignores the migrant and lets them pass on to where they want to go , it 's not their problem ( the problem just moves to sweden ) . 
  so the main problem to address is that italy needs to have a reason to identify someone -- e.g. 
  if they can identify an illegal migrant , there 's * somewhere * to which they can deport them . 
   it 's misleading to call the us a federation ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation  the oldest continuous federation , and a role model for many subsequent federations , is the united states . 
   mythology um . 
  also , there was n't much of a shared history when federalization kicked off . 
   in europe , i find higher education to be more valued by society in general .

  that 's us and maybe the uk and a couple of other countries that hop in mostly running around whacking things , not so much nato ; they might also be members of nato , but they are n't nato operations . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_operations there are n't all that many nato operations that have actually happened , and none of them are particularly far-flung ( the furthest involving military conflict is probably anti-piracy operations off somalia ) .

  i kinda wish that the gradient used for the colors was reversed . 
   is icons hard enough for you ? 
  no , because it 's an anecdote : i 'd expect all sorts of things to be happening occasionally in a country . 
  i 'm certain that you can dig up examples of people engaging in all sorts of extreme behavior as well in the us or france or ukraine or sweden , but an instance can easily not be representative of the country as a whole . 
  a statistic on a randomly-chosen sample , though , something that 's expected to represent the population as a whole , is much-more interesting . 
  poll results , for example . 
  / u/sanorpas did provide some ; however , the article did not . 
  if you want an example of things going the other way , my understanding is that russian state media likes to portray azov battallion as being representative of the pro-western faction in ukraine . 
  obviously , that 's not the case . 
  the way to avoid that is just to ask for statistics that are representative of the population as a whole . 
   one that has n't expanded for a century or so is useful . 
  well , with the exception of the [ northern mariana islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_mariana_islands ) , which [ voted to request joining the us in 1975 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_mariana_islands_status_referendum,_1975 ) and were approved by the us the next year .

   it 's akin to pinning programmers at uber against taxi drivers .

  it 's a pretty good read , imho . 
  i dunno ... i 'm not sure that i like this type of article . 
  it 's absolutely-packed with a dense mass of broad assertions , without any data to support it . 
  for example :  indeed germany is discomfited by power generally , especially its own . 
  at home and abroad it advocates right over might . 
  hence its apparent obsession with rules , even to the exasperation of its partners ( in the euro crisis , for example ) . 
  okay , maybe there 's a valid hypothesis there , but i 'm not particularly convinced that any `` obsession with rules '' -- to the extent that it even exists outside of a stereotype -- is a post-war guilt-induced affair . 
  the author did n't say `` this is why i believe this '' , but simply claimed it . 
   and want the uk to look like this [ 1 ] i have no idea what that * is * , but it looks neat .

  the puritans had it in for christmas as a catholic dogma thing : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas  however , in 17th century england , some groups such as the puritans , strongly condemned the celebration of christmas , considering it a catholic invention and the `` trappings of popery '' or the `` rags of the beast '' . 
  [ 64 ] in contrast , the established anglican church `` pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts , penitential seasons , and saints ' days . 
  the calendar reform became a major point of tension between the anglican party and the puritan party . 
  '' [ 104 ] the catholic church also responded , promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form . 
  king charles i of england directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old-style christmas generosity . 
  [ 97 ] following the parliamentarian victory over charles i during the english civil war , england 's puritan rulers banned christmas in 1647 . 
  [ 64 ] [ 105 ]   protests followed as pro-christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks canterbury was controlled by the rioters , who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans . 
  [ 64 ] the book , the vindication of christmas ( london , 1652 ) , argued against the puritans , and makes note of old english christmas traditions , dinner , roast apples on the fire , card playing , dances with `` plow-boys '' and `` maidservants '' , old father christmas and carol singing . 
  [ 106 ]   the restoration of king charles ii in 1660 ended the ban , but many calvinist clergymen still disapproved of christmas celebration . 
  as such , in scotland , the presbyterian church of scotland discouraged the observance of christmas , and though james vi commanded its celebration in 1618 , attendance at church was scant . 
  [ 107 ] the parliament of scotland officially abolished the observance of christmas in 1640 , claiming that the church had been `` purged of all superstitious observation of days '' . 
  [ 108 ] it was not until 1958 that christmas again became a scottish public holiday . 
  [ 109 ] [ snip ]  in colonial america , the puritans of new england shared radical protestant disapproval of christmas . 
  celebration was outlawed in boston from 1659 to 1681 . 
  the ban by the pilgrims was revoked in 1681 by english governor edmund andros , however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating christmas became fashionable in the boston region . 
  [ 65 ]   at the same time , christian residents of virginia and new york observed the holiday freely . 
  pennsylvania german settlers , pre-eminently the moravian settlers of bethlehem , nazareth and lititz in pennsylvania and the wachovia settlements in north carolina , were enthusiastic celebrators of christmas . 
  the moravians in bethlehem had the first christmas trees in america as well as the first nativity scenes . 
  [ 112 ] christmas fell out of favor in the united states after the american revolution , when it was considered an english custom . 
  [ 113 ] george washington attacked hessian ( german ) mercenaries on the day after christmas during the battle of trenton on december 26 , 1776 , christmas being much more popular in germany than in america at this time . 
  processed cheese spray will almost certainly also contain preservatives : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easy_cheese  easy cheese contains milk , water , whey protein concentrate , canola oil , milk protein concentrate , sodium citrate , sodium phosphate , calcium phosphate , lactic acid , sorbic acid , sodium alginate , apocarotenal , annatto , cheese culture , and enzymes . 
  [ sorbic acid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbic_acid ) and [ lactic acid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactic_acid ) are both added preservatives ; same idea in increasing the acidity to make it hostile to microbes . 
  ` course , i guess there it did n't constrain the food much , since you could make the food as easily without the preservatives added -- just would n't keep . 
  yeah -- not saying that baucus was a particularly egregious example or that this is anything new . 
  just wanted an example of each , and that i 've heard on many occasions that us ambassadorships are a common place to put political appointees . 
  [ bruce oreck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bruce_j._oreck ) , famous for [ certain cards ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/yes-man-u-s-ambassador-finland/ ) , is probably a better example of a political appointee . 
   `` russia may compensate for weakness with risky foreign adventurism . '', 
  that 's a snippit of a full sentence , which should , at least in the current bbc article text , be :  * others fear * russia may compensate for weakness with risky foreign adventurism . 
  and honestly , given that it 's a bit of a text from the very end of the article and makes use of [ weasel words ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_word ) , it kinda pushes the no-editorialization-in-titles policy . 
   nordic countries do n't really have a food culture .

   `` we expect the u.s. representative to norway to be someone who can meet at least a minimum standard of qualifications , '' my understanding is that us ambassadorships are often used as political favors : rather than putting a career diplomat in place , someone who has political connections goes into place . 
  i 'm not sure how common this is among countries . 
  for example , the current us ambassador to russia is [ john teft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_f._tefft ) , a career diplomat . 
  on the other hand , the current us ambassador to china is [ max baucus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/max_baucus ) , not a diplomat . 
  he was going to be retiring as senator from montana during the next election , and i would n't be completely-surprised if the obama administration gave him the ambassadorship to let a democrat run as incumbent in the next election .
