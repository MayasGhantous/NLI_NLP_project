  that 's also apparently [ part of a recent trend ] ( http://www.npr.org/2014/02/12/275897092/more-ambassador-posts-are-going-to-political-appointees ) . 
  < shrug  i suppose that there are worse positions to make political appointments than ambassadorships . 
  honestly , a * ton * of cuisine comes from having to figure out how to store things for a long time . 
  think of some examples : * with flour , you want to dry something out so that nothing can live in it , but leave it in a form that can be easily reconstituted to something edible -- you put bubbles in the bread to make it easy to chew . 
  * with pickled foods ( pickles , sauerkraut , etc ) , you want to make something that does n't need refrigeration . 
  * yogurt is acidic , so lasts longer than fresh milk . 
  * cheese exists because of acidity and penicillin bacteria , and in the case of some cheeses , probably the dryness relative to salt ) . 
  * salted and/or dried and or/smoked meat * ditto for salted/dried/smoked fish , like latvian sprats . 
  * jams/jellies/preserves / honey are so sweet that they dry out and kill organisms that land in them . 
  * a lot of fermented foods , like alcoholic drinks and soy sauce . 
  i remember mulling over it a while back and being impressed by what a vast chunk of what we eat is actually determined by what is , in many cases , archaic food preservatives or preservation mechanisms . 
  however , because our ancestors spent so long trying to come up with palatable ways to eat food that had been so-preserved and their work on making things taste good still applies , we have a lot of inertia still in place . 
  the main gun on the m1a2 is german , i do know that . 
  make warheads that can contain either nukes or good old fashioned snail mail for time-critical postage to help generate a revenue stream .

  [ manhattan has extremely-restrictive rules , which is why housing prices are so high there ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-skyscrapers-can-save-the-city/308387/ ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that a lot of people would like to live in the sf bay area for the weather or to work there , and do n't absolutely require it to have low-lying architecture . 
   and by the way , we are in a `` crisis '' because we do n't have money and are not as keen as americans to take loans ... [ world debt mapped ] ( http://www.cityam.com/1411501631/debt-map ) : in per-capita household debt , a number of european countries are above the us ( though , by the same token , a number are also below ) . 
  per-capita household debt in 2013 : the top 10 countries : | country | per-capita household debt in euros | | - | - | | switzerland | 75,488 | | norway | 66,988 | | denmark | 64,912 | | australia | 51,323 | | netherlands | 50,181 | | sweden | 38,696 | | ireland | 38,032 | | canada | 35,568 | | ** united states ** | ** 31,219 ** | | singapore | 29,691 | | united kingdom | 29,551 | i also suspect that if you weight that by per-capita household income , the us tends to move further down the list . 
  supposing that we could house * both * by removing height restrictions ? 
   but you can have tall buildings without poor planning ( look at manhattan or parts of london ) . 
  both manhattan and london are currently constrained by building restrictions . 
  here 's an article [ critical of new york city being too restrictive on buildings and thus resulting in the exorbitant real estate prices ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-skyscrapers-can-save-the-city/308387/ ) . 
   because of all the space you need to make parkings multi-story parking garages are pretty common in cities over here , where cars are a pretty big deal . 
  i dunno about prevalence across the atlantic , but i imagine that they 're over there too . 
   he got that building of all the area with living scycrapers will have about whole 10 % ( or even 20 % ) more capacity than three-storey buildings . 
  manhattan definitely has higher density than areas i 've seen with two-or-three story buildings . 
  it also has the perk that russia would like to discourage countries from entering nato . 
  acting threatening with conventional forces only serves to encourage them to do that . 
  that 's counterproductive for russia . 
  when acting threatening with * nuclear * forces , [ putin can claim that entering nato would increase the risk to the country in question by saying that it increases risk of being nuked in some hypothetical war ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/11487509/russia-warns-denmark-its-warships-could-become-nuclear-targets.html ) . 
  that 's a lot more appealing from russia 's standpoint : it creates incentives that encourage countries to do what russia wants . 
  is it a good strategy on the net ? 
  i do n't know . 
  people do n't much like being threatened at all . 
  i can see reasons to do it , though . 
  and i think that it 's a great deal more likely that it 's an intentional strategy from russia rather than that putin suffers from some sort of psychological problems and is doing this on a whim , as was / u/jravihun 's take . 
   sign of insecurity ? 
  you mean as some sort of psychological analysis of putin ? 
  i doubt it . 
  russia is currently in a spat with turkey , the us , and the eu . 
  they 're much weaker economically , which means that they do n't want to fight on the economic field ( even if that 's happening anyway ) . 
  they are much weaker from a conventional military standpoint , so they do n't want to fight on that field . 
  however , they * can * ensure mutual nuclear destruction , and in that sense , the playing field is more-or-less level . 
  russia does n't want to actually * use * them , but doing things like flying nuclear bombers around and frequently referencing them is cheap . 
  when threatening use of nuclear weapons is the only reasonable card in your hand to play ... < shrug  it 's not a crazy idea to use it . 
  i am a little doubtful that it will be effective , but of the available places to keep the discussion , i 'd think that it 's most in russia 's interest to keep it on the prospect of nuclear war . 
  countries join nato to avoid conventional war , not nuclear war , so if he 's unhappy about countries joining nato to block russian conventional capabilities , focusing on the prospect of nuclear war might make sense . 
  i 'm not an expert , but let 's rattle off a couple of possibilities : [ improving the reliability of current-gen weapons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rsm-56_bulava#timetable_.26_slbm_comparison ) [ based on recent developments , probably countering missile defense ] ( http://www.russianspaceweb.com/chronology_missiles.html ) . 
  i did n't follow the [ eurofighter typhoon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurofighter_typhoon ) saga , but it looks like that 's exactly what was originally going to happen until france and the rest of the consortium had a falling-out . 
  actually , that 's kinda what happened too with the [ french/uk aircraft carrier collaboration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_aircraft_carrier_pa2 ) , iirc . 
  some in-use fighter unit prices : | fighter jet | price | | - | - | | [ f-35a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_f-35_lightning_ii ) | $ 98m ( low rate initial production and not including the engine , full production in 2018 to be $ 85m ) [ this was the only full production price listed ] | | [ jas 39 gripen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_jas_39_gripen ) | $ 68.90 million ( 2006 ) | | [ eurofighter typhoon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurofighter_typhoon ) | $ 90 million ( system cost tranche 3a ) [ 4 ] # 125m ( including development + production costs ) [ 5 ] | | [ f-22 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_f-22_raptor ) | us$ 150 million ( flyaway cost for fy2009 ) | | [ pak fa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_pak_fa ) | us$ 50 + million for prototype ; no info on final model or mass production | | [ f-15 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mcdonnell_douglas_f-15_eagle ) | f-15c / d : us$ 29.9 million ( 1998 ) | | [ f-16 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_dynamics_f-16_fighting_falcon ) | f-16c / d : us$ 18.8 million ( 1998 dollars ) ( a * ton * of these were produced ) | | [ f/a -18 e/f super hornet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_f/a-18e/f_super_hornet ) | us$ 60.9 million ( 2013 flyaway cost ) [ 3 ] | | [ rafale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dassault_rafale ) | us$ 108 million ( flyaway cost , 2011 ) [ 7 ] | | [ fa-50 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kai_t-50_golden_eagle ) | us$ 30 million ( 2012 ) | | [ su-27 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-27 ) | us$ 30 million | some of the unit prices here lack a date and are almost-certainly quite old ( e.g. 
  the su-27 was made from 1985 , the f-16 from 1978 ) , so inflation will be a factor . 
  $ 1 in 1978 is $ 3.64 in 2015 . 
  eh , they 'd use a short form of it . 
  i do n't know the conventions german uses , but '' * panzerkampfwagen * '' became * pzkw * , for example . 
   cluster munitions -- inherently indiscriminate and internationally banned weapons by the [ convention on cluster munitions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_cluster_munitions ) , which russia -- and the us and china , for that matter -- are not signatories to . 
  and i do n't think that cluster munitions are particularly indiscriminate . 
  they 're more-efficient in terms of use of explosive force in exchange for a higher risk of leaving dud explosives behind . 
  first ... i mean , i guess whatever does it for people , but the fact that one of the twins is wearing an american flag wrapped around herself seems kinda bizarre ... particularly in an interview in which she 's complaining that the amsterdam sex trade is using prostitutes that are n't dutch enough . 
  second ...  louise and martine fokkens , 70 , claim to have slept with more than 355,000 men between them in the 100 years they have spent working , reports the sun . 
  how ? 
  that 'd be an average of 9.72 men per day for each of them , seven days a week . 
  even if you assume that this is n't actually a count of men , but rather of sex acts , that 's some serious dedication . 
  also , that 's roughly the male population of frankfurt , for crying out loud . 
  `` raid on nato '' seems like a bit of a stretch from what actually happened . 
   as a brony and a communist you know , i 'd have thought that the intersection of people who care about each would be fairly-limited , but apparently : * [ is starlight glimmer a communist ?

  these were not , however , bans , and this is an important distinction in the us legal system . 
  good idea or not , germany was gone for the next 45 years after 1945 . 
   i 'm referring to the statements a lot of greek people make often about `` jews and freemasons running the world '' the heck is it with people and freemason paranoia ? 
  http://www.masonic-lodges.com/masons.html  the lodge building is often used to hold fundraising and public relation events that are open to non-members and invited guests , like fish fries , pot luck , breakfast , etc. 
    freemasons do a lot of work for charities , including holding and participating in various fund raisers within the community to promote charitable causes . 
  you know , when they 're not doing service organization work , they take a break to secretly manipulate world governments ? 
  i mean , yes , mysterious rituals and all , but people think that the `` actual world power brokers '' are running around with silly hats and making up ever more-ludicrous mystic titles ? 
  i could understand that in an era that bought into the supernatural , but * today * ? 
  i 'm not familiar with it , but wikipedia says that [ plan totality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plan_totality ) : * was an american plan , not a british plan . 
  * was a bluff -- the us did n't yet have nearly sufficient atomic bombs to actually pull the thing off and ( i assume ) badly wanted the soviet union to think that it did . 
   uk/france etc are n't nuclear powers . 
  uk and france are nuclear powers , as well as possessing slbms to give them second-strike capability .

   i 'm a feminist and i 'm even saying feminists wo n't do shit . 
  especially not in regards to a group that is on the official terror lists of the us and eu . 
  not disagreeing on this particular case , but would point out [ feminist terrorism has been an actual thing before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rote_zora ) . 
  this is actually what i 'd be more-concerned about escalation coming from -- russia backing separatist groups opposed to turkey , not simply jumping into an outright shooting war with turkey . 
  afghanistan after 9/11 is clear precedent for a country backing a terrorist group that commits an attack to be grounds for an article 5 invocation , too , so there 's a clear route for escalation to nato-level conflict . 
   was there an occurrence where a terrorist organization could permanently carve out a piece of land for themselves ? 
  successful revolutions were no stranger to terrorist tactics . 
  in the american revolution , plenty of loyalists were attacked and their property stolen . 
  [ the troubles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) are probably the most-recent-and-obvious case of a terrorist conflict -- without traditional military warfare -- changing into an independent country . 
  * the ethnic composition there is in part due to [ russification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification ) ; a program intended to bind ukraine into the russian empire . 
  * hitler used [ the same rationale of ethnic ties as his public justification for his initial annexations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suxoerkjcey ) . 
  if what hitler did -- use of force justified by national borders not aligned with ethnic ones -- is not to be accepted in europe , why is it more acceptable when putin makes use of the same rationale ?
