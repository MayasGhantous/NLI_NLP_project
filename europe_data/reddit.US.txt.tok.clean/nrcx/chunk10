  it 's not just our imagination or a romantic yearning . 
  we are closer in many ways to the uk than the uk is to most european countries . 
  the obama administration , which was in office at the time , was extremely pro-eu . 
  and as for trump and the alt-right in general , if you 're a eurofederalist you might be interested to know that according to verhofstadt , it 's the opposite of what you think : https://janyobytes.wordpress.com/2017/01/30/eus-chief-brexit-negotiator-trumps-brand-of-american-populism-came-from-europe/, 
  are you aware of what this guy 's done in the past ? 
  he once made a video claiming to `` expose '' a community organizing center for giving advice to him when he was pretending to be a pimp , when the unedited video revealed that they actually called the police on him . 
  shared values ? 
   spending any more money on the military than is strictly needed is money that is lost . 
  eh , it gets re-invested into your own industries , keeps people employed , drives developments in science and technology , and maintains the world order . 
  it 's not a complete waste . 
   how more active would you like europe to be ? 
  i 'd like europe to have a permanent force in korea ( like we have for the last 64 years ) , bases in japan , unofficial guarantee of independence to taiwan , etc. 
  i 'd like it to have as many ships as us , and as many bases around the world . 
   that 's ... ironic i think it 's necessary . 
  argue if you want , but since the start of the war on terror , politics in some countries has been a continuous anti-us circlejerk , which imo would n't happen if those countries were n't taking a back seat in the war . 
  and terrorism is just an example - engaging with the world means getting your hands dirty , and not doing that encourages a kind of geopolitical naivete that 's damaging to our interests . 
  this is why i want europe to be more active in the world , so some countries can finally drop the pretense of moral superiority and start discussing these issues instead of just circlejerking about them . 
  i have no idea . 
  i also added a few things to the list . 
  for one thing , the camera panned off of his lips while he was saying that . 
  for another thing , the word `` and '' indicates that it was a sentence fragment , not a whole sentence . 
  for another thing , the title of the video is `` producer says russian narrative bullshit , '' but he did n't say that . 
  he said `` it could be bullshit , '' and then whatever he said to explain that was cut out . 
  for another thing , the fact that he keeps saying `` could be , '' `` might be , '' etc. , indicates that he 's not personally involved in any of this , or he would know if it was bullshit or not . 
  this is someone talking about something he 's not related to in any way . 
  russia is a thing in europe . 
  what he said has probably been selectively edited to mislead the viewer . 
  i can say that because veritas has a record of doing that . 
  in fact it 's all they 're known for . 
   also , have a source for that incarceration claim that is n't breitbart/alt-right sites ? 
  is n't it kinda telling that you do n't know your own racial equality statistics ? 
  my source is the annual report of the office of the correctional investigator to parliament , 2015 . 
  you can read about it [ here . 
  ] ( http://torontoist.com/2016/04/african-canadian-prison-population/ ) i 'll highlight a few relevant passages for you :  according to morgan , the silence around the issue stems from our willful denial of the situation , and our conviction that black incarceration is a uniquely american problem -- not a canadian one . 
  `` it has a lot to do with what i 've called canadian racial exceptionalism , '' says morgan . 
  `` if america is having a conversation about the hyper incarceration of black males , in order to maintain our sense of moral superiority , we ca n't look into those issues as we experience them here in canada , '' he says . 
  morgan notes that , in reality , overrepresentation of the black population in prisons is slightly more pronounced in canada than in the u.s. , where african-americans account for 37 per cent of the prison population and 13 per cent of the general population . 
   `` we 're not , as a country , ready to contest that , '' morgan continues , `` because of the myths we tell ourselves about multiculturalism , and thinking that we have it all figured out . 
  the truth of the matter is , when you look in our prison systems , if you go to our courthouses , if you go at children 's aid offices , to school detention halls , it is overwhelmingly black kids who are being criminalized and punished . 
  i think the generalized silence has to do with what we want to believe about ourselves as canadians . '' [ here are some more relevant statistics for you . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b8kh7srcqaixywb.png:large ) as for refugees , you 've taken thousands . 
  germany has taken a million . 
  after seeing your comment history , i 'm not convinced that your account is n't intended as a satire of canadians . 
  on the chance that you 're really canadian : you should probably be aware that canada has hardly accepted any refugees and that black canadians are more over-incarcerated than black americans . 
   why did they end up fleeing to begin with ? 
  because a war was started in afghanistan , following the american invasion . 
  oh , i see now . 
  never mind , i do n't have the desire to continue this . 
   either you face the problems out there , or the problems end up at your doorstep . 
  exactly ? 
  tell that to your teenagers . 
   well . 
  if you 're a teenager , the country went to shit long before you were born if you 're a teenager whose family fled the taliban , * maybe * you 'd like to fight the taliban and stop them from doing the same thing to others just like you . 
  if you do n't want to do that , then maybe you actually deserve to live under taliban rule . 
   many of the refugees from afghanistan see the afghan government as traitors . 
  receiving funds from european countries to accept returned citizens , ashraf ghani is despised for this . 
  so they 're not very likely to team up with ( in their mind ) the corrupt afghan government . 
   alongside this they 're fleeing from taliban . 
  some might end up joining the taliban , some might displace themselves to neighbouring countries . 
  then , as harsh as it sounds , maybe they deserve to live in a country that 's gone to shit . 
  they might convince some of them to fight for their country : https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/world/asia/afghanistan-kabul-taliban-massacre.html?_r=2&amp;mtrref=www.reddit.com&amp;gwh=9d0c823c30f590e156d8290be0251852&amp;gwt=pay, 
  it 's kind of weird how he openly invokes us as an example . 
  not only because it 's unusual and a little shameless , but also because it would seem to be a losing political strategy , and because verhofstadt himself used to be seen as so anti-american that it was part of the reason blair rejected him as president of the european commission . 
   not being worse than your enemies does not make you a good guy no , but it does mean you 're not `` the bad guys . '', 
  and of course they had humanitarian reasons . 
  read churchill . 
  read any history of the british empire and you 'll be reading about leaders who sincerely believed they were doing the right thing for the world , yesterday as much as today . 
  and please do n't downvote because of disagreement . 
  it puts its significance into perspective . 
  nope . 
  we do n't see it as evil because it was not evil . 
  at their worst , the british have n't been any worse than their enemies , and at their best they have been an inspiration to the world . 
  and they did n't take over the world exclusively for profit . 
  they also did it * to survive * and even for humanitarian reasons . 
  indians were burning their mothers alive as a normal funerary practice until victoria banned it . 
   but the empire gets gushed about a lot . 
  it 's a very difficult thing to realise as you get older maybe we were the bad guys ... never . 
  ruthless yes , because that 's what it takes to prosper in this world . 
  bad guys ? 
  [ dictatorships also shoot people . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francoist_repression ), 
  in italy you have 500-600 murders every year . 
  i assumed guns would account for some fraction of those . 
  how many people do you lose to terrorists ? 
  edit : and we did n't have metal detectors at my university either ( this was in the 2000s , not sure if it 's changed ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's true in your country too , unless you 've had some terrorist attack that killed several thousand people recently . 
  [ compare manitoba/minnesota ( neighbors ) , or saskatchewan/montana ( neighbors ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#canada ) or nova scotia/maine , northwest territories/yukon/alaska , british columbia/washington etc. 
  comparisons between the us and canada in terms of national averages are misleading for the same reason you pointed out : geography . 
  you 've been saying it constantly whether you 've used the word or not . 
  `` stop being american , '' `` are you really so american that you do n't know xyz , '' etc. , etc. 
  if anyone 's behaving like a stereotype , it 's you . 
   can you talk without insulting or is that too difficult ? 
  every one of your comments so far has included some `` stupid american '' line . 
  it 's tiresome . 
  i 'm sorry if they do n't teach you guys what sovereignty means anymore . 
  by the way , idiot : https://data.oecd.org/pisa/science-performance-pisa.htm see where france is ? 
  see where usa is ? 
  or how about this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment stop making an issue of my nationality . 
  not to us , unless we recognize them as such .
