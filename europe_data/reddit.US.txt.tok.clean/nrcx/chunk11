  we are sovereign . 
  no one can compel us legally to do anything . 
  they can compel us with force but not law . 
  no , again , sovereign entities are n't bound to any authority higher than themselves . 
  there are no laws governing them except those to which they agree . 
  if we do n't have a treaty that says an invasion is illegal , then it 's not illegal . 
  you can oppose us with force , but not with the law , because you have no law that 's higher than ours . 
   under what international act do you have the right to invade another country ? 
  the principle of national sovereignty is that the nation is a sovereign entity - there is no higher authority . 
  a sovereign entity does n't need anyone 's permission to do anything . 
  the only laws that bind it are those to which it agrees to be bound ( treaties ) , which it can revoke at any time . 
  so , yes , we have the right to invade , if we decide to , anyone , anywhere . 
   why should germany apply your laws on their ground ? 
  they do n't have to . 
  they can deny the extradition request , which the article says they 're expected to do . 
  but if persons wanted for crimes in the united states travel to the united states , of course they should be arrested . 
  i refuse to believe that you do n't understand this . 
  we are a sovereign nation . 
  the icc has no legal authority over us unless we give it that authority , which we have n't . 
  and our government has not only the right , but the responsibility to protect us . 
  are you kidding ? 
  you 're talking about the international criminal court . 
  we , the united states , have not ratified the icc treaty . 
  the icc therefore has no legal authority to prosecute americans for war crimes . 
  if it did , it would be abducting americans in violation of international law , and yes i 'm fine with invading anyone who does that . 
  of course it is ? 
  how is it not ? 
  our congress has n't ratified that treaty . 
  it has no legal authority over us . 
  you 're damned right we 'll protect our citizens from being kidnapped by foreign governments . 
  it is about the environment . 
  they 're being prosecuted for violating our environmental laws . 
  we do n't need the paris agreement to enforce our own laws . 
  also , jsyk , murica kinda invented environmentalism . 
  world 's oldest national parks . 
  it 's our unique thing in civ 6 !, 
  most of them did n't exist or were n't british yet . 
  but they were all self-governing to some extent . 
  that was a simple necessity because of the distance . 
   but you were not self-governing in 1620 were you ? 
  yep . 
  that colony ( plymouth ) was n't even legally recognized in england . 
  and the [ virginia company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginia_company ) ( a private corporation ) was granted self-government from the early 1600s on . 
  our system of government long predates our independence from britain . 
  edit :  did i say there was ? 
  you said `` washington dictates . '', 
  regardless , there 's no dictatorship . 
  and yeah , 1620 . 
  washington does n't dictate . 
  we 've never had a dictator in our entire 400 years of self-government . 
  we 're a civil body politic . 
  why not ? 
  and today they 're not as intertwined as the states of yugoslavia were , prior to their war . 
  or between american states prior to our war , or mexican states prior to their war , for that matter . 
  you 're not fooling anyone . 
   yeah , and peace in 19th century to holy alliance and other similar pacts ... oh no wait , they did n't work that was only between european countries . 
  nato/wp involved other continents . 
  there was war in yugoslavia in the 1990s and nato stopped it . 
  there 's war now , in ukraine , georgia and azerbaijan , because nato is n't involved . 
  there was war in 1968 when the warsaw pact invaded czechoslovakia . 
  if economic integration alone could make war impossible , civil wars would never happen . 
  to make war impossible requires overwhelming force against any aggressor . 
  i downvote because he makes ignorant comments on every post that are meant as satire but are more often misinterpreted . 
   the last design had migratory animals but also [ images like columbus first voyage ] ( https://i.blogs.es/ee331b/pass/650_1200.jpg ) that looks so cool , especially with the coat of arms . 
  on the inside . 
  the outside is just standard passport : http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55673ada6da8118c339cfd95/how-to-get-a-us-passport-renewed-in-24-hours.jpg, 
  sure but the not-having-a-strong-army thing was justified , since we barely had any army at all . 
   i 've heard that the usa counts indant mortality different from someone here on reddit , but i never looked it up yes it does . 
  according to the cdc , we have a higher survival rate for prenatal infants than denmark : https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db23.htm but that does n't count on this index . 
  it only counts mortality after birth . 
  as for higher education : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment, 
   fun fact , before wwii ( yes , this persisted even though wwi ) the stereotype of americans was that they were too weak and peaceful and could n't conduct war well . 
  the entire us army was 18,000 men when 1,300,000 germans were fighting at verdun alone . 
  as measured by statistics such as crime , which are known to correlate strongly with ethnic homogeneity , wealth and numerous other factors having nothing to do with social progress . 
  and yet it is !,

  [ happy traveler . 
  ] ( https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/images/verification/i9central/uspassportinside.jpg ) although not so happy anymore , since her passport has been cancelled . 
  i asked how something is perceived in germany , not what every single german thinks about it , and not what you personally think about it . 
  are you evading the question ? 
  whether sarcastic or not , i take it as an admission since he chose not to offer any other explanation . 
  the last time this crap was posted here , the author actually [ admitted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hmyl4/a_comparison_between_europe_and_the_us/dizuly9/ ) that the video was made to be misleading . 
  when comparing education , the only statistic he even mentions is student debt . 
  he does n't discuss ( for example ) average [ educational attainment . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment ) the fact that it also targets the uk does n't change that . 
  the uk is hardly europe 's favorite country . 
  `` not allowed '' is n't the same thing as `` ca n't . '', 
  my question was about what germans think , not what you personally think . 
   we do n't some examples then ? 
  would you mind telling me a few ways in which americans are perceived in germany of being better than europeans/germans ? 
  politically , culturally , individually ? 
  the pictures you get are of yourselves as superior to the rest of humanity and especially us . 
  no offense taken . 
  you think there 's a chance that that 's actually true ? 
  in that case we 've been speaking european on our continent for the last several centuries . 
  i 'm sorry , what language is this ? 
  allies are n't enough . 
  a country needs its own weapons to have its own foreign policy . 
  an eu navy would give you that .
