  that 's the biggest change that no one talks about . 
  i doubt it 's much of an issue normally , but circumcision does occasionally go horribly wrong . 
  there was an article a few weeks back about an infant 's penis being entirely amputated as a consequence . 
  as rare as that is , i would guess it 's reason enough that it should not be done on an infant except when strictly necessary . 
  but i 'm comfortable letting the medical community make such determinations . 
  it 's well known that american mothers are repulsed by the idea of touching their children , even when medically necessary . 
   even medical professionals in the united states have noted health benefits in terms of hygiene - which is why many americans are circumcised . 
  really it 's because we 're an english-speaking country . 
  circumcision was/is normal in all english-speaking countries , although not in the uk anymore . 
  there are some medical benefits , but the debate is about consent and necessity . 
  no , but u/kara-kalloveship is comparing french foreign policy to estonian and hungarian foreign policy . 
  how can estonia and hungary have an interventionist foreign policy ? 
  you need ships for that . 
  because they have the ability . 
  when hungarians have carrier battle groups , hungarians will be more interested in using them . 
  you ca n't have militarism before you have a military . 
  [ they remind me of something ... ] ( http://www.napoleonandglory.com/webroot/orange/shops/e75937a0-576d-11df-a8ed-000d609a287c/5572/dfed/5f97/24e9/5449/0a0c/05ee/5feb/1er_grenadier_1812.jpg ), 
  yeah me too . 
  looking at it more closely , flag waver is a little unfair to your flag because it stretches it a bit . 
  but it does look hot , even more hot if hung vertically . 
  i 'd vote for it . 
  edit : did n't notice you 'd posted the flag waver link already , will delete . 
   tell me when were us right and rest of the world not ? 
  most of the world was ruled by kings and was preaching theories of aristocracy when our government existed in its modern form . 
  most of the world thought fascism , communism or religious theocracy was a good idea . 
  most of the world has been democratic for less than a lifetime . 
  we own 40 % of the world 's wealth because most of the world does n't know how to govern itself . 
  you want us to start taking their advice ? 
   go to google images and type city that you `` visited '' and type before and after us came . 
  just see those images , and if you still think it was good that us destroyed so many lives , homes , families than you are truly lost . 
  have you considered what else there may be to that story ? 
  it seems to me that all your information so far has come from only one side . 
  otherwise , you would n't have been unaware of the fact that the us was an isolationist country . 
  try examining history from a pro-american perspective and i bet you 'll be surprised by what you learn . 
   stop reading only us papers only globalresearch.ca is an american website . 
  that was written by an american . 
   as sson as paper is against us it must be false claim . 
  no it 's a false claim because it 's a false claim . 
  you need to start subjecting your sources of information to more criticism . 
   most of the world hates you and this is n't the first time they 've been wrong when we have been right . 
  i 'm pretty sure that nothing on globalresearch.ca is actually true . 
   i wont belive that number is 50 % because you did not provide single source ha , basic facts about our country are unbelievable to you : http://www.gallup.com/poll/4621/majority-americans-identify-themselves-third-generation-americans.aspx btw , that 's out of date : the foreign-born percent of our population is now 13 % , not 7 % . 
   you say you want peace ? 
  how then most of the world thinks you are the main threat to world peace ? 
  i do n't have to justify what the world believes . 
  i realize it 's more convenient for you to believe in the great satan , but this is what happened . 
  and although we did n't lose much of our existing population at that time , more than 50 % of americans today have immigrant parents or grandparents or are immigrants themselves and this is their history as well . 
  plenty of americans were at auschwitz and buchenwald . 
  elie wiesel ( i quoted him in my last comment ) was one . 
   one thing you need to learn is that history is always written by victorious and their side of story . 
  athens lost the peloponnesian war , and still everything we know about it comes from athenian historians . 
   second if you wanted neutrality so bad how come went full 180 , never looked back and went full ham ? 
  because 2 world wars resulting in 100 million dead , plus the soviet union , the korean war , etc. , finally showed that neutrality does n't exist anymore . 
  we 're on a side whether we want it or not , so we might as well make sure our side wins . 
  aside from that , ww2 pretty much obliterated the moral foundations of isolationism . 
  there 's nothing moral about ignoring what 's happening because it 's not happening to you . 
  [ `` neutrality helps the oppressor , never the victim . 
  read , idiot . 
  this is historical reality and not something to debate about . 
   oh jeez you expect me to believe that you went from unwilling to go to war to have major profitable wars just because someone else forced you ? 
  us wanted to go in wars so badly . 
  ok , so you really do n't know our history . 
  read and be enlightened : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neutrality_acts_of_1930s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_non-interventionism#between_the_world_wars, 
   i am talking about you saying that you want to be left alone i said :  so did we that 's [ past tense . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/past_tense ) it 's something we wanted in the past . 
  but it was ultimately delusional . 
  also , that list is rather bullshit . 
  you have numerous un operations and defensive treaty obligations on it . 
  someone does n't know our history . 
  between 1784 to 1918 , the us was never part of any alliances and was n't involved in any wars outside our own continent . 
  because ww2 was when we finally figured out it was n't working . 
  no , but france and russia both supported him far more , and anyone honest would admit that . 
  when we invaded iraq we were fighting french super \u00c9tendards and russian t-72s . 
  his army 's main rifle was the ak-74 . 
  not one major weapon in his entire inventory was american . 
  none of that changes the fact that his entire military was equipped and trained by russia ( and france ) . 
  you have to be seriously ignorant to blame the us for saddam . 
  he was a russian ally as much as assad is . 
  and if you want to talk about chemical weapons , it 's a fact that [ most of them were provided by german companies . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_chemical_weapons_program#the_1980s_program ), 
  `` and i 'm 128 years old , * sucka !, 
  weird that i want this to be true . 
   your mistake was first propping up that asshole he was a soviet ally . 
  his entire army was russian-trained and russian-equipped . 
  why does this myth persist ? 
  oh , right : russia . 
   actually we 'd prefer to be left alone yes , so did we , actually . 
  it means the members of this subreddit generally have no idea how europe actually compares in terms of racial inequality . 
  as you pointed out , they do n't have any relevant statistics . 
  they just have this myth that europeans are n't racist , unlike americans . 
  [ but ask any black european what being a black european is like . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/68xcz0/living_un_finland_as_a_half_black_person_what/ ) when that un report criticizing institutional racism in germany was published , most of this sub [ responded ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wob71/un_accuses_germany_of_institutional_racism_and/ ) by attacking the un and defending racial profiling . 
  and this sub is n't even right-wing by european standards . 
  all you know is what they think they know , which is usually bullshit . 
   remember sb1070 ? 
  where az tried to racially profile . 
  do you understand that racial profiling is legal and normal in germany ? 
  that 's something the un mentions in the article i just linked you to . 
  it 's illegal in the us , and yes , we have states that try to legalize it , but in germany it 's standard practice . 
  you anti-american kids are all alike - you do n't know shit about other nations .
