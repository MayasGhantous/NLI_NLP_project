  saddam 's air force almost entirely came from france . 
  and that 's not the reason for your refugees . 
  this is a different topic and i posted it fyi . 
  we got the alt-right from you guys , not the other way around : https://janyobytes.wordpress.com/2017/01/30/eus-chief-brexit-negotiator-trumps-brand-of-american-populism-came-from-europe/, 
  i 'm not confusing them . 
  it 's my native language . 
  but i really do n't care enough to continue this . 
  i 'm not a right-winger but i do have better things to be doing , so , fine , whatever . 
  you 're confusing disagreement with censorship , same as the other guy . 
  it would be disagreement if tusk had said , `` no , auschwitz shows the necessity of ______ rather than _____ . '', 
  what he said was , `` shut up . '', 
  no , i 'm not doing that . 
  disagreeing does n't mean telling someone not to speak their mind . 
  and if my nationality is relevant here , it 's because americans actually have had a long history of political discourse . 
  the earliest colonies were democratic bodies , which burned witches , punished/exiled heresy , etc , according to the majority 's will . 
  eventually people figured out that a functioning civil society has to be one in which people communicate instead of suppressing each other . 
  yes , and if you decide not to say something because you do n't want to start or continue an argument even though you 're right , like i 'm doing now , that 's self-censorship . 
  there are different kinds of censorship . 
  he did n't offer any real criticism . 
  he did n't give any counterarguments , rebuttals or anything qualifying as civil discourse in reply to what she said about auschwitz and history . 
  all he said was `` shut your mouth . '', 
  yes . 
   perceived as inappropriate for the time and place . 
  that 's why it 's censoring . 
  * censor * is a verb which means , `` to suppress unacceptable parts of . '', 
  it 's from latin * censure . 
  united in diversity ? 
  this part :  `` such words in such a place should never come out from the mouth of a polish prime minister , '' that 's just `` shut up '' in so many needless words . 
  and :  widespread outrage with many taking them as a defense of the polish nationalist-minded law and justice ( pis ) party government 's decision it 's hardly outrageous for a pm to defend her own position . 
  that , as you say , is political discourse . 
   at a ceremony commemorating the 77th anniversary of the first transport of prisoners who entered the auschwitz-birkenau camp , szydlo said that `` auschwitz is a lesson showing that everything needs to be done to protect one 's citizens '' . 
   the comments caused widespread outrage with many taking them as a defense of the polish nationalist-minded law and justice ( pis ) party government 's decision not to accept any refugees under a european union resettlement plan . 
   `` such words in such a place should never come out from the mouth of a polish prime minister , '' donald tusk , european council president and an ex-prime minister of poland , said in a tweet . 
  i do n't think she should be censored just for defending her position . 
  it 's perfectly appropriate . 
  in a civil society , people can disagree about what lessons to learn from history . 
   absolutely true . 
  and that 's the difference between the china of now and the one before , the concentration of power on one person is not so vast . 
  only because the all-powerful party is currently divided by political loyalties . 
  that ( edit : imo ) ca n't last . 
  also , congress , and the supreme court , are n't below the president . 
  we have three co-equal branches of government . 
  and democracy is n't an empty magical phrase to me . 
  my opinion of what it means is [ this . 
  ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=mwtdaaaaiaaj&amp;pg=pa2&amp;lpg=pa2&amp;dq=%22a+political+body+of+citizens+united+for+one+social+life%22+%22the+expression+of+that+force+is+law%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=moxhmjxw47&amp;sig=6u4uioeztulucou_ce7rkelwpxg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi3_7fuhb7uahup5omkhdzian4q6aeijzaa#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20political%20body%20of%20citizens%20united%20for%20one%20social%20life%22%20%22the%20expression%20of%20that%20force%20is%20law%22&amp;f=false ), 
   mate , it 's not nice , and it 's not pretty . 
  but back when autocratic kings and emperors made law , it was still law . 
  but it was n't the * rule * of law . 
  that can only be imposed by some kind of collective ( meaning representative ) body , which binds the king , or the dictator , to the law . 
   and that 's why it took off after the 1980s . 
  in it 's own way china has law , it absolutely does not . 
  you 're falling for propaganda . 
  under the chinese consitution , which the communist party has rewritten dozens of times , the communist party is the final authority in everything . 
  there 's no law . 
  it 's just despotism disguised as law . 
  it took off in the 1980s because they finally gave up on * some * of their dictatorial bullshit , but the rest still remains . 
  china did n't even have a legal system until the 1980s . 
  there is no rule of law in china , and no separation of powers . 
  those things do n't automatically exist in a democracy , but a democracy is the only form of government in which they can exist , because everything else is just the tyranny of force . 
  until there 's democracy , there will never be anything but crisis . 
  that 's been the pattern everywhere else in the world . 
  it 's not as if siding with the monarchy means repressing democracy . 
  the kingdom of saudi arabia held its first elections in 2015 . 
  the belief in washington is that as long as the monarchy is in control and willing to reform , democracy and peace are both possible , but if the monarchy is overthrown , then there can only be abject tyranny , witch-burnings and perpetual war - which , because of their importance to the world economy , involves us whether we want it to or not . 
  evil money-grubbing elites secretly manipulating us behind the scenes !, 
  open your eyes !, 
  the ` referendum ' was a sham !, 
  we 're all puppets of an elite conspiracy !, 
  the uk is a great country - the elites stabbed it in the back !, 
  leave it to the german to believe a paranoid conspiracy theory that pits civil society against itself . 
  i was actually about to post that same quote , only what i was going to say was : i do n't see why anyone would read something so obviously slanted . 
  its authenticity was confirmed by the state department . 
  why is it suspicious ? 
  `` the blacks . '', 
  btw black canadians are more over-incarcerated than black americans , which i 'm 100 % certain you do n't know , because your rants are as good as a sign around your neck saying `` i 'm a pig ignorant fool who has never been to any of these places i 'm talking about . '', 
  when you grow up , try to travel a bit and gain some [ perspective ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-34140283 ) on what the people and places you 're talking about are actually like . 
  above all , exercise some charity in your opinions , before you lock yourself into a lifetime of ignorant beliefs about people you 've never met . 
  you might also want to read something about what actually happened in [ grenada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_grenada ) because it 's obvious there too that you 're utterly misinformed . 
  yeah , i do n't think you 're any of those things . 
  i think you 're an ignorant child on the internet with no perspective . 
   the trans-atlantic alliance will eventually have to deal with a longer-term problem that will outlast the trump administration . 
  one of britain 's great uses to washington in recent decades has been as a bridge to the european union . 
  it 's why barack obama lobbied so hard for a ` remain ' vote ahead of last year 's referendum . 
  it 's shortsighted . 
  obama 's a globalist and was never trying to maintain american hegemony . 
  his vision of the future is one in which countries no longer exist . 
  someone who actually wants the anglo-american alliance to continue its role in history as long as possible would be thinking in churchill 's terms , about some union of english-speaking peoples . 
   prime ministers , in a more understated manner , have also come to believe in british exceptionalism , the idea that westminster is the mother parliament , and that the uk has a governing model and liberal values that set the global standard for others to follow , not least its former colonies . 
  i think british understatement is greatly exaggerated . 
  this is the nation who send hms vengeance and hms invincible to conduct war games with uss poindexter j. 
  nobody , and who have rule , britannia ! , with exclamation point , as the inspiration for america , fuck yeah !, 
  who hurt you ? 
  `` if you want to feel even better , there are more people in guangzhou , which is a chinese sub-provincial city you know nothing about . '', 
  why would that make anyone feel better ? 
   germany and california agree never have four words caused me to consider so many wondrous and disturbing possibilities . 
  it was , yes , only the civil war that delayed the us 's reaction to the french intervention in mexico . 
  from 1865 on , arms and volunteers were sent to the liberal army , and the american legion of honor fought at the siege of mexico city in 1867 . 
  edit : re : cuba , those concerns are less relevant today because technology has moved on and russian subs/bombers are in the gulf of mexico and off the coast of california anyway . 
  also brazil + russia are cooperating as brics , creating the ndb to compete with the imf , and venezuela was/is all lovey-dovey with iran . 
  if we see the americas as our sphere of influence today , we 're deluding ourselves .
