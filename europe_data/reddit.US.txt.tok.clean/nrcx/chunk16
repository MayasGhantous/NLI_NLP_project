   decided not to because britain was an important ally i mean that 's the point . 
  it does n't apply anymore . 
  the doctrine was about opposing european powers in the new world . 
  we do n't do that anymore . 
  the monroe doctrine has n't existed for generations . 
  surely the falklands war proved that . 
  wikipedia 's article describes it only in the past tense . 
  congress is the final authority on all troop deployments : http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/17/politics/aumf-isis-house-vote-fails-us-troops/index.html, 
  not on foreign policy . 
  he was actually [ screaming ] ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-furious-clinton-criticizing-foreign-policy/ ) at them in private , refusing to listen to any of them . 
  he did n't listen when clinton warned him about the `` russian reset '' and he did n't listen when she warned him of the humanitarian catastrophe in libya . 
  for eight years we basically lost every battle . 
   obama went for the youth vote in 2008 , and guess what happened ? 
  70 million votes . 
  for the wrong candidate . 
  clinton would have been a far better president . 
  obama was naive and inexperienced exactly like she said . 
  his iraq withdrawal and appeasement of russia went exactly as she predicted they would . 
  our enemies walked over us for eight years , and even domestically , obama was unable to accomplish much of anything , and what he did accomplish will probably be undone . 
  but the youth knew better . 
   and even though actual left politics would galvanize an overwhelming youth turnout just like in the uk , they keep refusing to do it here , mostly because that would mean having to enact policies that are bad for the bottom lines of their moneyed friends ... 
  the thing about youth politics is that it 's rarely a good idea . 
  youth are inexperienced . 
  that 's the definition of youth . 
  they tend to go for extreme and ( as they later realize ) ridiculous ideas . 
  sanders of course would galvanize a generation of college students wearing red star t-shirts who know nothing about the world , which is why the democratic leadership does n't want anything to do with him . 
  ignorant perspective . 
  it 's describing the [ sixth party system , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) which began with the civil rights movement . 
  the fight over segregation broke up the fifth party system and created the `` identity politics '' and `` value politics '' which have characterized the sixth party system . 
  it did n't just appear from nowhere because `` exciting '' and it 's not what 's going on in britain . 
  again , press freedom usa 41 , china 176 , north korea 180 . 
  you just casually accept that the us has `` more press freedom '' - are you kidding ? 
  it 's not even in the same universe of press freedom . 
  and why , do you think , is it not ? 
  because of propaganda ? 
  do you realize the irony of saying `` mass propaganda '' here ? 
  mass propaganda is what china and north korea have instead of a free press , you silly child . 
  lol . 
   i 'm not trying to be deep , that 's just how i view it as an outsider . 
  yes , with complete ignorance . 
  surveillance , compared to china ? 
  you know nothing about either country . 
  jesus christ are you really defending that statement ? 
  and as i 've been saying , that 's what i find strange . 
  maybe it is a cultural thing . 
  germany is a kanzlerdemokratie and you 're accustomed to having a single person as head of both legislative and executive , but in our system the president is n't even the leader of his own party . 
  i 'm certain you do n't know this , but several eu countries have more prison convictions per capita than us . 
  incarceration rate has more to do with the length of sentences . 
  press freedom index currently lists the us at 41 , france at 39 , italy at 52 , china at 176 and north korea at 180 . 
  pretty even in authoritarianism ? 
  that really is childish . 
  the question is n't about trump - it 's about the united states , an ally for generations , and china , a totalitarian regime that breaks every agreement it makes . 
  i have to blame your media for the confusion . 
  and i 'm sure ours does n't help . 
  it begins : `` this european union deal is not perhaps everything that we would have liked . 
  it is not what ** we eurosceptics ** were hoping , not when the process kicked off . '', 
  i know this sounds reasonable to you but it 's just not . 
  even vietnam has a strategic partnership with us now because they know we 're more trustworthy than china . 
  any nation that trusts china more than us is seriously misinformed . 
  was he really ? 
  what 's the most pro-eu thing he 's ever said ? 
  judging from comments before he was president . 
   personally i hope this chaos prevails until brexit talks really just . . fizzle out . 
  personally i hope it prevails just long enough for us to recover from mental illness so we can discuss it in the context of empire 2 . 
  tbh i think boris is a much better choice for pm . 
  now if only we could get a saner president . 
  volatile and jittery . 
  because you have elections at semi-random intervals . 
  british government is so chaotic . 
  he hates donnie , but hopefully he 'll still be around for donnie 's eventual replacement . 
   looking at the free press index it says usa # 41 ; uk # 40 ; france # 39 ; italy # 52 ; south korea 53 ; japan 72 ; brazil 103 ; india 136 ; china 176 ; north korea 180 . 
  and really the standards are n't very objective . 
  it penalizes the us for its `` war on whistleblowers , '' which we would n't be fighting if we were a small , neutral country . 
  i thought it did when it annexed parts of the federal republic of central america , but actually , i was wrong !, 
  til . 
  as flattering as that is , i do n't think we 've ever deserved such expectations . 
  if we were ever the democracy , it was only because all the other leading contenders eliminated themselves or were eliminated somehow and it 's mostly by sheer luck that we were the only ones left . 
   and sorry , a government and especially the head ( orange ) of government does represent its country , whether you like it or not . 
  yes , and countries do n't change that much overnight , or even over generations . 
  so if your opinion of them changes that much overnight , what kind of opinion is that ? 
  how ? 
  i do n't even know who half our allies ' heads of government are and it does n't affect what i think about them . 
  jeremy corbyn is a lunatic but his election would n't change my opinion of the uk . 
  it 's a democracy . 
  pms come and go . 
  in a way , that explanation makes it worse . 
  i mean it 's strange to realize that a 70-year-old ally judges us solely on the basis of one man . 
  [ first mexican empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_mexican_empire ) or [ second mexican empire ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_mexican_empire ), 
  i normally agree , but , * we do n't have to respect the sovereignty of countries who are already at war with us . 
  * it was n't exactly * the * country anyway - noriega had obviously been voted out of office . 
  * our [ treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torrijos%e2%80%93carter_treaties ) with panama actually does give us the right to use military force to ensure the operation of the canal . 
  ... after panama 's declaration of war . 
  and silly us for thinking that a canal handling billions of tons of cargo traffic , which the us spent billions of dollars and many lives building , is worth fighting over . 
  maybe it 'd be better not to let germans ' opinions affect you that much . 
  they 're not infallible . 
  and the international date line runs 1.5 km between the us and russian parts of the diomedes islands , meaning that if you go any more west , you 're actually east . 
  political reasons which have n't stopped norway from raising its emissions from 7.4 to 11.7 . 
  this is n't moving any goalpost . 
  the basis of macron 's argument is that the us , because of donald trump , is n't going to continue reducing its co2 emissions , which is contrary to what is reasonable to expect .
