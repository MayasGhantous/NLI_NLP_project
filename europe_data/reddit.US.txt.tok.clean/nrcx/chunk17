   quick , move that goalpost faster . 
  denying reality ? 
  there are obvious reasons why us/canada/australia have higher co2 emissions and they 're related to geography , climate and industry . 
  national pride does n't make those reasons disappear . 
   i have no doubt that it will attract businesses , especially from foreigners and expats who moved to america in the last couple years but do n't feel optimistic about their future . 
  that goes against all evidence we have on the subject . 
  immigrants in particular are always the most patriotic americans . 
  people who spent years moving to a country and becoming citizens are n't going to suddenly change their minds . 
  it 's impossible for that to happen for these reasons . 
  vote me down if you want but that 's just the truth . 
  and the stated reason ( environmentalism ) is itself very flimsy . 
  the us has reduced its [ co2 emissions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita ) more than most european countries and there 's every reason to expect that trend to continue . 
  it 's an amazingly transparent attempt to steal talent/jobs from the united states , disguised as environmentalism . 
  honestly , it 's like satire . 
  edit : and just thinking it 's going to work is kinda nuts . 
  there are reasons we have those industries . 
  macron must not understand much if this is a real thing and not just propaganda for domestic consumption . 
  i hate to be argumentative but is there any statistical evidence of that ? 
  [ there was another , but mexico annexed it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_republic_of_central_america ), 
  there is certainly something refreshing about it . 
  https://data.oecd.org/pisa/science-performance-pisa.htm we could be dumber . 
  we could be spanish , french , swedish , etc. 
  your wealth was subsidized by all those brave americans who died to keep the sun alive . 
  our parties are private organizations , whereas the authority of the communist party is written into china 's constitution . 
  our parties are civilian , whereas the communist party actually owns china 's only legal military , the pla . 
  our parties evolved over 400 years of constitutional democracy , during which we have never lapsed into dictatorship . 
  those are the same parties i would have assigned them . 
  i do n't see the problem . 
  well , germany does n't have as many parties as the netherlands . 
  this is a generalization . 
  but you 're saying the german hillary clinton and the german bernie sanders would be in the same party ? 
  and german george w. bush and german donald trump ? 
  i did n't say it was . 
  i just said our parties are more like your coalitions . 
  i think it is , but that 's a whole other debate . 
   ~ ~ unstable ~ ~ fluid . 
  :p edit : i 'm kidding . 
  it 's just different . 
  in most eu countries , clinton , obama and sanders would be in 2-3 separate parties . 
  that 's why i said ours are more like your coalitions . 
  it 's not a perfect analogy but it works . 
  sure it does : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_party_system our party system breaks apart and rearranges itself every few decades . 
  we 're currently on our sixth party system , which is collapsing , hence the political chaos . 
  our parties are essentially what you would call coalitions . 
  it 's not just colder climates , but more extreme climates . 
  much of north america has a siberian climate : extreme heat in summer and extreme cold in winter . 
  treaties , yeah , but over the years states have standardized their laws in various ways , like the [ model penal code . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/model_penal_code ) but this is hot air . 
  what they mean is that they want to take credit for our environmental protections . 
  various states have said that they plan to continue cutting emissions ( as they have been ) but now it 's evidence of big stronk eu taking charge . 
  we do n't live in the frontier age because the frontier is populated . 
  if it was unpopulated , it 'd be the frontier age again . 
  and what you 're talking about is depopulating an area the size of europe . 
  i mean , of course it 'd have benefits , but it 's not a near-term solution . 
  edit : better . 
  anyway urbanization ? 
  ok , we 'll just relocate a few hundred million people . 
  i 'm not sure you realize the scope of what you 're suggesting . 
  besides , it would n't work : if our population was concentrated into a few megacities it would just make land everywhere else in the country incredibly cheap . 
  population density is n't the result of planning , but the result of available land . 
  9.6 is more than half of 16.1 . 
   twice as high in the usa as they are in europe only if you do n't count [ norway , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita ) the netherlands or germany as europe . 
  and the netherlands has n't lowered its co2 emissions at all since 2000 , and norway has actually raised them . 
  and europe 's emissions are generally lower than us/canada/australia / russia 's for an obvious reason : milder climate . 
  since 2000 , germany has lowered its co2 per capita by 10 % . 
  the us has lowered its co2 per capita by 20 % . 
  china has raised its co2 per capita by 300 % . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita i 'm curious what you think we could learn from the communist party that we do n't already know . 
  it seems more likely that people in democratic countries defending `` plucky '' islamic terrorists and attacking `` the us regime '' are going to serve as humorous footnotes when the histories of these times are written . 
  lord palmerston !, 
  it 's median household income . 
  beyond that , i do n't know . 
  but what i meant was that whether the number is high or low , median income is a more accurate indication of quality of life because it indicates something about the population in general , whereas statistics like maternal mortality only indicate something about some segments of the population . 
  as for u/teniga 's reply , i 'll speculate that it 's probably not about wealth distribution , because texas is n't an unusual state by that measurement . 
  it may have something to do with it being the largest border state , with the largest number of illegal immigrants , who often do n't seek medical treatment because of their illegal status . 
  also i think the way it 's phrased is unfair : higher than any developed country does n't mean * highest in the developed world . 
  * i suspect that other developed countries also have outlier regions . 
  or polygamy . 
  or maybe the fourth premise :  maternal mortality = quality of life . 
  since maternal mortality is a rare event that has no bearing on quality of life for most people , using it as a stand-in for quality of life will obviously result in discrepancies . 
  the median income in texas is $ 55,653 , which is certainly more of an indication of quality of life than maternal mortality . 
  it 's you guys who do this . 
  the users above are only this demoralized because you germans/french/etc constantly defame us . 
  countries who signed kyoto protocol : * germany * france * norway * sweden * ~ ~ usa ~ ~ countries who since 2000 have reduced co2 levels by ~ 20 % : * ~ ~ germany ~ ~ * ~ ~ france ~ ~ * ~ ~ norway ~ ~ * ~ ~ sweden ~ ~ * usa in france and norway , co2 emissions have actually gone up . 
  signing agreements does n't mean actually doing anything . 
  but all of our media is just buying the french and german line about how we 're destroying the planet and how they 're going to save it . 
  it 's sad . 
  if you were american you 'd probably be a trump voter . 
  a strong handshake is squeezing someone 's hand as hard as you can , white-knuckled , in an effort to hurt him ? 
  it 's not his fault he did that ? 
  has he ever tried to squeeze someone 's hand painfully tight ? 
  except trump has never done that , so maybe it 's actually macron language . 
  france knew almost nothing about macron before they elected him . 
   it is proof yet again that what we witnessed from the elysee on thursday was a master class in communications . 
   not only did macron break brazenly with longstanding convention ... he even had the chutzpah to subvert the us leader 's personal campaign slogan . 
  i think bbc 's in love . 
  it 's a little weird to congratulate someone for trying to cause pain in a handshake , though . 
  it seems like it should be the opposite to me . 
  because i 'm dumb and it 's easy to forget that 's what it probably is , i guess .
