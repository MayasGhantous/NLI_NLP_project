  did i say all by ourselves ? 
  why are you twisting things ? 
  i said we intervened ( reluctantly ) to stop europe from killing itself , which is just what happened . 
  it 's not as if we ever wanted to be there . 
  and we have n't left since 1944 because it 's literally never been safe to leave . 
  how is that not true ? 
  i realize you 're patriotic about your continent but there 's a line between patriotism and self-deception . 
  all by themselves ? 
  just wow . 
  you 're denying the holocaust ? 
   that 's , at least , how the us has always seen europe . 
  always ? 
  i think you mean , ever since the last time we had to stop europe from killing itself . 
  for most of our history we just wanted to stay away . 
  but anyway , no , americans have never seen european countries as colonies . 
  i mean , have you considered the irony of that statement ? 
  they 're not , though . 
  trump has the authority to withdraw the us from agreements , but he does n't have the authority to change law . 
  more importantly the fact that the us does n't agree to a treaty does n't mean it wo n't adhere to it . 
  the us did n't agree to kyoto either , but has since lowered its co2 emissions [ more than germany , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita ) which did agree to it . 
  it also never ratified the un convention on the law of the sea , but adheres to it as if it did . 
  and these same articles appeared back in 2005 when kyoto went into effect , only with bush instead of trump . 
  they 're just going way overboard as usual . 
  edit : but i guess us media is saying exactly the same thing , so maybe i ca n't blame them . 
  comment removed . 
  summary : some bullshit about how german media says the same thing about every republican us president , which on reflection is n't that blameworthy since us media does the same . 
  if that 's true , then almost all other democracies must be authoritarian nightmares . 
   it 's just a small incident but it tells pretty much everything about him . 
  i 've heard this said often about different people in different incidents and have learned to suspect it . 
  in any realistic scenario , it would be more like us following you into war . 
   in the context of the us invading all of europe i think that would be a hard sell to the british population . 
  historically speaking , i think it would be an even harder sell to the american population . 
  but if it has to be done ... 
  but there was a second half of that sentence :  and most of the time you do n't have to pay that yourself . 
  the state paid 90 % of my university tuition . 
   hundreds of thousands of usd for a degree ? 
  the average cost of tuition is $ 9000 per year at a state university , and most of the time you do n't have to pay that yourself . 
  i 'm going to remove this because i guess i phrased it accusatively . 
  i should remember not to ask `` why not '' questions . 
  yes , that 's basically what i 'm asking . 
  and also why eu countries are n't in south korea , for example , for similar reasons . 
  i know the question was vague and generalizing , but i did n't intend for it to be dissected literally . 
  what alliance means to me : canada , for example , has armored brigades in eastern europe . 
  are there any arrangements like that between european and asian countries ? 
  yeah , but i mean , from that article :  the ** first ever ** joint exercise in japan between the royal air force and the japan air self-defense force, 
   it 's really hard to tell a story about blowing up two cities in completely neutral fashion . 
  how would you tell the story in a completely neutral fashion , and how did your education tell it ? 
  can you paraphrase ? 
   no , history is to teach facts not morals . 
  in the answers so far , there seems to be a disagreement between slavic and nordic countries on this . 
   finally , in france you have to picture this : our two deadliest conflicts ( ww1 and ww2 ) were fought against germany . 
  germany is now one of our best allies ... several millions of death for what ? 
  we earned nothing with it . 
  but that 's because you let them live !, 
  if you had utterly crushed the germans and made their children speak french , then it would be like having two frances !, 
  / s , thank you for the insight . 
  well , that 's not how we cover it . 
  i think our textbooks assign the blame for ww1 ( and consequently ww2 ) to the old continent in general , with some degree of between-the-lines smugness . 
  singular guilt ? 
  i hope you 're not german . 
  it 's not a huge difference but the european war is given more pages , mostly because of cultural affinity , i think . 
  there are a lot more german/italian/polish americans than japanese/chinese americans . 
  and we say ww2 started in 1939 in poland , instead of 1937 in china . 
  i guess it 's unreasonable to expect the sino-japanese war to be covered much . 
  to me it 's the same war , but then it 's really not . 
  we never had ethics either . 
  probably should . 
  civics and government classes were basically that , though , at least as far as anything involving government was concerned . 
  thanks for the thorough answer . 
  as an educator , can you give an example of how teachers at a teenage level emphasize the badness of war ? 
  i realize it 's a broad question . 
  not as briefly as that . 
  we were taught about national socialism being a fanatically racist ideology and how it lead to the deaths of millions in death camps and exterminations , along with the wider story of the nazis dismantling german democracy and starting ww2 . 
  we watched footage of concentration camps . 
  i do n't remember any explicit words of condemnation , but then it kind of speaks for itself . 
  i asked what you learn about the war . 
  i 'm not arguing about it . 
  i do n't know whether it 's unusual in my country or not , because we do n't have a national curriculum , but in my school system history and civics were taught in separate classrooms by separate teachers . 
  we did learn how things should be ( or had to be for free government et cetera ) in civics , but history as far as i can remember was very amoral with no discussions about what was justified . 
  anything besides the holocaust ? 
  do you cover the japanese virus bombs and other bio/chemical wmds ? 
  i think there 's a difference in how international agreements are viewed . 
  we 're still not a member of icc , unclos , kyoto or paris . 
  in europe you have so many international agreements for so many things that if you do n't sign an agreement you basically do n't want the thing . 
  also electoral systems . 
  you do n't have politicians who disagree strongly with their party leaders , so discussion of some issues is shocking . 
  but i highly doubt that trump truly thinks global warming is a hoax . 
  his un ambassador says he accepts it as manmade . 
   however , from a european perspective the us government can be fairly annoying when it comes to battling global warming . 
  here , shifts in governments means shifts in the ideas regarding how best to stop it ; meanwhile , in the us , it often means a shift in whether or not the american government actually believes that there is such a thing as climate change in the first place . 
  could you explain why you have that perception ? 
  because here are some relevant facts : countries who signed kyoto protocol : * germany * france * norway * sweden * netherlands * poland * ~ ~ usa ~ ~ countries who since 2000 have reduced co2 emissions per capita by ~ 20 % * ~ ~ germany ~ ~ * ~ ~ france ~ ~ * ~ ~ norway ~ ~ * sweden * ~ ~ netherlands ~ ~ * ~ ~ poland ~ ~ * usa https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita sweden 's lowered its emissions about the same % that the us has , but no more . 
  some countries on that list have n't lowered their emissions at all , and others have even raised them . 
  what explains this perception ? 
  edit : as for china , its co2 emissions have increased by ~ 300 % . 
  i 'm asking because i was surprised by [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6f32c8/do_other_countries_teach_the_end_of_wwii_as/difqdk3/ ) about ww2 :  education about the pacific theatre is mainly focused on how cruel the nuclear bombs were . 
  hiroshima , dresden and auschwitz are the most frequently cited examples of the atrocities committed during the war . 
  what surprised me were two things : 1 . 
  do your history classes incorporate moral judgments ( cruel/appropriate/justified / unjustified/right/wrong , etc ) ? 
  do your classes about the asian theater of ww2 mainly discuss the atomic bombs ?
