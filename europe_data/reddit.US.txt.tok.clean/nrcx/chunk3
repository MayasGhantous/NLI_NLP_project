  that would be fine if you were only trying to determine the obesity rates of eu countries , but since you 're trying to establish how they compare with ours , what 's more important is making sure that the same methods are used in both cases . 
   also because it does n't make sense that the uk would have 28 % when the eu average is 14 % and the highest in the eu is malta at 24 % . 
  ... according to eurostat ? 
  is n't that circular logic ? 
  then people would n't know what exactly i said . 
  i 'd rather leave it . 
  and i do realize the difference . 
  i was once ( barely ) conversational in french and can still read it well enough . 
  i just glanced at it for a second the first time . 
  then people would n't know what exactly i said . 
  i 'd rather leave it . 
  and i do know the difference . 
  i was once ( barely ) conversational in french , although i 've forgotten 90 % of it . 
  i would assume that they use different methods of analysis which produce different results . 
  that 's why it 's better , when making a comparison , to refer to a single source ( like the who ) instead of comparing different sets of information from different sources . 
  anyway , pure reason is enough to tell you that the usa is n't like a different planet than canada , australia , uk , etc. 
  also ,  or who thinks that the usa has only a 5 % higher rate than the uk when it 's almost twice . 
  prevalence of population  30 bmi [ ( source : world health organization ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_body_mass_index_ ( bmi \\ ) ) : united states : 33.7 united kingdom : 28.1, 
  you can keep going if you want , but i 'm finished here . 
  anyone who thinks that only 24 % of portuguese has never been to portugal . 
  i doubt you 've ever been to either portugal or the united states . 
  you 're just ranting about subjects that are utterly beyond your understanding . 
  yes , i goofed . 
  and unlike this dumbass i 'm not going to go back and edit my comment into something completely different to cover it up . 
  yes it is french ; i did n't notice because it only took one look at the graph to see that it clearly shows that over half of portugal 's population is overweight , which is exactly what i said above , and that you 're being completely dishonest . 
  a few comments ago you tried to tell me that only 24 % of portuguese were overweight :  24 % is probably overweight rather than obese . 
   https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6t9oa5/san_francisco_or_lisbon/dlj96n6/ it 's twice that high , you ignorant troll . 
  and yes its actual obesity rate is the same as california 's . 
   your article says that it 's an estimate . 
  do n't need estimates when we have eurostats : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7700908/3-20102016-bp-fr.pdf/6a7f5689-11b2-4862-8b29-d5bf59795b87 i 'm guessing you were betting that i could n't read portuguese and would n't be able to see what you 're doing there . 
  you 're counting the category `` pre-obese '' as a separate group from `` obese '' for portugal , but not for the us . 
  that 's not a proper comparison . 
  and now you 're changed the subject to life expectancy and wealth . 
  crawl back under your bridge , troll . 
  california 's is n't our lowest . 
  no , 59 % of portuguese adults are overweight and 24 % are obese : http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/child-obesity-portugal-among-the-worst-performers/30770 3 . 
  what is `` europe ? '', 
  if you 're going to generalize 700 million people , go ahead , but your data will be meaningless and your conclusions will be filled with errors . 
  no it is n't . 
  and for the record , portugal 's obesity rate is the same as california 's : 24 % . 
  no it is n't . 
  at least half were serious , but even if they were all joking , i still find it remarkable . 
  if the question were `` hamburg or rome , '' the jokes would be actual jokes about beer or something . 
  they would n't just be `` ca n't be rome because it 's not full of fat stupid italians . '', 
  at least half were serious , but even if they were all joking , i find the nature of the jokes perplexing . 
  if the question were `` hamburg or rome , '' the `` jokes '' would be actual jokes about beer or something . 
  they would n't just be `` must be hamburg because it 's not full of fat stupid capitalists . '', 
  out of 12 current comments :  looks pretty nice , so must be lisbon ...  i do n't see any fat people , so lisbon ...  it does n't stink of crony capitalism , wealth disparity , rampant materialism . 
  lisbon . 
  ...  it 's not currently being destroyed by something , so lisbon . 
  and that is absolutely absurd , especially since the `` top '' countries are ones where [ this happens .

  that 's what we 're meant to believe . 
  this report comes from a media advocacy group , * i.e. 
  * a special-interest group . 
  its purpose is to change people 's perceptions and lobby for laws their sponsors want . 
  no , it means freedom of the press and that 's all it means . 
  and do n't call me shirley . 
  besides , that point it makes about shield laws is another item of bullshit - 49 out of 50 states have them . 
  decentralization = / = anarchy . 
  no , it means * freedom * of the press and that 's * all * it means . 
  it does n't mean ensuring that xyz is reported . 
  and do n't call me shirley .

  1000 per year , against 10 million per day ? 
  yes , that is negligible . 
  but the press are n't being imprisoned for reporting things . 
  the targets of this `` war '' are government employees - edward snowden , chelsea manning , etc. 
  press freedom is the freedom of the press and nothing other than that . 
  but the press are n't being imprisoned , or fined , for reporting things . 
  press freedom is about that - the freedom of the press . 
  not the freedom of government employees . 
  look at the criteria and you 'll notice that it 's not really about `` press freedom '' at all . 
  we 're yellow because of our `` war on whistleblowers . '', 
  but whistleblowers are n't the press . 
  anyone informed on the subject would know that our restrictions on freedom of the press are among the lightest in the world . 
  i do n't know . 
  i think it 's very easy to imagine that things wo n't change . 
  but 26 years ago , half of europe was totalitarian . 
  a lot can change in a few years . 
  yes , that 's the idea . 
  that 's not what everyone wants , but it 's what these people want . 
  it 's actually true . 
  a lot of money is currently wasted on the eu 's military forces due to redundancy . 
  a single eu military could be more effective with a lower price tag . 
  that 's what 's so scary - his generals have been fleeing the country , or getting purged and executed by anti-aircraft guns . 
  we 're gambling everything on the sanity of one young man we already know to be a cold-blooded murderer . 
  i think it 's unlikely , but to be honest i 'm not so confident of kim 's mental stability . 
  and i do n't think it would be anything like vietnam . 
  the vietnamese were actually fighting for something . 
  it was a war of independence , originally against colonial france . 
  i do n't think north koreans actually have anything like that kind of devotion to their nightmare dictatorship . 
  if they did , they would n't have giant concentration camps and land mines along their border . 
  there was no `` red line '' this time ; it was just a vague `` watch yourself '' statement . 
  in some ways trump is a lot smarter than obama . 
  you 're probably not aware of this , but `` our '' army in korea is actually [ united nations command . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_command ) if there 's another war in korea it 's not going to be dprk versus `` the west , '' but between dprk and the united nations , just like last time , and not because of rare earth minerals but because they 're fucking crazy totalitarians , also like last time . 
  really , you 're going to blame this on us ? 
  even putin warned them last year that their threats of `` preventative nuclear strikes '' against us were actually a legal justification for invasion .
