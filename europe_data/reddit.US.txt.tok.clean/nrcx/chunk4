  i do n't see the problem . 
  tbh i think this is what we need . 
  obama and bush always just shrugged at the kims ' incessant threats . 
  it 's nice to have a president who tells them plainly what 's going to happen . 
  i even like the understated way he said it : `` north korea better get their act together or they are going to be in trouble like few nations have ever been in trouble . '', 
  he just knows . 
  so you 're basically at the center of the central region . 
  it 's britain , not norway : https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/08/rochdale-grooming-case-10-men-sentenced-to-up-to-25-years-in-jail, 
   a few years tops in a western british jail nah it 's britain , not norway : https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/08/rochdale-grooming-case-10-men-sentenced-to-up-to-25-years-in-jail, 
   white americans for the most part are insulated from the vices of their government , and to claim that they , not the black , asian , or latino populations , are tge most distrustful of the government shows a serious disconnect in your views of your country and reality have you ever been to america ? 
  it would be interesting to see the number of americans who agree . 
  no , not true . 
  you do n't seem to get us at all . 
  mainstream media never talks about `` the librul media . '', 
  the mainstream media is the subject of that derogatory . 
  and yes , we learn these things in school . 
  i went to high school in a town with a population of 350 , and we learned the rationale behind the separation of powers , the 2nd amendment , etc. , in our civics and government classes . 
  our founders , if anything , were paranoid about too much government . 
  any poll ever taken will show that americans are more distrustful of government than europeans , and that white americans are the most distrustful of all . 
   her community is one of thousands in america , and distrust of media and the government is certainly not a topic that white americans by large learn about from parents or school . 
  speaking as someone else from such a town , it certainly is . 
  white americans from small towns are the * most * distrustful of government . 
  for her to say this , i can only assume she must have had no exposure to american politics before leaving the country . 
   her community is one of thousands in america , and distrust of media and the government is certainly not a topic that white americans by large learn about from parents or school . 
  speaking as another white american from a town like hers , yes , it is . 
  our schools have civics and government classes where we learn the reasoning behind the separation of powers , the 2nd amendment , etc. 
  and culturally speaking , distrust in government is the most american thing ever , * especially * for white americans . 
  for her to think we always trust our government and media , i can only assume that she had no exposure to american politics before leaving the country . 
  and , very importantly , being willing to change your mind when you learn something else . 
  he did n't even say both sides are bad . 
  he said violence is bad , m ` kay . 
  you ninja 'd me . 
  i think she needs to realize that when she says `` we , '' she means `` i. '', 
   `` we are told it is the greatest country on earth . 
  the thing is , we will never reconsider that narrative the way you are doing just now , because to us , that is n't propaganda , that is truth . 
  and to us , that is n't nationalism , it 's patriotism . 
  and the thing is , we will never question any of it because at the same time , all we are being told is how free-thinking we are , that we are free . 
  so we do n't know there is anything wrong in believing our country is the greatest on earth . 
  the whole thing sort of convinces you that a collective consciousness in the world came to that very conclusion . ''  `` wow , '' a friend once replied . 
  `` how strange . 
  that is a very quiet kind of fascism , is n't it ? '' she should stop saying `` we '' when she means `` idiots like me . '', 
   americans rarely think about how their national identities relate to their personal ones ??? 
  we talk about it incessantly . 
  you 're really arguing that you do n't need to read more than 3 paragraphs of something to understand it ? 
  maybe you should read the rest . 
  i think the issue is that he still refuses to specifically criticize maduro . 
  would you like to point out what i missed ? 
  if scots wince at the thought of being the same nation as england , why do n't they vote for independence ? 
  and is he really saying britain was wrong to defend its citizens in the falklands war ? 
  is n't that kinda insane ? 
  you could help me understand by answering the question . 
  if scots wince at the thought of being the same nation as england , why do n't they vote for independence ? 
  and is he honestly saying britain was wrong to defend its citizens in the falklands war ? 
  the point was that you asked why she decided to live in finland . 
  you treat her as an alien . 
  we do n't have public toilets at all . 
  i guess we do n't see the need ; you 're surrounded by buildings with toilets . 
  i think the issue is the fact that she was born in finland , yet white finns like you ask her things like `` why did she decide to come here ? '', 
  you treat her like an eternal outsider . 
  you do n't accept her as one of you . 
  at least that 's my experience after talking with other dark-skinned finns . 
  its stated mission is to portray germany a certain way . 
  it 's sad that i 'm downvoted for saying this . 
  some people have difficulty with the truth i guess . 
  then possibly she 's tired of being treated like a foreigner because of her skin color . 
  should be noted that deutsche welle is a media outreach program of the german government , not an independent news organization . 
  people enjoy feeling victimized and politicians learn that they can use that to their advantage . 
  it 's not like this has n't happened in europe . 
  the issues are generally just as fake in america . 
  the blm `` movement '' produced a manifesto in which they demand guaranteed minimum income for all black americans - meaning they literally want the rest of us to pay them a livable wage just for being black . 
  and it 's not like identity politics is new in europe . 
  there was this thing called the 30 years war . 
  also the holocaust . 
  you just have n't experienced this flavor yet . 
  oh my god the entitlement on display there . 
  i would n't have believed it if i had n't seen it . 
  is she an immigrant ? 
  yes it is the real tweet . 
  racists do n't like being called out . 
  shocking . 
  the title was , `` eu eggs are x times less likely to contain salmonella than american eggs . '', 
  if you really do n't get it , then i 'm not sure i can explain . 
  but maybe it suffices to say that you 'd never see a thread like that upvoted to the top of any american sub - one bragging about how america does some little thing better than france or the eu . 
  it just seems absurd and honestly , pathetic . 
  two days ago there was a thread saying european eggs are less likely to contain salmonella , and it got upvoted to 10k . 
   accessibility to education https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_secondary_education_attainment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment https://data.oecd.org/pisa/science-performance-pisa.htm we 're talking about income because that 's what this thread is about . 
  and you wanted to talk about gdp growth :  this is why i was n't sure if you understood the metric , a high inequality hinders a nations prosperity , a low inequality helps it . 
  if you look at countries that are achieving sustainable growth they are all lowering their inequality coefficient  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ru8kx/luxembourgers_are_the_only_nation_in_europe_who/dl80cek/, 
  we 're not arguing about slave labor . 
  we 're talking about differences in income in a society where everyone has equal rights according to the law . 
  if what you want is the greatest happiness for the greatest number , then you want a high median income , which is what we have . 
  in utilitarian terms . 
  there is no correlation . 
  there is no correlation . 
   earlier you said there was no relationship , we know that there is a negative correlation ( depending of course on your definition of prosperity ) no , there is * no * correlation . 
  i do n't think you read the report . 
  again : `` after accounting for weak instruments , the coef\ufb01cients turn insigni\ufb01cant ; so , it is not possible to draw any conclusion about the effect of inequality on growth , whether positive or negative . '', 
  that 's just not what it says . 
  maybe you should re-read . 
  `` no evidence '' does n't mean a weak correlation - it means * no * evidence .
