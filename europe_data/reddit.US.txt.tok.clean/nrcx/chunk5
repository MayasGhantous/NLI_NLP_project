  it does n't say that . 
  at all . 
  the report , which you can read [ here , ] ( https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25078/9781464809583.pdf ) actually says ,  recent research by the international monetary fund has claimed that lower inequality in disposable income is associated with more rapid and more durable growth for a given level of redistribution.a the robustness of the \ufb01ndings has been questioned , however , because of the presence of weak instruments in the econometric technique , a pervasive issue in this \ufb01eld of research.b after accounting for weak instruments , the coef\ufb01cients turn insigni\ufb01cant ; so , it is not possible to draw any conclusion about the effect of inequality on growth , whether positive or negative . 
  furthermore , the analysis relies on a dataset that extensively imputes inequality measures across countries , thus warranting further validation of estimates as more data are collected . 
  also :  the earliest macrolevel papers used data for a single cross-section of countries and found a negative effect of inequality on growth.f later papers , which used panel data , found positive effects of inequality on subsequent growth . 
  and :  across countries in the world , however , there is no robust evidence of a negative effect . 
  ok , so i was n't reading it wrong . 
  yes , i was saying that being equal in terms of wealth is n't necessarily desirable . 
  much of the third world is doing better than us by that measurement . 
  would you mind telling me what 's wrong with my reading ? 
  are you having trouble finding ethiopia on the map ? 
   i guess you were lucky your hospital was in-network for your insurance . 
  it 's not about luck . 
  you have the freedom to make your own decisions . 
  sometimes you make a stupid decision , like you apparently did . 
   if you look at hdi adjusted for inequality you will get a different picture : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi yes and if you look at [ equality ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/2014_gini_index_world_map%2c_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg ) you 'll notice that sweden is in the same league as ethiopia and mali . 
  bravo . 
  why the downvotes ? 
  i do ? 
  save your breath - it 's like talking to a horse . 
  it 's like talking to a dog . 
  the sanctions are a mistake , but that does n't give anyone permission to rewrite history . 
  yes , you 're moving the goalpost . 
  besides , it 's not true : the ayatollahs are theocrats ; they would n't have been happy with * any * secular , democratic government . 
  if you [ read their criticism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution#criticism ) of the shah , it was never about oil or democracy - it was the shah letting women and jews be judges , and letting the [ queen ] ( http://viola.bz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/queen-fawzia-of-iran.jpg ) go around uncovered , which angered them so much . 
  an atheistic pro-soviet socialist government would have been just as intolerable to them as the shah was . 
  i said the ayatollahs would n't have tolerated any secular government , and you said `` that 's on america making a coup against mossadegh . '', 
  i said that they hated mossadegh too and you said `` that 's because the uk 's oil embargo . '', 
  you 're moving the goalpost . 
  besides , it 's not true . 
  the ayatollahs are theocrats . 
  they would n't have been happy with * any * secular , democratic government . 
  if you go back to read what they said when the shah was in power , and before that , it was never about oil or democracy - it was about things like giving women and jews the right to vote . 
  you 're changing the subject . 
  actually , the ayatollah had already turned against mossadegh , along with the army , the king and most of the population . 
  mossadegh [ faked an election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iranian_parliamentary_dissolution_referendum,_1953 ) to dissolve parliament and give himself dictatorial powers . 
  the monarch ( the shah ) then used his constitutional authority to dismiss him as prime minister . 
  he was arrested for violating the constitution , tried , convicted and given a three-year prison sentence . 
  end of story . 
  thinking that the ayatollahs would n't have revolted against a pro-soviet socialist government is pretty ridiculous . 
   iran has not had an offensive war for over 200 years , are you forgetting the war in yemen where their houthi proxies are fighting to export their revolution ? 
  and their other proxy wars , in afghanistan and iraq ? 
  no , they really are the absolute gutter of british media . 
  i remember when they `` revealed '' that bush 's father was a nazi . 
  not surprised to find that you consider human rights violations `` no reason whatsoever . '', 
  another article from german rt. 
  they are n't abiding by it though . 
  i agree that we should stop using sanctions against countries we `` do n't like '' but it 's ridiculous to think that the islamic republic ever had any intention of abiding by the terms of the agreement . 
  it 's the left-wing version of the daily mail . 
  i think it 's greatly overlooked . 
  and i think looking at the highest level of social organization - the role of the king/tsar in most countries - is misleading . 
  probably , the most basic forms of organization would tell you more . 
  for most russians , the basic social unit of their ancestors from ancient times until the 20th century was the [ mir . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obshchina ), 
  i suppose that 's true . 
  what i was saying was that equality/inequality is n't an indication of prosperity or the lack thereof . 
  usa and russia are in the same category , and the eu is mostly in another category with ethiopia and mali . 
  russia and the usa are in the same category in terms of gini index : [ link ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/2014_gini_index_world_map%2c_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg/1280px-2014_gini_index_world_map%2c_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg.png ) sweden and ethiopia are also in the same , different category . 
  tens of millions of illegal immigrants , national debt , democratic stupidity on gun rights and any of the external problems arising from obama 's geostrategic incompetence ( see : syria , ukraine , libya , afghanistan , south china sea ) would be examples of right-wing issues . 
  no , i 'm not a right-winger . 
  i voted for clinton . 
  but all of the problems you listed are examples of things the left end of the spectrum likes to talk about . 
  i 'm saying not to entrust your opinions entirely to one faction . 
   you have a heroin epidemic , a huge amount of prisoners , a lot of people without proper healthcare , many young people with insane debt and a militarization of police wow , you know * all * the standard leftist shibboleths . 
  the liberation of iraq was not a violation of international law . 
  that 's a straightforward lie . 
  before you say `` crime of aggression '' : look up the date when that was added . 
  why , exactly ? 
  bretrayal . 
  this stuff is brilliant . 
  thanks for posting . 
  in order : 1 . 
  1st link : correct me if i 'm wrong , but that 's not proof - it 's an allegation made by one former officer , which is n't corroborated by anyone else he alleges to have been involved . 
  even if true , the extent of the support he personally attests to knowing about is minimal : `` communications jamming '' against the embassies of cuba , libya , iran and iraq . 
  2nd link : this is pure tinfoil hat madness , alleging that the cia gave chavez cancer . 
  3rd link : the substance of this claim is that the us ambassador had several meetings with pedro carmona . 
  carmona was a major trade organization leader in venezuela so it 's not surprising or suspicious ; the job of a us ambassador is to meet with such people . 
  you just linked to a book , which i have n't read , so ca n't comment . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but that 's not proof - it 's a claim made by one former officer , which is not corroborated by anyone else he alleges to have been involved . 
  even if true , the extent of the support he personally attests to knowing about is minimal : `` communications jamming '' against the embassies of cuba , libya , iran and iraq . 
   some people tried a coup against him at some point with support from the usa . 
  false . 
  traditionally it 's used to apply a soft , cheesy spread to crackers and other hard-surface foods : https://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/easycheese021.jpg and the others here are just going for karma . 
  it 's actually delicious . 
  it does n't even refer to that . 
  that 's where it originated , but all it really is is a term for the value of a country 's oil exports . 
  you could say `` cardollars '' in reference to germany or `` bananadollars '' in reference to costa rica the same way . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrodollar_recycling https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrocurrency, 
  the term [ `` petrodollar '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrodollar_recycling ) has nothing specifically to do with the us dollar . 
  it 's just the commercial value of a country 's oil exports - the same as saying [ `` petrocurrency . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrocurrency ), 
  no - you said our economy was dependent on them . 
  you said russia was your saudi arabia . 
  but we barely get any oil from saudi arabia . 
  you were obviously making a false statement and now you 're embarrassed so you try to say you meant something very different and it went over my stupid head . 
  [ we do n't import much saudi oil anymore , ] ( https://cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/1600/gif-oil-imports-2000-15-111-be8c.gif ) or middle eastern oil in general . 
  edit : why did you downvote this , lol, 
  never been there . 
  i know it 's boiling , and that it has a complicated relationship with latin america , for some reason . 
   why do we have to choose ?
