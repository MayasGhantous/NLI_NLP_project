  you know , you 're not the only ones who have to choose . 
  europe has been dragging america into its conflicts for a hundred years . 
  we never wanted to be involved . 
  in the 1800s russia was our closest ally . 
  you and they made us choose sides , and you 've never stopped.maybe just once , you could try to see things from our pov . 
  their companies , not them . 
  sometimes the pursuit of profit has to be restrained . 
  they know that .

   indian removal act affected several thousand people , 200 years after colonization . 
  why do swedes think they know so much about our history ? 
  to be fair , anyone could see that that position was n't going to last . 
  now you have an eu military on the horizon , which remainers said was ridiculous paranoia . 
  brexit was about the future , not the present . 
  it would be whataboutism if i were saying it as a diversionary tactic , but i 'm not . 
  you 're inferring a motive that is n't there . 
  i 'm not anti-eu . 
  i just think the guardian is a crap paper . 
  no , because i 'm not discrediting the article , if anything , i 'm using this article to discredit the other one . 
  you ca n't warn your readers that phrases like `` you guys '' and `` awesome '' are invasive viruses threatening to overwhelm britain 's native culture , if you 're worried about xenophobia . 
  i just think it 's a bit hypocritical to complain that phrases like `` you guys '' and `` awesome '' are eroding britain 's national identity , then complain about xenophobia . 
  i am judging it on what it says ? 
   `` britain has changed , '' said michaela aum\u00fcller , who after six years in cornwall moved to m\u00fcnster , germany , in april with her british partner , richard . 
  `` something has been broken . 
  neither of us wanted to put up with the new attitude to eu nationals . 
  there were incidents , little things , but they make such a difference . '' this from the guardian , who [ just yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qlhat/americans_are_coming_for_british_english_were/ ) was warning about slightly foreign ( american ) english infecting britain 's vocabulary and corrupting its youth .

'' this from [ the guardian , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qlhat/americans_are_coming_for_british_english_were/ ) who on another thread is worried about british youth using foreign ( american ) slang , and foreign ( american ) accents on some british television . 
  always stood by us ? 
  did you stand by us in iraq ? 
  what universe do you live in ? 
  now you 're going to say that iraq was a stupid war . 
  but the idea of `` standing by '' someone means you support them * even if * you do n't agree with them . 
  you and the russians used your unsc vetos to stop the un from helping with the liberation of iraq , and then you refused to help stabilize iraq for the next 10 years . 
  even if you disagreed with the liberation you could have helped with peacekeeping , because it would have served your own interest , but no . 
  and i can accept all of that - but saying you 've always supported us is something i ca n't accept . 
  it 's a little weird because he 's very neoconservative . 
  he was a big fan of george w. bush , even later in his presidency . 
  usually people like that are warm to imperialism . 
  in his comment history he 's posting about how europeans have bigger penises than americans and are taller , so offhand i 'd guess the motive is to make him feel insecure . 
  that 's because there 's no all-encompassing modern english accent . 
  there 's a ridiculous variety . 
  but general american english is a rhotic accent , so it does sound more like what you 'd hear in western lancashire in 1600 than the `` bbc accent , '' which is non-rhotic and originated in the southeast . 
  it 's a gross simplification , not a myth . 
  that sample is [ middle english , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle_english ) which died out 100 years before colonization . 
  the first americans spoke [ early modern english . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_modern_english ), 
  american/canadian accents are just british accents from the 17th century , before you all started talking posh to impress each other . 
  in vocabulary also , supposed americanisms like saying * candy * instead of * sweets * are just old british usages that fell out of style for some reason . 
  it 's not like you did n't want this . 
  you were never going to colonize north america and oceania and conquer most of the rest of the world , while keeping the majority of your population in the british isles . 
  inhabitants of great britain always intended themselves to be a minority of the english-speaking community . 
  just federalize with the rest of us and it wo n't be `` foreign '' anymore . 
  there 's no such thing . 
  we 're an isolationist people . 
  we never wanted anything to do with europe , russia , korea or the rest of this miserable planet . 
  it just wo n't stop dragging us into its problems . 
  what happened in the 1990s was that you had a bunch of tycoons buy up your economy , and we did little or nothing to help because we were too busy watching terminator movies to even know about the problem , but they were russian tycoons , not americans . 
  if you speak english and absorb our media , you know that americans do n't want anything except to be left alone to watch tv and play video games and enjoy our lives . 
  we have no animosity toward any nation , comparable to the kind of animosity that old world nations have for each other . 
  look , you guys can keep downvoting me but i 'm just telling you the truth . 
  ask r/askanamerican if you do n't believe me . 
  we 're pretty invested in the idea of self-government . 
  we do n't tell you ( edit : eu ) how to sentence your criminals and we expect the same in return . 
  yes and that 's a longstanding principle . 
  that 's different from using extradition as a tool to manipulate our justice system . 
  some of our own states ban the death penalty and have for over a hundred years . 
  we can understand that . 
  it 's rather different if you start harboring cyber-terrorists and refusing to release them to us until our laws conform to european norms . 
  maybe this is hard to fully grasp but in that case , we 're just not allies anymore . 
   but did he * do * anything with the stuff he stole ? 
  allegedly yes . 
  he 's accused of stealing and then disseminating people 's credit card information . 
  the prosecution says he discussed in chatrooms how the information was then going to be used , without realizing that someone in the chat with him was a paid informant . 
  i 'm not used to r/europe accusing us of * insufficient * geopolitical belligerence . 
  yes we 've been tolerant about some things , but that does n't mean we 'd tolerate this . 
  fortunately , your leaders are smarter than you , so it will never happen . 
  it has a bearing : the comment i replied to was that americans do n't know what justice is - in essence , saying we 're not a civilized nation . 
  * of course * it 's relevant then to look at our history , especially as compared to yours . 
  and you keep saying `` episode '' but the point i was making was that it was n't just an `` episode '' - with the exception of 10 years after wwi , germany was * never * a constitutional democracy * until * we invaded it . 
  and it probably would n't be today . 
  you may be tired of hearing that , but do you know what we 're tired of ? 
  being condescended to by nations who killed all their jews not long ago . 
   i do not propose equivalence . 
  i am pointing out a fallacy . 
  there 's no fallacy because they 're not equivalent . 
  you ca n't `` ignore us reprimands on human rights because black people were still being lynched , '' because there 's no remote equivalence between that and what we 're talking about . 
   europe 's fascist episode when would that be ? 
  the 20th century ? 
  the 19th century ? 
  the 18th century ? 
  are you pretending that there was just one `` episode '' ? 
  it 's not just hitler . 
  it 's also mussolini , franco , tito , and the fact that half of europe was a totalitarian dictatorship 26 years ago . 
  we do n't know what justice is ? 
  the fact that you can be so arrogant in this specific area is grotesque . 
  actually , i do know what european prisons are like , but given the absence of a flair i 'm making certain assumptions . 
  in any case i 'm just telling you what would happen .
