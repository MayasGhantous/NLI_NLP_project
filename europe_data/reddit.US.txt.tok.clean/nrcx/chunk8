  ours and canada 's are both from 1 to 15 , and [ mexico 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#mexico ) is from 2 to 85 . 
  and of course our `` regions '' are much bigger , up to the size of france . 
  subdivided into regions like ireland 's , the variation is much greater . 
  it 's crazy to think that a country like ireland ,  90 % white , which you can drive across in an hour , is as varied as a transcontinental country . 
  definitely , but that 's true of all statistics , including crime rates , and none of these international comparisons ever take it into consideration . 
  trying to explain it on reddit usually just gets you featured on r/shitamericanssay . 
   healthcare is also free in us for the elderly , the poor and people that meet certain criteria . 
  to quantify this : 130 million individuals are enrolled in either [ medicaid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medicaid ) or [ medicare . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medicare_ ( united_states \\ ) ), 
  a few years ago i was one of those who would have argued with you , and yeah , we were wrong . 
  it 's been a real eye-opener . 
  the difference between `` blue '' and `` red '' being 0.04 is a little funny . 
  [ us map ] ( https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2014/12/race-iat-score-map_white.png&amp;w=1484&amp;op=resize&amp;opt=1&amp;filter=antialias&amp;t=20170517 ), 
  a federation * is * one country . 
  if you start calling your federal states countries , it 's just going to confuse the meaning of the word for everyone . 
   above all macron , unlike may , has shown himself to be an operator . 
  at the `` family '' photo-shoot at the g20 , macron , realising his relatively small frame and slated for a rather undistinguished position in the second row , simply ignored protocol and inserted himself in the front row next to the us president . 
  they 're actually spinning that in his favor ? 
  this is what happens when the media does n't like you . 
  the oath :  i swear ( or affirm ) that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth the second , queen of canada , her heirs and successors , and that i will faithfully observe the laws of canada and fulfil my duties as a canadian citizen . 
  i mean the premise ( at its heart ) is pretty undeniable . 
  western countries do n't have a good record of treating anyone * fairly . 
  the trouble is , we do n't have a word for that concept . 
  we need a new word . 
  use your german magic . 
  well you do n't have the death penalty . 
  presumably that would be a condition too . 
  i 'm glad we do n't have to alter our social mores for trade ... yet . 
  you 'll just downvote any reply , so why bother asking ? 
  you 're right . 
  le pen is a fascist but at least she 's a french fascist . 
  of course , i should have realized that would be your perception . 
  33 % of your voters are a lot of people to disqualify , right ? 
  unless you think le pen is much better than trump . 
  did n't 1/3 of france vote for marine le pen ? 
  i do n't think the communist party sees it that way . 
  it was just because the user was american . 
  change your flair to avoid that . 
  only if they think it can , which they do n't . 
  please , it 's the opposite . 
  your continent has always seen itself as the most civilized on earth , which is why anything we do differently from you is `` objectively stupid '' ( in your words ) . 
  even your username is a reference to an american weapon . 
  the only real complaint being made here is `` fake friendliness , '' which is a common accusation that french/germans make about americans generally , not just about american waiters . 
  no one ever says our service is actually bad . 
  various restaurants in the us have tried to adopt a no-tipping model , but have reverted back to tipping due a loss of customers . 
  what 's the deal with applebee 's ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever actually eaten there . 
   servers in france are paid enough so they do n't need to rely on tips . 
  tips in the us are part of the pay . 
  it 's not charity . 
  restaurant workers do n't want to change it . 
  french who come to the us are always impressed by the service they get at restaurants , but still they hate the practice of tipping for some reason . 
  ... the cayman islands has a murder rate 3x higher than ours . 
  saint pierre and miquelon 4x higher ( and i mentioned it in my original comment ) . 
  french st. martin has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the world . 
  by what definition are these `` more appropriate '' comparisons and how do they contradict , instead of confirm , what i said ? 
   ummm . 
  dude , it 's illegal in europe too . 
  no , dude , * it 's not . 
  * at least not in germany and most other european countries : http://www.dw.com/en/is-racial-profiling-illegal-depends-on-where-you-live/a-36988027 the size of our prison population is because we tend to favor longer sentences . 
  longer prison sentences = more people in prison . 
   millions of dead natives http://www.cracked.com/article_19864_6-ridiculous-lies-you-believe-about-founding-america.html the most infamous genocide in our history was the [ trail of tears , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trail_of_tears ) which killed between 2000 and 6000 largely accidentally ( inadequate supplies ) and was almost 200 years ago . 
  jews , for some reason , seem to like it . 
  maybe we should ask europe 's why , except that i ca n't find them , for some reason . 
   a justice system with an institutional racial bias , racial profiling is illegal in the us , unlike in [ most ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-racism-racial-stereotype-african-descent-black-united-nations-un-police-authorities-customs-a7603771.html ) european [ countries , ] ( https://raster.fi/2016/06/21/the-reality-of-ethnic-and-racial-profiling-in-finland/ ) and you 've already been told how much bullshit the private-prisons myth is . 
   i could be an expert on us politics and law no you ca n't , because it 's obvious from your comments that you 're very misinformed . 
  you 're talking about private prisons keeping incarceration rates high * because * you 're misinformed and you do n't know that they account for 7 % of state prisoners and that they 're * declining * at the same time that the incarceration rate is * growing . 
  * same with your comment about penal labor . 
  you 're not an expert , so do n't pretend . 
   citizens incarcerated per 100k we 're talking about homicide rate , you pretentious twat . 
  the comment you 're replying to is :  guiana ( in france ) and st. pierre and miquelon ( also in france ) have homicide rates 4-5x ours . 
  an insult which i 'm now going to repeat . 
  see edit . 
  [ black canadians are more over-incarcerated than black americans . 
  ] ( http://torontoist.com/2016/04/african-canadian-prison-population/ ) the main difference is that there are n't as many . 
  ok , so you ca n't read a table . 
  suriname 's rate is more than twice ours and several times canada 's , idiot . 
  private prisons account for 7 % of state prisoners , but please , go on correcting me about a country you 've never visited , and which i 'm from . 
  literally all of your statistics are wrong : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate, 
  because the point was  another continent, 
  is there a more appropriate province of a european country on our continent that i could have used ? 
  and low population usually means less crime , not more . 
  sure but i 'm giving some context . 
  and if we 're being totally honest , the demographic makeup of the population is a factor , both in crime and in the approach to sentences . 
  well , guiana is the largest part of france in the americas . 
  it 's almost like we 're on another continent . 
  guiana ( in france ) and st. pierre and miquelon ( also in france ) have homicide rates 4-5x ours . 
  edit : hello sas brigaders, 
  i was n't old enough to vote then , but i guess so . 
  til this is mislabeled , should be ' 3 protesters ' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxlvhqf1bq4&amp;t=3m19s, 
  i could be wrong , and please correct me if i am , but i do n't recall anything like this at g20s in the us . 
  rioters , yes - city skyline wreathed in smoke , no . 
  meetings like this have to be held in decent-sized cities because of all the hotels and other accommodations needed , not only for the government but also for all media , and the thousands of extra police and everyone else who will be there . 
  maybe g20 should institute a policy that if riots like this occur , the host country is banned from hosting further meetings for 20 years or so . 
  that might get people to act more responsibly . 
   at the very top there is only one way but down . 
  relatively yes , but it 's rather dangerous to tell people that we need to keep the rest of the world poor in comparison with us , is n't it ? 
  the majority of white and black americans have some native american dna . 
  the average hispanic american 's genome is 30 % native american . 
  but what * is * it ?
