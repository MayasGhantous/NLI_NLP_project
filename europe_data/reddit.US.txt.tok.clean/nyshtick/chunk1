the 16-year-old boy had painted anti-israel slogans , a crossed-out star of david , and a nazi iron cross on the walls of the gothenburg concert hall and a nearby museum . 
   the district court ruled that the graffiti was an expression against the conflict between israel and palestine , and not a case of racial agitation . 
  did n't realize a nazi iron cross was an anti-israel symbol . 
  kid has a funny way of not hating jews . 
  yeah , though even if there were n't many victims , it probably spurned some of the emigration to america . 
  relatively few people in hollywood are religious . 
  relevant question : how often do certain communities deviate from the national guidelines because of demographics ? 
  for instance , new york city public schools give days off for rosh hashanah ( 2-3 days ) , yom kippur , & passover . 
  i think that occurs in other municipalities or universities with high jewish populations . 
  there have been pushes to include chinese new year & certain muslim holidays as well . 
  i worry less about the consequences of a `` bold invasion of the baltics '' & more about what would happen if russia does the same thing in the balts that he did in ukraine . 
  if some `` separatists '' showed up in the town of narva , which is literally on the russian border with a russian-speaking population of 94 % , i 'm not sure how nato or the us would react . 
  ok . netanyahu lived in pennsylvania for a few years and attended mit , but he has n't spent as much time in america as ilves . 
   if for example a medical student from austria did his medschool internship in the us it would rather help him get a job back in austria than hinder him . 
  and i think the same goes for president ilves . 
  yeah , but there 's a difference between attending university in another country and spending ~ 40 years abroad . 
  president clinton attended oxford briefly , but had he spent most of his life in britain , i think it would have been a political issue . 
  yeah , but i feel like ilves goes a bit further . 
  president obama typically meets with & holds joint press conferences with merkel/netanyahu , even if they are the heads of government . 
  seems like ilves is more involved than the german/israeli heads of state . 
  is it more like france or israel ? 
  both have presidents that are n't the head of government , but in france , the president is the most important figure , while in israel , it 's entirely ceremonial . 
  i ask because normally when the head of state is ceremonial , it 's the head of government that meets with foreign leaders . 
  but it 's usually ilves who meets with the president and represents estonia on the international level . 
  question for the estonians . 
  is the fact that ilves is so americanized seen as a bad thing ? 
  looking at his bio , it seems like he 's spent most of his life in the united states . 
  i feel like a lot of countries would see that as a bad thing . 
  or is it not a big deal or seen as a good thing ? 
  which holidays ? 
  the u.s. president does n't give major addresses for any holiday , but they usually record a message for tons of different holidays . 
  even ones only practiced by small religious minorities ( yom kippur , rosh hashanah , hanukkah , diwali , ramadan , nowruz , lunar new year , etc ) . 
  american presidents do that fairly often and reserve the prime-time speech for things that are particularly important . 
  / r/european seems to be a subreddit exclusively for bashing muslims . 
  frankly , people like norm finkelstein & john mearsheimer probably should n't be the poster-children for spurious accusations of antisemitism . 
  finkelstein [ has claimed ] ( http://www.volokh.com/posts/1191298186.shtml ) that prominent jewish leaders `` resemble stereotypes straight out of der sturmer '' or that `` jewish elites have a mindset of jewish superiority '' . 
  mearsheimer [ has endorsed ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/09/john-mearsheimer-endorses-a-hitler-apologist-and-holocaust-revisionist/245518/ ) a book that is no less antisemitic that mein kampf frankly . 
  the book questions the historicity of the holocaust and even blames jews for it . 
  there are some even more crazy conspiracy theories in the book . 
  seriously , if you 're going to accuse others of being overly liberal with their definition of `` antisemitism '' , do n't say things that are antisemitic by any measure . 
  fun fact : the president of estonia , toomas hendrik ilves , was born in stockholm and grew up in new jersey . 
  he went to columbia , the university of pennsylvania , taught in america , & worked at radio free europe . 
  when estonia gained independence , he became their ambassador to the united states . 
   this questionnaire is complete bullshit , if you agree just with `` jews are more loyal to israel than to this country '' you 're apparently anti-semite . 
  if you answer `` yes '' to a majority of the following questions , you are classified as an `` antisemite '' . 
  * jews are more loyal to israel than to [ this country/to the countries they live in ] * jews have too much power in the business world * jews have too much power in international financial markets * jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the holocaust * jews do n't care what happens to anyone but their own kind * jews have too much control over global affairs * jews have too much control over the united states government * jews think they are better than other people * jews have too much control over the global media * jews are responsible for most of the world 's wars * people hate jews because of the way jews behave  a jew living outside israel would have to be seriously mentally retarded to not be loyal to israel more really ? 
  certainly not the case in america . 
  anyway , i think one of the overlooked problems is that many europeans do n't understand antisemitism . 
  it comes up often on this subreddit . 
  obviously , most of the acts are coming from europeans from the muslim world , but part of the problem is that many people do n't understand the issue . 
  tony blinken is actually the deputy national security advisor . 
   hasson told the foreign envoys that `` if the european countries fail to protect the jews within their territory , the state of israel will . 
  so a single member of the israeli knesset said this . 
  i 'm sure this will head directly to the top of / r/europe . 
  i think they just have an open site where they approve almost anyone and they can post what they want . 
  it 's not as if he draws a salary or something . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the times of israel does n't screen the blog posts before they 're hosted . 
  i think the guardian has something similar , right ? 
  i 'm not sure about how exactly they run it though . 
  says member of israeli knesset that is n't even in the ruling coalition . 
  6 % over a 12 year period . 
  well , there are two ways to look at it . 
  you can compare it to other countries or to aliyah stats from france over time . 
  it 's at about 6 % in france , 1 % in germany , 2 % in the u.k. , & 5 % in belgium . 
  as for the trend , it was 17,000 from 1990-2001 & 13,000 from 1980-1989 . 
  not sure for your second question . 
  i have some elderly cousins that made aliyah , but that 's it . 
  there are a decent number of israelis that come to the united states though . 
  also , it 's worth noting that it 's not just because jews in france fear for their safety . 
  at this point , the israeli economy is probably stronger than the french economy . 
  similar gdp per capita with much higher annual growth rates . 
  some relevant statistics : about 30,000 jews immigrated from france to israel between 2002 & 2013 . 
  that 's about 6 % of the french jewish population . 
  people who make these comparisons should not be part of any serious discussion of the issue . 
  given your posting history , you 're probably not the ideal candidate to complain about others discussing the issue of antisemitism . 
   it was europe that caused the mess in the first place people give too much agency to europe when discussing the israeli-palestinian conflict . 
  britain did not create `` israel '' . 
  they were marginally supportive of a jewish state , but once they pulled out in 1948 , the creation of israel was up to them . 
  unless of course your blame on europe refers to historical european persecution of jews . 
  anyway , of the many awful things that go on the world , the israeli-palestinian conflict is pretty far down on the list . 
  it gets way too much attention . 
  i 'd prefer to see states focus their efforts on solving conflicts that kill far more people . 
  you mean like jpmorgan chase , which was forced top pay $ 13 billion in fines/settlements as part of a deal with the justice department ? 
  yes ( [ source ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_topics/20140224_140224-pr2014-028-defence-exp.pdf ) ) . 
  nato countries , including the united states & canada , spend a bit over one trillion usd on defense . 
  nato countries that fail to hit the 2 % target ( including canada ) would need to spend an additional $ 108 billion to hit the targets .

  however , the attack is leveled against israel more than any other country and the surrounding comments are often something like `` i guess the nazis did n't teach them their lesson '' . 
  context matters . 
  saying `` the jews control the media '' is and will be perceived as antisemitic , even if we do n't really care if someone says `` whites control the media '' . 
  few things are in the same ballpark as the holocaust . 
  israel 's actions certainly are n't . 
  i have no issue with people who are gravely offended when others take one of the most horrific crimes in human history and label israel with it simply because israel is the jewish state . 
  relevant question from a survey of european jews : would you use any of the following to describe the person or persons who made antisemitic comments ? 
  someone with a left-wing political view : 53 % someone with a muslim extremist view : 51 % someone with a right-wing political view : 39 % someone with a christian extremist view : 19 % [ source ] ( http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-discrimination-hate-crime-against-jews-eu-member-states_en.pdf ), 
  it is , the survey uses purchase power parity . 
  yes , though i do n't think that 's ppp adjusted . 
  the gdp ( ppp ) per capita in the united states is higher than switzerland and pretty close to norway . 
  but both have a higher median household income . 
  fwiw , [ median household income ( ppp ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_household_income ) in the united states trails luxembourg , norway , & switzerland .
