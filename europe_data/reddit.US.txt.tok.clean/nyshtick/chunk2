  also , i know income inequality & median income frequently come up in discussions like this , but there is some value to income inequality . 
  if everyone was guaranteed the same amount of money , then nobody would work hard . 
  income inequality leads to innovation ; the question is how much is appropriate ? 
  the fact that the 95th percentile in america makes more than the 95th percentile in france can certainly be interpreted as a good thing . 
  the united states trails luxembourg , norway , & switzerland in median household income ( ppp ) . 
  ** united states ** network news : cbs , nbc , & abc are mostly entertainment , but they have 30 minute broadcasts each night at 6:30 . 
  these are the mostly widely viewed forms of television news , but they tend to be dominated by older viewers . 
  the networks also having morning shows that focus a bit on news and sunday news shows which tend to have the most prominent guests ( senators , cabinet officials , etc ) . 
  cable news : cnn , msnbc , & fox are the big three . 
  fox news is conservative and dominates the ratings . 
  msnbc is progressive & cnn is pretty middle of the road but both lag behind fox news . 
  all three are 24-hour news . 
  newspapers : the new york times & washington post are typically considered to be the top journalistic outlets in the united states . 
  the wall street journal is the premier business newspaper . 
  usa today has a large circulation as well . 
  internet news : i think a lot of people use cnn & the other mainstream news sites . 
  huffingtonpost is big on the left . 
  buzzfeed too . 
  both are n't exclusively hard news though . 
  the drudge report gets traffic too , but it 's influence has waned over time . 
  a lot of people get news on twitter . 
  i listen to a lot of podcasts . 
  bbc , the council on foreign relations , & slate all have good podcasts . 
  i also download & listen to the economist audio edition . 
  i browse twitter , which means that i 'll usually see any notable article . 
  vox is a very good site if one wants to stay informed . 
   i 've never seen anyone being racist about israel wait , you 've ** never ** seen anyone make antisemitic comments related to israel ? 
  most new york households do not own a car & nyc is the only american city for which this is true ( [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._cities_with_most_households_without_a_car ) ) . 
  fitch is headquartered in new york & london . 
  it 's also half owned by a french firm . 
  it is n't the united states pushing you around . 
  it 's the united states saying that we are not obligated to come to your defense unless you spend 2 % of gdp . 
  it 's a give & take , not a one sided demand . 
  i like how the russian propaganda portrays president obama as really powerful but tons of people in america criticize him for being weak . 
  also , if the united states were able to tell the eu what to do , then the sanctions would likely be tougher . 
  i 'd guess that there are two reasons : 1 : [ it 's cheaper . 
  ] ( http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/electricprices.gif ) if something is cheaper , people will use more of it . 
  2 : americans on average have higher incomes than residents of the european union , especially because of eastern europe . 
  therefore , they spend more money . 
  why are these numbers so much higher ? 
  data compiled from [ the imf ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/index.aspx ) . 
  honestly , it 's usually mental illness & alcoholism . 
  few people deny that the european union is a big global player , just that they are n't the big global player . 
  texas does n't have it 's own foreign policy , but italy does . 
  unless the european union sees integration on the level of america , that will remain the case . 
  barroso is not anywhere near as powerful as the leaders of the member states . 
  it looks like all the united states is doing is `` backing '' ukrainian operations . 
  that 's fair , but i think i 'd make the same characterization of the united states & canada . 
  israel has the added aspect of being heavily influenced by 19th century european nationalism . 
  well , there 's the obvious issue of geography . 
  no definition of europe includes israel . 
  israel is certainly culturally close to europe , as many countries are , and is wealthy enough to fit in well with western europe . 
  however , i doubt there will be any chance as long as the west bank dispute remains . 
  the example of northern cyprus is actually a decent parallel ( though somewhat less complicated case ) that gets far less international attention and i do n't recall turkish withdrawal being a necessary precondition . 
  however , israeli accession to the eu would complicate relations with a host of countries , something that is not in europe 's interest . 
  ah , thanks . 
  still somewhat concerned about the tax thing though . 
  three issues . 
  first , it appears that they do n't have enough evidence to say that canada has passed the united states . 
  second , i 'm not sure if after-tax income should be used ( though it 's difficult to know how to account for different types of taxes ) . 
  ~ ~ third , i ca n't tell if it 's adjusted for purchasing power . ~ ~, 
  it 's kind of unlikely that people will see no difference . 
  there 's little chance of europe becoming more integrated/homogeneous than the united states and the cultural & economic difference between northern states and southern states in america still exists . 
  i do n't think anybody wants cultural homogeneity in europe . 
  perhaps you mean political or economic . 
  it 's worth noting that politically , much of eastern europe is aligned with the west . 
  economically , it seems likely that most of eastern europe will lag behind the west . 
  however , one only needs to look at south korea & taiwan to see the economic development that can occur in just a few decades . 
  in my opinion , it 's becoming increasingly apparent that the united states should station military assets in poland & the baltic states . 
  my critique of this idea is essentially that europe does not see itself as one entity . 
  if i were estonia , i 'd be a lot more confident in america riding to my rescue than france , britain , or germany . 
  the united states has global alliances that rely on countries being confident in america 's commitment . 
  that means that there would be real strategic consequences to the united states failing to defend an ally . 
  the major european players need not worry about such things . 
  a russian invasion of estonia may not threaten american interests , but you can easily say the same for any european country that could fight off russia . 
  considering that earlier in this thread , [ you accused ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22zqpu/frances_main_jewish_group_fined_for_defaming/cgs378b ) someone of anti-palestinian racism for question electronicintifada , i 'm going to need a bit more evidence than that . 
  perhaps . 
  i do n't know much about crif , but they may not be wrong here . 
  why do you characterize them as racist ? 
  israel , the united states , & australia [ appear to agree ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/committee_for_charity_and_support_for_the_palestinians#alleged_terrorist_connections ) for what it 's worth . 
  does france make it way easier to win defamation lawsuits ? 
  i ca n't imagine that they would have won in american court ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/terrorist-illicit-finance/pages/protecting-charities_execorder_13224-b.aspx ) is their listing at the treasury department ( under c ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/u.s.-designated-hamas-front-gets-symbolic-win-in-france ) seems like a decent piece . 
  french libel law is very different . 
  treasury department allegation :  commite de bienfaisance et de secours aux palestiniens ( cbsp ) and association de secours palestinien ( asp ) are primary fundraisers for hamas in france and switzerland , respectively . 
  founded in france in the late 80s/early 90s , like other hamas-affiliated charities , cbsp acts in collaboration with more than a dozen humanitarian organizations based in different towns in the west bank and gaza and in palestinian refugee camps in jordan and lebanon . 
  asp , a subsidiary of cbsp , was founded in switzerland in 1994 . 
  the group has collected large amounts of money from mosques and islamic centers , which it then transfers to sub-organizations of hamas . 
  khalid al-shuli ( designated under executive order 13224 on august 22 , 2003 ) is the president of cbsp and asp . 
  definitely need to see [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wluowtu.jpg ) in more / r/europe threads . 
  nice username . 
  i think novaya gazeta is supposed to be independent . 
  it 's generally understood that russian internet censorship does not rise to the level of chinese or iranian internet censorship . 
  they 've done better on international rankings on the issue . 
  yeah , but it 's probably better than in china & iran . 
  putin 's grip on the media is n't quite as strong . 
  russia does n't have the same level of internet censorship . 
  china has a practice of sending political prisoners to re-education labor camps and a lot of stuff iran does is pretty despicable . 
  well , depends what you mean .
