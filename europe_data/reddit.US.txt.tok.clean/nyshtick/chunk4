  the united states has a ban on oil exports and is pretty restrictive on natural gas as well . 
  the united states has a big advantage on these issues because we are more or less energy independent . 
  i think there 's a 16 % difference between production & consumption , and it 's projected to fall to about 4 % in the coming years . 
  any difference comes from canada . 
  i think it 's tougher to ship natural gas across the atlantic ocean than to get it through pipelines . 
  europe should definitely diversify their energy sources though . 
  estonia , latvia , lithuania too . 
  i think the report i read also indicated that sweden was more on the u.s. side than the western european side in terms of how to react . 
  both levi ekshol & golda meir were born in ukraine , though meir came to the united states as a young child . 
  a third , moshe sharett , was born in kherson . 
  most ashkenazi jews are from ukraine , belarus , or poland at some point in their family 's history . 
  that area was the best area for jews during much of the second millennium . 
  in the 1980s and 1990s , many of the ukrainian jews that had not yet left either immigrated to israel or the united states . 
  half my friends are jews from the former ussr . 
  there was a big wave of immigration in russian empire years . 
  most of my family immigrated from the russian empire in what is now western ukraine . 
  wikipedia indicates that there are 600,000 ukrainian jews in israel . 
  i do n't know whether it counts the descendants of early immigrants though . 
  off the top of my head , 25 % of the 1st israeli knesset was born in what is now ukraine , more than any other country . 
  i think i read in the economist that he refuses to return to scotland until they gain independence . 
  you do n't `` have '' to do anything . 
  most of these conflicts do n't require any member to do anything . 
  if anything , france has been the more aggressive county the last few years . 
  i 'm surprised . 
  half my friends are from the former ussr and i 've never heard that sentiment before . 
  though they 're all jewish , so that may have something to do with it . 
  it is the understanding of the nato treaty that article 5 indicates military action . 
  it is and has never been the understanding of anyone that the budapest memorandum commits the united states & united kingdom to militarily defend ukraine . 
  that 's a big difference . 
  what message would you like the united states to send ? 
  i support a strong reaction and we 'll see what president obama does in the next few days . 
  but nobody is suggesting that the united states launch a military strike against russian forces . 
  a russian wearing a nazi uniform makes almost as little sense as a jew wearing one . 
  i still do n't get what in the budapest memorandum requires the u.s. and u.k. to respond militarily . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/ukraine._memorandum_on_security_assurances ) is the english text . 
  1 : russia obviously violated this , but nothing requires america & britain to respond . 
  2 : again , russia violated the second point , but nothing requires a response . 
  3 : just deals with economic coercion . 
  4 : requires that the parties seek unsc action . 
  5 : requires that nobody use nukes . 
  6 : requires the three parties to consult with one another . 
  as for iran , they did not agree to stop their nuclear program . 
  it temporarily suspended it while negotiations are happening . 
  the iranian situation is very different from the ukrainian situation . 
  it 's unlikely that non-aggression pacts will be what the p5 +1 parties give iran . 
  it 'll be sanctions relief . 
  yep . 
  i 'd imagine so . 
  does british foreign policy differ at all from american foreign policy ? 
  the two countries agree on pretty much everything . 
  what country are you from ? 
  [ of note : 55 % of ethnic russians supported independence .

  sorry , meant to write nato . 
  ( edited ), 
  out of curiosity , what country are you from ? 
  a lot of european countries were complicit in the nsa activities . 
  it 's as much a problem of trusting your own government as it is of trusting ours . 
  honestly , there is no advantage of a joint-european army over a nato military . 
  even france & britain , the 2nd & 3rd strongest nato military forces , often rely on american logistical support . 
  feel free to disagree with american foreign policy , in fact , i hope you do . 
  american often disagree as well . 
  just keep in mind that it is n't just the policy of the united states , but also of many european states . 
  also , in terms of the scale of things , the foreign policy disagreements between the united states and our european allies are relatively minor . 
  the united states & nato can intervene anywhere they want to , but they are n't obligated to . 
  intervening in the balkans is like intervening in libya . 
  even though nato forces are far superior to the russian military , challenging the russians is a different ballgame . 
  i 'm kind of curious what the chinese opinion is on the matter . 
  `` the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to ukraine , in accordance with the principles of the csce final act , to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of ukraine . '', 
  russia certainly has broken that , but what requires that the u.s. and britain respond militarily ? 
   the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to ukraine , as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , if ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used . 
  what does that guarantee beyond the americans & brits going to the security council ? 
  also , it seems to include nuclear weapons as a prerequisite . 
  what obligates them to defend ukraine ? 
  [ i do n't see anything . 
  ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/ukraine._memorandum_on_security_assurances ), 
  i see nothing in it that guarantees that the u.s. & u.k. defend ukraine .

  it 's difficult to erase significant linguistic and cultural differences . 
  new yorkers are mostly ok paying taxes to help a poor person 's healthcare in california , but are germans ok paying for an italian 's healthcare ? 
  i think it 's probably quite difficult for europe to give up sovereignty in exchange for greater political unity . 
  people bring up the united states , but the cultural diversity in america is nothing compared to europe . 
  further integration is possible , but i remain skeptical that anything more than that will occur anytime soon . 
  also , europeans tend not to be huge fans of the eu as is , getting them to agree to complete integration is unlikely . 
  common fiscal policy would be good . 
  look at how the united states recovered from the unemployment crisis compared to europe ; it 's night & day . 
  integration would allow the eu to act in a more commanding way on the international stage , but i 'm not sure that it 's necessary . 
  despite some issues , the united states & europe are almost always on the same page on international issues . 
  i 'm not sure if european integration would change much . 
  i hope that the united states & europe are strong on this one . 
  america is n't going to intervene militarily of course , but both the u.s. & europe should use everything else in their arsenal . 
  imf support , u.s. backed loan guarantees , etc. 
  russia is unlikely to invade anything outside of crimea . 
  this is an opportunity for the west to show that it is still a force for good . 
  i wonder if america will consider lifting it 's ban on oil exports . 
  this may be a good time to do so . 
  [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25457.htm ) what exactly are you referring to ? 
  defending countries is so much easier when there 's water between them .
