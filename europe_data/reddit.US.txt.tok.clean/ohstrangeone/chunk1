can \u2260 will, 
  * sigh * , guess not , oh well , 
   which had ( and still has ) some of the highest drug abuse rates of any country in europe this is patently false , their decriminalization program was a massive success , everybody knows this , i 'm not even going to bother to source it , you can google if you like ( educating you is not my responsibility , do whatever you want ) . 
  edit :  and yet somehow i 'm sure you still think you 're right ... and oh look , i was right , what a fuckin ' shocker ... 
  very ridiculous , apparently ... 
   that 's not how we do things in europe portugal . 
  is that country not in europe ? 
  and oh look , not only is that * not * how they do things there , but it 's the exact opposite * and * it 's worked out fantastically for them , and yet somehow i 'm sure you still think you 're right ...  if you want to be a member of our voluntary society , you have to follow the rules 1 . 
  that 's true , and that 's fine . 
  i can , however , also do everything within my power to get the rules * changed * if i disagree with them , and i do n't really care if they end up being changed to something * you * do n't like . 
  this is * also * part of how your society works , do n't forget that . 
   feel free to move to some land or i could just stick around and get the rules changed as i see fit , much to your chagrin , and then i 'll be the one telling * you * `` hey , move if you do n't like it '' , 
   that 's assuming that all people are reasonably intelligent beings . 
  no , it 's not , i 'm the last person in the world who would assume that . 
   problem is , i 'd estimate that maybe 75 + % of people are literally too stupid to take care of themselves . 
  that 's not a problem , let it play . 
  natural selection has worked great for the last several hundred million years , we do n't need to fuck with it . 
   make their problem everyone elses when that occurs i agree something needs to be done about it , but what needs to be done is to in some way hold * those specific people * responsible via taxes on the risky activity they perform that are equal on the whole to what that activity costs us in terms of health care and such -- i 'm fine with making taxes on harmful substances like alcohol and tobacco such that they add up to what those substances end up costing society in terms of health care and such so that the rest of us do n't end up paying for someone else 's stupidity or malice . 
  i do n't care . 
  really , i do n't . 
  freedom is more important . 
  there has to be a line , and the line , as far as i 'm concerned , is drawn where one person is not * directly * hurting anyone else -- as long as they 're not doing that , they should be allowed to do what they want to themselves . 
  how ridiculous are we going to get ? 
  illegal to eat junk food , illegal to do risky sports , illegal to drink more than x amount of alcohol ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned those examples are right along the same lines ( no , not more extreme ) as what you 're talking about . 
  it does n't matter , preventing people from doing something harmful to * themselves * is wrong in my opinion and the government has no business in it . 
  if someone wants to do something stupid and risky ( use heroin , smoke cigarettes , skydive , whatever ) no one has the right to force them not to . 
  irrelevant . 
  people should be free to put whatever substance they want in their bodies ( providing they 're adults who are n't mentally ill/retarded etc. 
   do n't upvote me . 
  fuck you . 
   but go ahead mr. american , tell me more about the country i am visting on a regular basis for working . 
  sure : it 's fucking r ** o ** manian , not r ** u ** manian . 
  how 's that ? 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  i 'm pretty sure you just * actually * confused romanian with roma - i thought no one did that anymore . 
  i really wonder if the people really in control are n't secretly right-leaning and are doing this because they * know * what the reaction will be ... 
  do n't be a dick , it 's not necessary . 
  good things . 
  good , multicultural things that will ... like , enrich you and stuff . 
  lmao, 
  right ... laters ... 
   because they are not as intelligent amirite ? 
  go back to stormfront . 
  there 's reasonable criticism and then there 's just plain dumb racism . 
  * sigh * , and you were doing so well until this . 
  downvoted . 
  how stupid can you be that you think * that 's * racism ? 
  fuck 's sake , pathetic ... 
  how much shit is submitted here solely as circlejerk material about the u.s. so the insecure children can point and reassure each other by saying essentially `` yes , yes , it 's ok , we 're better than them , see how much better than them we are ? '' . 
  guns/shootings , health care , and prisons/police are the big ones that get ` jerked over repeatedly . 
  usually there are two or three such submissions per week from what i 've seen . 
  i would * love * it if this sub just stuck to european-related topics . 
  i 'm american , i did n't subscribe here to read about my own country ( whether what 's written is positive , neutral , or negative ) , i sub ` ed to read about things related to europe . 
  if i wanted american-whatever i could go to any of the other major subs . 
  in this case they 're probably not just dealing with portugal but the eu , so i 'll honestly be surprised if there are n't some fairly harsh consequences for these two . 
  for what it 's worth , this is also very common in more rural parts of the u.s. 
  i am an american . 
  i have * never * heard this term until now . 
  i 'm shocked vermont has n't fully legalized it yet , frankly . 
  i think they 'll be the first , then new hampshire , then who knows . 
  `` yankees '' or `` yanks '' is perfectly fine , do n't worry about it . 
  it means something different inside and outside the u.s. , that 's all . 
  neither is `` incorrect '' . 
  we do not have voting fraud . 
  says the guy in ... * china ?!!, 
  * are you fucking kidding me ? 
  ah yes , why * that * * must * be it . 
  very simple , and yes this * really * is all there is to it , it 's nothing deeper or more complicated than this : right now , especially in europe , it 's stylish to be anti-american , or at least anti-american-culture . 
  that 's it . 
  there 's no good , logical , or intelligent reason to it . 
  i 've heard someone say ( they were talking about france specifically but they could have just as easily been talking about europe in general ) that the fastest way to kill an idea or product would be to say that it 's american or comes from america . 
  it does n't matter how good it is , if it gets labeled `` american '' or associate with the u.s. that immediately and significantly devalues it . 
  stupid ? 
  yup . 
  but so are people  edit : hahahaha !, 
  -17 , of-fucking-course :d,

  do * not * respond to this person , [ they regularly post in / r/whiterights ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/whiterights/comments/10wra9/self_our_collective_will_can_end_obamas_term_this/c6hjah4 ) . 
  i , unlike france , am not the least bit shocked at all . 
  ohhhhh that 's going to help . 
  [ my reaction to this as a man ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx7wtnokuho ) . 
  that was n't racism . 
  their own . 
  keep digging that grave , guys , i 'm impressed with how deep you 've already managed to go so far , i 'm sure you can go deeper if you try . 
  edit : this went from +10 to -14 in about 12 hours ... srs ? 
  shocker . 
  downvoted for the title . 
  wtf ? 
  ok , that 's good to know . 
   the general drug policy is supported by all major political parties and , according to the opinion polls , the restrictive approach receives broad support from the public . 
  yup , that 's the problem , just like i said . 
  there it is right there , very clearly stated : `` the restrictive approach receives broad support from the public . '', 
  wtf , sweden ? 
  why so backwards -- you of all people usually are n't ? 
  here 's a good example , the other scandinavian countries are similar : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drug_policy_of_sweden complete zero tolerance and i 've heard anecdotally that scandinavians in general ( especially swedes ) are terrified of drugs , e.g. 
  a story i heard about a dutch guy with swedish roomates in the netherlands where the guy starts smoking a blunt ( marijuana cigarette ) in the other room a few hours after the swedes had just moved in , the swedes see it and * freak the fuck out * , refuse to come over to that side of the house the rest of the time they 're there , refuse to speak to dutch guy , and are terrified of him thinking he 's going to go nuts and murder them in their sleep or something . 
  other stories i 've heard , though not as extreme , generally correlate with this : they 're very irrationally scared of illegal drugs and their users . 
  oh , but it 's fine to binge drink to an extreme nearly every weeked and stumble home black-out drunk at 5 am on saturday , a very popular activity in sweden ( and , i suspect , the other scandinavian countries ) -- this would certainly qualify as alcohol abuse and make the people who do it alcoholics , but they see nothing wrong with this while simultaneously thinking anyone who smokes one marijuana cigarette is severely mentally ill and in desperate need of arrest and forced treatment and rehabilitation : /, 
  you guys really need to work on your attitudes and laws concerning drugs , they 're atrocious ( i love a lot of things about the scandinavian countries , but this is n't one of them , it 's actually very contrary to the overall attitude of tolerance and live-and-let-live-mind-your-own-business and such ) .
