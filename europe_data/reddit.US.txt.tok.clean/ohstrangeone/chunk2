  they 're disturbingly similar to those in the u.s. , if not * worse * if you can believe that . 
  agreed . 
  the attitude of the scandinavian countries towards drugs is * shockingly * intolerant , very contrary to how their culture is in general . 
  they 're honestly a lot like the u.s. in this regard , they seem to think all drugs should be illegal or heavily regulated ( look at how they handle alcohol sales , utter stupidity and ridiculousness ) and that drug users are horribly dangerous and should be locked up . 
  it 's really quite shocking and disconcerting when you 're familiar with them in general and then you find this very out-of-place aspect of them , it just does n't seem to fit with everything else about them , it 's very odd . 
  they 're scared to death of drugs , it 's so strange . 
  not going to bother with this anymore , this has gotten ridiculously stupid . 
  i do n't think it 's belittling , it would be unusual for anyone outside of europe to know a lot about the politics there , i would n't expect an american ( or an aussie or canadian or mexican ) to know much about it . 
  i 'm american and even * i * know that makes no sense . 
  thanks for telling me which part of germany to visit when i go , 
   that last sentence ( ` also you 're ugly and your mother dresses you funny . ' ), 
  is meant to be humorous . 
  you 're pretty much the only person who has n't gotten this . 
  no , i got it , and my response to it was meant to be humorous . 
  yes , there * is * someone here is n't `` getting it '' , that 's for sure . 
  you obviously agree , so what i said still applies . 
   you did n't get mad when ... [ i did ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iwantout ) ( notice who created that subreddit ) . 
  and need i remind you that the british government , while not * quite * as bad as ours , is n't too far behind in a lot of the above-mentioned aspects ? 
  you have your own version of many of those . 
   also you 're ugly and your mother dresses you funny . 
  you have bad teeth ... and essex . 
  ... good answer . 
  i mean , * i * do n't , but still ... 
  oh shut up , you guys believe in elves . 
  yes that 's true but that 's a result of our political system , not our legal system / constitution . 
  correct . 
  there have been cases in the southern u.s. of politicians who are publicly * known * to have connections to the kkk getting elected . 
  i do n't believe it 's happened recently ( last 10 or 20 years at least ) but it 's happened . 
   you do n't eliminate the problem by banning a party agreed . 
  doing this actually makes the problem worse , not better . 
  i could spend the next 5 hours lecturing about all the things wrong with the u.s. and our government , but one of a few things i think we got right and many european countries get wrong is freedom of speech : mein kampf should not be banned , it should not be illegal to do a nazi salute , it should not be illegal to deny the holocaust -- * making * these things illegal makes the problem worse , it does n't help at all . 
  the best course of action is to welcome people like that into the public limelight so that they can be ridiculed mercilessly , * that * would be far more effective than trying to censor them . 
  censoring them just makes martyrs out of them . 
  no , but you * have * repeatedly chosen to * remain * a u.s. territory in order to reap the benefits without having to pay the taxes . 
  and in addition to this you now get offended when you 're called american ?!, 
  oh fuck you . 
  please , do the real america a favor and vote yourselves independent -- why * have n't * you done that since you seem to be so vehemently opposed to being considered american ? 
  you 've had a vote on this several times in the past , but the population never passes it . 
  why ? 
  oh , that 's right , you 're getting a bunch of free shit from us and you do n't want to lose that ( by becoming a sovereign nation ) nor do you want to have to pay for it ( by becoming a u.s. state ) . 
  lovely . 
  you 're treating europe like an individual country . 
  everything we 're talking about is very country-specific . 
  i 'm thinking about moving to finland most likely , the education system there is * awesome * . 
  i agree that there are some european countries that are worse than the u.s. in some regards ( education , ignorance , etc. 
  ) , but my point is that there are some that are far better . 
  i would n't consider moving to italy , greece , the u.k. , or france . 
  but finland , norway , sweden , or possibly even the czech republic ? 
  yeah maybe . 
  i 'm especially impressed with finland right now , they 're really kicking ass in nearly all the areas that i consider important . 
  there 's a reason i started and run / r/iwantout - i will * not * raise my children in this country ( to be clear i do n't have any yet but probably will in 10 or 20 years ) . 
  it 's not just the stuff mentioned in the article , it 's the shittastic education system as well , the cost of higher education , the terrible and inhumane social programs , and the ignorance of the general population ( thanks to the aforementioned education system ) . 
  i could list another dozen reasons as well , but those are most of the main ones and the ones i was able to come up with off the top of my head . 
  that sounds strangely kinky . 
  that 's gon na cause some cultural and social problems . 
   austerity is just a word used to tarnish the concept of living within your means . 
  no it is * not * . 
  calling austerity `` simply living within your means '' is an attempt to legitimize austerity by calling it something that people already accept and will agree is good , in this case `` living within your means '' , when it 's really not that thing at all . 
  this is like when the conservatives in the u.s. refer to the very wealthy as `` job creators '' in order to justify not raising taxes on them and even giving them * more * tax breaks than what they have . 
  `` austerity '' , as i perceive it being used in europe right now , means making the 99 % pay for the mess that the 1 % made ( sorry , i 'm going to use that `` 99 % '' thing , i know it 's a cliche at this point , but in this case it 's the best way i can explain this ) . 
  it 's a known fact at this point , it has been proven , that in a recession giving money to the lowest income group via government welfare is * far * more effective in stimulating the economy than giving money to the top earners ( investors and business owners ) via tax breaks and loans and such , for the ridiculously obvious reason that the poor will actually * spend * much , much more of that money than the rich will . 
  yup , napoleonic code , i remember learning about that when i lived in new orleans , very interesting . 
  also , tulane university law schools is one of the very few in the country that specializes in admiralty law . 
  no fucking shit : <, 
   we have n't really been relevant as a world power in a long time sorry , hate to point this out ( very immodest since i 'm from there , but it 's true ) , but the current world power * does * use english as its native tongue and we rarely know how to speak anything else , so if you want to deal with us at all -- economically , politically , militarily , etc. -- you need to speak english . 
  actually even the french are coming around . 
  it 's the younger generation that 's really making strides in this area , and in all areas in general . 
  i say this as an american : the only hope for our country * really is * in the younger generation in that they 're going to have to repair the massive , * massive * damage that 's been caused by the older generation . 
  regrettably , a lot of what we want to do will have to wait until the old farts die :(, 
  no we do n't . 
  it 's just that a lot of us * think * we do . 
  this causes all sorts of problems . 
   europe is n't homogenous and ca n't be forced to be no matter the amount of political resolutions . 
  nor should you want it to be . 
  what a horrible idea . 
  holy fucking shit . 
  ok , that 's fucked up ... and then some . 
  you guys are adorable . 
  -- america, 
  the death penalty has * always * been more expensive than life in prison , it 's been one of the talking points of anti-death-penalty people for a long time now . 
  he 's saying that you should * start out * in the native language , out of respect , and i agree . 
  it takes all of 5 minutes to learn the bare minimum you would need to know : `` excuse me , do you speak english ? 
  '' , that and maybe `` please '' , `` thank you '' , and `` help ! '' . 
  you can learn all of that in 5 fucking minutes , there is * no * excuse whatsoever to not know how to say those things in the native language of a country you 're going to visit , * none * . 
  and who the hell is going to think that someone who asks them the question `` excuse me , do you speak english ? '', 
  can understand their native language ? 
  of course they ca n't , that 's why they asked you if you spoke english : one of two and only two responses will be forthcoming , either ( in english ) `` yes , i do '' and then the conversation goes forth in english or ( in either language , does n't matter which since it 'll be understood regardless ) `` no '' and that 's the end of it . 
  that 's a * very * old joke . 
  i 'm american and i completely disagree , it sounds to * me * like they got what they had coming to them . 
  i would have been infinitely amused by this situation and , presuming they were acting like jerks in the way described , definitely would not have indicated that i speak english and french and can help . 
  [ no ... no , you still do n't understand , son ... it 's * not * your fault .

  you ** lucky ** motherfuckers ... 
  [ if you 'd really like to learn about federalism in the u.s. and the federalist vs. anti-federalist debate that he talked about ] ( http://www.amazon.com/federalist-papers-alexander-hamilton/dp/1612930751/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1330633728&amp;sr=8-1 ) . 
  well , to be fair , there is n't an `` american version '' like there is a version for other countries ( google.ca for canada , google.co.uk for the u.k. , google.fr for france , etc. 
  ) , there 's just google.com , which is their international english-language version of google . 
  interestingly , i recall seeing some numbers that indicated that the majority of searches done by english-language speakers , regardless of what country they were in ( canada , australia , u.k. , etc. ), 
  were done on google.com , not that country 's respective google site . 
  well , his generalization is probably accurate , but you 're definitely right in pointing out that there are exceptions ( are n't there always ? ), 
  and improving the perspective we have on this .
