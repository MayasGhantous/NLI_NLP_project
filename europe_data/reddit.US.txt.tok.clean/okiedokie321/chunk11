  eh to be fair , we are no different from the eu too . 
  we 're also on there . 
  and deal with these issues ? 
  heck no . 
  you could pay me all the money in the world and i would n't want to do it :p, 
  isis is definitely the bigger , immediate threat , between everyone pretty much . 
  unfortunately , us 's views are different than europe in regards to syria , iran , and russia . 
  not all the time we can agree , but that is the nature of politics . 
  they have been coming to europe since the arab spring in 2011 , countries from morocco to libya to syria . 
  i just do n't think it will do any good to treat the problem at the source - invading with ground troops . 
  no country has the appetite to do that except the syrians and russians . 
  once assad eliminates the isis threat , the migrants wo n't be coming back still . 
  therefore , i think this is a border issue and europe should look to australia to see how they handled it . 
  and of course , take in refugees as necessary . 
  we 'll continue to give money to jordan for the refugees and take in refugees on our part to help out . 
  we just need to take in more . 
  i agree with this . 
  it is more preferential to have assad in power . 
  look at what happened when the west took out saddam and gaddafi - those states became total shitholes . 
  it does n't mean we should support assad for his killings during the arab spring though . 
  both the eu and the us supported sanctions against syria during that time . 
  it is better to stay out of it and let them fight it out . 
  hardly . 
  it will help to stem the numbers and make things more orderly , yes , but it will never stop the migrants from coming here . 
  some of our issues include migrants being massacred by cartels and police in mexico and increasing numbers of unaccompanied minors .

  border militarization does not mean shooting at people with tanks . 
  it means fencing , drone and remote surveillance , night vision goggles , increasing border patrol staffing .

  i do love tony parker and batum . 
  it 's more or less from [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1zupnid.jpg ) , but that was a year ago and it is missing kurdistan and russia . 
  it 's alot of geopolitics . 
  it 's not like we can back out now . 
  iraq was our problem and responsibility to begin with , but the issue with us involvement with iraq and eventually syria is a small portion of the bigger issue with the migrant crisis we 're now seeing in europe . 
  the us came back and did airstrikes when isis was getting close to [ erbil ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/thousands-pour-into-iraq-kurdish-north-us-jest-bomb-isis-militants ) , which eventually led to airstrikes in [ kobani ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11226998/us-air-strikes-help-halt-isil-advance-towards-kobane.html ) , syria . 
  i understand you are angry about the recent migrant problems , but it started since the iraq intervention ( our doing ) , arab spring , libya intervention ( europe ) , and the syrian civil war . 
  you have people from countries like morocco , tunisia , libya , syria , egypt , eritrea , etc. 
  all wanting to go to europe since [ 2011 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/18/-sp-world-briefing-europe-worsening-migrant-crisis ) . 
  they are displaced due to war , persecution , bad economy , and human rights abuses . 
  there are many complex factors as to why all this started , and alot of blame to go around for the countries involved , including my own , gulf states , syria , iran , russia etc. 
   loser oh ... you bastard , 
  i think isis will use russian soldiers to further their propaganda . 
  i hope they tread lightly . 
  however , it is understandable why they did not join the air strike coalition since the west kind of has a thing against assad , of which russia wishes to prop up . 
  i think you can say the same for us troops too , most do n't make that much unless you 're a high ranking officer . 
  any good teams to root for ? 
  used to root for spain but wondering if i 'm overlooking any teams with great potential . 
  i agree , we can take up a lot more . 
  but our screening process will need to be overhauled to accommodate . 
  canada will have to do the same too . 
  make money in u.s. , then bring home the bacon to finland . 
  the fashion capital of the world !, 
  cz , just because it 's so much cheaper and has a good quality of life . 
  nl is good too ( but depending where you live ) . 
  love the old towne square and charles bridge in prague !, 
  nah mate , fsa does n't even exist anymore . 
  it 's isis and co. now . 
  even if assad acts as a dictator , i think the west would rather prefer syria be stable with a dictator than have the mess going on now . 
  the way i see it , the us contributed through the vacuum left in iraq with al-maliki abandoning and turning on the sunni 's in anbar . 
  when isis and co. came over from syria ( arab spring ) , sunni 's sided with them . 
  that 's true i guess . 
  in my city at least , we give syrians only 8 months of aid . 
  we can take in more probably . 
  we are at 1434 now with a commitment of 10k , but we should definitely take more . 
  i think the un referred 15k and irc said we need to take up 65k but , between canada and us , we can take alot more than that . 
  we need to up those numbers , it 's pathetic . 
  we have plenty of room between canada and us . 
  lmao, 
  just another target for dutch planes . 
  eu and us should stay the fuck out . 
  our only priorities is protecting kurds and throwing bombs at isis from the air every so often . 
  let russia and syria fight al-nusra and isis punks . 
  i am secretly cheering for russia though . 
  reminds me of this comic about eesti making his own [ club ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6nknhkk.jpg ) because he can not into nordic . 
  minus the presidential candidates part , there was already a thread about what what they think of [ americans ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jbx8q/how_is_the_us_viewed_in_your_country/ ) . 
  do a search next time . 
  agree , though sanders is not perfect but he 's leagues better than hilary and trump . 
  and god forbid we ever vote for jeb bush . 
  that too . 
  that makes sense , thanks !, 
  she 's actually really plain in my opinion , but the fact that she is british increases her attractiveness 10x . 
  correct . 
  hah i do the same too for the ignorant americans who come on this sub . 
  there are just idiots everywhere . 
  rest assured , we like you guys . 
  it 's the loud minority especially on the internet making surrender or smelly french stereotype . 
  i personally have viewed french as a classy , romantic people growing up . 
  but the francophobia is very real . 
  i do n't why americans always think that french people would hate us so much . 
  this is not european news . 
  if you ever get an itching bull 's eye rash ( a characteristic sign of lyme 's disease ) , see your gp as soon as possible . 
  your english is better than mine . 
  it stabilizes europe fairly well and i 'd imagine it gives the argies a second thought on the falklands . 
  eastern europe 's view on western europe was what did it for me . 
  the city is even burning in the background . 
  just look at it as banter . 
  i think there should be more threads `` what do you think of ____ '' for european countries like serbia , romania , etc. 
  i feel this this type of topic about the u.s. comes up too often in this sub . 
  saying that , it was nice to see different perspectives so thanks op . 
  hahah , i get that alot .
