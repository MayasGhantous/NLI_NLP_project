  plenty of people hate it i know . 
  it is an acquired taste . 
  when you have friends who have bags full of this stuff and you did n't want them to throw it away because of waste , it will eventually grow on you . 
  best of all , you can keep more to yourself . 
  `` what are you eating ? '', 
  `` oh can i have some , let 's share ? '', 
  `` what are you eating ? '', 
  * black licorice * . 
  `` eww fuck , that 's gross dude . 
  here you can have my bag . '', 
  found it , [ lakritzschnecken ] ( https://www.haribo.com/dede/haribo-lakritz-schnecken.html ) . 
  stuff is amazing , you have no taste :p, 
  i 'd kill for some bratwurst and those licorice gummies from haribo . 
  they do n't have that here . 
  at least not those licorice ones . 
  i had your stance a few days ago . 
  got this [ explanation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ilrzr/poland_to_store_us_military_equipment_from_mid2016/cui4ml2?context=3 ) by a pole . 
  it is really more about them and less about the uk , sure , but uk troops will be warmly welcomed there . 
  they will greatly appreciate it . 
  plus , better eastern europe than afghanistan , i 'd say . 
  i agree , if those are our candidates , we are doomed . 
  i 'm putting in my vote for [ sanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernie_sanders ) . 
  that man should be hung . 
  we call him ... dad . 
  but i need to treat you with [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/is1wujg.png?1 ) first . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joking, 
  http://i.imgur.com/u2thaef.png one day finland ... one day ... baltics would be happy :p, 
  all for it . 
  go ahead , call your [ yugozord ] ( https://imgur.com/a/yglq7 ) !, 
  i think china is slowly taking over that role though . 
  rather support india . 
  i 'll place the c-4 on the jeep !, 
  our government supports pakistan but our people like india more . 
  it 's kind of the same way with saudi . 
  launch at 01:02:00 . 
  well , germany is doing its best to unite the eu . 
  they have big [ hearts ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/germans-welcome-migrants-refugees-donations-food-clothing-toys-photos-1518028 ) . 
  it 's just facing stiff resistance from some countries who do n't want to take in refugees . 
  but i agree though , if the eu was federalized , things would get done quickly . 
  on our ends , we should do what we can to help out in our respective countries . 
  i 'm not sure how i can influence my country to take in more , but i think i will look into donating to german charities . 
  so far we have received only 15000 un [ referrals ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/us-accept-8000-syrian-refugees-after-germany-france-call-overhaul-eu-asylum-system-2066777 ) , so our asylum obviously needs an overhaul . 
  70,000 is a drop in the bucket , i agree and we should be taking in more . 
  you 'll do well in germany , child . 
  we have been and will gladly take them . 
  see [ here ] ( http://immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/refugees-fact-sheet ) . 
  a good majority of our refugees are iraqi and afghan , just starting to get a trickle of syrians here . 
  questions to germans : how long do the refugee benefits last ? 
  i ask because refugees here think it is a goldmine in germany and sweden and will last forever . 
  you guys are more generous than us on the social safety net after all . 
  for example , over here , we only give them aid enough to pay for rent , food , and such for about 8 months . 
  then we hope they have a job by then to support themselves . 
  of course they can apply for more aid but it is more difficult after you use up your 8 months of refugee benefits . 
   libya - check we can blame the french for this one , for once . 
  most americans get something like 2 to 2.5 weeks . 
  government jobs get more if i recall but that 's a paltry amount to our european counterparts who can get months off . 
  the work conditions are some of the reasons why americans just want to work for startups or telecommute ... at least for my generation ... 
  he must be american or british . 
  haha albania :p, 
  we are taking in about 10k syrian refugees but obviously it 's not enough . 
  afaik , eu has n't consulted with the u.s. about this issue right ? 
  you are forgetting the arab spring . 
  isis was created during the vacuum of power taking place in syria , before they crossed over to iraq . 
  i hope the uk votes to stay . 
  the eu needs to stay together instead of passing the buck on issues . 
  canada , i am so proud of you bro . 
  we do n't control nato . 
  we are just a founder and largest contributor , arguably with the largest influence , yes . 
  you are not forced to increase defense spending . 
  the 2 % is just a benchmark . 
  if sweden joins ( which i doubt they will ) , do you think finland will follow suit ? 
  you guys need more / r/yurop man , this stuff is getting depressing . 
  wow , that poor guy got wacked right in the head with the rifle butt . 
  there are good and bad immigrants everywhere . 
  you get your hard workers and you get your leechers . 
  i think we have our own issues with the hispanic immigrants currently as it is , but if iceland can take in 10k , we could probably double that amount for syrian refugees . 
  i think canada is taking in 10k over 3 years and we 're taking in 10k by next year . 
  a paltry amount compared to what iceland intends to do . 
  props to those guys . 
  if the ussr defeated the west , things would have gone the other way . 
  i think the issue about western europe looking down on eastern europeans can stem back to anti-slavism dating back to the 20th century . 
  heck , hitler himself said slavic people were sub-human which was messed up . 
  also , different economic systems , plus ussr stunted the growth of eastern europe for a good while , though they themselves have very impressive inventions and power if you include them amongst all europeans . 
  i think countries like poland and romania will grow stronger economically , politically , and militarily . 
  it takes time . 
  you get my vote , especially being a potential non-european mod . 
  it would help during the odd hours . 
  let me grab the popcorn . 
  mccain needs to retire ... 
  sweet !, 
  cheers . 
  here 's a petition i found about ids : http://chn.ge/1jspklm, 
  you have the right mindset . 
  go enjoy yourself before you become enslaved to the workforce . 
  we are all corporate peasants in the end . 
  on the bright side , germans get alot more vacation days/pto than we do !, 
  just do n't change your system to ours . 
  how much of a loan do you have to take out ? 
  i imagine it must be very low . 
  yeah that bit is really sad , when nato can intervene in libya but not intervene in ukraine because of russia .
