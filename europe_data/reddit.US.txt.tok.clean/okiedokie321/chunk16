  we demand our rights for bases !, 
  * chasing nato into corner * mr. nato : ohshitohshit, 
  i know where i 'm going for vacation . 
  sounds super cheap . 
   london has artificially made the prices rise across all uk now i know why brits hate london . 
  and it will be donated by volunteers from their military surplus store . 
  top gear , geordie shore , newcastle , expats , and a handful of celebrities , actors , etc. 
  loving the nature scenery . 
  hello , i am balticbot . 
  well , as long as that funding is used for independent journalism , exposing truths regardless of which side , then it should be fine . 
  though i have a feeling the us/eu funding such things will only lead to information wars and cyber warfare with russia . 
  but what can you do when the other side is spreading some unbelievable propaganda that gives even north korea a run for its money ? 
  rafale takes my money . 
  looks like something i can fly on the go consulting just a manual . 
  i 'll be over here watching geordie shore . 
  just place nato flags all along the border and see if they call nato 's bluff . 
  they have to be crazy to invade a nato country anyway . 
  not like it actually prevented russian users from making shrooms and getting high while browsing through reddit . 
  jokes on them !, 
  the dutch have been burning russian [ gas ] ( http://www.gazpromexport.ru/en/partners/netherlands/ ) for years !, 
  many nations fund the un and we get this . 
  unbelievable . 
  wow , what a kick ass video . 
  and now i am craving watermelon . 
  mighty albania powerful montenegro liechtenstein big iceland stronk !, 
  at the time , there were `` technically '' no russian soldiers , just `` separatists . '', 
  nato soldiers would have had every right to defend themselves and the crash site of mh17 and establish a small defacto nato zone in ukraine . 
  you and i know russia would not touch the nato even if nl wanted to drag nato into a potential conflict . 
  i think it was n't an article 5 issue , more of an article 4 but of which nl could have done . 
  not bad . 
  time for poland to convince ukraine and belarus to join . 
  that reflection !, 
  loved that eerie cartoon . 
  i command you to stop getting invaded every now and then !, 
  and also you must make your own nukes without the world knowing . 
  that is an order !, 
  where i am from , we have many somali , pakistani , indian , syrian , asian , and african immigrants and refugees . 
  from my experience travelling through europe and across usa , we are more receptive to immigrants than europeans are and more willing to embrace them as americans . 
  however , if you go to middle of no where , usa where there is only white people , yeah those americans wo n't recognise you as a american . 
  to them , american is white people . 
  * shudder * different perspectives is all . 
  one can become a citizen of norway , but not considered norwegian because of ethnicity . 
  on the other hand , one can become a citizen of america , and be considered an american regardless of ethnicity . 
  geert wilders reminds me of an american politician . 
  thank goodness you guys do n't have alot of crazy politicians like we do . 
  we love you too !, 
  i agree , i just think the terms of article 5 is somewhat vague . 
  recent polls show that a sizable nato population does n't support defending its own allies . 
  this is coming from countries like germany and italy . 
  i think we have to go to bat anyway because of credibility . 
  as for uk , they got this perceived notion of following usa but that was only because of iraq . 
  we did n't bomb syria because uk did n't want to go in . 
  i guess you can say it 's kind of mutual . 
  i would say semi-unified . 
  i 'm sure uk or poland would come to bat any day of the week to defend a nato or eu country , but others might not , or their populations are reluctant to go to war for another country . 
  i wish . 
  we have nicki minaj , which is its own genre itself . 
  * shivers *, 
  can we import these authorities to do the same thing here too ? 
  we got [ ice cream ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8vpxkyy.jpg ) . 
  [ anglosphere ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q3cvonlau0o/uueejq6vexi/aaaaaaaaahk/1ula4qcdkgk/s1600/anglosphere+polandball.jpg ) , unite !, 
  http://i.imgur.com/p0ctjsc.png france is related * somehow * . 
  norway < 3 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ why ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ us ? 
  lol you troll, 
  it 's sad how our countries could n't be on friendly terms . 
  today , it 's like the cold war all over again . 
  wtf happened ? 
  it 's funny how croatia invited all nato members to participate , but everyone backed out last minute . 
  probably did n't want to cause more tensions with serbia . 
  hashtag # justbalkanproblems, 
  i wonder if eurofighter diverted potential sales from rafale . 
  hope the injured recover . 
  ... or that german nato rapid response force . 
  we 're not paying them to stand around for nothing !, 
  it will be overkill though ... 
  interesting , i 'll check that out thanks . 
  from the media , it sounded like isis was gaining ground in syria and iraq so i thought the bombardment was just a placeholder to show the international community something is being done . 
  haha oh fox news ... 
  ah i think i know what you 're talking about . 
  had to look it up on [ google ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/91sv6oesrsl._sl1500_.jpg ) . 
  and during my search , i found something interesting when i typed in [ egg ] ( http://www.candywarehouse.com/assets/item/large/gummy-fried-eggs-box-132905.jpg ) . 
  i 'm curious about the white piece . 
  continued bombardment is n't going to do anything though , neither would troops on the ground ( and god forbid that ever happens ) . 
  if this was back in the 40 and 50 's era , i think the us or uk would have used the nuclear bomb on the caliphate already . 
  nothing at all . 
  it is just french logic to burn cars , some high-end , on bastille day . 
  * slowly cries *, 
  i had the laughing gas from reading that title . 
  that or they are unfamiliar and too afraid to try european restaurants haha, 
  whatever fast food chains you guys have there is better than the shit we get here . 
  and we invented those popular chains too . 
  [ rekt ] ( http://randomoverload.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/d1e5a563elf-sarkozy.jpg ), 
  it 's quite funny actually . 
  europeans seem to think brits are the unruly and rowdy people of europe . 
  over here , we think of them as classy , intelligent , and sophisticated . 
  * shrugs *, 
   news corp. , owner of the newspaper , said the video taken by the rebels was smuggled out of donetsk just this week after months of efforts to obtain it . 
  i would love to know more about how they were able to get this out . 
  this is proofs of nato expansionism and a blatant landgrab - v. putin, 
  i read last year looters were able to get cell phones , credit cards , cash , and jewelry from the dead .
