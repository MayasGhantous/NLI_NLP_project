  so the rebels did a pretty bad job at securing the site . 
  if they want to be their own credible cuntry , at least try to be professional about it . 
  but no , they had to convince themselves that an imaginary ukrainian sukhoi jet shot down the civilian plane and that they shot down that imaginary sukhoi to save mh17 . 
  the fuck is that going to do ? 
  secure the damn crash site !, 
  nice collection !, 
  they 're all talk and no action . 
  french ? 
  i thought everyone liked them . 
  it seems more like american , russian , greek , and sometimes brits . 
  if i was greece , i 'd learn from belarus and leverage between eu and russia . 
  you can not lose if you stay in between . 
  feels like home . 
  have you hopped on over to the bahamas yet ? 
  must be nice right now ... 
  just do n't show hilary that . 
  we went to hell and back in the blunder that was iraq ... took out gadaffi forces with ya in libya ... spied together all over the place ... 
  think we 've been cool for quite some time i 'd say ... 
  vive la france, 
  with how well the uk economy is doing , going past 2 % would n't be a stretch at all . 
  now if nato can convince canada to do the same ... 
  this post should n't be in / r/europe to begin with . 
  europe is n't even in the title . 
  this is a personal matter stateside . 
  nah , no one reaches the big 20 anymore . 
  nowadays , it 's all about `` getting disabled '' and getting paid by the va for your rating . 
  think i even heard one guy `` get disabled '' at boot camp , then collect his bennies ( something like $ 4000/mo ) . 
  the whole military pension and va system needs overhaul . 
  it 's not sustainable . 
  cutting the troop numbers down is a start at least . 
  we need to be smaller and efficient , not bigger and wasteful . 
   here is the source ( girl is greek ) just a minor tidbit pointing it out to op . 
  perhaps the op thought it was a greek reporter . 
   also , the girl is named phoebe greenwood and is not greek ( not that it matters , just for clarity 's sake ) . 
  ... and someone found the lady 's name . 
  i 'm upvoting . 
  on this sub , you learn to avoid the downvotes and speak your mind . 
  yeah , that 's all he can do - mediate . 
  other than that , there 's no point in intervening unless he 's waving cash to bail out the greeks . 
  question : is dw usually the better news article ? 
  the girl is a brit i believe . 
  ... sadly you are deeply misinformed . 
  http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2005-07-13-rating-the-game_x.htm  the british anthem god save the queen in tribute to the victims of last week 's terrorist bombings in london was also a nice touch . 
  http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050708-9.html  president signs book of condolence at british embassy http://www.cnn.com/2005/us/07/07/us.response/index.html  the u.s. army band played `` god save the queen '' outside the embassy thursday evening , and the state department lowered the union jack to half-staff outside its washington headquarters . 
   `` i want to express our sympathy and our prayers for the families of those who have died and our prayers and wishes for the recovery of the injured , '' rice said . 
  `` i also want to say that we have no better friend , and ally , in the struggle against terrorism than great britain . '', 
   people left dozens of flower bouquets and signs with messages such as `` we stand with you '' and `` today , we are all british '' against the front gate of the embassy .

  i liked how the lady got up to the camera while the reporter was trying to get around her at 1:50 . 
  i loved \u0160koda when i was in czech republic . 
  great looking cars , affordable , and overall good performance . 
  maybe one day they will go big and bring them to the us . 
  grant is small but it was a nice gesture on the part of germany . 
  and all day and all night and everything he sees , is just blue like him inside and outside ... 
  the whole ordeal with greece , the eu , and military funding for the bundeswehr . 
  well , i 'm not being patriotic or anything , just stating the truth . 
  i was n't knocking on germany however , you guys have enough problems as it is . 
  this is giving me an aneurysm and i do n't even live over there . 
  it gives me an aneurysm too and i do n't even live there . 
  never heard of him much over here either . 
  oh great , we have a person who thinks 2 nuclear powers of the unsc are us stooges . 
  that 's baffling . 
  you do realize we were invited to nato , right ? 
  we do pay a huge budget and play a role in nato but it 's not like we outright own the organization . 
  i 'm sorry but we were n't the ones who wanted to bomb gaddafi forces . 
  france and the uk took the initiative , we only joined to help europe out ( did you know some european countries ran out of bombs ? ) . 
  obama even said himself he wanted to `` lead from behind '' and let europeans handle it . 
  right now we 're also taking the initiative in the bombing isis campaign and taking in syrian refugees , so it 's not like we do n't have our hands full either . 
  what europeans need to do is stop fucking fighting one another and get united on a single platform . 
  this whole grexit and migrant problems are issues that could have been handled better if you guys would stop blaming other countries besides your own . 
  i mean , just look at italy . 
  it feels like some european countries just want to leave italy hanging . 
  what 's worst - the italians never wanted to bomb gaddafi forces in the first place !, 
  great going , huh ? 
  nice gesture . 
  of course , american volunteers are there . 
  they have to get there first before russian volunteers do . 
  ... eh only a handful of volunteers . 
  now if this was the us gov ' t doing a bailout , then now you 're talking . 
  i 'm not eu but yes i would advocate for a rise in military spending in germany and increasing the military power of germany within an eu apparatus ( or within nato like you already are doing ) . 
  i can only hope your country will support your military because it seems most germans spit on the bundeswehr , which is very sad . 
  being a soldier is a job as well . 
  what can i say ? 
  it 's an anglo thing . 
  this is getting to some absurd levels . 
  my friend put it more simply : '' there 's moscow , there 's st. petersburg , and then there 's the rest of russia . '', 
  so it is not surprising we got these answers . 
  the people from these cities are well educated , cultured , and overall good folks . 
  sweden is strange in that it participates in so many nato exercises and operations , and yet still is n't a full nato member . 
  i suspect the populace is the only thing holding them back but once there 's people more for it , sweden will jump at the chance regardless of finland joining at the same time or not . 
  a future referendum should be done . 
  no , if us soldiers were training with finnish/swedish troops and russia invaded , they would be ordered to withdraw back to base and abandon vehicles and equipment as well . 
  it 's because there is no obligation between us and sweden/finland to defend them ( i.e. 
  nato ) . 
  same applies to norwegian soldiers , unless they have a special agreement ( which i believe they do ) with sweden and finland on nordic defense . 
  sweden and finland is the obligation of the eu , which we are not apart of . 
  however , i do agree there might be some public bias towards defending swedes and finns more than georgians , unfortunately , because of how western they are perceived . 
  i bring over some armor and shields .
