  man depression fucking sucks . 
  poor lady . 
  ... or the us gov ' t is a bunch of back-stabbing pansies ... is more like it . 
  perfect timing , 
  that 's good news . 
  yeah i agree not actively . 
  if they were active and had full intention to surround russia without being mindful of it , they probably would have accepted georgia , ukraine , and pressure finland to join ( which they did n't ) . 
  surrounding russia is a bad idea anyway . 
  it only makes the alliance more prone to a likelihood of war because of nato 's enlargement and more territory to defend . 
  we ( us ) are thankful for that , and the help we received during the hurricanes . 
  only makes sense to give back or in this case , provide a deterrence force in the baltics . 
  i do n't think nato is intentionally doing that , they are just approving members who want to join , countries of their own free will . 
  but yeah , russia should treat its neighbors better . 
  we probably wo n't be in this current situation in the first place had they done so .

  but ... but our `` special relationship . '', 
  nah , to put it quite simply , the uk and us war would just be a fight without nato involvement . 
  that is true . 
  but like you said in your other comment , considering the bnd 's budget , it is very impressive for what can be done . 
  german efficiency and all that , hah , 
  i do n't agree with lolmonger 's comment either as we definitely do have poverty here . 
  i think you underestimate the [ bnd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesnachrichtendienst#telephone_surveillance ) . 
  there 's probably more technology and intel that we citizens do n't know anything about .

  and worldwide . 
  we can only hope to help our fellow man and woman stricken by poverty through initiatives like the [ global poverty project ] ( http://www.globalpovertyproject.com/ ) . 
  this should better explain it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yb1w-0l8yq, 
  sure , guns welcome if you want . 
   in return you can use greek history as your own and no one can ever mock you again , it 's win-win . 
  dang that is a great perk !, 
  alright , here 's the plan . 
  we 'll buy out the greeks but in return , they must be a us territory for 5 years , agree to hosts bases , use the usd , and direct a greek mythology epic adventure , hollywood style . 
  then they can declare independence , rejoin eu , and repeat the process . 
  italy , just quash these bugs already .

  damn , we just got blocked by france for a un intervention in / r/europe . 
  we will just have to make do with renaming french fries * freedom fries * , once again . 
  sorry europe , looks like it 's up to the uk !, 
  they need to be pushed back and possibly even arrested . 
  perhaps it 's time the uk sends in the royal army ? 
  if france wo n't do it out of fear of protests or societal pressure , i know the brits will happily do it . 
  i suggest to europeans to travel the european continent instead . 
  or check out the carribbeans . 
  much safer for you guys . 
  this is fucking tragic . 
  man , this is weird . 
  it 's ok , france still loves us .

  can confirm . 
  we have unbelievably stupid citizens . 
  10/10 trolling , sweden . 
  do you seriously think we control you like a puppet ? 
  poland is an independent country , it is just the media overhyping things between russia and nato , with poland in particular very paranoid about russia because of history . 
  poland is also a nato country so using poland as a proxy and pushing them towards a war with russia would drag us in as well ; it would make no sense . 
  plus , as others have said , if we wanted to up the ante and make a proxy war with russia , we would have armed ukraine right from the get-go . 
  it is the media . 
  they do the same fear mongering over here too about russia invading our air space . 
  this too shall pass . 
  you are overreacting . 
  stay away from the news for awhile . 
  maybe the baltics were n't kidding ... 
  strange , google said it was posted just 15 hours ago . 
  here 's a different [ one ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/nato-rapid-reaction-force-counter-russia-ukraine ) from february 2015 . 
  basically , nato will rotate lead on the spearhead force and this year it is led by germany . 
  wow , that really sucks : / . 
  we sometimes have protests where a funeral is held for a dead soldier and people show up with signs saying `` thank god for dead soldiers . '', 
  it 's the price you pay for freedom of speech in our countries i guess . 
  i do think it 's sad how people treat soldiers so shitty . 
  it is a job as well but people do n't comprehend that . 
  this might sound stereotypical american lol but ... . * thank you for your service . 
  to be fair , you guys already are doing enough . 
  the new nato rapid response force is led by germans . 
  i have not actually , but from what canadians have told me , the streets are filled with potholes over there . 
  and i was just joking about not wanting the french part of canada . 
  just a joke . 
  ah , do tell . 
  we can learn from the best , 
  i think even if germans did the same thing , i have a feeling the baltics would still want us there . 
  i mean , it makes sense right ? 
  if you 're part of a military bloc , you would want the strongest country in that bloc to back you up . 
  now , if germany was stronger than usa , then maybe the circumstances might be different .
