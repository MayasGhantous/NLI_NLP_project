  same here , i did n't know there was a morava valley in serbia . 
  til . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/morava_valley_ ( serbia ), 
  sure , take your pick !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ bet ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ texas ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ them . 
  yep !, 
  most czechs who live in texas are from moravia region . 
  i 'm born in usa tho . 
  well , that is quite tempting ... we could become a hockey superpower ... 
  deal . 
  then we can apply for eu membership now that eu is so close , 
  i think we need to stop giving germans so much flak , just look at canada . 
  i 'm surprised it 's not more considering how much land they have . 
  i do n't understand why you are being downvoted so much . 
  i always see your comments on / r/europe and it 's downvoted plenty . 
  what about the eu ? 
  does n't the eu have a clause for member defense ? 
  i 'm surprised we do not see eu ( like the swedish ) troops alongside nato troops in the baltic/eastern europe region . 
  no , not really . 
  there are russians that are nice . 
  most average americans do n't even care about foreign affairs with russia , unless when they fly the occasional bomber to our shores . 
  do n't worry eurobros , we got your back . 
  this is why we have to `` pre-position '' as a preventative measure so russia does n't get any ideas to attack . 
  and if they do ... well , shit . 
  do n't worry canada and greenland ( denmark ) , were not getting any ideas . 
  i believe iceland is in nato if i 'm not mistaken . 
  later down in history , romania would be a good role model to look at . 
  the 21st century way of getting colonial troops . 
  we do the same thing too . 
  awarding citizenship after service ... 
  dude , this is the epitome of being on a `` high horse . '', 
  respect . 
  yes , we can into debt . 
  yes , with some sort of federal power sharing deal so no one state/country would hold too much influence . 
  capital in brussels , of course . 
  the truth is ... . we do n't want quebec . 
  no amount of poutine would convince us . 
  european military together as one is not to be underestimated . 
  however , the problem is the eu does n't have a fully federalized military nor is the populace really supportive of backing up nato members ( with exceptions like uk and poland ) . 
  that 's not mentioning how divided some countries are on defense and the whole `` hot potato'ing '' issue elsewhere ( i am thinking of the migrant problem ) . 
  the us helps to fill in some of that void with military presence like in the baltics while the eu focuses on other things ( like targeting migrant smugglers ) . 
  it 's a mutual partnership . 
  i 'm not trying to brag and i 'm sure a federalized eu would have more manpower and military than us ... but right now , we have a big military by western standards and we are alot more responsive to defense commitments . 
  additionally , we do n't have a crazy neighborhood * at this time * but europe does . 
  60 + years ago , western europe [ sought ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_brussels#nato ) usa and canada as partners in a military alliance . 
  they allowed wudo to be absorbed in favor of nato for good reason and today , the alliance still has its helpful merits ( and some ugly ones like the libya operation * cough cough * ) . 
  but until the eu can get everything sorted out , it will be a loooong time before europe can be on its own two feet . 
  americans ( and i guess canadians ) are something something swamp european mutts , many generations removed . 
   bazookas holy hell . 
  how ? 
  they break into an army base ? 
  please , anything but quebec !, 
  like 17.1 million km \u00b2 area for 143.5 million population is not enough ... india would like a word . 
  the designs were ahead of its time . 
  one of the greatest british children shows ever invented . 
  years later you can watch it while high ( yes people actually have done this ) . 
  i think thats what will happen too . 
  nato states will funnel weapons and hardware through lithuania which in turn officially arms ukraine . 
  it 's dirty but maybe not as dirty as little green men on vacation . 
   everyone look at me , i have offensive cartoons !, 
  i died . 
  this is good for the russians from their perspective . 
  as for belgium , why do it at all if you are just going to unblock it later ? 
  surprised they do n't replace with a new model . 
  but that 's the latvian flag . 
  i think my country will follow your lead like in libya , but we have to assess the risks , like what 's now occurring after libyan intervention . 
  the only thing our countries will really do is perhaps arm the ukrainians - but nothing more . 
  i think it 's nice we can joke about the little things that the french and us gov ' t advise to its travelers . 
  that was the best one . 
  just replace finland with sweden and yuo might get this : http://i.imgur.com/u2thaef.png, 
  and we have some of the best healthcare services and tech , but where we fuck up on is the whole system of private insurance . 
  not too mention americans look at county/city healthcare ( free ) and some immediately think if we overhaul our system to something similar to that ( or like canada 's ) , we will all have to wait and get our care delayed , etc. 
  worst - the old timers think anything socialized = bad . 
  we are a stubborn people . 
  happy icelandic national day !, 
  as much as i like the greek people , this guy is an idiot . 
  he 's playing the pointing the finger game already , whether it 's imf or eu . 
  wow , ok maybe i can understand the officers whacking the migrants with sticks but the migrants whacking back with their own was a surprise . 
  that 'll convince the spaniards to take you in ... 
  do n't think this is a european matter . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  but russia is already reacting harshly to hardware essentially in storage . 
  ca n't be any worst if we let the balts have the hardware . 
  instead of `` pre-positioning , '' why not just give the vehicles away so they can train with them ? 
  the baltics do n't have any tanks or ifv 's if i recall . 
  plus , donating would n't antagonize russia so much that they would put missiles in kalingrad . 
  if we should take responsibility then canada should too . 
  we only followed europe 's lead . 
  you have to remember we are on a different continent on the other side of the world . 
  we have enough responsibility as it is in eastern europe dealing with russia ... at a time no one else in europe wants to help and again , this coming from a nation an ocean away . 
  i agree , nato should not have its name slapped on the allied operation . 
  there was no threat to a nato member . 
  on the bright side , the intervention showed that we ( us ) do n't control nato like most people think . 
  on the bright side , i imagine serving the military makes your resume look good . 
  do n't mean to point fingers but it was uk and france that started the mess in libya . 
  we tagged along like any other ally would . 
  we were initially hesitant to jump in , much like italy . 
  ca n't blame them , fish n chips are great . 
  dang , my condolences . 
  that damage and loss of life ( both animal and human ) .
