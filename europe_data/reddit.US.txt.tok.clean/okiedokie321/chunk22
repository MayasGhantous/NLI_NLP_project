  i 'm no kremlin shill lol , but come on , you guys ca n't always be anti russian all the time right ? 
  somehow , i just knew someone would say this before i even clicked to read the comments . 
  i misread the title . 
  i thought hungarians were using t-72 's as shooting target practice . 
  good video nonetheless , looks like fun . 
  literally to russia , associating with us means you become an asset and your country automatically has no free will of its own . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ he 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ north ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ american . 
  but we did ... we did n't stay long except in places like germany . 
  the us went as far east as czechoslovakia to liberate western bohemia , then we left and russians took over . 
  never mind , it was danes sending jets to defend sweden [ . 
  ] ( http://cphpost.dk/news14/international-news14/danish-f-16s-confronted-russian-fighter-jets-approaching-sweden/047591.html ), 
  do n't go !, 
   in the case of the recent air incursions , he said , the message was clear : `` they were testing how we 'd react . '', 
  so are the finns constantly sending jets to intercept the air incursions ? 
  i think i read somewhere either it was sweden or finland that did n't send interceptors and jets from another country were sent to do that for them . 
  ca n't really blame them . 
  our most recent incursion in alaska , we did n't send any interceptors either . 
  at this point , russia 's just trolling everyone . 
  the eu should just federalise already . 
  a single european army is a great complement to nato and serves european interests . 
   `` buckwheat , tokens , iphones '' lmao that is random . 
  build a snowman !, 
  there is a cyrus and bieber joke in there somewhere . 
  and [ barbie girl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyhryis509a )  je m ` appelle mads : hyldest til danmark this is ... ... surprisingly catchy . 
  good pick !, 
  also , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zojcmpkayn8, 
  those pro-israel lobby groups need to fuck off . 
  russia i 'm not really surprised with , but china ? 
  wow , quite surprising to see them there . 
  perhaps it is to emphasize partnership with russians and provide a `` show of force '' to protect their hegemony in africa . 
  they have interests in the region after all . 
  calling germany a colony is a bit of a stretch though !, 
  at one point , they ( the germans ) colonized us . 
  i 'm pretty sure you guys spy on us too , i would n't even be surprised . 
  everyone spies on each other nowadays . 
  it 's the new craze . 
  sounds like you will fit in but maybe your name and background will help . 
  plus , there 's a bit of bias towards hiring folks who speak fluent american/canadian english than with someone with accent . 
  did you come from california too ? 
  seems like everyone these days are from texas . 
  i suggest nato should send a brit , they are quite good with banter . 
  he would be trading words with the crowd . 
  do you have any particular recommendations ? 
  i 'm assuming this is the french quarter we 're talking about . 
  oh definitely , travelling europe by air was very cheap for me , even cheaper than train . 
  the kicker is those prices are n't even sales - its regular price . 
  in the us , we largely have to take advantage of sales , mistake fares , or use points ( from credit cards ) to get around for cheap or free . 
  from least expensive to most expensive , you 'd want to go for [ spirit ] ( http://marketing.spirit.com/traveldeals/air.php?s=2135&amp;mw=1 ) ( right now advertising fares as low as 34.10 usd ) , [ frontier ] ( http://content.flyfrontier.com/ways-to-save/online-deals ) ( 19 usd ) , [ southwest ] ( https://www.southwest.com/ ) ( 73 usd ) , and [ jetblue ] ( http://www.jetblue.com/ ) . 
  spirit and frontier are very much like budget airlines in europe because they tend to charge you for things like not printing out your plane ticket . 
  i usually advocate for southwest mainly because while you pay a bit more , they are really lax with their rules , wo n't charge you for trivial things , you can change or cancel your flight date at any time without additional charge , and they also allow you to have 2 luggages/boxes/whatever you want on the plane , plus 1 carry-on all for free . 
  now , if you 're ever in the south like texas and such , you can take advantage of mexican budget airlines as they have very cheap flights going around usa and also usa to mexico and back if you are ever interested . 
  i ca n't recall the names but a simple google search should usually do you well . 
  when you 're in a major city , take advantage of uber or lyft apps because they tend to be much cheaper than the taxis that charge an arm and leg . 
  that 's if the city does n't have major public transit . 
  use tripadvisor.com to plan ahead and see what people have reviewed . 
  the flags in the first photo look cheap as hell . 
  yep , it 's more so for me than other americans because i 'm first generation ( my family moved here in the 90 's ) . 
  it 's a bit of both . 
  us and russia seem like total opposites . 
  maybe the people ? 
  there 's idiots from both sides so that 's a similarity haha  4 . 
  i think europe may face a population decline with births falling . 
  same with japan . 
  you can take the train via amtrak or go by air to explore . 
  i would advise hitting up the major cities by air so you can see more and avoid spending all your valuable time to driving ( roadtrips are only good if you have friends or family with you ) . 
  our equivalents to easyjet , ryanair , wizzair are southwest ( best ) , spirit , jetblue , and frontier . 
  christ , you will have it easy in texas . 
  i swear they let anyone drive here . 
  mini coopers are popular . 
   charlotte from what i 've seen , charlotte has some form of public transit train but for the most part , you probably need a bike or take public bus to get around . 
  when you go from east coast to west coast , you will notice how public transit is a bit better in the east than west ( mostly cars ) . 
  there is something called amtrak for trains to get around but for the most part , americans either drive or fly state to state . 
  if you 're looking to go from charlotte to d.c. , new york , or something , our equivalents to easyjet , ryanair , etc are southwest , spirit , frontier , jetblue . 
  it is actually , but i 've been through places in serbia , for example , and it was n't what i expected . 
  balkan food is amazing though . 
  and generally nice people . 
  prague is getting very popular and flooded with tourists nowadays . 
  it 's becoming well known , 
  germans like texas too . 
  but yeah , the temperature may be too uncomfortable . 
  many of us are out here in texas , but if you like colder weather , the northeast or northwest is more for you . 
  i 'm thinking boston , new york , seattle , san francisco . 
  czech republic - my country and where i 'm originally from ( my family immigrated to usa during the 90 's ) . 
  also , beer . 
  poland - opportunities and it 's cheap to live . 
  romania - the women and best internet in the world , of course !, 
  honestly , i think i could live anywhere except the balkans lol, 
  well i 'm czech . 
  dated my fair share including russian women . 
  makeup really does transform women some good , some bad . 
  shoot , fooled me !, 
  police armed to the teeth with `` army police '' defending a monument immediately led me to think of my own country at first . 
  you 'd be hard pressed to believe any of them support putin . 
  also , perms . 
  as for the girls , gorgeous as always but knowing how slavic women are , makeup truly does wonders . 
  take that away and ... it 's something else . 
  i know you 're joking but seriously , slavic women do n't take that shit kindly lol ... they are much like texan women here . 
  good idea , it should help them for employment prospects . 
  or consider a career in the military . 
  not to worry comrade , to them we are all the same ...
