  can / r/europe include large wording on the right side pointing to where to ask travel questions ? 
  been seeing them a lot lately . 
  now that 's more like it !, 
  you have my upvote . 
  really ? 
  i expected us to be near the top of most religious . 
  kind of surprised by south america . 
  catholicism/christianity must still be strong down there . 
  i agree , very good moves towards cuba and iran . 
  for cuba particularly , it gets around 3 million arrivals per year so they could see even way more money from us arrivals . 
  there could be billions made in the travel industry with [ cuba ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/02/investing/cuba-tourism-us-travelers-caribbean/ ) as a partner . 
  putin will lose cuba i think . 
  not sure about iran , they still seem very close to russia despite our reapproachment . 
  the renegotiated sum was 8 billion short of military 's request apparently . 
  still , vast raise in the defense budget that we do n't always hear from sweden . 
  ... am i in a different world ? 
  no one is going `` yurop !, 
  eu is best eu . '', 
  where 's the free healthcare , free education , best police , or highest gdp comments ? 
  comments are kind of ... tame . 
  maybe this will get you guys [ riled up ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/eu+v+russia+in+ukraine+not+oc+credit+to+koleye_291c12_5010770.png ) . 
  still love yurop though < 3, 
  somewhere in there , finland 's `` contribution '' is calculated into the swedish defense budget . 
  [ you forgot poland ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/poland-train-ukraines-fledgling-military-fight-pro-russia-rebels-says-advisor-1827914 ) , too . 
  eubot vs krembot vs ciabot . 
  may the best troll win !, 
  for countries , yeah . 
  for citizen folk like you and me , consider yourself retired in your 20 's . 
  it 's also one of my favorites , 
  if you look very closely , canada also sent the [ hms beaver ] ( http://members.gamedev.net/nordwindranger/images/canada.jpg ) . 
  the country apparently has a bitcoin wallet . 
  the united nations of brittania , columbia , [ canadia ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=canadia ) & commonwealth minus quebec . 
  people outside the western hemisphere are probably like : `` ah westerners , always fighting and bickering amongst themselves . '', 
  i prefer brixit but to each their own . 
  or worst . 
  some swedes were saying it was actually a us or nato submarine trying to scare you guys to joining nato . 
  yes , we want you guys in so badly that we are willing to provoke international outcry . 
  whoa man , the f-35 was never intended to replace the f-22 . 
  it was to [ replace ] ( https://www.f35.com/about ) the harrier , f16 , f18 , and a-10 . 
  it is supposed to be a supplement to the f-22 and eurofighter ( much more capable air superiority fighters ) . 
  no , most hungarian , austrian , and czechs are fine with americans . 
  just learn basic phrases and words before you go . 
  europeans tend to dress business casual from what i recall . 
  and you will be safe to travel alone . 
  watch out for very crowded areas like tram stations where pick pockets are prevalent . 
  in prague , i would watch out for the taxi meter rip off scams but i forget which company that was . 
  only certain companies can be trusted so i 'd do some research on that . 
  also , uber can be used there . 
  no , do n't do the canadian flag thing . 
  american here . 
  please do the same with murican idiots . 
  former soviet countries : fool . 
  russia/serbia : traitor . 
  us/uk/ireland / germany/etc : hero . 
  really hollywood ? 
  shame it 's being downvoted though . 
  gee , i do n't know , i was thinking of maybe a sports car . 
   carpet made of armpit-hair ? '', 
  mankind never ceases to surprise me . 
  we would have no western leverage in the un security council if france and uk do that . 
  but not in estonia . 
  too close to russia . 
  if we threatened to invade cuba in 1962 because of nukes , russia will obviously do the same to estonia if nukes were there . 
  right , but finland and sweden are n't nato members either : / i just ca n't see how russia would try to drag nato into a conflict and make things worse for them unless they attack the baltics too . 
  even the baltics would send troops to finland to fight instead of on their own territory with which we have troops in . 
  russia would be nuts to attack us in the baltics . 
  as you said earlier , it 's all really murky water . 
  i would have taken a car but roller skates are fine too . 
  it was just a reminder that we did n't take the lead on the libya operation  us public opinion was split at the time and obama 's decision to join nato 's bombing was criticised . 
  the way i see it is , nato-eu members will send troops to finland , but those attacks on nato troops do not necessarily mean an attack against nato states ( article 5 ) , unless someone can prove me wrong on that . 
  i have nothing against sweden or finland , nato will definitely send aid , but there is no obligation to their defense unless they are nato members . 
  ukraine and georgia are good examples of this . 
  that 's a loophole if i have ever seen one . 
  either sweden and finland join nato or not join at all . 
  it also does n't mean north america , norway , turkey , and other non-eu members will send troops to finland . 
  our only obligation is to nato territory and sovereignty . 
  sweden and finland will remain the responsibility of the eu . 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  i 'm being downvoted myself . 
  freedom brought by the french and british . 
  we followed this time , 
  look at the history of our countries within the last century or so and the number of innocent lives lost , whether to war , torture , genocide , etc. 
  i do n't have to say anything further . 
  by western standards , germany , russia , and us are the fucked up cousins of the west . 
   there is no way we ( nato ) could stop them from taking over the baltic states . 
  it 's 2015 , where the hell are our mecha robots that shoot unlimited missiles and lasers , japan ? 
  you have to admit , for all the shit they 're getting , you have to admire their tenacity and commitment . 
  this is the answer people . 
  is nato pivoting into the area because it serves turkish interests ? 
  that 's worrying , plays right into russia 's cards that we are expanding ( we do n't , members choose to join us ) . 
  putin burger vs. mcdonalds . 
  i can totally see it now on wikipedia . 
   the ~ ~ cold ~ ~ food war was a state of political and fast food tension after the ukraine crisis between powers in the western bloc ( u.s. , u.k. nato , and others ) and power ( s ) in the eastern bloc ( russia ) . 
  i would bet we are next in line . 
  yes it seems a bit odd but here 's the interesting bit . 
  according to the christmas dinner wiki , it says  virginia has oysters , ham pie , and fluffy biscuits , a nod to its very english 17th century founders . 
  so it has `` very english '' origin apparently . 
  over in north america , it really depends on the region too . 
  english canada has traditional british christmas dinner while french canada has more of the french influence . 
  in the us , it 's mostly british origin surrounding the main course of turkey but with varying degrees of differences based on region .
