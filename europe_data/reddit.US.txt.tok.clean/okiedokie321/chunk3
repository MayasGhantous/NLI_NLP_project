  you need to use alternatives . 
  http://i.imgur.com/llrexbt.png all jokes aside , public opinion will shape the future . 
  there 's growing animosity towards nato and even un membership . 
  there were presidential candidates who advocated for withdrawing all troops at one point . 
  not saying its going to happen now but it will eventually . 
  france left at one point and only until recently got implemented back into nato command in 2009 . 
  what 's to stop the us ? 
  they were even reluctant to engage in wwii . 
  history changes a lot and is very short . 
  if nations were people , each would be diagnosed with bipolar disorder , especially the us . 
  no worries , it 's the internet . 
  they were avenging for the 4th . 
  happy birthday . 
  whoa , calm the assumptions buddy !, 
  ^ andthecontradictions, 
  i hope they do n't . 
  they 're in for a rude awakening once the us leaves nato this century . 
  where is this evidence ? 
  no idea what you 're saying either . 
  based on americans not traveling ? 
  you 're saying we see europe not as homogenous blocks ? 
  i 'm sorry but you 're putting words in my mouth . 
  a lot of condescending talk . 
  ** le tank **, 
  the uk was right to be skeptical of the eu . 
  the eu is a joke . 
  this is great for russia 's force projection into europe . 
  i support this . 
  poland can self rely on their own . 
  they do n't need the divisive eu . 
  * facepalm * i 'm trying to get my fellow englishmen riled up . 
  thanks . 
   that 's ** probably ** coming from young muricans who never visited europe . 
  * assumption * 1 ) american tourists make up a large chunk of tourism in europe . 
  young and old . 
   they ** think ** that white europeans are one big ethnicity - like the americans with european ancestry - and that italy and russia are not any more different than florida and new york . 
  * assumption * 2 ) who said `` italy and russia are no different than florida and new york ? '', 
  is that your assumption based on the american stereotype ? 
  not knowing geography ? 
   because that 's what diversity is all about - having a couple thousand taxi drivers from whateveristan . 
  * assumption * 3 ) yet another assumption , and feigning ignorance at that . 
  there 's a few countries of '' - stan '' out there . 
  and alot of other immigrants besides the `` whateveristan . '', 
  yes , in europe as well . 
  i do n't think you understand the difference between cultural and ethnic diversity , or europe , the continent you live in . 
  let alone common sense . 
  i do n't think this belongs in a european sub-reddit lol . 
  and well , i do n't blame ya . 
  plus , it 's the internet and alot of us are on reddit . 
  to americans in particular , it 's a celebration of the recognition on great britain 's role in the creation of the united states . 
  you have every right to hate or ignore but ... . thank you england . 
  there would have been no america otherwise . 
  some people grow out of video games . 
  i 'm in that phase and probably wo n't know much about video games in the future anymore ... what with life priorities and whatnot . 
  my 12 year old self could have never imagined me saying that lol, 
  i happen to live right by one of the most ethnically diverse [ counties ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/us/what-ethnic-diversity-looks-like-fort-bend.html?_r=0 ) in the us but of course , i 'm not going to say america is the most ethnically or culturally diverse ... because it 's not the whole picture . 
  just like some americans and europeans here do n't get the whole picture . 
  [ canada ] ( http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/05/diverity-map-harvard2.jpg ) is the most ethnically diverse followed by [ america ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/17/article-0-19d63300000005dc-492_964x520.jpg ) then europe . 
  culturally , europe is the most diverse . 
  some of you seem to mix it up it seems - that and combining all whites as one . 
  as for the anti-americanism , i pay no attention to it . 
  alot of it is rooted in foreign policy and media , but speaks nothing of american people . 
  the american stereotype is ingrained into our minds just as much as we think of white flags representing the french ; it 's not always true . 
  that said , we 've had europeans visit and love it here just as much as myself and other americans travelling europe and meeting all sorts of friendly folks . 
  i love europe and the different countries that represent it . 
  my own best bud is norwegian married to a pretty american gal and he was the one to tell me when we first met how he always thought american girls were always lazy and always eating from what he saw in norway . 
  sometimes , facts on the ground are a hell of a lot clearer than what you see on your tv or computer . 
  wow , way to generalize ... 
  fine then !, 
  all the more better !, 
  we 'll leave nato and ally with russia . 
  we 'll antagonize romania together . 
  team us-russia forever !, 
  * hmph *, 
  dang , i have some russian friends here in the us . 
  i will make sure not to antagonize them so mr. putin does n't airdrop spetsnaz shock troops here on us soil . 
  you never answered my questions , that 's what . 
  you have no logical counterargument : what are you doing wrong to cause the ~ ~ military ~ ~ police to want to kill you , in which you 're taking up arms for ? 
  you imply the government is infringing on your interests . 
  what are these interests ? 
  how do you plan to overthrow the government ? 
  where can i find these americans to take on the police and military ? 
  defend themselves ? 
  what are these robbers doing in your house in the first place ? 
  are you saying they have good intentions ? 
  are you going to wait defenselessly or will you fight and call 9-1-1 ? 
  in court , you would win the case because you stood your ground and protected your family and property . 
  hint : the declaration of independence is n't a law . 
  and the amendments help protect citizens . 
  under 18 u.s. code \u00a7 2385 - advocating overthrow of government , you would '' ... be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years , or both , and shall be ineligible for employment by the united states or any department or agency thereof , for the five years next following his conviction . '', 
  where is your uprising ? 
  where are the vast masses of americans who want to overthrow the government ? 
  anyway , what are your interests that the government is infringing upon ? 
  you have right to own guns , right to protest , and so on . 
  or are you unhappy with obama , the potus who you and the people elected by voting ? 
  of course not , but you do n't make alot of sense . 
  the us government has had bad reputation , there 's no denying that . 
  it still does today . 
  they 're not the only ones , though - look at russia , china , or some of our allies . 
  honestly , you have the big brother-is-watching you mentality .
