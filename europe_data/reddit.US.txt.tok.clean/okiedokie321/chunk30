  true . 
  our cousins . 
  to me it just seems like it 's only the president who has a hard on for russia . 
   the lawmaker , ilya gaffner , said in televised comments that his region 's 25 percent inflation rate would `` not [ be ] that bad '' if people learned to control their appetites . 
  wtf what lawmaker says that, 
  how much are they paying ? 
  from a swede , that was actually what he told me about danes . 
  pretty much each scandinavian country says each other 's language sounds like something lodged down their throat , childish , or drunken unless it 's the standard language like on tv ( theres various dialects ) . 
  and then in the end , when nothing could be understood , english is sometimes spoken with varied results . 
  wow , that 's a steal . 
  wow just reading his bio , he was pretty much a us politician too . 
  speaking of bush , cnn did a funny compilation of [ best of the bushisms ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be6tunbrcs8 ) . 
  it 's hilarious :d, 
  can confirm . 
  we would be astonishingly [ grateful ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/11ksqndwt2hjs0/giphy.gif ) and [ shitfaced ] ( http://media3.giphy.com/media/j1janr1vln2sc/200.gif ) . 
  / r/canadia, 
  they keep saying that but nothing 's happened . 
   but people on reddit keep saying it is . 
  sometimes i 'd like to think fox is another arm of rt. 
  they have a hard on for putin and love to compare him , a `` strong man , '' to obama , a `` weak man . '', 
  the baltics seem so nice and friendly , like the canadians . 
  wish we had them as our southern neighbors ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ btw ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ im ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ mexico, 
  no i definitely agree with you , however , i think there should have been , you know , no-fly zones around anti-gaddafi cities and leave that be . 
  let un troops on the ground be the peacemaker . 
  leave nato out of it . 
  well if you ever come back again , you should visit the more popular and fun places like los angeles , las vegas , miami , new york , etc. 
  i went to boston and i agree , i would never go back either . 
   yeah well , the us has always pulled back troops from one war and then started another . 
  if we just sit back and watch isis do their thing , i 'm sure things would 've been worst . 
  but hey i do agree with you about fucked up policy in the middle east . 
  i think obama has been a godsend compared to bush . 
  stopped the wars , ended cuban embargo ... hopefully things just change for the better , learn from our past mistakes , and maintain peace . 
  though it 's unfortunate we have isis to worry about . 
  the film was made by canadians . 
  the iraq war were definitely the dark years for us . 
  definitely was n't a `` good war '' compared to say , desert storm or afghanistan . 
  another bad war was vietnam when we were trying to stop communism . 
  you mean bombing isis was not a good idea ? 
  that 's the current war . 
  they killed british , us , japanese , iraqi , and syrian civilians . 
  who was going to step in : /, 
  did you like your trip ? 
  where did you go ? 
  i do n't mind if europeans led the initiative or americans joined later , i do n't care much for that at all . 
  however , libya is arguably in a worst state than before with its militias roaming around and people trying to flee to italy . 
  i think it was a mistake and the un ( not nato ) should have intervened . 
  us : we plan to send a * whole * calvalry unit for joint exercises . 
  we will also send * a * calvalry unit , with tracksuit . 
  i feel sanders would be better from russia 's perspective . 
  not trump or clinton . 
  we can stream or watch it on youtube , but television will reach a bigger market which is probably good for eurovision . 
  til we drill with [ moldova ] ( http://www.radiochisinau.md/exercitiu_moldo_american_dragon_pioneer_2016_foto-33133# ) . 
  where are the romanians ? 
  france initially left nato because they thought anglosphere 's influence in nato undermined its sovereignty . 
  they rejoined in 2009 to better relations and they saw they could influence nato in their own way . 
  i think the slovenes just gained an ally in sweden for not calling denmark the happiest country . 
  also  wales  better than england shots fired . 
  i thought that was pretty interesting compared to other maps . 
  to be fair , they 're not exactly [ wrong ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/business/international/russian-business-target-of-cypriot-bailout-still-loves-the-island.html ) . 
  for once , a country that does n't call greece broke . 
  it is just `` in crisis . '', 
  imo polish results are more interesting than the japanese , chinese , american , and australian ones we 've seen so far ... despite the inaccuracy . 
   or the downright idiotic french libyan operation that was under eufor command are you sure it was eufor ? 
  i could 've sworn it was nato . 
  this is [ what ] ( https://euobserver.com/opinion/32624 ) i found . 
  and you 're right , it does n't have the ` change-a-dictator ' thing to it , but it still projects eu influence . 
  very popular and also has one of the most visited [ destinations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_paris ) . 
   the paris region received 32.3 million visitors in 2013 , putting it just ahead of london as the world 's top tourist destination region , measured by hotel occupancy . 
   solvakia never heard of that country before . 
  interesting . 
  japan views portugal as weak . 
  china views italy as weak . 
  us views poland as weak . 
  the french withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 without fully quitting . 
  in 2009 , france rejoined as a full member . 
  i suggested we could do the same if it ever comes down to it . 
   swiss being rich so americans can go there to beg nope , you 're right !, 
  defensive agenda is definitely more suitable for germany and poland , for example . 
  it does n't speak for all of the eu though . 
  if you read the european security strategy , it speaks of this :  the document starts out with the declaration that `` europe has never been so prosperous , so secure nor so free '' . 
  its conclusion is that `` the world is full of new dangers and opportunities '' . 
  along these lines , it argues that in order to ensure security for europe in a globalising world , multilateral cooperation within europe and abroad is to be the imperative , because `` no single nation is able to tackle today 's complex challenges '' . 
  as such the ess identifies a string of key threats europe needs to deal with : terrorism , proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , regional conflict , failed states , and organised crime . 
  the eu has military [ operations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_operations_of_the_european_union#/media/file:map_of_eu_interventions_overseas.png ) abroad for a reason . 
  of course it is n't . 
  it depends on who you want to beg . 
  this [ guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nknt9mb.png ) or this [ guy ] ( http://www.polandball.pl/assets/content/551c6b57db8741427925847897.png ) . 
   but what if these troops only have a negative effect ? 
  we send troops , they send troops , we send more troops , they send more troops . 
  well , the idea is to send only a token number of troops . 
  presence is after all , very reassuring . 
  to people in the baltics , nato troops in their country act as a sort of `` trip wire '' for a hypothetical invader . 
  plus , such small number of troops wo n't violate the 1997 nato-russia agreement . 
   there 's only so much armies that have faced decades of relentless austerity can do . 
  so we have to prioritize things , ` reassuring ' the baltics naturally has a lower priority than fighting isis , defending a state like mali or trying to put a stop to the migrant flow . 
  true and that makes it tough , but it sends a good message to a country like lithuania . 
  france asked lithuania to send troops to mali and car , so it is only fitting lithuania can ask for the same of france . 
  actually , germany has been thinking of sending troops to lithuania so that 's something . 
  go to switzerland .
