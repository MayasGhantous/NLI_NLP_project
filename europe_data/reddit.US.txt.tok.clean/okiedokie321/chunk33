  germany should send troops to the baltics and poland to reassure them . 
  they still think germany will not help them if a `` hybrid war '' spills out . 
  germany would gain the hearts and minds of those people if they deploy there , plus those countries are tied to nato and eu which germany is also apart of . 
  if germany can send troops to turkey and build an airbase in turkey , why not baltics and poland ? 
  what is this bias ? 
   why would they do it now with their mostly outdated and under-equipped army and a military budget half of the uk 's and france combined ? 
  i agree with you on all parts except this . 
  no one in the world should underestimate russia . 
  their budgets look small , but the salaries for their soldiers and other expenses are also small . 
  they can make planes on a cheaper budget than the west can . 
  they have clearly shown that they are able to expand to syria , ukraine , the caucaus , and the arctic . 
  they have the troop numbers and vehicles that the uk and france would only dream of . 
  they are pioneers in space exploration despite their small budgets . 
  westerners should not underestimate russia . 
  it is not some north korean shithole people make it out to be . 
  we make up a huge chunk of nato , but it does n't necessarily mean we * are * nato . 
  did western europe envision us to be as strong when they decided to include us into nato ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  there 's also a reason why nato 's hq is in brussels and not new york . 
  you do n't get it - he 's pointing the finger at norway . 
  i think we buy most of our small arms from fabrique nationale d'herstal ( belgium ) also . 
  though , nothing comparable to what we sell to europe , like planes and drones . 
  that 's a good question actually . 
  many countries in europe are still alot safer than say , south korea which understandably still has a us military presence . 
  can you tell me what these [ removed ] comments were about ? 
  i did n't get a chance to read them nor receive a new message notification . 
  yes , still private citizens . 
  it 's nice they could be able to afford that . 
  we also have to take into account the differences in how europe wants to defend itself too . 
  western europe does n't see a need to increase defense spending . 
  in the east and southeast , there is a need to increase defense spending due to ukraine and the syria conflict ( you might say turkey is not in the eu , but they are a nato member ) . 
  i do n't necessarily think mr. obama is correct with the defense spending bit . 
  rather , i think he should have said that europe ( mainly western europe except the uk ) needs to commit more political will to military matters on the account of members in the eu and nato facing heightened tensions . 
   20-40 million . 
  wow , and these are private citizens i 'm assuming ? 
  must be nice to afford that ... 
  you mean nato . 
  * technically , * it was france that started it which later dragged my country in along with many other european countries . 
  everyone got a bat and started gang banging on libya pretty much . 
  this is the one event i believe nato was misused . 
  the funny shit is , italy 's berlusconi ( his country is closest to libya ! ), 
  wanted nothing of it and was initially against intervention . 
  he would later be proven right had the west not intervene , as we can see what 's going on in the mediterranean now . 
  makes sense , you ca n't just give asylum to everyone or else everyone will start crying for asylum and/or making false claims . 
  further , you need evidence that they served with lithuanian troops and that takes time to review . 
  that 3rd [ picture ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/04/25/96286601_obama_news-large_trans++eo_i_u9apj8ruoebjoaht0k9u7hhrjvuo-zlengruma.jpg ) in the article pretty much sums up what the europeans think of obama 's concerns . 
   it filled gaps in its budget for years by taking paying tourists into space . 
  that 's awesome . 
  space tourism , heh . 
  i wonder how much it cost . 
   i 'm starting to hate the environment because of them . 
  that 's a bit much . 
  they just have the wrong leaders and people in place . 
  that 's an interesting bit of geopolitics . 
  the uk also sent troops to the baltics . 
  funny enough , the kurds [ speculated ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/22/from-the-frontlines-of-assad-s-strike-on-the-kurds.html ) that isil was coordinating with assad when they attacked the kurds . 
  we need to give them our surplus f-16 's . 
  it 's probably cheaper in the long run and a bigger deterrent than 2 planes . 
  i think this is good news . 
  the green party will fall apart even quicker now . 
  excellent . 
  hopefully , mankind can colonize the moon and mars without any setbacks . 
  we 're one step closer to the death star now . 
   canada and denmark have yet to fully settle issues over hans island ( it is canadian ) so i doubt there would be any co-operation . 
  have you seen this [ site ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/14m9sg/free_hans_island_from_the_evil_canadian/ ) ? 
  it 's hilarious . 
   i understand the us is in a sticky spot when it comes to international waters but we will probably lose the case to russia in the end . 
  the reality is that the current canadian government is moving the arctic onto the backburner it seems so russia will be able to back up its claims with military vessels and development and canada will just continue to say we think it is ours . 
  i think we will press the issue in the arctic council , but as it is , we barely have 2 icebreaker ships while russia has a whole fleet . 
  not only are we in a tough spot about international waters , but we ca n't back any claim with just 2 icebreakers . 
  there needs to be cooperation between canada and denmark , and possibly with norway if you want to have any chance at claims . 
  edit : apparently , there is [ something ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/canada-denmark-should-turn-hans-island-into-a-condominium-academics-1.3315640 ) in the works between denmark and canada . 
  yeah , we probably should . 
  i guess we are n't , because it would set the precedent that the south china sea belongs to china and we would be accused of hypocrisy because we claim that as international waters . 
  you should read [ this ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/russias-new-claim-to-north-pole-puts-pressure-on-canada-expert-says/article25838454/ ) , i think it is pretty interesting what the arctic is slowly becoming to be . 
  best thing for canada to do is work with the danes , because apparently the danes themselves have laid stake to the entire continental shelf just north of greenland , but i do n't know how possible that is when canada is next door . 
  then i think it is the arctic and possible clashes with russia . 
  there 's definitely an upcoming flashpoint there . 
  russia 's perspective i can somewhat understand but ...  china also has a legitimate point in these disputes . 
  there are many countries bickering with china over islands - boat rammings and all . 
  it 's just not the same . 
  by their logic that south * china * sea belongs to china , does that mean the entire gulf of * mexico * belongs to mexico ? 
  how can you blame the italians when the french fucking destabilized libya ? 
  do n't be a hypocrite . 
  we 'll always be a target , that 's for sure . 
  definitely , i agree . 
  we 'll always hold the highest body count in the western world due to islamic terrorism . 
  after 9/11 however , we placed a high degree of emphasis on our security apparatus , so it does n't happen again . 
  we even went as far as making it more difficult for canadians to cross borders and we never had problems with them before . 
  * after 9/11 . 
  they 'd be really going out of their way to get into the us , seems a bit far fetched imo . 
  the british empire had a fondness for moats in its colonies/commonwealth as well . 
  just look at canada , us , australia , and nz . 
  no shit, 
  / u/ltburtreynolds either suffers from victim mentality or is [ victim playing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victim_playing ) . 
  ca n't really tell . 
  in any case , reddit is not healthy for him . 
  i hate americans with a victim complex . 
  we get it already . 
  just stop .
