  i agree , that is pretty dumb . 
  we can project and make a better fighter aircraft than the f-22 in the future . 
  it will be surpassed at one point in time . 
  itt : never would have thought i 'd see an army of americans defending the european union against europeans . 
   lets be real your daughters are in no danger of being homeles or hungry , for many of us however that danger is all to real . 
  that 's true , but he is a politician . 
  europeans have safety nets to prevent being homeless and poor . 
  in america , we have minimal safety net . 
   america and israel is behind everything and they are doing these things to keep turkey/muslim community in the middle east under control . 
  america and israel used to have very good relations with turkey before . 
  argh , right in the kisser !, 
  just had to rub it in , huh netherlands ? 
  absolutely , we are severely lacking in the anti-submarine department . 
  at one point , we even [ leased ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gotland-class_submarine ) sweden 's gotland-class submarines for training and to study diesel-electric subs . 
  definitely not the first time the french `` sunk '' our ships . 
  it happened in [ 1998 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_submarine_casabianca_ ( s603 ) as well . 
  carrier groups have also been `` sunk '' by swedish , australian , canadian , south korean , japanese , german and dutch subs in similar war games . 
  it 's a great way to study tactics and see what works in naval warfare . 
  it does n't even matter . 
  i predict the us , eu , and china are going to fluctuate in various spots in the top 3 . 
  probably leaning towards china as # 1 , however, 
  `` alright , mr. 
  controller . 
  i 'll teach you to flirt with my wife ... '', 
  by taking denmark , they also get greenland  and all island territories of france , uk , nl , etc. 
  the fourth reich is back !, 
  * mistake later found * `` alright , who 's the intern ? '', 
  japan : gundam, 
  maybe in 2150 . 
  today , japan needs us against china and turkey needs us against russia . 
  sounds like an interesting book though . 
  there 's probably some gundams inside . 
  brutal . 
   who 's this guy ? 
  i do n't know what it is , but kill it with fire !, 
  burn it alive !, 
  does he not receive a diploma for going to this school ? 
  if i 'm an employer , i would give fuckall about where he went to school . 
  i would care about whether he knows his shit . 
  there are people who half-assed their way through university and learn nothing out of it unfortunately . 
  well ... now we can add johnson and farage to the idiot podium along with trump . 
  just because obama thinks that way does n't mean all of america thinks that way . 
  it 's just one event . 
  one event wo n't decide who is better in intelligence gathering . 
  there are pros and cons to both continents . 
  one thing i noticed about americans is that patriotism can rob us blind . 
  we are an overly prideful people . 
  edit : i 'm getting downvoted by americans but it 's the truth . 
  the last part was fine and all , but before all that was a hell lot of cringe . 
  we are not a young country , our constitution is just the oldest and longest surviving . 
  our culture is young , yes . 
  also , we are not a nation of warriors . 
  those are big words coming from somebody who has n't served in the military but talks high and mighty . 
  more and more americans are no longer serving in the military . 
  something like less than 0.5 percent of the population serve in the military today . 
  that number used to be 12 percent during wwii . 
  the divide between civilians and the military are also evidently increasing . 
  many americans can not even tell the national guard from the u.s. army , or can name all of our uniformed service branches like the obscure ones . 
  you can have this w. just this once . 
  i agree , this only drew more flak for him . 
  however , he 's definitely been anti-british so the hatred for him has merit . 
  see [ here ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:phgvkpzru7kj:blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/nilegardiner/100088961/barack-obama-top-ten-insults-against-britain-2011-edition/+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk ) and [ here ] ( http://capx.co/president-obamas-brexit-intervention-insults-the-british-people/ ) . 
  we really need to stop pushing this whole special relationship thing with the uk . 
  it 's embarrassing for them and makes them look like some 2nd rate country just tagging along with the us . 
  we do n't even say this about canada and i consider them a closer country to us than the uk ever will be . 
  according to some articles , he 's been the most anti-british us president in recent times . 
  the uk absolutely hates the man . 
  that is so deathly ignorant . 
  shamed to have you as a countryman . 
  i agree . 
  i do wonder what other brexit news we 'll get though . 
  it 's gotten really interesting lately , with june around the corner . 
  absolutely , we 're [ surrounded ] ( http://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2011/04/feature-3312.jpg ) on all sides !, 
  sorry i 'm just naming the news events surrounding brexit , and calling it all absurd . 
  no dishonesty here . 
  do n't want to go into an argument , but here 's the [ gist ] ( http://time.com/3633514/why-wont-america-go-metric/ ) of it . 
  i 'd say our system of using both metric and imperial units is fine . 
  australia can be the joker , because you know , criminals and all ... kiwi can be harley quinn . 
  we can never go to war with the brits today . 
  do you know how obsessed we are with the royal family , tabloids and all ? 
  plus , that 's like usa invading canada . 
  that 's just something that does not happen . 
  it just does n't . 
  this is * absurd * . 
  irish pm is urging citizens to make a pro-eu case to uk relatives . 
  president obama voices his opinion that the uk should remain in the eu . 
  then we have france 's marine le pen campaigning ** for ** brexit . 
  you ca n't make this up . 
  edit : made the * absurd * comment in light of the brexit articles we 're getting lately , because of june around the corner . 
  things have gotten ... interesting ... 
  haha , at least we did n't appropriate `` carbonara '' and set off the wrath of italians on the net  edit : looks like you lot ca n't take a joke ... 
  well , either way , we have good friends in europe . 
  i agree . 
  i must 've missed that tidbit . 
   not donate when natural disasters hit . 
  it has not only been donations though . 
  on the fourth reich : they were doing well , until the migrant crisis and things like brexit . 
  i think there is too much bickering between countries . 
  there is no sense of european unity that i used to get before . 
  but make no mistake , the fourth reich will hold .
