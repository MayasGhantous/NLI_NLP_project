  whatever the case , the u.s. is very slow to respond to these kinds of matters . 
  we ought to copy what canada does so we do n't get too far behind . 
  they 're a good role model for us . 
  nah , we salute them for arming up , meeting defense commitments , and taking care of their own country 's defense , rather than let their military rot . 
  that 's the best allied nation you can ever ask for . 
  what the eu needs to do is negotiate so we can streamline our visa waiver process and/or add more eu countries to the program . 
  the problem is on our end . 
  yup  ), 
   david bowie resurrected . 
  i 'll have to agree . 
  yes . 
  you have only 3 wishes . 
  choose carefully ( and it has to be europe-related since we 're in / r/europe ) . 
  i 've been summoned !, 
  brexit the nightmare ? 
  the title is wrong . 
  it 's the eu . 
  incredibly right-wing with the possibility of civil war somewhere . 
  britain will leave . 
  norway and iceland will stay out of the eu . 
  increase in security presence . 
  divide between communities due to religion , race , etc. 
  still first world and better to live in than other places though .

  if visas are imposed , that 's good news for us , canada , iceland , and norway , no ? 
  we 'll just spend more tourist money in our countries . 
  czech m8 !, 
  well , i 'm a u.s. citizen and i live here so ... 
  american women are more willing to do it though . 
  hell , they 're a lot easier than european women from my experience ( i 'm czech ) . 
  well , the english are a bit condescending , i admit . 
  i have no problems with canadians and scots , however . 
  russia is not a bad country . 
  the eu should federalize in that case . 
  it would be the most powerful nation in the world . 
  neither does brussels . 
  iirc , the patriot systems were removed as to not escalate tension with russia . 
  i do agree about the visa liberalization , however . 
  we are so damn expensive even for our own citizens , sadly . 
  we really have a thing against nazi germany . 
  i have to do this for global entry anyway . 
  well , minus the sperm sample . 
  * is that what that glove is for ? 
  ... sigh ... unzips ... * american men before boarding . 
  ... they probably would n't mind . 
  of course not . 
  some states , especially in the south , are like war zones for the drug cartels and gangs . 
  agreed . 
  japan is a hell of a lot safer than some of the countries i 've been to on that list that rank higher than it . 
  in some states it 's not safe compared to other places . 
  in other states , it is very safe . 
  it depends on where you live . 
  your experience does n't speak for other people . 
  here you go : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dsdtc/the_attitudes_of_the_romanians_toward_other/, 
  fair point . 
  i have seen british redditors argue that the eu would be using the british army while contributing little of their own , which is understandably unfair . 
  an eu border garrison force does seem like a sound idea . 
  on the one hand , the u.s. does benefit from extending western hegemony and american interests to the eastern borders of europe . 
  i 'm sure we do n't mind it as much , unless politics dictate otherwise . 
  on the other hand , this is detrimental to the eu 's military capabilities . 
  i feel like the eu battlegroup is not being properly utilized , because of us . 
  however , if this was the uk ( or france ) , leading the eu militarily in the east , we could see the development of an eu army in the works . 
  i 'm not sure how receptive the uk would be to that , however . 
  will do . 
  no worries . 
  prior convos ? 
  who are you referring to ? 
  i love usa but i know this country is not some pure country that you make it out to be . 
  / u/bloodysneeze brought up vietnam . 
  you made it out that we were defending all of vietnam ( against whom ? ) . 
  / u / _ cyrilfiggis _ brings you down to reality and explains the truth about vietnam and why we really were there . 
  you then try to save face . 
  another commenter said you do not understand what american exceptionalism even means ( which started your whole argument ) . 
  that 's the gist of it . 
  the uk , france , every european country is complicit in all of this , from libya to afghanistan . 
  western intervention has been going on for centuries . 
  we are all at fault here . 
  this is something the eu could really work with , but it seems it has n't come across their minds . 
  man that 's shitty, 
   a 14-year-old girl complains , `` when i play with my cell phone , they tell me to be quiet . 
  but why ? '', 
  because they 're a quiet people and you 're being a loud child . 
  bush should be hanged . 
   last but not least , anime . 
  we like anime . 
  i 'm not even kidding . 
  it is one way for japan to dominate the world i suppose . 
  russia is laughing at all of this . 
  you have us beat on the czech , polish , and romanian polls too . 
  the eu and usa are at a point of no return . 
  it 's not looking to good . 
  japan is the most impressive of the bunch , because from what i understand , japan and russia have island and other disputes , yet russians view japan as majorly positive . 
  france and germany , good job . 
  a country with eu aspirations should not be rejected . 
  they just need reform and progress all of which takes time . 
  good on them for seeing ukraine for what it is . 
  universal basic income , free housing , and education for more than 300 million people is not sustainable . 
  the system needs tweaking , but nothing as drastic as that . 
  it 's inflation and globalism at play . 
  free housing and education is great and all , but is it sustainable ?
