  there is no counter-thesis . 
  i said i agreed and wish we could take in more , but we wo n't change our screening process just to take in more refugees/economic migrants . 
   claiming that , many are also coming because of the economic reasons does not change anything since they 're able to come because of the ongoing syrian civil war . 
  yes , which were a combination of factors that started it all , including arab spring , protest uprising , civil war , and later isis , merkel invitation , and economic reasons . 
  weird , is n't it ? 
  the refugee stream comes from iraq too , so by your logic earlier , danish bombing also contributed to the iraqi refugees coming to europe , just like us bombing and weapons . 
  your country is still complicit in all of this . 
   we have to stop the refugee stream somehow and the us is not going to help . 
  thanks so denmark . 
  thanks for [ promising ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/20160212/denmark-promises-us-to-go-hard-after-isis ) the us to go hard after isis too . 
  i am sure a handful of jets and 30-50 special forces troops will make all the difference in stopping the refugee stream . 
  yes , we should n't have to look at other factors that are contributing to the refugee stream . 
  you guys are brilliant . 
  i love denmark even more now . 
  maybe , but so are you . 
  i went by your logic that us has been `` occupying '' germany since 1945 , yet greenland has been `` occupied '' since 1940 . 
  here , you argue that it is necessary as part of a missile defense system . 
  you are a hypocrite . 
  it is `` occupying '' either way , in that case . 
   just wait until the next election is due and then remember this comment . 
  i will definitaly think of yours . 
  what is this ? 
  is this goodbye ? 
   we should also support assad it 's too late . 
  we had a chance to support him in suppressing the protests in 2011 , but we did n't . 
  now syrians coming to europe are blaming assad more than isis , though we know they are coming for economic factors , and not just for safety . 
  if those western ( and russian sources ) are true , then i will not argue with it . 
  the new cold war is really brewing . 
  what ? 
  as if not sending jets to iraq does not affect syria ? 
  plus , soon there will be . 
  have you not paid attention to your country ? 
  [ denmark to send f-16s and troops into syria ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/20160304/denmark-to-send-f-16s-and-special-troops-into-syria ), 
  still `` occupying '' greenland either way . 
  we appreciate everything britain has done for us . 
  really , we do . 
  but he is merely saying that britain and france were `` free riders '' in libya . 
  i do not understand how you went from one man suggesting that the uk was a `` free rider '' to `` fuck you , america has no allies '' , etc. 
  no , our mistake was being involved in the first place . 
  obama should n't have joined in . 
  even congress was not supportive of him . 
  why even bug them ? 
  what threat do they pose ? 
  he just mentioned earlier . 
  we will leave if asked , just like france asked us to leave . 
  we have closed several bases in germany last year too , so the number of troops are less now . 
  did you know we have bases in denmark and greenland too ? 
  if denmark asks , we will leave . 
  wrong actually . 
  you forget estonia and uk . 
  poland never met the 2 % . 
  yes , just a normal day in us . 
  i even took a selfie with a head i found on the sidewalk . 
  of course not , because the frequency of nato planes flying in or near russian borders is minimal at best , in contrast to the other side . 
  just a quick google search shows your country complaining about russian planes and ships a countless number of times . 
  it had adblock . 
   he would have needed to pay some small bribes . 
  knowing some folks , they 'd want to drive in an apc too and risk getting shot at then pay the bribes . 
  now kith, 
  and drake !, 
  i think it 's really cool you do n't need a passport to visit puerto rico . 
  you can experience a bit of the carribbean that way . 
  but its expensive as fuck though . 
  i really did n't mean it !!, 
  :( ... plus , you 're hardly backwards !, 
  yes , i would in a heartbeat !, 
  hack them back . 
  people like drama , is my guess . 
  i tend to agree , but what does this have to do with / thread . 
   you cause the civil war in syria to be much worse . 
  what ? 
  your country was not complicit in the bombing either ? 
  why are there danish jets there too ? 
  we know that syrian refugees are blaming [ assad or isis ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/survey-leaves-no-doubt-syrians-are-fleeing-assad/a-18775789 ) , but we also know that they are leaving because of [ economic factors ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/560523f26.html ) , according to the un . 
  it is not just conflict or lack of safety anymore they are fleeing from . 
   that is how many lands in italy and greece each weekend during the summer . 
  i agree , we need to take in more , but we are not going to opt out of our screening process . 
  [ the isolated chancellor : what is driving angela merkel ? 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/why-has-angela-merkel-staked-her-legacy-on-the-refugees-a-1073705.html ) good insight if you wish to read . 
   coming from the country that does n't take a single refugee/migrant . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  hell , i 'm from a family of migrants . 
  we 're slated to get 10k syrian refugees over the year . 
  even texas admits [ refugees ] ( https://atlas.qz.com/charts/njqbewsnl ) , with [ syrians ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-refugees-texas-iduskcn0vi02f ) slowly trickling in , against the wishes of some states . 
  i 'm not sure what else you expect us to do when we have a [ long process ] ( https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/11/20/infographic-screening-process-refugee-entry-united-states ) of vetting in people . 
  we can not just take them in by the millions and not screen them . 
  what are some italian banks that you would recommend ? 
  probably not , but i think we can be on par with the uk . 
  it 's just americans are incredibly selfish and willing to pay the big banks fees just to keep the `` relationship '' with said bank . 
  if you want no minimum balances and no maintenance requirements in the us , online banks like [ ally ] ( https://www.ally.com/bank/interest-checking-account/ ) and [ barclays ] ( https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/index.html ) are the way to go . 
  some even reimburse you for atm fees worldwide . 
  but there are no physical branches . 
  i can say that more and more americans are staying away from the big national banks and opting for credit unions ( smaller local banks ) that also have no fees or maintenance requirements . 
  they all pool in together and share a system similar to the uk 's link called [ co-op ] ( http://co-opfs.org/media/36401/shared_branch_vsbanks_infographic_021016.pdf ) . 
  she 's a tough willed woman , a lot tougher than some guys i know . 
  hope she is released . 
  i want to say uk but they are n't quite as backwards . 
  so that leaves only turkey , poland , and maybe russia . 
  are you me ? 
  i fantasise about being a british commonwealth .
