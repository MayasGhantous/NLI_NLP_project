  we could use an nhs here , and we still obviously love the royalty ( just look at the tabloids ) . 
  signed . 
  a loyalist in hiding . 
  probably helps that we are both hated by western europe . 
  ... and then there 's incidents like this where you should n't skip the line . 
  sorry to hear that . 
  it 's a shame russia is not in nato . 
  all this `` paranoia '' would disappear in an instant . 
  nato fucked up . 
  because of nato , someone died . 
  if nato did not have an exercise , there would have been no death . 
  1:16 - guy just skips the line . 
  smart . 
  and no potholes . 
  i would say 100k/year ( unless you live in nyc or rich area , then 200k/year ) . 
  but i tend to agree with everything you said . 
  likewise , i 'd want to live in europe if i was middle class or making small amount of money . 
  social safety nets are much more secure in europe . 
  you underestimate the men . 
  why around age thirty ? 
  just curious . 
   you need nato or a united european response for that . 
  if article 42.7 is anything to go by , you would get a token amount of support and some troops ( e.g. 
  a troop or two sent to mali in support of france from luxembourg ) . 
  the problem i see with a united european response is that the eu does not yet have a federalized army . 
  nato is only slightly better because you have non-eu members like usa and norway . 
  nato is a decent solution for the meantime while we wait on the eu . 
  interesting information and makes plausible sense , thank you !, 
  right in the feels !, 
  love how this gets downvoted . 
  on strike !, 
  so british gets downvoted and monaco gets up voted ? 
  hmm . . 
  how did they end up in the u.s. ? 
  hopefully the french will tag along . 
  he must come back . 
  the anti-emp . 
  wew , this is another contender for best navy . 
  hard to pick . 
  damn you dicaprio ... 
  they win . 
  hardcore pagans are cool . 
  living the life !, 
  those we call weeaboo . 
  it will be interesting to see how the italians perceive starbucks ' frappuccinos . 
  [ a guide to italian coffee : sugar is optional , frappuccino does not exist ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/17/an-italian-guide-to-coffee-sugar-is-optional-frappuccino-does-not-exist ), 
  fun fact : the [ hawaiian pizza ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hawaiian_pizza ) was not actually invented in hawaii , but in canada . 
  i read this and thought we were in polandball for a second ... 
  lithuania for the win !, 
  but we need their cooperation to stop the migrants coming into europe too . 
  plus , you know , turkey being in a strategic geopolitical position and all ... 
  it goes both ways i think . 
  but i tend to agree they need us slightly more than we need them . 
  that would only increase chance of war with greece and open the floodgates to europe . 
  we 'll just brain drain each other . 
  it will all balance out . 
  she was probably going through a rebellious phase . 
  one of these days , she 'll post on / r/blunderyears . 
   future belongs to east . 
  true , i do see eastern europe flourishing and being prosperous . 
  this is actually a wise travel tip . 
  nothing , it wo n't do a dent . 
  but at least the migrants will be happy there . 
  great weather , sunny , good food , great atmosphere . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  civilians probably throw stuff at the nato soldiers . 
  poland 4 the poles !, 
  whoa , french circle jerk in here . 
  and that frigate is sexy . 
  wow . 
  we might have to buy from the french one of these days . 
  is the mistral compatible with the f-35b version that hovers ? 
  it could turn into an aircraft carrier ... 
  america would welcome this . 
  yes , sanction your greatest export partner . 
  russia is part of europe , is it not ? 
  we 're all about honor , that 's us . 
  that was the one . 
  man that pilot went way low . 
  i like it , especially the realistic footage part . 
  sof is badass . 
  i tend to agree . 
  the [ air force ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/470vt5/reurope_show_off_your_countrys_militaryspecial/d09w337 ) does it pretty well imo though !, 
  i like the `` sign up for nordic battlegroup '' one . 
  i ca n't find it on yt , but it showed a car horn in sweden blaring loudly , then switches over to one in real warzone . 
  fireworks in stockholm , then switches to explosions in a real warzone . 
  i thought it was realistic and great . 
  this wins , hands down . 
  the best us commercials are from the us air force . 
  want something [ cod-like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izyan7xdfys ) ? 
  [ explosions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql958em6x14 ) ? 
  presidential [ speeches ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rj9-fmxbug ) ? 
  even the us air force guys themselves do videos pretty well :d [ i got u - duke dumont parody ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddu3hunlk0u ), 
  nice !, 
  i would join if this played on tv . 
  too bad it 's not an actual tv ad . 
  that new ad is n't very popular , it got downvoted to bits . 
  the british army commercials are some of the best military ads i 've ever seen , especially the slow-mo version . 
  this is worth the read , from a swedish perspective on / r/financialindependence .
