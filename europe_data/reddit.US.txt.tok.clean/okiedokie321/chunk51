  not really major . 
  it does n't affect the sanctions that the us , un , and eu lifted earlier . 
  itt : romania making everyone feel bad lol, 
  i like the different colors . 
  now , everyone move to scotland !, 
  a very refreshing post in / r/europe . 
  basically , we have to throw money at the turks and see what happens . 
  they released our people and we struck a nuclear deal . 
  we think they 're okay , until proven otherwise . 
  we 'll let history dictate our decisions . 
  this is weird . 
  [ continue the chain ] china investigates rule of law in us . 
  japan investigates rule of law in china . 
  from my experience on youtube pertaining to the balkans , the psychological warfare started from youtube comments . 
  if anything , that 's a good thing . 
  the eu and us should not be like some married couple in international politics . 
  holy shit , i had a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment , because you were top comment in this thread and top comment in this [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40tu7d/estonian_dutch_and_us_military_practicing_for/cyx22nv ) . 
  i think it was the u.s. army link you posted , which made me think ... `` wait , i saw this before . '', 
  poor sweden, 
  we 'll send chicago to join the union . 
  slava america, 
  interesting . 
  so our training buddies are the finns while the uk has norway ? 
  who 's matched with sweden then ? 
  i think he 's referring to that it was posted before . 
  i could 've sworn i read this before . 
  amazing !, 
  oil . 
  rich . 
  oil . 
  beautiful . 
  oil . 
   slava putin made me spit my coffee haha, 
  i thought russia responded to protect russian troops after georgia attacked . 
  germans are very efficient , even their [ soldiers ] ( https://youtu.be/gnymze-yfd8?t=26s ) . 
  i do , gop hates him for making the party look bad . 
  he wo n't hesitate to go against them . 
  i foresee trump embracing putin . 
  i hope he does n't get elected . 
  let 's not make it a space race . 
  i 'm not surprised by the nordics and netherlands . 
  they speak even better english than us . 
  i have a dutch friend who speaks perfect english with an american accent even . 
  very rarely does the amsterdam region accent come out . 
  what surprises me the most is that they speak english at a high profiency and keep their mother tongue . 
  edit : am i really being downvoted for praising you guys ? 
  lol, 
  they are becoming part of anglosphere . 
  i laughed . 
  i prefer work ethic of greece or spain to be honest . 
  his life turned around . 
  well done . 
  you have to hand it to him . 
  he 's a good man . 
  at least it would look good and driveable in norway . 
  i hope she seeks victim protection . 
  fuck these pc fanatics . 
   anthropophobia interesting , never knew there was a word for it . 
  it is kind of the same here also , but we have adhd and like to chat . 
  it 's like we have adhd or something . 
  kind of like nato , eh ? 
  the europeans ( precisely the british ) founded a western european defense alliance , which eventually led to the idea of including the us - that led to nato . 
  now we hold a good degree of influence in the organization today . 
  sounds homely . 
  wwi , wwii , balkans , ukraine , and others . 
  not including centuries of war before the 1900s . 
  i agree , it is getting annoying . 
  good morning !, 
  think they 're referring to the recent events on / r/europe , hence `` the final countdown . '', 
  i did n't get it at first either . 
  we should accept all puppets for fairness and balance . 
  thanks trump 's grandfather ... 
  do n't think he was targeted specifically , but he was at an [ event ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/may/04/two-gunmen-shot-dead-in-texas-outside-muhammad-cartoon-exhibition-rolling-coverage ) where two gunmen showed up . 
  and vomit everywhere on the cobblestone . 
  sounds very simple . 
  in the u.s. , very complex and not good if you 're poor . 
  i was under the impression that german students have free tuition and fees . 
  do you get subsidies ? 
  but if i am not mistaken , you get a housing and health insurance subsidy , correct ? 
  if we 're lucky , a nursing home on mars !, 
  yeah the usd and euro go a long way there . 
  more money to drink . 
  wow pegida just went full retard . 
  do you have the thread ? 
  i want to read the french reactions . 
  holy shit , you were n't kidding . 
  xd  luxembourg is to send a * second * soldier to mali to help in the fight against the islamic state , in response to an appeal for solidarity from france . 
  that was 2008 , however . 
  2016 russia is pretty lean and improved . 
  well , minus the economy . 
  i agree with you except for ukraine . 
  they already had euromaidan , made moves to join , hold deep eu aspirations , and currently have a civil war . 
  what is the eu going to do ? 
  turn their backs on ukrainian ? 
  the problem with the eu is [ mismanagement ] ( http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/how-european-union-corrupted-eastern-europe ) of funding to eastern states . 
  that 's not entirely eastern europe 's fault . 
  not to mention i did say in a different thread you need to give these guys time to root out corruption and such . 
  the economies of [ poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_poland ) and [ czech republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_czech_republic ) , for example , are strong . 
  they will pull their own weight within the eu soon . 
  they wont mess with nato obviously , i mean look at what turkey [ did ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q1a1e5y.png ) .
