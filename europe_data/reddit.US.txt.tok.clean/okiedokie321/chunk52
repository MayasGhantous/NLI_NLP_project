  russia has eastern europe on lockdown , both air and ground . 
  this is why you want to avoid war with russia . 
  because they can literally steamroll across europe with thousands of tanks and shoot down all us/european air assets with their s-300s / s-400s . 
  edit : i 'm not a russian shill , just saying the truth . 
  ... oh ... so that was what it was . 
  i think we uh , used the last stockpile in syria ... 
  anyway , that 'd be [ cheating ] ( http://youtu.be/zfqbjgcjyfk ) !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ around ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 1:30, 
  if i start a gun range school , shooting at the nato banner ... 
  so what are some cool perks of serbian citizenship ? 
   what . . god i 'm devastated . 
  your mind is deep , my friend . 
  for a drunk , not bad . 
  managed to write all that and even edit 20 minutes ago . 
  they are not like us canada . 
  what are those parties stances ? 
  i have heard horrible stories from romanians during soviet days . 
  things were rough during the transition too , but today romania is in much better condition . 
  still a disparity with west eu but it is better , is it not ? 
  moldova , on the other hand . . 
  same over here . 
  owners who had affected vehicles by the scandal had substantial discounts on new vehicles . 
  next time i should search terms like `` putin '' before posting . 
  the way the refugee crisis was handled mostly . 
  i 'm all for an eu army and pro-federalist myself ( maybe not as of late ) , but it will be some time before that happens . 
  for now , nato will make do . 
  not attack , but send in `` little green men . '', 
  if there is a loophole in a nato country , putin would no doubt take advantage . 
  `` leave britain alone ! '', 
  you say that , but someone played the empire theme song when labour politicians were walking out of session . 
  if i was n't on mobile , i 'd post it . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  now i know why germans are not [ patriotic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cip7rf7.png ) . 
  because of stuff like this . 
  people always pulling the nazi card . 
  nah , we 'd just hand over cash , cross our fingers , and hope for the best . 
  dammit , vw is going against the german stereotype of ordnung . 
  sorry , i am not in your shoes to understand the smug complaints . 
  but hey , on the bright side it seems they complain about russia more than west eu . 
  well ... shit . 
  i was tired , sorry . 
  too bad german and italian luxury cars wo n't be any cheaper . 
  oh well , more nutella for me !, 
  and the european kind please , not the sugary one from canada . 
  ah , but it is legitimate ukrainian soil . 
  the ukrainian government fully cooperated with the nederlands . 
  the dutch could very well send in troops/investigators . 
  the problem was contested territory . 
  i partially disagree . 
  russia was in denial of any troops in ukraine to begin with . 
  logistically , the dutch are capable of it . 
  politically , they could n't stomach it . 
  the end result is this : [ micromanagement ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10992799/australian-and-dutch-forces-prevented-from-taking-control-of-mh17-crash-site.html ) by a government not even universally recognized . 
  you had to agree to * their * terms to do an investigation over the deaths of * your * own countrymen . 
  that 's fucking humiliating . 
  let 's face it , russia was definitely in an * oh shit * moment when mh17 happened - it withdrew its military assets and was waiting for a strong western retaliatory response . 
  but [ nothing happened ] ( http://img10.deviantart.net/f737/i/2015/217/c/8/____but_nothing_happened__by_karret-d949trs.png ) . 
  this is why putin can get away with things and deny , because we are all about inaction . 
  it probably does n't help the uk and us did nothing after the budapest memoradum violation . 
  i think the dutch should have secured the crash site with their troops . 
  it would 've sent a strong message to putin - but then again , the separatists field more tanks and vehicles than the dutch army . 
  it is sad , but those soldiers will get away with this and the deaths of mh17 will not be avenged . 
  you can only hope one day someone will feel guilty and step forward . 
  we need more unbiased alternative media , with the likes of vice . 
  this western political correctness bullshit has got to go . 
  we can not decide for what goes in the eu , but we often send out our opinion and perspective on matters - like reducing reliance on russian gas , supporting greece 's call on loosening austerity , wanting the uk to stay in the eu , and even asking the eu to accept turkey as a member state . 
  those are just a few things i 've taken note of in the past few years . 
  they 're also unpopular opinions that the eu hates . 
  nato , on the other hand , we have a lot more say . 
  but it is only military matters . 
  your western european superiority complex is showing . 
  / s no , but seriously . 
  i think if you give some time to poland and other countries , their economies will improve and catch up to the western states . 
  we have to remember that these were formerly ex-soviet countries . 
  what they 've achieved thus far has been remarkable . 
  now , greece , on the other hand ... 
  germany just needs soldiers , any soldiers , to increase presence . 
  i was inferring to us troops because they are on bases , on german soil , etc. 
  we will help if asked . 
  sigh . . and this is why europe can not into unity , so long as this snobbery of looking down on eastern europeans exist . 
  we should form our own men 's rights group and protest in full nudity . 
  - everyone gets arrested - fuck . 
  no , what they need is force presence . 
  germany needs to deploy german and u.s. troops to back up the police . 
  it would intimidate any would-be violators , both pegida and migrants . 
  they do n't even have to be armed with guns , just need numbers of able-bodied men . 
  police state ? 
  it 's called saving the country . 
  no european unity at all ... 
  competition is always good . 
  in the end , esa does n't win . 
  it does n't quite have the same ring to it , but i like it . 
  we 're bipolar . 
  dammit , i spat out my drink . 
  make a space alliance akin to nato combining nasa , canada , esa , and other european space agencies . 
  pool resources together and we could make far greater progress in space exploration for mankind . 
  add russia and japan as partner countries . 
  ... sadly , that is just a dream . 
  what was he eating ? 
  yeah me too .
