  i usually bring it up front and pay up instead . 
  merry christmas dude !, 
  good choice of weapon . 
   corporate slave i hear you dude . 
  do n't fall for it . 
  and if you must , ensure the contract is advantageous to you , it 's good money , and that you are happy . 
  happiness is the key . 
  that ca n't be , because in afghanistan we had us troops under nato command led by the uk , in addition to our own us-led command ( separate from nato ) . 
  it 's pretty confusing . 
  i would n't discount them and their ` frozen conflict ' method . 
  it 's dirty but it works . 
  there 's a reason countries fear russia . 
  this is wallpaper material . 
  the london firework show is amazing though . 
  i do n't know any country that can top it . 
  i 'm looking at the content there . 
  i wish / r/yurop was more patriotic , but maybe their way of being patriotic is to look down on us . 
  meanwhile , in / r/murica , it 's half tongue in cheek and overly prideful about american things . 
  the adequate term would be `` western . '', 
  why would we be angry ? 
  a strong eu is in our interests . 
  want an eu army ? 
  kick us and the turks out of nato and there , you have your eu army plus canada . 
  ca n't get any better than that . 
  wow , that 's actually pretty genius . 
  oh come on , old bean . 
  the argies are n't a threat to the falklands ? 
  i believe that was nato . 
   while secretary general , [ ismay ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hastings_ismay,_1st_baron_ismay ) is also credited as having been the first person to say that the purpose of the alliance was `` to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , '' a saying that has since become a common way to quickly describe the alliance . 
  2015 was a shitty year for all of us , especially with the terrorist attacks . 
  with time , things will get better . 
  just a rough patch that europe is going through . 
  i might sound cocky saying this but i think the english language will prevail for years to come , especially with how prevalent it is in the media ( think hollywood , star wars , etc. ) . 
  not to mention the countries that have been doing decent economically have been anglo countries , who happen to speak english . 
  english will never truly go away at this rate . 
  it 's the rt man . 
   like donald trump approves of putin we 're doomed : /, 
  ... i actually expected a much higher - net favorability for usa compared to other western nations . 
  rt must be doing damage here , i guess . 
  and holy fuck , finland is dark , for a country that is neutral . 
  oh come on , even we found where serbia was . 
  when i was 18 , i got kicked out of the house by my parents because they wanted to follow the `` american way . '', 
  i had some rough years , had to support myself with no parental support , joined military , managed college while working , etc. 
  it made me a stronger person and pretty street smart , but i wonder what life would 've been like if i was born in czechia or elsewhere in europe and my parents never moved to america . 
   is older than your country thanks for rubbing it in , dad . 
  it 's christmas . 
  ca n't we all get along ? 
  putin is life . 
  great gesture . 
  we do not have strong ties with the turks , just mutual interests . 
  they should put darth vader mask on him like they did in ukraine to lenin . 
  still not as high as russians and their favorability of putin . 
  i think we just like to complain and point fingers at our leaders even if things are going well . 
  it is the american way . 
  we must have drama . 
  not bad for a country across the pond . 
  even better than some european countries , wow . 
  f-15 and gripen , for a good combination of air and numerical superiority . 
  all the others are too expensive or impractical . 
  ah , but this time we have eu on our side . 
  ah , that 's right . 
  it 's been a year . 
  `` watch your step . . '' :d their food court is pretty good and there 's a supermarket there . 
  `` crap , i have to use this dollar to pay the internet bill '', 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sell ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ us ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ greenland ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ too, 
  one day my friend , one day . 
  admittedly , our politics are a bit of a mess . 
  i mean , we are just now taking off sanctions off cuba ... after 50 + years lol, 
   russian duma plays russian national anthem , angering russia . 
  we 're also pretty pro-eu . 
  we should just all employ turkish fighters to patrol our airspace . 
  no offense to belgium , of course . 
  you danes always picking on sweden , 
  allies can have mood swings sometimes . 
  you kind of just look at the friend and pretend nothing is wrong . 
  nato too has to save face . 
  the one who laughs at the end is putin . 
  a german who reads / r/polska . 
  i 'm impressed . 
  god no, 
  very cool . 
  a [ u.s. air force f-22 raptor , a royal air force eurofighter typhoon and a french air force dassault rafale ] ( http://theaviationist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/151207-f-kb808-347.jpg ) , flying together during the inaugural trilateral anti-access/area denial exercise scheduled for dec. 2 -- 18 . 
  thank you for bringing the hard truth to our neighbors , 
  wow , had no idea italy had 750 troops already in iraq . 
  logically , russia . 
  for bringing all of us together so we can complain about airspace incursions . 
  lol, 
  they work with the esa . 
  this will be the first uk astronaut from the esa that 's heading to the iss . 
  there were other british astronauts from nasa but they had to take up u.s. 
  citizenship . 
   other britons who have flown into space have done so either as private individuals - richard garriott and mark shuttleworth - or by taking us citizenship - the nasa astronauts piers sellers and nicholas patrick . 
   another british-born nasa astronaut , michael foale , already had dual citizenship through his us mother . 
  ... what, 
  poland tourism stronk !, 
  i never knew we were competing to see who offered the most luxurious options for our prisoners . 
  edit : fix 'd, 
  we should not be interfering with the eu defense clause and how their members put out military aid . 
  where to buy ? 
  according to the article , nato is much weaker than it seems .
