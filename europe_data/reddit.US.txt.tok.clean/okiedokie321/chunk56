  does the government have some sort of outreach program for the roma ? 
  so egypt denies terrorist attack so tourism industry does n't take a hit ? 
  got to keep reeling in the money somehow . 
  chump change for the norwegians . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  for a moment , i thought i was in / r/unitedkingdom . 
  no north korean leader . 
  good for them . 
  what 's wrong with french police ? 
  wow , this whole time i thought ibm was dead . 
  what country would that be ? 
  here in u.s. and canada , there 's no immigration debate about brits . 
  most are just here for economic opportunity . 
  just being locked up in a cell , naked , is millions in compensation here . 
  pretty ridiculous , but one happy camper if you are that person . 
  best : cheap beer , great food , good looking women , old towne square ( during christmas season it 's very lively and fun ) , and in general good people ( i had no phone once , told taxi driver to meet at a certain place at so-and-so time , i ended up being late because i was drunk with friends and he somehow found us and drove us to the hotel . ), 
  cons : cobbled streets , vomit on the street is n't cleaned up it seems , and some 3-star hotels are n't really 3-stars ... 
  ungrateful bastards . 
  after we helped you be free from gaddafi ... man , france should have never bombed those tanks heading for benghazi . 
  i 'm ok with that amount . 
  150 troops from each country seems small but it is a tripwire force basically . 
  that , and it wo n't likely anger russia . 
  we do n't want them either . 
  definitely entertainment and less tribal . 
  it 's become a shitshow of the latest commercial ads and who 's singing at half-time show . 
  well , the super bowl anyway ... 
  on behalf of germany , i would like to apologize for this guy ( i 'm not even german lol ) . 
  he 's a very lousy journalist and does n't represent germany as a whole . 
  i think once the media picks up on this and spreads , it 's possible he could lose his job , no ? 
  i ca n't say who the enemy is , but russia has been infringing on your airspace , has it not ? 
  the uk should maintain nukes and a military that can respond to crises worldwide against any foe . 
  you never know when falklands will be taken by the args for example . 
  or if putin decides to fly more bombers near the uk . 
  that 's not a bad trade-off for 30 + years of nuclear deterrent and defense that keeps the country safe . 
  anyone who argues otherwise is an idiot and just wants the country to burn . 
  i 'd argue both our countries are in a need of saving . 
  reminds me of that one letter that an american made to the queen to take the u.s. back as a colony . 
  i personally would n't mind it either . 
  we could benefit from the nhs and sound politics . 
  hispanic and asian friends have said he 's a racist . 
  they will be voting for sanders or hilary . 
  not my word , but theirs . 
  people change . 
  agreed  . 
  also https://vk.com/darth . 
  telecommute , maybe do a data entry job . 
  that could help ... hope you 're getting therapy and counseling . 
  anxiety sucks . 
  or if you 're in a rural area in the middle of nowhere . 
  * girl ? 
  what is girl ? 
  haha brilliant . 
  `` hot dogs ... get your hot dogs here ... '', 
  this was a good pr move and free advertising . 
  smart guy . 
  do n't take ppl 's opinions to heart . 
  you just brush it off and move on . 
  who cares, 
  yes , yes you were indoctrinated by british military [ propaganda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zcgbgga-_8 ) . 
  paging [ melon-pan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ize_zmyctzg ) . 
  it was all part of the [ plan ] ( http://stmedia.digitallook.com/web/img/images_uploaded/3/9/putinwink_620x350.jpg ) . 
  i have already stated my reasons to pick germans above . 
  they are not like the french , british , or italians who would want to fight over control of the eu army . 
  that is what france wanted initially with the european defence community . 
  they wanted an eu army led by france . 
  an eu army controlled by the institution would also work , but then you have arguments coming from the uk saying they would ` be picking up the slack for the other countries that do n't want to contribute . ', 
  there 's also the fear of losing sovereignty and military might to the ep . 
  it is honestly better just to go with the germans . 
  it will make them like mercenaries , yes , but it will benefit the eu without any of the bullshit . 
  i suggest you read this article here , it really gives alot of insight : http://thefederalist.com/2015/03/16/a-european-army-is-a-terrible-idea/, 
  is there an exact time it was built ? 
  wiki seems vague . 
  added . 
  ca n't forget that !, 
  better late than never i suppose ... 
  * quick rundown on the human history of walls * 221 - 206 b.c. 
  - great wall of china built 122 a.d. - romans build [ hadrian 's wall ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vfyelyy.png ) to separate roman britain and scotland 1453 - walls of constantinople besieged , byzantine empire falls to the ottomans 1961 - berlin wall built 1989 - fall of berlin wall 1998 - / u/finnishperson 's mom 's wall built to separate stupid neighbors 2015 - viktor orban 's fence 2015 - great wall of trump 2015 - latvia 's 90-km fence built 2042 - putin 's speech to latvia : `` tear down this ~ ~ wall ~ ~ * fence * ! '', 
  edit : well , i did mention `` quick rundown '' not the whole `` complete '' history on human walls :p, 
  i see germany as the leader of the eu and they are in a central location in europe . 
  they also make some of the best military hardware , gear , and weapons . 
  for countries like poland , uk , and france , i suppose they can keep their military but they should at least contribute funds to an eu army . 
  a well funded eu army that can respond to threats anywhere in the eu is really ideal for small countries like those in the baltic region . 
  but it can also aid the french or other better funded militaries as well . 
  it will be tough to argue with the sovereignty crowd . 
  most of them are anti-federalists too . 
  i think they should keep their respective armies , but they should still contribute to a german eu army . 
  this is definitely an unpopular opinion , keep seeing downvotes and upvotes :d, 
  * republic, 
  turkey and russia should be in eu , along with ukraine . 
  nato should penalize and kick members out for spending over 2 % gdp ( us ) and for spending less than 1 % ( canada ) . 
  all eu states should give up their militaries ( except volunteer defense force ) and give funding to germany . 
  german military will provide the protection . 
  this will be the only way to a true eu army , undivided , without politics , and without language barriers between countries . 
  we 're getting bigger numbers of french expats in louisiana . 
  met quite a few new immigrants and expats myself when i was in nola for work . 
  the consulate general is also trying to make it [ easier ] ( http://www.consulfrance-nouvelleorleans.org/better-informing-and-welcoming.html ) to welcome those expats and immigrants . 
  still , the number of francophone speakers only number 100k last time i checked . 
  and it 's a different type of french apparently ... 
  i vomited a bit . 
  \u00af \\ ( \u30c4 ) / \u00af * shrugs * it is what it is .
