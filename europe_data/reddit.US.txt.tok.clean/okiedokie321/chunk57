  ca n't forget baltics !, 
  you guys went through quite a transition . 
  i also think lithuania , latvia , and estonia should combine to form a superstate !, 
  i do n't know when us reign will end , but i do know powers come and go . 
  old ones get overthrown and new ones take its place . 
  the romans and british thought their empire would last forever , but it did n't ... 
  yeah we 're kind of like a [ mosquito ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2vlrtl/peoples_republic_of_china_only_china/ ) in their backyard xd, 
  i would n't say poland is worth more than all of those countries . 
  each has its pros and cons . 
  it still amazes me however , how poland escaped relatively unscathed after the fall of the soviet union and even managed to join eu/nato - considering its history . 
  now their country is a rising economic and military power . 
  china 's pretty assertive with its neighbors like vietnam and japan . 
  still amazes me they have n't taken over taiwan yet . 
  why jealous ? 
  we 're somewhere in the top 3 as trade partner for the uk . 
  we 're also china 's number 1 trade partner by total trade . 
  the brits are free to pick whoever they want for business and trade . 
  this will benefit the anglosphere ( and the west i suppose ) . 
  sadly , politics have creeped into our system too , based on how well students do on centralized testing . 
  things were much better before . 
  god this spying stuff is getting ridiculous . 
  i 'm skeptical because of the polls and also france plans to [ veto ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-blunts-french-veto-on-nato-enlargement ) or reject new memberships . 
  shit that 's hilarious . 
  i would have joined and chanted `` allah-u akbar '' for fun . 
  ^ ^ ^ wait - ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ nvm ^ ^ ^ nsa, 
  should we be surprised ? 
  why do i feel disturbed that there is a post about bernie sanders on my / r/europe ? 
  i want euro news man , * euro . 
  we 're third world by european standards . 
  bruh, 
  [ russia : almaz-antey `` entirely refute '' dutch safety board 's conclusions on mh17 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cro9t4jctnc ), 
  you need a chill pill . 
  we call those spitcakes , because it 's cooked on a spit rod . 
  here is the european family of [ spitcakes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/k%c3%bcrt%c5%91sh_kal%c3%a1ch_family.jpg ) or however you want to call them . 
  based poland . 
   yanukovych , who had [ triggered ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/obama-russia-lavrov-coup-ukraine/26826632.html ) mass protests in kyiv by refusing to sign an eu association agreement in november 2013 , abandoned power and fled to russia shortly after signing the february 21 deal . 
  yes , all those protests were bankrolled by us , eu , nato , nasa , nsa . 
   `` paris has once again confirmed that in defending ukraine 's national interests ukrainians have no allies but themselves , '' commentator pyotr shuklinov wrote bitterly on liga.net . 
  `` berlin and paris decided to play the role of arbiters . 
  neither is willing to take decisive action to end the war in the center of europe . '', 
  eu is a funny organization . 
  they will turn back a huge eu supporter who underwent a chaotic transition including a civil war and snub its noses at them , not even giving an ounce of support , only sternly worded letters . 
  even putin laughs and only serves to embolden him to get away with things . 
  an organization under v4 is really starting to look enticing now . 
  you ca n't trust western european governments . 
  sorry to say this : /, 
  well , klm must be doing something right . 
  do n't think germany can send back refugees . 
  assad barely has any territory left . 
  it 's all carved up by the kurds in the north , isis to the east , fsa to the north by turkey and south towards israel . 
  initially read it as monkey ... * we just want the monkey food . 
  lol, 
  nato mate , it is a great insurance . 
  old relic that has a renewed purpose and strongest when united . 
  eu is just going through the downs right now but things will be better . 
  to be fair , the germans are trying to be neutral . 
  but i agree with you ... 
  thanks uk !, 
  different stances really . 
  germany is ok with assad in power , us wants a transitional government with assad stepping down . 
  however , i do not get why we should exclude the brits and french who have our same views . 
  makes no fucking sense ... 
  heck yeah , france !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ murica ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ equivalent ? 
  yeah i would consider the swiss as everyone 's favorite go-to because you are neutral . 
  the friction between us and germany will never end ... 
  if eu was federalized , yeah we would probably be the best ally in those sectors . 
  that or canada . 
  not really mate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/india%e2%80%93united_states_relations but i think in a war , india would stay neutral . 
  no belarus ? 
  i do not agree with china being a threat , you guys are like the best of buddies right now . 
  no belarus ? 
  no uk ... ? 
  iirc , we have the second most users after the uk here in / r/europe . 
  and then when you have a thread like this with people from ee , us , and uk naming each other as allies , i can see why it 's like a circlejerk . 
  anglosphere : british empire vers . 
  plus germans lead nato rapid response force . 
  germans will be the first to respond , but i think what he means is german bureacracy holding up things . 
  dad , spain 's at it againnnnn !, 
  judging from the answers from countries in central/eastern europe , i would say they are all a close second as well . 
  i wonder if they would like to join us in the anglosphere ? 
  we have tea and burgers . 
  oh come on mate , you 're putting yourself down calling yourself a pet . 
  i 'm sure it 's cameron who decides that not us . 
  thanks uk !, 
  yeah , unfortunately moldova has the shorter end of the stick here ( transnistria ... ), 
  i think nato should be thanked , it has not only been us . 
  but appreciate the sentiment bro !, 
  they have already taken over youtube , help !, 
  i would suggest counter-rt news outlet . 
  i wonder what would happen if you were to combine them ... 
  are you being assumptive that i imply something ? 
  where did i say i think anime is for kids ? 
  [ this is what winning looks like ] ( https://twitter.com/misspatriarch/status/797587546243035136 ), 
  trump is just a president . 
  there will be friction between the cia , trump , and the house and senate . 
  the country is very divided . 
  from my understanding , it was agreed upon before trump 's election that canada would deploy to latvia , uk to estonia , germany to lithuania , and us/uk to poland as part of nato . 
  other countries like italy and spain tagged along as well . 
  none of this will change under trump , so do n't worry about him .
