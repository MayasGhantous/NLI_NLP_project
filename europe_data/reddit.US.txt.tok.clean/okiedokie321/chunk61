   who is `` we '' anyway ? 
  the eu ... * ahem * ... germany . 
  no one wants to move back in with pa. 
   but i honestly remember spending much more time learning about us history * checks flair * wat . 
  if hypothetically we stop the war on drugs , would it help any if we fund ( and i mean seriously fund ... helicopters , tanks , and shit ) the mexican army to go after remnants of the cartels ? 
  how do you reel them in and stop them from kidnapping , trafficking , killing , and selling drugs ? 
  what about monterrey or puerto vallarta ? 
  thoughts ? 
   i can try and make a list of nono places i 'd actually be interested in this if you have the free time . 
  or you can go by regions to avoid instead of cities . 
  i consider ourselves a bit of a safer country but not entirely . 
  canada is the only safe country in north america i feel . 
  probably best country in the world with good history and intentions . 
   they 'd be annexed by mexico within the day one could only hope . 
  * crosses fingers *, 
  damn , i was hoping he did it in the name of android , not for refund purposes . 
  no , trump is just a nut . 
  operation earnest voice has been in the [ news ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/17/online-persona-management_n_837153.html ) for awhile now . 
  i would argue it is nowhere near effective as what we 're seeing today . 
  france is also going into south china sea . 
  i sometimes wonder if western intelligence agencies will employ similar troll brigades . 
  because at this rate , rt and other russian propaganda techniques will do a number on us , at least here in the states . 
  no wonder l\u00e6ffy went crazy . 
  oh that 's a tough one . 
  f-16 is a well proven aircraft time and time again , but if given the option to buy a similar aircraft and it is new , i would buy new almost every time . 
  quick , lads !, 
  we have found one who somehow slipped through !, 
  * throws cinnamon *, 
  lithuania does n't have student loan debt , does it ? 
  i thought it was only for countries like mine or japan . 
  all hell breaks loose . 
  this is why you see divorces happening during 40 's and 50 's . 
  if you marry young , it is happening in 30 's . 
  what country are you from and do pre-nups help ? 
  and make / r/europe pay for it, 
  if you combine it with some aspects of socialism , it can do some countries very well . 
  lol ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ humble ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ brag, 
  good for polish tourism . 
  i am envious of you swedes . 
  our generations coming up are becoming spoiled . 
  we need conscription back . 
  fuck that 's dirty . 
  those guys who operated the buk have blood on their hands . 
  i am willing to bet they will admit it when their conscious becomes guilty . 
  is n't that sub full of russians living in the west ? 
  dual seater planes are so badass . 
  you guys got f-16 's now , that 's relevant news . 
  russia probably has the most feared ground force in the world though . 
  tanks by the thousands . 
  you can send all the strike-fighter jets , dominate the skies , and bomb ground targets from the air , but you also have to fight them on the ground . 
  biggest carrier in europe and in that part of the hemisphere i believe . 
  fuck , that must be a thrill as a pilot . 
  check out the danes ' [ reaction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkwobh_jxfo ) to brrrrrrt : `` what the fuck man . '', 
  i ca n't help but feel this conversation has turned into something resembling a dick measuring contest . 
  wow , those youtube comments ... 
  hard to tell that was a joke from the internet . 
  maybe you meant sarcasm ? 
  ** here , i tell you a joke : ** * an american , a russian , and a serbian are sitting in a bar . 
  * they started arguing about who has the best shoes . 
  * the american says : * `` we have nike shoes that are so soft , you can jump from the second floor . 
  the shoes absorb most of the damage , so you only end up with a minor foot injury ! '', 
  * the russian guy says : * `` we have a nike-lookalike that are smooth and soft , you can jump from the fourth floor !, 
  the shoes will fall apart , but you suffer no injury . '', 
  * the serb then says : * `` we have opanak . 
  they are so strong , you can jump from the top of a building !, 
  you fall apart , but the shoes take no damage . '', 
  you 'll notice many of the countries who give out student loans ( uk , us , canada , sweden , japan , etc. 
  ) , these students are n't always partying or taking out loans themselves . 
  many of them have to take up part-time jobs like alot of european students ( some of whom i know spend a fuck ton ) . 
  so what are you going on about ? 
  * checks flair * ah , that explains it . 
  i hope they do not hear their mp saying this . 
   well , you are student , your efforts and expenses should be focused on studying . 
  and then there are those students who spend compulsively and party alot , then come home and complain about being broke . 
  not too mention , it takes time to select the right partner . 
  no one can just pop a baby out right away unless they want to be a single mother . 
  daddy issues . 
  kind of sad to see that . 
  not saying christianity is always good , but i find it does provide a good moral framework to live life . 
  societies often go corrupted and moralless without it - and i 'm saying this as someone who does n't really believe in god but finds christianity appealing in some aspects of life , like for marriage and excommunication for cheating ( which is the rage these days ) . 
  divorce is fucking terrible . 
  happening worldwide like wildfire . 
  get a good hobby , lift , and sink your time into it . 
  stave off depression . 
  civil wars are not our forte . 
  can confirm , mexicans are very friendly to gringo expats . 
  and then there are * others * covered in tats who will gladly cut your head off . 
  already bought my plane ticket . 
  for once , we are not at a parade . 
  fuck , that 's cheap . 
  just another reason to move to poland . 
  same here . 
  i want to invest in eastern polan . 
  happy independence day !, 
  glory to ukraine !, 
   our women whore themselves from miami to seoul no , alot of women are like that , no matter what nation . 
  i 'll add fries ( ` chips ' ) to that . 
  how does credit history work in europe ? 
  i 'm sure over here in the us , if the company goes under , your credit score and history takes a hit - then you wo n't be able to borrow for quite some time . 
  very true .
