  france , you have new competition now . 
  entirely up to the brits if they wan na kick us out . 
  american here . 
  i would have entered , think it must be a german thing , sit down , and not question it . 
  oh god . 
  imagine if the coup all started because of a misinterpretation of video game cheat codes . 
  at this rate , turkey is gon na spar with everyone in europe and north america ( even canada ) . 
  we 've been hearing this for a long time now . 
  what 's stopping ya ? 
  no one has kicked us out of their country in europe yet , except france . 
  still waiting for germany , italy , and the others to do the same . 
  one could say finland got away with it with minimal loss . 
  things could have been way worst . 
  interesting . 
  i read in a book a long while ago that the few who stayed behind were persecuted . 
  i agree with ya . 
  he has something going on with him , whether mental or social . 
  ^ damn , he got taken by the unemployment police . 
  uk , us , turkey , russia , then portugal - welcome to the idiot table . 
  who 's next ? 
  lukashenko is an angel compared to those other two lol, 
  i always knew amerika idolized nazi germany . 
  still , it 's rather unfortunate ussr got away with east karelia and persecution of finns living there . 
  the west lives in a spoiled society . 
  which is sad ... europe does not give any aid to us in the us . 
  there are no medical missions or anything to give to the us poor . 
  it 's almost one-sided aid to europe or in this case , the balkans - from a country an ocean away . 
  when the whole world seems to be going right , germany stays left . 
  show the world what left wingers can do . 
  turkey has become buddy buddy with russia . 
  boy , what has the world come to . 
  germany , save us !, 
  you 're the west 's only hope : o,

   excellent , the ball gag is working . 
  ... now to take out the flogger and some rope ... 
  i think i will let a turk or german handle this though . 
  i hear they are excellent at this . 
  you are speaking too much . 
  i have to put this ball gag on you now . 
   now about that whip , are you female and do you wear leather or latex ? 
  male , eh ... 
  i can do both . 
  you 're in us prison now . 
  what 's your kink ? 
  world domination ? 
  bombing run play ? 
  economic isolation ? 
  corporate flogging ? 
  i 'll bring out the whip , extendedsceptic . 
  come play . 
  i 'll go play military and eat a burger now . . 
  great wall of america . 
  nice one . 
  it 's the coldska . 
  looks like a deformed cow . 
  panama papers . 
  you get an a. 
  you can have them, 
  mexico looks like the tail end of a spermatozoon . 
  actually mate . 
  i was hoping we were never europe 's first line of defense to begin with . 
  because if we were , we sure did a really shitty job at it . 
  - * looks at ukraine and recent terrorist attacks * - you can say we complemented ... 
  this . 
  and the way things are going here , we will not be as hawkish as before . 
  europe needs to be ready for any threat , foreign and domestic . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  but rather play it safe and let erdogan stand than risk a nation freefall into chaos . 
  let 's hope there is no civil war at all . 
  after the nice attacks , a civil war on europe 's border is the last thing needed . 
  if turkey is embroiled in a civil war , the syria situation will pour over and refugees will flood europe even further . 
  it would be an opportunity to infiltrate for isis . 
  that is fucking horrible , regardless of what you think of erdogan . 
  fact is , we need strongmen like erdogan and assad to hold onto their respective countries . 
  coup or not , we do not need more instability on europe 's borders . 
  we saw what happened to countries like libya and egypt . 
  i think a coup is a bad idea and i am ashamed so many of you wish to support it . 
  it 's just more bloodshed for some power hungry military brass . 
  use the power of the vote to get erdogan out at the next presidential election . 
  the power lies with the citizens of turkey . 
  rip to those poor people . 
  i think the tech industry in general is in a bubble . 
  well i agree that calling us yanks is n't too bad . 
  it 's a british and irish term mainly , and has been in usage since wwi , and even further to the 18th century if we count the term `` yankee . '', 
  but no one here calls british ` limey ' or ` pom . ', 
  it 's just brits , nowadays . 
  united statesians . 
  but if you are lower middle class and above , you have to pay for your insurance . 
  the system is retarded . 
  us and eu competing against each other on who spends the most in nato . 
  it will then eventually lead to a space race and we 'll finally get space ships ahead of schedule . 
  i 'm all for it mate . 
   the best way to prevent wars is to stop fucking around with other countries ' sovereignty , but if you really have to invade ( and some very exceptional cases require it ) , then you must assume the brunt of the responsibility of the result of the war , not pull out like a coward and leave everything in shit behind you . 
  i know you are slighting my country , but you should also take the blame and responsibility for libya then ( which we helped you with ) . 
  the obama kenyan comment was a bit distasteful , but meh . 
  ` special relationship ',
