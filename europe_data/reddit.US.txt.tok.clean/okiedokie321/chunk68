  when you get the chance , see the nato expenditures of european members for 2016 . 
  it is on this sub but i 'm on mobile . 
  it is very embarrassing for europe , and the eu is supposed to be the next superpower ... 
  if true about the harassment and drunkeness , that is a problem . 
  they should be moved to very rural areas . 
  eh , spending is not the answer . 
  we need better smear tactics and propaganda . 
  you can steal allies , win new friends , and sow discord by using russian tactics without firing a shot . 
  this is why russia and china are winning . 
  their eurasian alliance knows what 's up and have managed to steal our allies away . 
  funny how effective misinformation and smear tactics are . 
  a good one that is united with top of the line hardware that money can buy on a reasonable dime , plus the largest nuclear arsenal in the world . 
  there is still too much disunity within the eu to get anything done . 
  i would bet some eu members wo n't come to the aid of a baltic state . 
  for the money , russia can afford a lot of troops and hardware . 
  it does n't matter if we spend more . 
  this is something i think we should work on . 
  certain countries should not have to spend the 2 % requirement ( ex : iceland ) . 
  we were already crazy , it was bound to happen . 
  not true . 
  we 're keeping in line with the 1997 agreement with russia . 
  that 's why we are rotating troops in and out . 
  if we move east , we 'll just cause more trouble . 
  you can move east if you want . 
  we wo n't be blamed for you angering russia . 
  we shot ourselves in the foot with the loss of tpp . 
  we lost vietnam as a result . 
  thailand and the phillipines are already cozying up with china . 
  it may not be a military defensive pact , but it does wonders from a geopolitical aspect , especially with countering a parallel international system like the aiib . 
  loss of tpp also gives way to the rising shanghai pact . 
  all hail our new indian/russian/chinese overlords . 
  we deserve it . 
  vietnam is cozying up with china because of the fall of tpp . 
  it 's all over the news . 
  so far , we have lost thailand , vietnam , and the phillipines to china . 
  rightfully deserved , because we have incompetent morons who lead . 
  pax americana is over , baby . 
  perhaps for the baltic states , now is a great time . 
  but for someone looking at the whole of the west , we are not doing too well as before . 
  we are more divided than ever . 
  ** trump ** : `` people want their own identity , so if you ask me , others , i believe others will leave . '', 
  `` you look at the european union , and it 's germany . 
  basically a vehicle for germany . '', 
  `` nato is obsolete . '', 
  ** white house advisor ** : `` ummm , mr president ... '' ... ** trump ** : `` eu is wonderful . '', 
  countries like bulgaria , greece , slovenia that have been pro-russia now you add turkey . 
  it is concerning . 
  nato is still very much divided , we can not agree on everything . 
  turkey is against the west because we antagonised them and made a mockery of erdogan . 
  we failed to see their strategic importance in terms of nato and migrants . 
  that is why they are russian friendly , even after shooting down a russian jet . 
  you are too optimistic and need to see reality for what it is . 
  if you compare now and pre-2008 , things were in our favor back then . 
  trump , brexit , preventing ukraine and georgia from joining nato , luring nato nations away , turning turkey against the west , keeping assad afloat , rise of populism , and focus on negativity of migrant crisis . 
  they are not winning per say , but they definitely have made advancements compared to the status quo prior . 
  they love it because it hurts the west . 
  sukhoi makes some of the best planes out there . 
  shame no western country can make quality planes for cheap . 
  everything has to be god awful expensive . 
  i do not want to be overly confident , but we will wait and see . 
  we are definitely in a war with russia . 
  it just wo n't involve bullets or bombs , but information , propaganda , and cyber warfare . 
  sadly , they caught us with our pants down . 
  you have to admit , they are winning this new cold war though . 
  look at what happened to turkey , bulgaria , slovakia , us , and uk in recent years . 
  elected russian puppet leaders or became client states for putin . 
  if we are not careful , france and germany will be next because their political societies are deeply divided . 
  a better vetting process would probably do it . 
  i want to agree with you but alot of these kids , even those born here in the us , excel at academics and get into high paying jobs in finance , investment banking , medicine , stem , etc. 
  i 'm friends with quite a few and the funny thing is , we party hard as hell . 
  i think the asians are just gifted . 
  amazing !, 
  one thing is for sure . 
  these students kill it when they go to america . 
  it is almost an embarrassment to our homegrown kids . 
  i think a combination of east asian discipline with western creativity is good . 
  i mean , we take it a bit too far with our philosophy and basketweaving majors . 
  just say it , it ca n't be any more racist than us . 
  well at least you make the big bucks because everyone else is shunning math . 
  haha why such a big difference in estonia compared to its neighbors, 
  well it is true  give them no incentive to invade . 
  it is not like finland has anything valuable to putin that russia does n't already have . 
  that 'll only work if they can find an opening like threatened russian minority . 
  think ahead , fill those gaps and they have no reasoning or excuse to absorb . 
  that none of it is true . 
  the eu at that point would be a country like us . 
  nope . 
  i think we will lose eventually . 
  downfall is inevitable . 
  global hegemony , and all the responsibility that comes with it . 
  i love how 2 out of the 6 are related to infidelity . 
  until the eu federalizes and produces vast soft power , we 're still going to see american-centric news , movies , and pop culture for quite some time . 
  i 'd argue though that the uk has strong soft power out of all the european countries . 
  we are too self-absorbed to be more open to other cultures . 
  it 's that dominant sadly . 
  things are changing with each generation though . 
  i also blame our geography and lack of neighboring countries like how it is in europe . 
  yes , but i am merely saying romania has not faced an attack by russia or terrorists * yet * . 
  if romania was attacked , of course nato would respond . 
  when will the eu federalize ?
