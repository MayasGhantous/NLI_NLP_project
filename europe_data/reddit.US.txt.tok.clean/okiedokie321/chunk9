  as you know , americans can be kind of misinformed about the world . 
  they certainly do n't hate russians , but rather very curious about russians . 
  seriously , their knowledge about russia is from dash cam videos and stupid in soviet russia jokes . 
  it 's only when you go on sites like youtube and our news sites i 've noticed where russians are going in droves pushing an agenda , disliking and commenting in russian on pro-us related articles and videos . 
  i 've seen it more pronounced since the ukraine maidan now that i think about it ... 
  it makes sense . 
  we 're one of the nations helping to enforce [ anglosphere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:commonwealth_and_anglosphere.svg ) . 
  i would not be surprised if somewhere in the uk the elite people planned all these geopolitics and wars all along haha, 
  yeah i sometimes believe eu is more or less nato . 
  sweden and finland already picked the west long ago ( so belated welcome to nato if you guys join ) . 
  but the eu is weak militarily i think . 
  well , not in the physical sense but in the political sense . 
  for example , finland said they would not be able to help the eu baltic states if there was russian aggression because finland lacks sufficient resources . 
  i think that 's why baltics look to nato instead . 
  when you add turkey , norway , canada , us + eu states , we are alot stronger and reliable than the eu . 
  that 's what i feel too haha, 
  thank you dalai lama . 
  my country never existed in the first few crusades . 
  we just kind of popped out of nowhere and found the middle east on our own . 
   1 ) who do you think joins the us military ? 
  where do you think their sympathies lie ? 
  with the people . 
  i side with my people , thanks very much . 
  we 're cheaper to employ . 
  we are the western world 's china : /, 
  and these guys lurk among us ... 
  we need to go to war addiction anonymous . 
  that is the eu and us 's stance on the fsa , but to me , they are the same as isis . 
  just because they say they are moderate ? 
  when have we heard that again ? 
  oh right . 
  i think we are the western world 's china . 
  serbs are really nice . 
   finland joining nato is 100-years away , i.e. 
  not happening anytime soon . 
  reason i said this was because the finnish polls show that finland should not join nato . 
  what you said makes complete sense however . 
  is that just speculation ? 
  i have only heard about airspace incursion but nothing about gotland . 
  i just read in a different article on / r/europe that the swedish proposal to join nato will be conditional on having similar agreement like norway 's ( no nukes or troops ) , but the swedes also want finland to join at the same time . 
  finland joining nato is 100-years away , i.e. 
  not happening anytime soon . 
  no one will control the whole [ country ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/syrian_civil_war.png ) . 
  there 's really 3 main factions here at play - assad , al-nusra/isis/fsa , and the kurds . 
  the only way syria will be at peace is if it is split up unfortunately . 
  even if you remove isis , then it will still be between fsa vs. assad . 
  and then you also have the kurds who want their independence . 
  right , and that 's something the public does n't have an appetite for . 
  by our stance , that would mean getting rid of both assad and isis ... 
  thank god it was an opinion . 
  i though it was a news article at first . 
  you are [ correct ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11793011/sas-took-part-in-abu-sayyaf-isil-raid-in-syria.html ) . 
  this was taken from [ march ] ( http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/04/most-americans-want-obama-send-ground-troops-battle-isis ) so i think we would be apt to support it . 
  but the fight will be really difficult i imagine . 
  according to the ama from the syrian refugee on the front page , it seems there is still a very large civilian population in the isis-held territory . 
  i think special forces would be most suitable to this situation in my opinion . 
  thank you . 
  is ok , we friends [ now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw0s53kl9vw ) . 
  til !, 
  russia does not rule out nato membership at some point in the future , but for the moment it prefers to keep co-operation on a practical , limited level , moscow 's envoy to nato dmitry rogozin told [ euobserver ] ( https://euobserver.com/news/27890 ) . 
  `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . '', 
  well , i have to agree milan was pretty shitty compared to the rest of italy when i visited . 
  actually , i would say naples was worst . 
  the us has its shitty parts and great parts too . 
  i think if countries had the ability to move continents , we would be the only one in north america . 
  the poster made it seem worst than it really was . 
  sometimes a few of the russian people remind me of some americans we have here . 
   like 16 % of the population under the poverty line , a well-spread police brutality , segregation , high suicide rates , high obesity rate , low life expectancy , etc you 're generalizing here , it is not all bad as the media makes it out to be . 
  that 's like me basing my views about milan from the internet and saying how shitty and gloomy the city is because the media reports about the poor weather , somalis , and rampant graffiti . 
  but i agree with you that money does n't lead to a better or happier life . 
  he seems rather similar to our bernie sanders . 
  i can see them being buddies . 
   there is no way in hell that russia would be that ballsy to move a nuclear submarine between the uk and ireland , the english channel maybe but not smack in the center of the uk . 
  i ca n't believe that the mod would even try to pull this one . 
   germans are in gerneral very , hospitable , open minded and travel a lot . 
  i agree with you here , except maybe not to your own soldiers . 
  i talked to a soldier from bundeswhehr , and he said he got spat on by germans after coming back from kosovo . 
  sadly , they do not realize that a soldier is a job too . 
  in every western nation , there 's going to be a need for augmentation . 
  i 'd say it 's great time to be a plastic surgeon . 
  on that note , danish women seem to have some pretty fancy dance [ moves ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqew9_5kuri ) . 
  germans are the last people i would ever imagine being hipsters . 
  this `` professor '' lol, 
  please sue justin bieber first . 
   where 's hitler when you need him i know this might be insensitive to some but fuck i laughed way too hard at that comment . 
  seems much longer than that . 
  nice knowing you . 
  / s but we should not assume he is on a power trip . 
  perhaps the other mods are being lazy or are inactive ? 
  we should hear his side of the story first . 
  it wo n't happen i do n't think . 
  swedish people are still very much against . 
  [ nato ut ur sverige ] ( https://youtu.be/qq9hhq22jw4?t=15m18s ), 
  there are people who live in comfy west and are pro-communist . 
  they are hipsters usually . 
  same over here . 
  for things like phonecases and other accessories , it is often cheaper to buy from hk/china through ebay . 
  til there are international editions of cards against humanity . 
  german .
