the thing is that just the actual threat of doing this would force russia to the table . 
  short term pain , but long term win for the eu since russia 's economy is so weak and teetering that they 'd blink first . 
  if the us was in this position they would probably chicken out also because politicians ca n't afford to have unemployed voters , but fuck it man someone needs to stand up to putin . 
  the world let 's him abuse the gays , rig elections , and browbeat his way into ukraine just because politicians do n't want to run the risk of having their electorate be inconvenienced . 
  russia would probably put up a tough facade for a few days , and then try and come up with a compromise to save face . 
  but homosex does n't exists in russia ... everyone knows that ... classic american propaganda ... 
  yeah the title is misleading , but let 's be honest though . 
  it will take a lot more than a russian backed/supported rebel group shooting down commercial airliner , killing 200 + innocent people to get even a minor sanctioned lobed against one of germany most important trading partners . 
  sanctions would mean she would come under political pressure for doing the right thing , and we obviously ca n't have that . 
  ` murica !, 
  i think in texas they sell them at walmart at a bulk discount ... 
  / r/conspiracy i 'm sure the bilderberg group and chemtrails had something to do with it ... sometimes i accidentally get directed to that sub via random link and i nope the fuck out asap . 
  staying too long makes your brain hurt at the idiocy . 
  all it takes are a few locals they know the area well enough to chip away at the forces over a period of time . 
  the goal is to make it politically/economically unfavorable for the invading party . 
  shit ... they 're onto us !, 
  that was just the local attack helicopter club taking their state is the art vehicles on leisure flybys ... of government buildings ... 
  sounds like some parts of texas honestly . 
  you 're not a texan unless you have enough weapons to invade a small country . 
  i wonder what new taxes/laws or lack thereof the new citizens would come under if they went over to russia . 
  better/worst for them ? 
  what interests me more is what happens to the former state assets after the brake up . 
  imagine if a portion of the country that had the majority of the countries military/navy/weapons broke apart ? 
  would you have a small country/breakaway region in charge of all those assets ? 
  what if they join another country ? 
  does the new country now control all those assets ? 
  my analytical chem professor just cringed at these statements . 
  understood european brah , we 'll prepare the jets to [ `` protect '' us citizens from the `` instability '' in canada . 
  `` all countries are bad , except my country ! '', 
  type of mentality is usually the standard even if we do n't want to believe it . 
  except canada , everyone knows canada is the leader of the axis of evil . 
  dat syrup flow !, 
  do n't hate the player son , hate the game . 
  it 's the way the world works , since each nations politicians are linked to their local voting populace . 
  i also think that another major factor is an increase costs of goods/gas would piss off the voting people , and the politicians do n't want that . 
  in russia it 's a different dynamic since putin just does n't give a shit and would steal an election/impose his will on the populace , give them a big f-u and just do whatever he wants . 
  locally putin 's political future is secure even if people are financially suffering , but internationally he 'll be isolated but that does n't matter to him . 
  why not cookies ? 
  classic fascist keeping the cookie man down !, 
  you 're talking about canada right ... we 're taking canada next right ? 
  well by 2020 we 'll accidentally have skynet up , and that 'll take care of everything ... 
  but if other members of the eu/region that do get energy resources from russia are affected , then they in turn get affected with less imports/exports . 
  it 's all a tangled web , and the eu should find a way to get off that dependence . 
  i 'm not sure if the cost savings are worth being a slave to russia . 
  well we better fix that ... build all the nukes o.o !, 
  well ... with the right mods it can be ? 
  maybe some cheat codes ? 
  china 's interest is to limit the eu from getting stronger probably . 
  this just keeps everyone outside of asia involved and pre-occupied . 
  i think the problem is that when a country has one of the largest militaries in the world , and the 2nd largest arsenal of nukes you do n't really want to be rash . 
  honestly russian market 's reaction to this will probably do the most to shut down this adventure of putin 's . 
  trade sanctions will speed things up , but russia can just as easily fuck with the economic trade of other countries , and specially put some pain on ukraine . 
  / u/dfractalh has now sent troops to protect it 's people from / u/datr0ll 's instability ... for peace of course . 
  they should have changed it to `` heroic '' before entering the ukrainian raid instance . 
  better gear that way . 
  rookie mistake raid leader putin !, 
  ~ ~ wait ... is there oil nearby ? ~ ~ we shall help our brothers in ukraine acquire the ~ ~ oil ~ ~ freedom ... or whatever . 
  can confirm , i do n't mind the troops ( no bias of course ), 
  it really is amazing the people in this thread asking the us/eu to go to war with russia . 
  putting the whole nuclear holocaust aside , a mere declaration of war between any of these entities would collapse stock markets , and then resources would be withheld , which russia exports quite a bit of . 
  on top of it there is no middle ground in a `` war '' with russia . 
  either we 're attacking/killing each other or we 're not . 
  russia will end up losing honestly , but the collateral damage would me massive for all countries involved . 
  us here ... can confirm . 
  the entire southern part of the us is bat shit crazy uninformed . 
  it would then de-legitimize the ukrainian revolution , and we 'd be called western imperialist that are blood thirty for war . 
  if we do n't do anything we 're western dogs that are blood thirsty ** and ** cowards !, 
  we 're kinda fucked either way . 
  massive civil war yes , but the winner would n't have been a foreign power that previously owned the land . 
  it would have been still owned by the original founders ... well not the native americans because they were kinda being annihilated ... but yeah . 
  maybe some french/british interest would have tried to reclaim some land . 
  the people fighting had a disagreement over slaves and the whole agriculture-vs-industrial political/domestic problems the north and south had . 
  they had fought a revolutionary war , and they claimed their country for it . 
  now they were fighting because they hated each other due to different directions they were going in their development . 
  i 'm not a history major so most of it is from my college courses/history channel/wiki stuff i remember . 
  although the south is still pretty fucked up though . 
  `` i 'm the president of ukraine '' - commanded the ukrainian president , in russia , to russian government officials , from a russian safe house . 
  no . . really ... they are the crazies of texas . 
  their argument is based on some inane reference from the past when texas was a nation for a brief period of time . 
  on average ... they 're going to be the ones hating the blacks/mexicans/brown people and have a large enough armory to invade a small country . 
  so ... always go full genocide ... never half ass it . 
  also , disease immunity was the us 's friend . 
   clearly what is done is done . 
  europe is redrawn for better and worse , and only more conflict can come from not accepting that fact . 
  as someone from the us that does n't really have these land reclamation problems it 's always amazed me how many problems in europe/asia still boil down to this . 
  we 're fortunate to be an isolated country with only two neighbors , and i ca n't imagine the problems if we also bordered a few other countries that we had been at war with in the past . 
  although i do n't trust those canadians ... i feel they could invade at any moment . 
  also considering i 'm from texas , we have a lot of those `` secede '' weirdos that you encounter every once in a while . 
  although texas ** is ** obviously the greatest * nation * on earth & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  if you ask putin ... democracy . 
  yeah , i also think the last thing putin wants is western friendly `` rebels '' that do n't particularly like russia in a civil war . 
  but ... but they promised . 
  you say that now !, 
  the canadians have always plotted to invade alaska !, 
  and if we do n't , were imperialist war hungry dogs . 
  it 's a no win situation for us either way . 
  how many of this money losing enterprises are due to the corrupt rich pocketing funds ? 
  i would imagine it 's huge the amount of money that never enters the countries coffers . 
  i 'm mixed on what the protests should do , but a few months could have given the presidents cronies and putin enough time to weasel out of the agreement and slowly undo their gains . 
  seen it time after time where they just stay in power , so i ca n't blame the protests for being suspicious of the government that was killing them a few hours earlier .
