if does happen without any intervention , then that is the market chosen by the consumer ( which given rational consumers , is the best market ) . 
  monopolies or oligopolies are not inherently bad . 
  if the monopoly tries to take advantage of the market then it will breed competition and the monopoly/oligopoly would end . 
  we currently have many oligopolies today due to regulation as well ( think gas companies , cell phone companies [ for na , i think eur is better in this regard ] ) . 
  i do n't think this is true in practice or historically . 
  industries with huge economies of scale have incredibly high barriers to entry , once a monopoly gets established they can abuse price fixing to raise profits and if anybody * tries * to enter the market immediately leverage their superior position to undercut the competition and put them out of business . 
  monopolies were more common historically with less regulation and they were broken up by the government for very good reasons , the phone and oil industry were two of the industries that specifically trended towards monopoly before the u.s. was heavily involved in regulating the market and needed to be broken up . 
  that they 've managed to return to oligopolies in this time of weakened regulations and rampant corporate lobbying is a testament to the natural tendencies of the market and poor implementation/repeal of regulatory policies . 
  you can even see this behavior taking place in the wild right now as opec has flexed their muscle to drop the price of the oil barrel in an attempt to bankrupt the emerging shale oil industry . 
   this is hardest to argue in support for , but i 'd argue early usa was fairly close to libertarianism market . 
  the early u.s. also had rampant problems with mis/dishonestly labeled products , worker safety , consumer safety , utility standardization , and national infrastructure in general . 
  `` snake oil salesman '' were common enough that the word is still part of the popular consciousness . 
  i do n't disagree that our system is very flawed . 
  honestly i think the success of a system has a lot more to do with the implementation than the ideology . 
  i believe both a libertarian society or a fully communist society could succeed in some fashion if they were implemented by passionate , effective , unselfish leadership with the full support of society , but that 's a pipe dream . 
  i write off communism because they seem to lack a cogent economic plan despite some valid criticisms of capitalism and i write off libertarianism because they seem to have a difficult time getting reality to conform to their economic models . 
  6 years ago my facebook feed was chock full of ron paul supporters claiming the fall of the u.s. fiat dollar was just around the corner and here we are today with the u.s. one of the better performing economies in the world and austerity performing pretty horribly in europe . 
   why not ? 
  and note i am asking about libertarian theory , and not anarcho-capitalism which is a whole other mindset despite what some people believe basically ? 
  because regulation does a ton of good and a completely free market in many industries naturally gravitates towards monopoly or oligopoly , which eliminates the original benefits of the market system . 
  i think many of the benefits of a libertarian system are entirely too hypothetical and untested in real life , whereas given what we actually have tried , semi-socialist systems seem to provide a higher overall quality of life and happiness to their people . 
  in my mind capitalism provides a wonderful engine to motivate and drive society but can easily run amok without a good framework built around it to steer and control it . 
   our philosophy derives that you can do what you want so long as you do not harm others . 
  libertarians are pro-choice ( or should be ) . 
  now if you consider a featus a human being , that 's a whole other discussion . 
  i believe rand paul is explicitly pro-life as a part of his platform ? 
  i agree with the libertarian party line here , just not rand paul . 
  first : i minored in economics and i 'm a committed neo-keynesian ( paul krugman 4 lyfe ! ) . 
  i can respect that reasonable and intelligent people can disagree on this issue but i just do n't see libertarian economic philosophy working out in real life . 
  so that 's a big negative right there . 
  second : i 'm staunchly pro-choice until such a time that we can safely and non-invasively remove zygotes from mothers and raise them to term in an artificial wombs on the scale needed to do away with abortion . 
  in my mind the right to life does n't extend to a right to impinge on another person 's sovereign control of their body . 
  third : i 've seen several articles on him flip flopping and directly contradicting earlier statements ( or even denying he made them ) . 
  it 's hard to say how credible these sorts of smear articles are but it reinforces my general feeling that he 's much more the politician and less the principled ideologue than his father . 
  i may disagree with ron paul on a lot of policy issues but i absolutely respect his integrity and desire to do what he views as right . 
  i do n't think his son is as bad as most politicians , but i do n't have * too * much confidence in him either . 
  just my 2c . 
  i may not like everything he stands for but he sure looks a lot better than the competition !, 
  i 'll take an honest socialist any day over a two faced politician in the pocket of private interests . 
  hell , i kinda like rand paul and trump on the other side because they have some of that same ` disconnected from the establishment ' feel , and they both come with some huge downsides from my point of view . 
  they actually play a very different role in american politics as the only immigrant community that 's primarily republican . 
  the republicans have been staunchly anti-castro and they 've been rewarded with the loyalty of the old cuban generation that hates him . 
  domestically they have a lot of similarities with other refugees and immigrants , but there are also some key differences . 
  awesome detailed breakdown , thank you . 
  that 's what i was looking for . 
  ahh . 
  i was n't aware the attempted illegal behavior was blocked , my impression was they got away with it , thanks for clarifying . 
  i was n't attempting to justify their actions , i have no horse in this race and am well aware of my ignorance of the specifics , i was more trying to highlight the danger of breaking traditional rules of ` fair ' political competition . 
  that 's what allows those apologists to present a justification for this power grab . 
  my impression is that the previous government went extra-legal and used underhanded and potentially unconstitutional methods to stack the supreme court , so now the current government does n't feel obliged to play ` fair ' either and has now one-upped their underhandedness . 
  maybe someone with a better understanding can clarify , but to me it highlights the danger of violating civic traditions of government ; once respect for the spirit of the law is lost the road to authoritarianism becomes a lot shorter . 
  wait what the fuck this guy could actually go to jail ? 
  i was a little out of touch and kinda skimming the reading material on this , just enjoying the stupid songs . 
  dang , that 's fucked . 
  we let canada have a couple teams so we can claim we defeated the world . 
  we americans have a hard time taking something seriously unless we 're the best at it . 
   ** actually matters **  ** euro ** vision does not compute . 
  if several million people did , it would literally make you a giraffe . 
  websters would add an entry and everything , that 's how words work . 
  to argue the devils advocate position ( and to be fair , i 'm an american with american views on free speech , i still think the guy 's an asshole ) : they do n't self identify as terrorists , they self identify as islamic . 
  when you try to pin down what exactly defines a terrorist , it 's very difficult to do . 
   not me . 
  no idea what kind of `` damage '' you 're talking about , it 's a natural proces and it does n't matter if you like it or not , this is just how we reproduce . 
  this kind of comparations are ususally useless , the parents are `` donors '' of their gametes . 
  google `` vaginal tearing '' . 
  birth is a traumatic and painful process because it is causing damage to your body , damage that used to be severe enough to have a good chance of killing you . 
   i 've asked you to read the definition of life , you should have it in biology classes anyway , or at least i hope that 's in american schools curriculum . 
  read . 
  did ** you ** read it ? 
  right here , front and center :  ** it is a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life . 
  ** [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] this is partially because life is a process , not a substance . 
  [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] ** any definition must be general enough to both encompass all known life and any unknown life that may be different from life on earth ** i challenge you again to ** list the characteristics ** that make a zygote life but not a sperm , or admit you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   you 're obviously wrong , we can control it only as far as contraception works . 
  mothers ( and fathers ) should be awared of that when they decides what to do with their `` bodies '' . 
  we can also have abortions , which clearly end the pregnancy . 
  that is another form of birth control , so yeah , we can control whether children follow from sex , the technology is clearly present . 
   once again i repeat , humans in embrional period of their life are separate organisms ( bodies ) , even if dependant on their mothers . 
  excuse me if i think that someones comfort is not enough to justyfie elimination of another human . 
  you are a separate organism and body from me . 
  you would not have the right to live from blood transfusions from my body , even if you needed them to survive . 
  the fact that you consider them separate entities does n't give them the right to live inside and upon the body of another , damaging and changing it in the process . 
   i 'm afraid it is , not a single biologist , not even a phisician which somehow excuses aborting humans , would consider gametes as living organisms and deny that zygote is a one . 
  deliberatelly i 've mentioned sometic cells , also because they 're diploids . 
  you are wrong . 
  a simple google will show you that there are many people that disagree on this subject and no scientific consensus . 
  please list the characteristics a fertilized egg possesses that a sperm does not that qualify it for your definition of `` life '' . 
   so i tell you once again that arguing with independence or viability outside of mothers womb is a fallacy . 
  you keep saying this and i keep finding your arguments lacking . 
   there were developed ways to treat premature births and humans are dependant on mothers for many years even after they mature during puberty . 
  i already explained the relevant differences between dependent children outside the womb and those within . 
  the mother can simply give them up for adoption and walk away , additionally , her body is completely under her control . 
   also , once again i repeat that intercourse leads to procreation and if it 's not a rape , then the argument about `` unwanted '' offspring is moot . 
  intercourse does not lead to procreation unless we choose to allow it to . 
  we have the power to make this choice now , so we do . 
  whether the offspring is ` wanted ' or not has nothing to do with the mother 's right to decide what happens to her body . 
   so we have a conflict of interests here and unless we get a compromise and develop some technology to avoid this problem , we have no other choice to preserve the life of both parts . 
  simply not true , literally false actually . 
  the woman 's right to control over her own body trumps the rights of non-viable unborn humans who are incapable of surviving without their mother 's wombs . 
  we do have the choice to allow women to have abortions and we do allow them to have them . 
   no , gametes are not living organism , neither somatic cells are .
