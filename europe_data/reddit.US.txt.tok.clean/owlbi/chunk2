  please , read the definition of life . 
  this is your opinion , it is not established scientific fact . 
  i think a sperm is one of the two haploid forms of the human organism . 
  the other haploid form of human is the unfertilized egg . 
  under the proper conditions a haploid form may join with another haploid form of the opposit type and become a diploid form human . 
  if all goes well that diploid form will mature to produce many more haploid humans . 
  many biologists would agree with me . 
   and i see it clearly because zygote in her own `` body '' is a separate human . 
  excuse me if i think that every human is a subject , not an object . 
  i see the zygote as a separate entity too , though i would n't consider it fully worthy of human rights until it 's viable outside the womb . 
  regardless , neither it 's status as a separate entity , nor hypothetical status as a full human being in it 's own right ( which i do n't consider it as having ) would give it the right to live inside someone else 's body against their will . 
   no , i 'm telling once again that an offspring organism is not their own organism ( `` body '' , if you insist ) and that the humans which are dependent on the others are not their `` property '' . 
  i would n't consider the fetus the property of the woman , but her womb most definitely is and if she does n't want a fetus in it , that 's her right . 
   zygote is an early stage of organism developement , if it 's a human zygote , then it 's a human organism , it fulfills all the biologic criteria of a living organism sperm fulfill all these same criteria . 
   what you 're trying to talk about are the conditions set by some politicians and ideologues in order to excuse elimination of that human organism . 
  otherwise known as `` laws '' , and `` rights '' . 
  yes , the woman 's right to control over her own body absolutely does excuse the elimination of a zygote . 
  i see no contradiction . 
   you stated that the fetus has rights to it 's own body . 
  meaning that you were talking about aborting an unborn child rather than a fetus in early stage of development . 
  you 're not being very clear here . 
  are you distinguishing between different trimesters of development ? 
  or are you saying i somehow ceded a philosophical point by calling it an unborn child ? 
  the development of zygote towards full human status is a spectrum , not a switch . 
  i do n't really see that much of a moral difference between a fertilized egg and sperm / an unfertilized egg , but the closer one gets to birth the closer it gets to being a human that i view as worthy of full human rights . 
  where exactly one draws that line is personal and subjective ; there is no scientific consensus , so i do n't really focus on that argument . 
  my reasoning , and the court 's , is that viability is an important distinction for legal reasons because it represents the moment at which the fetus is no longer dependent on a parasitic relationship with the mother . 
   just saying that by giving something that never had rights to it 's body to begin with you 're doing exact oposite of what your original intent was . 
  no , it 's not as black and white as that . 
  you can read the whole roe v wade decision text [ here ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113 ) if you 're interested , but they go into past precedent for the legal consideration for fetal rights and considerations as well as the state 's interest in preserving unborn life , the justification behind it , and where and why they draw the line . 
  exerpt from the supreme court ruling on abortion ( roe v. wade ) :  with respect to the state 's important and legitimate interest in potential life , the ** `` compelling '' point is at viability . 
  this is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother 's womb ** . 
  state regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications . 
  if the state is interested in protecting fetal life after viability , it may go so far as to proscribe abortion [ p164 ] during that period , except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother . 
   measured against these standards , art . 
  1196 of the texas penal code , in restricting legal abortions to those `` procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother , '' sweeps too broadly . 
  the statute makes no distinction between abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed later , and it limits to a single reason , `` saving '' the mother 's life , the legal justification for the procedure . 
  the statute , therefore , can not survive the constitutional attack made upon it here . 
  in other words , the court found that the mother 's right to privacy and personal medical choice under the advisement of her physician outweighed any state interest in preserving potential life up until the point of `` viability '' where the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb . 
   in your case you could very well abort a child 5-7months in because it does n't have the rights to the body of another person . 
  as if it 's an unwelcome tennant that can be simply kicked out . 
  no , it 's well past viability at that point and someone else ( the state ) can choose to step in and provide for it . 
  also once you 've started parenting a child you 've effectively accepted some responsibility for it , which is how we end up with legal justifications for parental care requirements until 18 , child support , etc. 
   they have , except that they should n't have absolute authority over the other humans . 
  if they do n't have access to abortion then they do n't have control over their own wombs . 
  you are telling them what they can and can not do with their own body . 
   eliminating sick and `` unwanted '' humans is not a medical solution , even hipocrates was against it , but who cares about it today . 
  eliminating sick humans ? 
  where have i ever advocated for that ? 
  zygotes are n't yet fully human , and by the time they they possess the biological criteria we consider human , we start restricting abortion . 
  basically once the fetus has a good chance for sustainability outside the womb we grant it full human rights . 
   good , but until then we have nothing else but human wombs . 
  yes , and women should have absolute authority over their own wombs . 
   we can not control most of processes that are taking place in our own bodies , another person like phisician can do it , but still is limited . 
  so what ? 
  we can control this . 
  our inability to control * everything * is not an argument against controlling what we can . 
  their are people researching artificial wombs right now . 
   you ca n't control or `` dominate '' some natural processes that happends inside your body . 
  yes we literally can . 
  that 's pretty much what the field of medicine * is * . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
  if someone needed a blood transfusion from you every day to survive , should you be legally required to give it to them ? 
  if we had the technology to remove the fetus from the mother without pain or trauma to her , and then carry it to term artificially , we would . 
  as we do not have that technology , it 's right to life does not outweigh the mother 's right to absolute dominion over her own body . 
   the offspring body , organism actually , is not mother 's organism . 
  it 's defenceless and ca n't claim its rights . 
  it has no rights to the body of another person , only it 's own body . 
   ask your biology teacher , the `` baby '' is just a common name ask my biology teacher ? 
  how old do you think i am ? 
  i 'm aware of the different terms for different stages of embryonic development , thanks . 
   and no , sorry but we do n't grow from tadpoles . 
  never said this . 
   some humans at age 30 are not able to survive without their parents in the real world . 
  and we do n't legally require their parents to do anything for them , because they have no right to ** demand ** that of them . 
  sure , parents can choose to provide , and mothers can choose to give birth . 
  that 's what it 's about , choice . 
  control over one 's own body . 
  humans age 3 are capable of surviving without the mother , should another choose to nourish them ( and the state is always willing to step in and do so ) . 
  they do n't ** require ** a traumatic and debilitating parasitic relationship with another human being to live , neither does a teenager . 
  we would n't force someone to give a three year old blood transfusions every day , even if the 3 year old needed them to live . 
  that does n't mean we 're infringing on the 3 year old 's right to life . 
  a mother having an abortion is n't choosing to kill anyone , she 's simply asserting control over her own body . 
  if we had a * non-invasive , non-traumatic * way to remove the fetus and the state could then carry it to term artificially , we would do that instead . 
  it 's still debilitating , traumatic , and does permanent damage to the mother 's body . 
  it 's not about guilt , nobody is guilty of anything , it 's about having control over your own body ; the one thing you should have the right to control above all else . 
  i do n't see a fertilized egg as a baby . 
  it 's a zygote , less organically complex than a tadpole for quite some while . 
  at the point where it becomes more human , and especially at the point where it starts becoming more capable of surviving outside the womb , then i start to consider it worth affording full human rights . 
  that 's why we have laws restricting abortions past certain lengths of time . 
  the analogy was about a person who needs something from someone else that requires an intrusive and dangerous risk to their body . 
  the organ in question does n't matter , all that matters is that the person in need will die without the hypothetical aid . 
  just because they really need that help does n't give them the right to demand the other person put themselves in danger and through trauma . 
   fetus is just an organism in prenatal stage of life , it 's neither an organ like kidney , nor a gemete like sperm , all of these typical comparations are simply false and based on ignorance . 
  we do n't have technology to breed outside of our bodies , there 's fertilisation on glass ( in vitoro ) and it 's possible to treat premature births , but ther 're still limits and unless there 's developed another way , humans will be reproducing sexually and growing in uterus . 
  how is any of this supposed to support your argument against abortion , exactly ? 
  a fetus is a premature and incomplete stage of human life , with similarities to both sperm , zygotes , and gametes but also significant differences . 
  we have the technology to terminate unwanted pregnancies , so we allow women the sovereignty over their bodies to choose whether they wish to go through the trauma and risk of pregnancy . 
  it 's the right thing to do . 
   no , baby 's body is not her body .
