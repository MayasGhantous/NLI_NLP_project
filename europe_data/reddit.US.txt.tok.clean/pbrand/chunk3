  same for [ brazil ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=olympic+medal+rankings&amp;rlz=1c1chfx_enus629us629&amp;oq=olympic+medal+rankings&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3007j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8#mie=oly%2c%5b%22%2fm%2f03tnk7%22%2c1%2c%22m%22%2c1%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2c0%5d ) , which has 200 million people but underperforms countries like new zealand and canada which have 10 % of its population ... in gross medals . 
  not even per capita . 
  per capita is a severely dumb discussion when there are caps on applicants , i 'm sorry . 
  you ca n't analyze that value when there 's a bottleneck . 
  good post , lots of proof and rhetoric . 
  really embodies the german sturm und drang feels over reals . 
   just so usa wo n't go down on some list . 
  no , i 'm offended at the faulty math and general nationalist anti-intellectualism . 
  i already gave you examples where per capita is valid , such as gdp , gdp per ppp , hdi , or ihdi . 
  none of those have bottlenecks . 
  you do n't have an application period in which 20 of the richest americans get to apply for the official gdp census , and only their data is collected ( ignoring the other 314,999,980 poor people ) . 
  then suddenly that becomes the official us gdp per capita stat . 
  the size of the incoming pool is quite irrelevant when the bottleneck is so small . 
  in fact , it favors small countries ( so long as you care about faulty per capita calculations ) . 
  so long as your 2 million-strong country can field 16 fencers , and 1 of them wins a gold medal , suddenly your ratio of 1 gold per 2 million people can trump the per capita ratio of a 29.99 million country that wins 15 gold medals in other categories . 
  that 's mathematical bullshit , my friend , even counting incoming pools . 
  population is n't some magic you toss at a pool and get magic results out of . 
  that 's what doping is for , not 1,000,000,000 indians . 
   a country with a larger population has more people to draft their competitors from , not a difficult concept to figure out ... 
  apparently population is the only thing that matters , which is why india is an olympics superstar . 
  right ? 
  edit :  you just seem butthurt about this whole thing . 
  oh now i get it , you 're a bigot who judges people off flags instead of post content . 
  very progressive . 
   scaled down , usa gets the best of their 300 sportsmen while finland in comparison gets the best of 5 . 
  so why are n't you comparing per capita of medals per sportsmen ( i.e. 
  applicants to the national olympic team ) instead of the whole population , since the capita value is throttled by [ maximum team size ] ( http://assets.ngin.com/attachments/document/0069/9415/2016_sog_fen_ath.pdf ) ? 
  you want the appearance of mathematical vigor without the actual math behind it . 
  per capita is a fairly useless attribute when there 's a bottleneck . 
  gdp per capita , murder per capita , education per capita , etc. 
  are all sound statistics in contrast because they are n't throttled by team size or an arbitrary entrant limit . 
  they affect everyone without limitation , ergo it 's a valid stat to measure per capita . 
  is n't the number of competitors capped per country ( especially team based sports ) ? 
  i 'm struggling to think of a way that per capita is valid when everyone gets , say , 5 fencers . 
  if the usa could enter all 20,000 of its basketball players while lithuania fields all 300 of its players , yes , there would be unfair mathematics in ratio if medals . 
  but that 's not the case : both teams field one team of an equal number of competitors . 
  no , the general pattern is that the religious nutjobs are coastal south , which is n't `` a large middle part '' as per / u/anephemeralthrowaway 's ignorant characterization . 
  yeah , that includes tennessee and kentucky , which are n't coastal themselves but are just one state away from the ocean . 
  as opposed to the `` true middle '' states like north dakota or colorado who have just as few evangelicals as california or oregon .

  first of all : my condolences to sweden . 
  i hope the victims are not related to anyone who posts here . 
  on the topic of gwb , that quote always irked me because it 's ineloquent and a bit misrepresentative of what i think truly is the issue . 
  it 's not really ` they hate us for our freedom , ' but closer to ` they hate us for not choosing islam with our freedom . ', 
  even though islam has tended to spread by the sword , there are voluntary converts to it . 
  the people who ca n't speak english generally segregate themselves off in cultural ghettoes and do n't interact with english speakers ( because they ca n't ) . 
  so it 's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy , except on border states . 
  their children might avoid that fate if they 're put through public schooling , but at that point the next generation is already culturally american and most of them do n't speak their parents ' language . 
  the american public school system is the most effective integration tool we 've got . 
  the melting pot is really more about ideas , customs , and food more than it is about language . 
  unlike the normans forcing french vocabulary on the english or the soviets forcing russian on polish people , the power structure of language here is a bit different . 
  the immigrants who come here are n't french-speaking nobles who force words like `` military '' and `` philosophy '' into the language , they make `` pico de gallo '' and `` pljeskavica '' and sometimes the natives learn that . 
  but they are n't really forced at swordpoint , because like i mentioned before there 's the unfortunate phenomena of cultural ghettoes . 
  americans generally start in high school , which is around age 14 . 
  they learn a few years of spanish or french ( sometimes german , like myself ) and forget it all within a decade of disuse because the nearest neighbors with which to practice ( quebec and mexico ) are generally thousands of miles away . 
  the internet obviously exists as a resource , but there are a few obstacles to fluency . 
  the first is that practicing by reading and typing on forums only improves reading/writing , which are pathetically easy compared to listening/speaking . 
  for the latter , exposure to french and spanish media ( like film , tv , and youtube ) would be the best antidote but ... those are n't too common in comparison to the gargantuan presence of english media . 
  i also would n't wish german tv upon my worst enemy . 
  tl ; dr : having thousands of square miles of nothing but english speakers on this continent unsurprisingly means americans learn a second language and forget a language quite handily . 
  here are some influential thinkers from the civic nationalist movement during the 1880s : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_stuart_mill https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ernest_renan the modern gut reaction to nationalism as being some sort of orwellian `` doubleplusungood '' really irks me . 
  there are two major types of nationalism , ethnic nationalism and civic nationalism . 
  simply saying `` nationalism is bad '' is unintellectual because it throws civic nationalism out too . 
  more education is required in this area ( in my country too ) for the average citizen . 
  i 'd argue that high school/secondary school age would be an appropriate time for teenagers to learn the basics of international politics so that they do n't `` learn '' that nationalism is some snarl word on tumblr . 
  you got downvoted by someone , not sure why . 
   and did not realise that this sub is pro-eu . 
  i 'm fine with it actually , but the spurning of britain should be done elsewhere . 
  / r/europe still contains non-eu members , whether it 's norway , switzerland , and now britain . 
  i have n't seen really any hazing of norwegians or swiss for not being in the eu during the time i 've been subscribed here . 
   if you want to ignore reality , oh no , i completely acknowledge reality . 
  but bringing up gross gdp in a conversation of `` this state keeps the other afloat '' is pure poppycock . 
  california barely keeps itself afloat . 
  it gives the federal government 4.2 billion dollars in taxes and 3.9 billion dollars of taxes is spent on it . 
  it is not keeping anything `` afloat '' ( other than itself ) by any means . 
  the fact that you bring up gross gdp for a topic that per-capita clearly matters more is where the ignorance lies . 
   are you done bullshitting ? 
  are you ? 
  you singled out 2 states that are n't even in the top 5 , when discussing a union of 50 states . 
  if you want to discuss the usa , try knowing something about it first , beyond a pleb tourist 's ignorant scope of `` everything is new york and california . '', 
  oh i 'm fine with calling english a peasant language . 
  but we 're all speaking it , not just me . 
  i 've been subscribed to / r/europe for at least three years now and i 'm honestly tired of the recent trite brit-bashing . 
  they want to leave the eu , who cares ? 
  europe is a geographic entity . 
  people who hate britain should be whining in / r/eu , if that subreddit even exists . 
   gross not really applicable here . 
  california generates a lot of federal tax and it also sucks up a lot of federal tax . 
  per capita is more appropriate in this particular case to avoid the case of `` extremely large california barely subsidizes itself . '', 
  wrong states there , buddy .

  illinois 5 . 
  connecticut but yeah , ny is 6th . 
  california has no place in your statement . 
  no matter how much embarrassing brit-bashing goes on modern-day / r/europe , i 'll always find solace in the fact that 98 % + of the threads are in the english language . 
  it 's fine though , push the brits towards us : /, 
  actually it mostly does .
