  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) religion is a particularly strong meme , and countries like saudi arabia believe they 're more stable when they prevent women from driving and stone people for being gay or raped . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_r._price here 's one person who tried to test the limits of that theory by analyzing the extremes of historical human behavior like warfare , suicide , and genocide . 
  the idea that `` suicide bombing ( literal gene-killing ) a sufficiently foreign group of genes ( let 's say , 3000 people ) at the expense of aborting one 's own genes was a logical net positive if it improved the stability of that suicide-bomber 's surviving genetic-proximates ( i.e. 
  close family ) '' drove price insane and he killed himself with scissors . 
  going back to darwin 's memes , i do n't think that tradeoff necessarily has to be genetic -- there are people who hate capitalist globalism so much that they 'd trade their lives to kill that same number of people by flying a plane into them . 
  trade 19 for 2996 , net positive . 
  you 're free to put all of your eggs into the cultural meme basket though , but do n't peddle the frankly ignorant bullshit that the genetic basket does n't have the same science behind it . 
  it 's in the same goddamn book , the selfish gene . 
  splitting hairs is the preferred phrase in american english too , not sure about other englishes though . 
  deal 's on then . 
  you can pay our 2 % , then the remaining 314999999 of us will freeload . 
  do n't forget to pay the bill by the end of the month . 
  thanks !, 
   ethnic muslims  ethnic ... what ? 
  if you 're ever uncertain of english syntax , blame william the conquerer of 1066 . 
  seriously . 
  just call him an asshole . 
  well yes , modern communication tech allows questionable politicians to say stuff like ' i have two sets of policies , one for behind closed doors with goldman sachs and another out in the open . ', 
  then that gets leaked or hacked , then voters feel duped . 
  tech is equivalent to transparency in this case . 
  i 'm really baffled at how a lot of political subs are falling for this diversion tactic . 
  yes , the russians probably obtained information with a phishing attempt and pushed that toward wikileaks , in the worst possible case . 
  solution ? 
  american politicians need more safety regulations in their communication protocol because they 've ( clinton , podesta , etc. ), 
  proven themselves to be incompetent retards in that regard . 
  boom , done . 
  there 's no more discussion you can squeak out of that -- cybersecurity is real and it 's about time lazy politicians start treating it as a serious thing just like every private sector employee with a critical/confidential job . 
  this whole ordeal , especially couched in fake-news style language like ` russia 's election hack , ' is blowing it up into something it 's not . 
  worse , gullible american voters may read that headline and come to the false conclusion that russia went into ballot machines and adjusted numbers . 
  hillary and the dnc made embarrassing emails that would have lost them the election * if spoken aloud to the public , * no russians necessary . 
  bump up the netsec and stop crying , everyone , please . 
  i 'm embarrassed that people continually fall for these cheap talking point diversions , as if i need any more reason to be embarrassed for my country . 
  thank you so much for doing these . 
  uh , quite the contrary . 
  there were two big categories of colonizers in the usa , [ those who came due to religious persecution ( the puritans ) ] ( https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel01.html ) and those who came for economic interest . 
  the pilgrims in particular were a separatist religious group that was forced out of the church of england and founded the religious colony of plymouth . 
  charles i dissolved parliament in 1629 specifically as a move to destroy the power of puritans within the government , and naturally after being disempowered , many of them left to create a `` pure '' christian society . 
  argue at their success or whether it was a good idea , but it happened , and it happened for that reason . 
  they got their foot in the door , survived a few harsh winters on an unforgiving land , and then proceeded to try to [ convert the natives to christianity ] ( http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/native-americans-treatment-spain-vs-england ) . 
  when that failed , the natives were pushed back and evicted from their own land due to increasing settlements . 
  displaced , if you will . 
  there is precedent of refugees displacing existing populations , and my country is a shining example . 
  it comes down to different cultures and population growth . 
  if you want to lay down and die , sure , that 's your prerogative , but i do n't think you should wag the finger at your countrymen ( continent-men ? ), 
  who have looked at human history and decided '' * i do n't want that . 
  next up on reparationstv : germans are allowed to shit up hungary due to historical displacement by the huns , italians the same to sweden ( ostrogoths ) , russia and eastern europe can guilt trip mongolia , turkey will give whites and blacks reparations for the ottoman slave trade , and ... no wait , let 's stop this nonsense of guilt . 
  you know just as well as i do mongolians do n't feel an ounce of guilt what they historically did to central asia and europe . 
  and that 's fine . 
  if there happens to be a mongolian citizen who feels guilty about his country 's past and wants to donate his own wealth to the descendants of the allegedly disaffected , he 's free to do that . 
  and so should you . 
  but do n't force your guilt complex on others because setting a precedent is going to spiral out of control . 
  here 's a variety of sources , chronologically : ** 07/12/15 : ** https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration ** 08/12/15 : ** http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/ ** 13/06/16 : ** http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/13/trump-if-elected-ill-ban-immigration-from-areas-with-terrorism-ties.html ** 10/11/16 : ** http://www.vox.com/world/2016/11/10/13577474/president-elect-donald-trump-muslim-ban ------------------------------ the normative assessment is that he cast his net wide , then retracted it . 
  `` all muslims '' became `` people from conflict zones . '', 
  and , like the progressive website vox states , both are actually within us law . 
  our bill of rights does not apply to non-us citizens , so religion is n't relevant here . 
  in effect , us policy toward incoming immigrants is very much in the context of a. ), 
  whether they do immediate harm to us and b. ), 
  whether they boost our economy . 
  in terms of the specifics of the policy , or method , no one knows yet . 
  on one hand it 's unfortunate that the public is left in the dark on the specifics , but on the other hand if isis and other rogue actors knew how to game our system ( through our requirements ) they 'd more easily be able to circumvent a system designed to keep them out . 
   they are behaving rationally and have a common-sense . 
  you ( we ? ), 
  are not . 
  altruism is n't really rational . 
  in fact , many cases of altruism are harmful , in the sense that they treat symptoms instead of the root of a problem . 
  you can take 2 % of the middle east 's population every crisis , but that 's ignoring that they do n't use condoms and rely on very unstable economic monoculture ( oil , natural gas , etc. ), 
  to sustain their lifestyle instead of diversifying . 
  [ by the time you take the newest wave of refugees , there will simply be 5 children to replace them , all doomed to the same outcome . ] ( https://youtu.be/zdceliplhwq ) . 
  and that 's not even considering cases of western direct intervention , ex : britain 's balfour declaration , france/britain 's boundary line designation , usa 's iraq/afghanistan invasion , etc. 
  suddenly trump 's vetting program does n't sound so insane . 
  cue the downvotes i guess , because he 's clearly retarded in other areas but i 'm not mentioning them here for brevity . 
  i 'm not really sure it 's a fair comparison . 
  assuming [ this ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/517155/reddit-user-distribution-usa-gender/ ) data is trustworthy , there are about twice as many males that browse reddit than females , so that 's 2x the pool of potential `` fringe '' population . 
   not really sure why it 's such a hard concept to grasp in 2017 . 
  probably the development of capital-intensive economies as well as the welfare state between then and now . 
  the first ensures that you have a caste of people in your country who is willing to sell their countryman downriver for a euro ( earned from a foreigner ) . 
  the second one requires that your country maintain a certain birthrate (  2.1 ) so that the money that the young pay into the system stabilizes the needs of the elderly . 
  invasions are approved by traitors who profit off the outcome . 
  sort of like opening the castle portcullis but adding a toll to it . 
   it works for australia . 
  just to provide some data for this claim : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11554161/how-australias-migrant-policy-works-and-is-it-transferable-to-the-mediterranean.html two interactive graphs there , one is boats per year ( of illegal migrants ) and one is humans per year ( on those boats ) . 
  boats peak at 86 in 1999 and drop off a cliff nearly to nothing ( 1 ) by 2002 . 
  the number of people total peaks in 2001 at 5520 and drops off a cliff to ... one person in 2002 . 
  had to take a second glance there myself . 
  the [ `` pacific solution '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) policy , which created detention centers in nauru and papua new guinea and broadcast a message to migrants that their trip would not likely end in successful asylum , was begun 27 september 2001 . 
  capitalism and nationalism seem to be increasingly competitive philosophies ( or bodies of thought , or organizational structures , whatever you want to call them ) nowadays . 
  how can i identify with certain citizens who live within my country who do their best to exploit the remaining vast majority of my countrymen ? 
  those in the global elite remove themselves culturally from the rest of us ( americans , i mean ) and probably spend more time on the plane speaking with multinational businessmen than they do the average lower class or middle class american . 
  it 's increasingly difficult to consider us all to be part of one nation . 
  and the relationship is n't both ways here , it 's always , * always * the upper class exploiting that relationship , not the other way around . 
  while true , that theory still leans heavily on the effectiveness of dogma over a certain population . 
  a citizen uncritically accepting ` gayz are n't bad lol ' from a government is n't very far away from ` gayz are bad lol ' from a state church . 
  if dogma were truly effective the result would be approximately the same, 
   or the business is no longer viable if they have to significantly increase wages and it closes down . 
  their fault for trying to run an unsustainable business that relies on abusing an exploitative labor supply . 
  that 's capitalism . 
   or they invest in automation and then can reduce their demand for manual workers . 
  highly likely indeed , it 's just a matter of whether labor is valued to x # ( x being defined as the tipping point where automation is more profitable ) or whether the government , under pressure from their ( potentially angry and unemployed/underemployed ) constituents , raises the minimum wage to that x # marker . 
  either can happen , business will respond in the same way so long as the technology is actually up to snuff . 
  inflation erodes the working classes ' wages every year , so it 's an inevitable ticking clock toward that outcome .
