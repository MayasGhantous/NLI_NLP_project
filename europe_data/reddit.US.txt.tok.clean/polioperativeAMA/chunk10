  i just pissed them off and told them i was a republican and they 'd get so mad they would n't be coherent . 
  it has a shared intelligence agreement in 5-eyes . 
  maybe he is confused because the usss is a national policing agency . 
  its not realpolitiks or trust between leaders , its shared cultural and historic ties that create the relationship in the first place . 
  let 's shit on them is used pretty often in a sports or competitive context . 
   united states downgrading the special relationship with britain in favour of paris and berlin lol , thats a cultural and historic relationship , not a realpolitik one . 
  `` does not compel '' , not `` does not allow '' . 
  and its on its territory , not in its territory . 
  so if someone launched rockets from algeria into france it would be an attack on its territory , not in its territory . 
  lots of thought goes into the difference between `` on '' and `` in . '', 
  any other nation ? 
  so if russia decided tomorrow to invade the uk it would be more than capable and an easy fight . 
  what if the queen goes on a bender and leads the uk to declare war on the us ? 
  or is your entire `` more than capable '' comment relying on the fact that the most effective defense most european nations have is to have their leader [ reach this phone . 
  ] ( http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/4fb24b0eecad04ee59000000/before-you-give-him-money-at-a-fancy-fundraiser-obama-takes-your-cell-phone-away.jpg ), 
  but the uk ca n't defend itself against the biggest boys . 
  so you 've given up the ghost and turned defense into a welfare program as its main point to keep it ? 
  so give up and say `` well we are n't the biggest boys on the block '' ? 
  that 's pretty defeatist , by that logic the uk should just get it over with and petition to be an associated state . 
  and their willingness to put themselves on the line is the same reason there 's a small contingent of us armed forces in estonia . 
  the us would to go to war for nato , but a dead american killed by a ruskie who 's last words were wolverines . 
  the white house and capitol hill would be taken over if we did n't declare war . 
  because some countries do n't want to give up the ghost . 
  okay , what happens if a country decides that iceland does n't need to be independent anymore ? 
  a strongly worded letter from the un , or us intervention . 
  you should n't pin your independence on hopes that someone bigger takes issue with it . 
  the only reason they can afford to not have an army and they exist independently is by the grace and political interplay of other countries . 
  because they have n't given up the ghost like other european countries have ? 
  their willingness to fight , even if they lose , is much more dangerous to an attacker than one who simply throws up their hands and says `` whoops , looks like that was a fun run of independence '' by your logic no one but the us should have armed forces . 
  but they punch above their weight . 
  i mean , neither can easily execute a war halfway around the world , but compared to the rest of europe they punch above their weight . 
  poland . 
  dude , i 'm not watching a video that glorifies a terrorist group . 
  yes , i 'm closeminded , i 've made my decision to not pay any positive attention to terrorists . 
  the headline on the video says `` pkk '', 
  dude its not a codeword . 
  its the name of a revolutionary marxist terrorist group . 
  and both links were to pkk fighters . 
  dude . 
  by definition beduins are arabs . 
  you 're trying to be so politically correct that you 're factually incorrect, 
  so russia and ukraine have a peaceful 200 year history where one side never had taken control or caused a famine ? 
  they also have the longest unmilitarized border in the world ? 
  they also have joint air commands to protect airspace and a history of mutual cooperation and aid ? 
  they have the worlds largest trading relationship ? 
  are there monuments on the border with the gates welded open ? 
  yeah there 's no `` smallest amount '' in the us . 
  once its dangerous , deadly is allowed . 
  but thats fundamentally wrong , http://archive.is/f4gbv, 
  except in the us that 's not true . 
  http://www.hoplofobia.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/armed-resistance-to-crime.pdf and in the us concerns about accidents are irrelevant because we view rights as immutable . 
  yeah the only difference between us and german self-defense besides means is the concept of proportionality . 
  in the us once the attack is possible to cause severe bodily harm or death you can use deadly force . 
  you do n't have to not shoot someone just because they 're unarmed , only if they 're unlikely to cause damage . 
  ( aka ca n't shoot a toddler about to attack you , but an adult attacking you , you can ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada%e2%80%93united_states_relations hell , the canadian embassy is one of the few major ones not on embassy row , and is literally the only one on capitol hill . 
  i do n't think a 200 year history of friendly relations with the longest land border and unified military commands is similar at all to a country annexing parts of another . 
  our nro and nga do a lot of earth observation though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_reconnaissance_office https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_geospatial-intelligence_agency, 
  dude , russia annexed parts of other countries , this is n't a 20 year old fear . 
  the united states ' doctrine is to have the ability to fight a two front war without resorting to allies or a draft for immediate relief . 
  our whole doctrine is `` america invicta '' , just be happy we do n't have the concept of `` civis americanus sum '', 
  at least they sent infantry , most everyone else did n't want boots on the ground . 
  well if i want fireworks , i just tell them i 'm republican . 
   or any line other than its own for that matter . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  it is its own country . 
   in neither america nor europe i do n't see what 's wrong with that , why do they have to pick one way or the other ? 
  how has nato expanded , by conquest ? 
  or did they expand because all the states in russia 's reach wanted to be in nato desperately for protection from russia ? 
  the us did n't march into the baltics and poland , they asked them to come . 
   a typical conversation on the topic might be a brief lecture on why we should have publicly funded health care and education , and that to pay for this we should cut our military spending . 
  god i just want to have a beer . 
  instead i get lectures on domestic policy like some dutch guy 's opinion will sway me . 
  http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/nato-publics-blame-russia-for-ukrainian-crisis-but-reluctant-to-provide-military-aid/ there 's a strong sense of unwillingness to defend allies in germany , and other continental western states .

  http://www.amazon.com/sabre-red-pepper-spray-protection/dp/b015ywhp6u try getting it in pink !, 
  because local and state governments would never surrender their sovereign powers to make a simple command chart, 
  because i just explained it , expansion of a police organizations mandate often leads to it being more and more ineffective . 
  separation of powers . 
  separation of mandate . 
  in the us at least , the more broad a police agency 's purview , the more it lacks in each specific areas . 
  you see this in the us with the debate over the us secret service being tasked with anti-terrorism for events now , rather than just protect the money and protect the president . 
  turks are turks . 
  if we have to get geographic , can we just agree on anatolian ? 
  but if you ice it , it becomes the greatest tea ever, 
  that we 're number 1 . 
  i mean i 'm from the south , and i make tons of racist jokes and observations and the two black guys who 's weddings i was in laugh at them . 
  but my family from the north is like `` you ca n't say that you 're racist , respect all races '' and then you realize they literally know no black people on a personal level because there 's no black people in their neighborhood, 
  read `` candlemakers petition '', 
  nova ? 
  it was 1.60 in hroads when i went to the beach a few weeks ago, 
  there was some quote talking about how racism is in the north and the south . 
  where the north loves the race and the south loves the individual . 
  where he 's trying to convey that southerners might be a little bit more racist but they like the individuals they know and the north talks about how much they love black people but self segregate away from them . 
  he 's arguing that if they do n't have the ability to enforce their sovereignty , they 've long ago given up the ghost . 
  it was called a paddy wagon because most of the cops were irish in the ne so you 'd see a bunch of paddy 's riding by in their wagon . 
  and since 1862 we literally gave away land if you promised to work to become a citizen . 
  well we did use different colors until 2004 when the dems wanted to switch cause they did n't want to be red, 
  we 're not imperialist , we honestly do n't care .
