  i 'm not advocating labor theory , i 'm just saying the value of the product is not worth 15 an hour . 
  i 'm saying their labor is n't worth 15 dollars . 
  jobs that are n't supposed to pay a living wage . 
  do you think the labor of someone working as a cashier is worth $ 15 an hour ? 
  yeah but i 'd rather not pay more in taxes to support people who find a certain pay beneath them . 
  you 're arguing a living wage argument in a thread about unemployment you 'd have people unemployed than working if you do n't feel that the wage they get is high enough . 
  yes , he was disabled in college when a tree fell on him when he was out on a jog . 
  they 're cowboy boots . 
  in texas its a tradition to both wear them ( i have two pair ) and if you 're elected the boot maker will usually put the seal of your office on them . 
  [ rick perry , past gov of texas ] ( http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/bootsfreedomandlibertyimage2-e1324574967730.jpg ) [ rick perry , past gov of texas 2 ] ( http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/d/2012%5c148%5c2012-05-28t015417z_01_san10_rtridsp_0_nba.jpg ) [ rick perry , not in formal wear ] ( http://www.memphisflyer.com/binary/cece/1319042060-grp-shooting-3.jpg ) look at the brown boots . 
  [ greg abbott , current texas gov ] ( http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/576_576_/abbott1.jpg ) [ greg abbott , again ] ( http://photoblog.statesman.com/wp-content/uploads/000031.jpg ) i 'd find some if he had a cool seal on them but he 's in a wheel chair so his pants legs are n't gon na ride up : /, 
  not really , in many countries labor force participation rate is a huge factor . 
  in the us its the huge discussion dealing with falling participation as more middle aged women stay home with kids and more students stay in school longer . 
  it was over 20 and thats not a crisis ? 
  thats absurd it started out that high . 
  i mean it , its responsibility for your actions . 
  you juts ca n't say whoops never mind to another human life . 
  i mean , if make a choice there 's a risk . 
  so what you 're saying is that a person should either not get in car or live in perpetual fear they will become a paraplegic , with all the trouble that entails , cause they might get into a major car accident . 
  i mean contraceptives are n't 100 % . 
  you know that going in , there 's a risk with the reward . 
  that 's the only bind . 
  the survey says out of 69 % of people still willing to talk about the abortion 95 % had no problems with it . 
  so all the survey can claim , ( cause their methodology sucks ) , is 95 % of 69 % of women having an abortion have had no regrets about the abortion . 
  there 's no responsibility on the woman either . 
  i ca n't compel a someone to take responsibility for something they had no responsibility in creating . 
  well its a unique life or potential of life , which is why i hate nitpicking timelines . 
  its either life at conception or birth . 
  and i 'm pro-life with the only exception being rape or health of the mother . 
  magically is your argument ? 
  how about infants who do n't have concepts of self ? 
  so 69 % went through with a study . 
  so you can only say that at most 2/3 of women do n't regret getting an abortion . 
  its methodology is terrible . 
  does an infant have a unique value because it has no developed concept of self . 
  the difference is two half-cells have merged into something new and distinct . 
  throwing metal is n't the same as throwing out a car . 
   but having an abortion is morally just about the same as wiping your nose . 
  really , even the most ardent , sane , pro-choice advocates recognize it is destroying something of value the `` potential '' of life . 
  its bullshit to compare a fetus , even if you 're 100 % pro-choice , to snot . 
  maybe , cause we 're talking about two different levels of skill . 
  plouffe is easily top 5 , maybe top 1 of political `` operatives '' . 
  he knows how it all works and he knows how to mobilize people . 
  and honestly , at least in the united states , the gop is happily obsessing over uber because it has the perfect trifecta : successful business ( read : friendly capitalists ) , popular with younger generations ( have to turn them off of dems ) , and hurts unions . 
  so there would always be some institutional support for it . 
  but plouffe is getting a big payday b/c of his knowledge to keep dem criticism of it limited . 
  internationally , if he 's involved , its probably more of a skill in management and mobilization , and knowing how to read polls and deal with press on his side than it is knowing the players . 
  yeah it basically means i 'm the imagined scary guy in smoke filled rooms running campaigns , when in reality i wish i could smoke in the office so my job is 50 % dip 50 % feigned competence . 
  poli ( tical ) operative . 
  i was at some bullshit luncheon with angel invetsors and they were discussing risk perceptions . 
  where risk is something to be embraced + conquered in the us and its something to be managed + avoided in europe . 
  but education quality is much higher in the us . 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2012/10/30/unemployment-and-the-presidential-election-an-historical-perspective/ its one of the main driving factors in elections . 
  out of work -  out of office . 
  in addition to the democrats shift leftward following 2000 might have been impacted the unemployment rate increases in the rural south leading to a rejection of the democratic party in former d strongholds . 
  obama got a quickly falling unemployment rate in 2012 to help stave of defeat , but basically anything over 7-8 % unemployment and the president loses the election . 
  there 's more capital available too . 
  so not only is it easier to find a job , its easier to make yourself one . 
  yeah , but not a nice car . 
  and not a nice house , and not a big pool . 
  i 'll drive my escalade not a yugo . 
  so you stay 2x stronger ? 
  you do n't prepare by hoping your enemy does n't attack , you prepare by being ready for attacks . 
  the us only makes big headlines when they want to do an exchange , like they did with russia back with their spy ring a few years ago . 
  when russia has a political prisoner , they round up a few spies for trade , and boom , problem solved . 
  nah , ask anyone who works in politics in campaigns ( not in gov ` t , those lazy fuckers ) and both sides of the divide ( at least here in america ) work well over 80 hr weeks regularly . 
  conditioning . 
  i started off at the lowest level where they weed people out who ca n't do 100 + hours of work . 
  you learn to just close off everything and work , maybe sleep in the office , and do it because you love it . 
  politics . 
  cause i like working , i like making money , i like my high standard of living . 
  cause i work really odd hours . 
  a 100 + hour week is par for the course come september/october . 
  i thought series a has rebounded up to around 10 - 15 ? 
  i work 80 +, 
  well she did literally say `` less crunchy technique '', 
  to the city `` istimbolin '' just like stimboli in crete ( the city ) !, 
  there 's a few of us republicans here . 
  bullets in free fall are lethal . 
  forget basic physics , what comes up must come down . 
  its a deadly weapon . 
  you would n't pull a sword and say you gave them a warning slap with it . 
  deadly = deadly . 
  i did n't know anywhere did . 
  if you 're pulling out your gun you 're in a deadly situation . 
  in the us its illegal to fire warning shots . 
  shoot to warn ?!, 
  deadly force is n't a warning , its deadly . 
  there was a first question before that where it was like 45/55 for continuing the status quo in lieu of other options . 
  it 's a really weird vote because there were questions on it and the votes for the first were much higher than the votes for the second question so evidence points to the second question being ignored as a protest vote . 
  its not 61 for . 
  its a pretty even split 1/3 for independence , 1/3 for statehood , 1/3 for keeping the status quo . 
  but with the default they might vote for statehood to fix the problem . 
  puerto rico is the closest thing to a state w/o being a state . 
  the us maximum is somewhere like $ 2.6 k a month and thats only if you worked for 40 years at the highest possible income bracket and retired at 65 . 
  puerto rico might get statehood now , to help fix their debt issues . 
  yes but i 'm not taking a cold drink to cure my heat , i 'm taking a cold drink because refreshing sweet tea is exactly what feels good . 
  but america will , and so will canada . 
  teamed up , we 're undefeated . 
  yeah , but nato has the us .
