  they like to tell people what to do with their genitals , they like to tell women they should n't have upper-middle-class jobs in science or engineering , and they like to call blacks niggers and jews kikes . 
  there are a couple of them on our campus every so often screaming about jebus and such . 
  i mean , fuck 's sake , you ca n't even use facts . 
  you 're too uneducated to dredge up any , i guess . 
  why am i supposed to give a fuck about people who reject bettering themselves and learning ? 
  i outright hate these kinds of people , in fact . 
  you misunderstand me . 
  i do not hate the working class because it is poor . 
  i hate it because it is stupid . 
  if you do not value the life of the mind or the things that intellectual work has done for society - engineering , medicine , science , and yes , even sociology - then you are abhorrent no matter how rich or poor you were born . 
   yeah , showing an extreme hatred of anyone who has n't taken a sociology class is real intellectual and pretending to be part of the left is just the cherry on top . 
  i bet your gender studies bachelor has nothing to do with your troubles on the job market at that . 
  i 'm in the sciences , but whatever , keep being a moron, 
  your claim that getting an education is somehow classist is precisely what drives some people to vote conservative , you anti-intellectual fool . 
  i do n't even think you know what happens in actual uni classes . 
  anyway , i do n't think i 've personally failed . 
  i 'm talking about the problems of others . 
  take the many women and blacks who were n't permitted to enter universities for a very long time and further themselves . 
  stop using ` the man ' to blame for your own poor iq , your misogyny , your racism , and your inability to pass a university-level class . 
  who 's the person with a chip on their shoulder ? 
   if you had your way actual working class people would be fired for being too crude , too uneducated and too privileged while in the presence of a petit bourgeois cunt . 
  spoken like someone who 's never actually gotten an education , who does n't value the mind at all , and who does n't actually have relatives who are crude and uneducated working class idiots . 
  my parents came out of the working class , got graduate degrees , and are enormously glad they did . 
  neither of them are particularly fond of the working class . 
  and neither am i. 
   no , clearly not . 
  why should i care about the swiss people 's political history again ? 
  because it 's relevant , idiot . 
  why should i give a fuck about your country ? 
   you 've shown consistent racist and sexist views in this thread rife with conspiracy theories on how they 're oppressing you and now you 're whining about `` institutionalized '' views ? 
  christ . 
  i know what you 're showing : a lack of reading comprehension . 
  cite where i said something that 's racist or sexist . 
  please . 
  ( when i was talking about straight white conservative males , i was talking about that particular subgroup of white males , and that particular subgroup is a pack of assholes , as are straight white conservative females and straight conservatives of any other ethnic group of both sexes . 
  i have no problem with straight white non-conservative men . 
  guess what the unifying factor is here ? 
  they 're conservative . 
  people who are n't straight usually are n't conservative . ), 
  the only racists and sexists here are the assholes supporting gi such as yourself , who think every white or black or brown person has the exact same views as every other white or black or brown person and who are supporting an organization that advocates for gender roles and discrimination against people who are n't heterosexual . 
   what a luck it would be to live among peoples with whom i have nothing in common and no solidarity . 
  try making friends . 
   a country where how much you have determine how much you 're worth as opposed to what ? 
  your skin color or your genitals ? 
   where you can be fired for anything because peoples lack the cohesion to oppose anything on ethical grounds what the fuck do you think the left wing tends to fight for ? 
  at least in the united states people will fire folks for being gay or not being christian ; the further left groups are the ones fighting for protections . 
   a country where you 're judged on your race like right-wingers do everywhere  a country that have one percent of its population in prison at any time because of conservatives , their ties to private prisons , and ass-backward drug laws that conservatives back ... damn , you 're a liberal !, 
   yes , it was around the time men got the vote as well here , since only men and women from the noble families had any real say prior to that . 
  clearly , you 're not swiss ; women only got the vote there in the 1970s . 
   a conspiracy theory to blame your own failures on other people , and said group is apparently both a `` racial '' and sexual grouping . 
  oh , yes , because institutionalized sexual and racial bigotry has never existed in europe and if it did it no longer has a social legacy that still needs to be dealt with , and shit like not admitting women into places like cambridge until super-recently ( google rosalind franklin ) , essential enslavement of people like the congolese by the belgians and the colonizing binge that it took until sometime in the 20th century to get off of , and a general widespread shitting on anyone who was n't a white guy does n't count !, 
  / s you 're not only entitled , you 're an egocentric cumstain . 
   funny how the supposed idiots are also the ones apparently in charge of who gets to practice meritocracy and gets to compete . 
  clearly you 've forgotten your history . 
  remember when it used to be illegal for women to vote and they were n't allowed into universities , for black people to use the same restrooms as whites , and for gay people to even be out of the closet ? 
  yeah , these are people such as you who were imposing this shit , and plenty of them still wish they could - these are the people who got where they are by unfair means and shitting on other people because they could n't fucking compete . 
   funny , considering the conservatives are the one who tend to fetishize meritocracy . 
  `` meritocracy '' , which consists of them claiming that blacks and women are intrinsically somehow too stupid to do anything ? 
  i 'll call conservatives meritocratic when they extend that meritocracy to anyone who 's not straight , white , conservative , or male . 
   took you long enough to show your racial and sexual prejudices . 
  showing yourself to be both a racist and sexist in just a few lines . 
   and now you 're accusing me of being a rapist as well ? 
  from me pointing out who is doing the discrimination you infer that i am a racist or a sexist ( funny that you only scream when whites get picked on , and ** i 'm white myself ** ) , or thinking that by me comparing your modus operandi to that of a rapist that i am somehow saying you are a rapist . 
  you 're too much of an idiot to compete with liberal or non-white people , which is probably why you 're so uppity and insecure . 
  awwww , feeling bad about your qualifications , pissy-pants ? 
  you apply and you interview like the rest of us ; you 're not a special snowflake . 
  you 're not owed a job over someone who 's , say , a female muslim immigrant who 's better-qualified . 
  now that 's meritocracy . 
  just like non-westerners , westerners are n't exempt from not being an asshole because of one 's culture . 
  the only dog-eat-dog i see is the conservative one , where straight white conservative males come out on top at the expense of everyone else because , since they ca n't compete , they have to forcibly lock others out of the pool . 
  yes . 
  straight white conservative males are too fucking wussy to compete with others . 
  same thing as people who rape - you ca n't get it the fair way so you force it like the inferior stuff you are . 
  fuck you and your entitled pea-brain . 
  oh europe , keep being ethnically divided in the wackiest ways america does it better, 
   it 's sad to see people spit on old traditions like that . 
  for good reason . 
  you do know it used to be ` traditional ' to burn people suspected of ` witchcraft ' , right ? 
  piss off . 
  tradition for the sake of tradition is the mark of a backwards , unthinking moron , especially when it hurts others or flies in the face of reason , which this does . 
  no , you do n't . 
  you are sympathizing with uneducated , emotionally-driven filth . 
  the only thugs i see here are the ~ ~ brown ~ ~ yellow-shirts meting out vigilante justice . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation_identity http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/archive/fascism-reinvented-for-the-modern-era-generation-identity-in-the-uk  ** the fascist ideals of generation identity **  so what is generation identity all about ? 
  what are its guiding ideals ? 
  one good place to turn is a book published by one of the movement 's most prominent voices , markus willinger . 
  in his highly readable short polemic , generation identity : a declaration of war against the ' 68ers -- also published by arktos , who produce a vast array of intellectual material relevant to the new right tradition -- he talks of a coming nationalist revolution where multiculturalism will be no more , and where traditions forgotten by a generation of europeans will be restored . 
  tellingly , this self-styled ` declaration of war ' is available in translation both as a kindle download as well as a paperback book . 
  born only in 1992 , willinger claims he is currently a student at the university of stuttgart , yet he has produced an accomplished piece of fascist writing -- one engaging with many of the tropes familiar to those who analyse such texts . 
   fairly typically , the theme of generations is crucial to willinger 's framing of an alleged crisis to which generation identity has the answer . 
  he argues that the generation that came before him , ` the 68ers ' as he simplifies , were overtaken by a series of allegedly crazy , utopian and universal ideals . 
  this ` cultural marxism ' ( a term also employed by anders breivik among many others on the far right ) has allowed for mass immigration , which in turn was followed by the onset of a crisis in national identity across europe . 
  the ' 68ers themselves were driven to this misplaced idealism by their knee-jerk response to the horrors of nazism , he continues . 
  trying to distance all this from sympathy with interwar fascism , he stresses that the failure of the ' 68ers has now created a crisis in the present , which needs to be overcome by a new movement driven by willinger 's generation : generation identity . 
  this new movement , he claims , rejects both nazism and postwar multiculturalism . 
   ** fascism revisited **  all this is set within a powerful language of war against the established elites , and overthrowing a corrupt generation focused on individualism , with a new generation who will put the ideals of the national community ahead of individual rights . 
  yet these were core themes found across the very same interwar fascist movements from which willinger tries to distance himself . 
  so in reality , willinger 's polemic calling for a cleansing of europe , while also restoring a strong sense of ` traditional ' national identity , is an ideal that is very reminiscent of interwar fascism . 
  moreover , as with all fascist ideologies , there is a powerful call for a spiritual revolution to accompany the overthrowing of a generation of corrupt individualists , one that develops a sense of societal redemption achieved through participating in radical political action and by resorting to a strong sense of identity . 
  to judge the tenor here , take this quote from the preface of the book arguing that a new era will emerge from the activism of generation identity :   a new political current is sweeping through europe .
