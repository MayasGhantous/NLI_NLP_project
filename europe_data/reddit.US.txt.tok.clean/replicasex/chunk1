it 's a little inappropriate since she seemed to * work * for the stasi as well . 
  it 's * funny * that this has been up for a full day and no one has commented on it . 
  it 's why you bring in your own country 's construction workers for the embassy 's construction . 
  the chinese would n't have anything to do with an american company when they built their embassy and we would n't have anything to do with theirs . 
  saying `` this is private '' is useless unless you can make it so . 
  or perhaps europe will trust to the power of friendship while the usa pursues its interests ruthlessly . 
  american here -- turns out the girl 's roma parents are in fact roma . 
  yes , the blond haired girl is in fact a dirty gypsy . 
  here to tell you your assumptions are racist and you should feel bad . 
  though undoubtedly you will console yourself with the finest schnitzel . 
  it has nothing to do with suppression , it 's just the way the culture is . 
  it 's not a conspiracy , people just do n't want to hear things . 
  trust me , i know . 
  i 'm a socialist living in the us , i get how little representation dangerous ideas get . 
  upsnowdens to the left , please . 
  [ does this inspire you ?

  war contains all these horrors but i do n't see many people arguing that * guernica * should be covered up . 
  surprise !, 
  rape is pretty ugly . 
  i think it suits the subject matter . 
  communism is n't the issue . 
  the vast , vast majority of communists wholly repudiate the atrocities the ussr committed . 
   do not think that i came to bring peace on earth ; i did not come to bring peace , but a sword . 
   for i came to set a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ; and a man 's enemies will be the members of his household . 
   he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me . 
   and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me . 
   he who has found his life will lose it , and he who has lost his life for my sake will find it . 
  what the hell do you consider `` deep south '' then ? 
  we needed labor and we imported it . 
  when we did n't we clammed up quite tight . 
  everything else is sentimentality . 
  it 's unlikely to happen but if we do n't raise the limit of our debt then we ca n't pay our loans . 
  basically several countries will fall into the sea . 
  it 's our most routine apocalypse . 
  the government shutdown is n't especially scary . 
  it 's the debt ceiling fight in two weeks ' time that europeans should keep an eye on . 
  in fact the uk should be proud for how integral it was in its formation !, 
  but if you believe the black helicopters are coming for you then that 's how you 'd see it i imagine . 
  you could  . 
  you have to love how thoroughly the us is blamed for everything . 
  i agree , which is why i 'm merely taking a contrarian position . 
  the uk is quite integral to the process and proudly so . 
  i do enjoy being told what i do and do n't believe . 
   which the eu grants to the british people the convention does n't grant anything to anyone -- it 's an international treaty that sovereign nations in europe agree to ratify . 
  it also features a very nice framework for the prosecution of rights violations . 
  but let 's be clear -- the force of the treaty depends on the sovereign nation in question . 
  britain agrees to enforce the treaty , not any other country . 
  cameron 's comments are asinine but they 're not absurd . 
  britain is only subject to laws and standards it agrees to . 
   a government you do n't have a say in which has your best interests at heart is infinitely better than a government you have a minuscule say in which is actively opposed to your interests . 
  would a benevolent dictator be preferable to a fractious democracy ? 
  you realize i do n't actually believe in the argument right ? 
  for the people who buy into cameron 's rhetoric it 's not about that , it 's about an hysterical fear of black un helicopters and the like . 
  you 're not very free , personally , if your laws are subject to the whims of foreign governments are you ? 
  mind you , i 'm just playing devil 's advocate . 
  to play devil 's advocate : could n't you argue that you 're * less * free if your country , nominally sovereign , has values and laws forced on it by foreign countries ? 
  countries are only subject to treaties and `` international law '' when they agree to be subject to it . 
  it 's within the uk 's rights to withdraw from any convention they like , is n't it ? 
  you produce an absolute metric ton of gay pornography . 
  [ populism , yeah yeah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzqf492qbw ) . 
  most americans ( that i know ) do n't identify as any ethnicity if they 're white . 
  even if they mention it it 's just throwaway trivia . 
  it 's not an identity for most of us . 
  could it be that fonts sometimes make things harder to read , which might be a problem for places with multiple languages ? 
  yeah , in my mind it conjures poorly dressed techno-loving hooligans . 
  rich enough not to have empathy , stupid enough to think they 're cultured etc. 
  there 's a seriously large percentage of conservatives who believe he 's secretly a muslim so you 're not far off . 
  iraq was peaceful ? 
  i suppose it was if you were n't one of the hundreds of thousands of people saddam brutally murdered . 
  bloomberg 's metrics are really weird . 
  libya ranked above the us as well , though i guess that 's because it was largely free under gaddafi . 
  uh , you know dogs are already used in the military right ? 
  some with [ titanium fangs ] ( http://www.cqbk9.com/wp-content/uploads/toofs.jpg ) . 
  we used to have sedition laws , presidents who would flatly ignore the supreme court and two centuries of the most bankrupt back door politicking around . 
  things are , amazingly , better . 
  though not nearly good enough . 
  oh i know , i 'm just couching the idea in one many americans strongly identify with . 
  that america is inviable and uninvadable is just a prominent example of our exceptionalism and it shapes how we view ourselves . 
  yeah , that 's the idea . 
  nothing can stop us but us , etc. 
  is it any wonder so many americans remain `` doubtful '' of anthropogenic climate change ? 
  america has never been invaded , not really . 
  north america would be awfully hard to invade and we 've never faced an existential threat . 
  it 's commonly thought that the only thing that can destroy america is itself . 
  the idea that outside forces can overcome us is quite alien . 
  stereotypes are n't always true  . 
  i imagine it has to do with the academy francaise and all the stereotypes that stem from that . 
  i assume it stems from a stereotype of french protectionism . 
  you do n't like anglicisms , you do n't want american tv etc etc. 
  surprisingly little of america is affected , though . 
  even at 60m . 
  i do like a nice , thick zucchini ... 
  i thought someone had told you their zucchini was bigger or something  . 
  vegetables ? 
  the yards are very , very large and the volume of leaves may be significant . 
  amusingly , the czech republic is a gay porn capital . 
  there 's going to be ** knick-knacks ** on top of your ** toilet ** . 
  we 're coming to eat your children and redecorate your bathrooms . 
  i hope there are immediate calls to distance the rest of europe from germany .
