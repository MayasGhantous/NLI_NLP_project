thanks , i will . 
  [ i can go to any country i want any time i want . ] ( http://www.aifspartnerships.com/wcccsa/ ) . 
   as for `` only white ones '' due to political conflicts i do n't have a lot of options . 
  yeah i know i 'm just reading some sensationalized headlines all day . 
  i did n't mean here exactly . 
  i just find it odd oprah is there one day ( ? ), 
  and now the entire nation is racist . 
  the whole point in her being there is for tina 's wedding right ? 
  has n't tina been ** living there ** for quite some time ? 
  does she feel it is racist there since she has spent so much time there ? 
  i just find it odd no one has thought of this . 
  also it 's stupid how people are blaming oprah for buying an expensive purse . . as if she is not rich to begin with . 
  i never said i was n't going i 'm just saying it 's ironic a story of switzerland pops up as i 'm looking into there . 
  if its your job to show the handbags , you should be showing the handbags . 
  hmm . . 
  i was considering studying abroad here too . 
  he was a coward it 's that simple . 
  that would have been exactly what he wanted , to be idealized or whatever . 
  where would the money to clean it up and restore come from exactly ? 
  where would admission fees go towards ? 
  his entire legacy needs to be left to rot just like his body . 
  i know you speak from a historic perspective but think about it , the man is hiding in a bunker like a coward while his people are killing other civilians by the truckload what would you gain from that kinda thing . 
  there are plenty of other sites like the actual concentration camps where you you can wonder the same questions . . 
  the racial terms are now buried or deleted . 
  at first they were massively upvoted but i see that has changed . 
  i never said that . . you 're being paranoid . 
  is this really what people in europe are like ? 
  good grief . 
  lol dude i do n't care what you have to say . 
  it 's obvious most of you are in denial about your comments and attitudes of other cultures so i 've just removed myself from this subrddit . 
  i do n't want to have anything to do with people like this that post here . 
  most of you do n't want to admit your comments are wrong and prejudice , so the next thing most of you do is insult * me * for being ** american ** . 
  well i 'll take that over this subreddit . 
  this place has become far too fragmented and butthurt for any decent discussions as of late anyway . 
  pure denial all around here . 
  i never said it was it must be how you see it in england . 
  yeah we bomb them in the name of christianity it 's bs on both sides and i highly doubt either god would be pleased . 
  oh ok i guess this ignorance is acceptable then . 
  what the hell was i thinking , it 's * technically * not racist !, 
  there are a lot of crazy prejudice comments being upvoted . . 
  i 'm not sure where you read your tils from . 
  why would it matter though . 
  if i saw it i would n't care . 
  not my religion and they 're not bothering anyone . 
  does n't seem like these guys had anything wrapped up . 
  the amount of racism here is very interesting i must say . 
  guns kill people , did n't you know ? 
  [ chex ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chex_mix ), 
  that is amazing . 
  maybe that is the perception here due to students moving away to university after grade school . 
  often times these universities can be hours away with no parental supervision . 
  also back in the 80s or so a couple could buy a house for almost nothing , the `` american dream '' etc. 
  in today 's america it is a completely different story as with the rest of the world but the stereotype of being a loser is still unfairly there if you do not have those things . 
  actually most considering the deadline of having these things to be the age of 25 or so . 
  i 'm learning french so i ca n't wait to experience the different cultures abroad . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  wow 25-30 is the `` young adult '' age in europe ? 
  i am 24 and will be 25 by the end of the year . 
  i get the impression that in america `` young adult '' is like 21-25 so in europe it is different or just for the sake of the poll ? 
  obviously i 'd take the this opposed to american perception  also for relationships is it considered `` bad '' like in usa if you do n't own a car , house , job etc your social life comes to an end ? 
  without this in america you can almost forget about a romantic relationship also . 
  i 'm not criticizing anything i am hoping to understand this better thanks . 
  i see you 're trying to cover up your tracks now . 
  we have maps of other planets and asteroids . 
  lol, 
  who are you replying to ? 
  i do n't care about the stereotyping it 's just that i 'm surprised to see comments that basically read like `` oh my god someone was shot in boston . . ** all of america is unsafe i am so glad i changed my mind about visiting there based on what i see on the news !!, 
  ** i mean really that is just absurd . 
  i do n't care if you troll america i would n't be in a european subreddit if i did . 
  these are things i have to constantly correct americans * here * about . 
  not all hispanics are illegals . 
  not all muslims are bad . 
  i guess i did n't expect here to be along those lines also buying into the hype . 
  yeah but typed on my ipad thanks . 
  i subbed here to be more informed of europe . 
  in part to learn more of europe for personal interests and also in part due to stereotypes like this . 
  i have no problem with this being posted . 
  i 'm not surprised that someone in power has no idea what he is talking about , it is to be expected in politics . 
  what i am surprised about are the comments here . 
  not all , but i have seen people posting about how unsafe america is and they 've never been to america . 
  some of you think you know america completely based on stereotypes and what is posted on reddit . 
  i am honestly surprised and kinda depressed . 
  i do n't even care that it 's about america , i 'm not an elitist i 'd like to travel as much as the next guy . 
  the fact you 're basing living on another continent because of one video or whats posted online is sad . 
  at first i was like meh but as i read these comments in horror i see some of you guys are ** actually serious ** and think all americans are stupid . 
  seeing the `` i guess americans should invade iraq '' comments i could easily reply with a france surrendering joke but i thought we were past this point really , especially considering the fact we have a handful of robots on mars for example . 
  i also see those with american flags replying `` sorry '' . . lol and actually wanting to leave . 
  for the sake of humanity i wo n't even take those replies seriously . 
  anyway like i said i 'm more surprised by the comments and how gullible it really is here i guess . 
   we must realize that ** not all countries are as fortunate as ours . 
  ** one of these countries is the usa . 
  i did n't realize europe was a country . 
  lol !, 
  do you understand how foolish this sounds ? 
  you 're basing your opinion of the united states of america . . on what you see posted on the internet . 
  well it 's a good thing this is n't a fox news ran message board . 
  the thing is , this is an european subreddit that assumes all america 's * do * watch cnn . 
  edit : americans * also personally i go to cnn the see the top headline for the breaking news but unless it has potential to disturb * my * plans i usually just wait a few hours for the story to better develop and is less sensationalized . 
  i usually wait for france24 or npr . 
  i agree with you .
