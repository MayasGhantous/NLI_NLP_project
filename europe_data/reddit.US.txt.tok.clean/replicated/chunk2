  i 'm only seeing this posted here , for cheap laughs & upvotes i guess . 
  in middle school they teach us a lot . 
  the only problem is that no one going through puberty gives a shit about history . 
  i thought so too . 
  maybe someone french can explain this more . 
  yes it originally said i do n't care lol . 
  i read these comments with a yorkshire accent in my head . 
  edit : i love the yorkshire accent btw . 
  if by invasion you mean ddos attack to show them who 's boss !, 
  edited because people think i 'm `` upset '' i guess reddit is too serious today . 
  as an american , i 'm used to seeing things like this . 
  i subbed here to become more aware of europe in fact . 
  then one day , i met french people my age ( 20s ) that had no idea about the existence of quebec , the louisiana purchase or that ( traces ) of french is spoken here in america . 
  it was a sad day indeed . 
  [ http://one-europe.info/in-brief/european-government-debt-from-1995-2011] ( http://one-europe.info/in-brief/european-government-debt-from-1995-2011 ), 
  guns . 
  so much for jobs i guess . 
  i think he means american girls . 
  need more ladies here . 
  ok thanks for clearing this up, 
  is the white flag a joke ? 
  i thought france was taken by the nazis also so why not the nazi flag like the others ? 
  france 1814 . . 
  i see what you did there \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  hehe, 
  it think like i said a lot is due to us culture too . 
  some things are just * expected * to go along with the territory . . literally . 
  that may be true however is is n't anything drastic compared to the entire world scale . 
  for example i believe it 's the west coast that typically does better than the east coast but unless you 're talking college then it is n't saying much . 
  most of the universities after all are foreigners so that explains the few good universities we do have . 
  you can not deny that overall as a whole the us is far below most other nations in education . 
  ok well i narrowed it down a bit . 
  i hope sweden , england and france are acceptable countries . 
  what is in place in those countries that provides more successful students ? 
  yes i know europe is n't a country but i did not want to leave out any countries that might actually be better than another as you mentioned . 
  lol, 
  lol sounds like you 're buying into the media hype . 
  most americans already have our minds made up . 
  the few that are undecided [ still have time ] ( http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2012-debate-schedule/2012-presidential-debate-schedule/ ) to decide . 
  there are only one or two polls so i 'm curious to the polls you 're looking at . . 
  not according to the [ maps i see ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map.html ) . 
  plus i 'm sure it would be a lot easier for obama to do absolutely nothing until nov if he wanted than it is for romney not to continue to piss in his own campaign pool . 
  if you think all americans think like him or share his views then you 're just as stupid as he is . 
  look at the polls , this guy is losing . 
  yeah i guess you 're right . 
  thanks . 
  i do hope to visit soon . 
  cool good luck . 
  i hope to visit maybe london and somewhere in france someday . 
  also some celtic areas would be nice . 
  mostly stuff [ like this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/w2vp7/this_american_thanks_the_french_on_july_5th/ ) will make me as an american look like an idiot no matter where i go or how educated i am . 
  the us historically and in terms of tourism typically has not leave the best impressions abroad and most people abroad do n't forget . 
  it 's easy for people of other countries to just come here but us going abroad is n't exactly the same when you 're expected to do something stupid . 
  we have our moments . 
  * i 'm not a crook . 
  there are things i like and things i dislike . 
  i will say i do like the american justice system compared to other countries at least . 
  in some other countries you just do n't stand a chance . 
  that 's not even including the more corrupt systems . 
  i have never been but i know what you mean . 
  it seems sometimes we can be rather . . rude when around other cultures . 
  i was born here , i 'm already poisoned from birth . 
  plus it appears like i 'm also uncle sam 's bitch no matter where i go anyway . 
  i wish i was european . 
  [ do n't tread on me ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwex_yvyas4 ), 
  we threw ur tea in the water . 
  how do u like that . 
  sorry if this is off topic but it is well known that ** [ the usa might not have the best education . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk0y9j_cggm ) ** i really like learning and tldr i was wondering exactly what is the difference between education outside of the usa and education in europe ? 
  exactly what is done to make learning in europe better and students more able to be more successful in college ? 
  i always assumed ( at least now days ) it 's just apart of american culture basically to be . . ** [ content with what are are today . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/06/daily-chart-15 ) ** if i write how bad my high school experience here in the south was , someone on the west coast would be able to completely relate for example . 
  it is completely expected for high school to suck generally . 
  so i 'm just trying to understand what is done in european countries to make their education better ? 
  do european students just have a strong will to always learn ? 
  schools have more money ? 
  you have better resources ? 
  are the courses and workload better ? 
  i have to ask this because i 'm just fed up with my education here in the usa and was considering coming to europe for an education . 
  i have no idea how that works as of now but i 'm starting to do research . 
  what should i know that makes it so much better ? 
  are there any americans here that have gone there for an education ( or vice versa ) and can make the comparisons relative to me ? 
  please do not take this too literally . 
  i basically want to know , as a student , why am i likely to fail as the result of the education system in the usa opposed to if i was a student in europe or elsewhere . 
  ** edit ** : okay alrighty . . to specify let 's compare sweden , england and france at college/university level education to usa 's . 
  what are they doing right to have more educated students that usa is n't ? 
  yes i know europe is n't a country . 
  to specify ( because yes i know europe is n't a country ) i would like to hear from the point of view from those in england , france , ireland and germany . . others feel free also . 
  i am `` african american '' and i 'm ready to move on but the us still seems to still be racially paranoid on both sides even after 400 years . 
  from what i gather it is n't so serious across the ocean right ? 
  i know here in the us , at least imo , it 's ridiculous how sometimes [ the media will take a video clip and chip , chip , chip away ] ( http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/02/both-sides-push-videos-before-presidential-debate/ ) just to try and prove someone is `` a racist !! '', 
  based on their tone or whatever . 
  why do we need this ?? 
  again , this is not really us * bashing * just maybe some things that seem odd or ridiculous to you as a foreigner ? 
  i do n't want this to go way back to the seriousness of slave or kkk days but more of a comparison what the current `` tension '' is like in these countries . 
  i want to hear from those that have come to the us or seen `` enough '' material from here to make a comparison . 
  i was hoping to leave the us in the far future just to be able to clear my head of this nonsense . 
  i know in france it is illegal to ask for a race , does that help solve problems that we have in the us because we do have to check the box ? 
  at some point we 're going to have to joke about this as a country to get over it but it seems even today certain things are still too sensitive . 
  is this kind of thing common over there also or what ?
