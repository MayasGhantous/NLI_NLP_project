also , most states only redraw those districts when there 's a new census . 
  if they 're fucked up then it takes 10 years or major legal action to change them . 
  where i am ( seattle ) one major chain is open 24-7 , but the several others do n't . 
  there are n't any walmarts inside city limits . 
  at one time i worked nights for a trader joe 's in town , but they eliminated that shift after several months . 
  while service industry is a massive portion of our labor pool ( me among them ) , the triple-shift , 24-7 business is relatively rare ( manufacturing , denny 's and 7-11s excepted ) . 
  it 's more common for something like a starbucks or a fast food shop to open at 6 am and close at 10pm or some other late hour . 
  there is rarely , if ever , extra pay for working the later hours . 
  true enough . 
  i do n't understand what you mean by your additional edit . 
  as someone who 's interested in geography and journalism both , this is a really lousy article for a ) not providing context and b ) being a straight reprint of a [ ministry press release ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk--england-and-wales--scotland-and-northern-ireland/2013/sty-population-estimates.html ) . 
  ok , so who are those other 4 eu nations its comparing to ? 
  the comparison implies britain is not among them , but it was [ third ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/europe/thematic/largest-countries-by-population.html ) in 2011 , and seems to be at the top of the charts [ still ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_population ) . 
  the press release provides many numbers and statistics that might be useful to someone who already has a context , but saying the 400k + people ( mostly immigrants ) is a higher * rate * than the other * big * countries is almost meaningless , as it does n't tell you what those other rates were or how many people other countries gained . 
  it 's all relative . 
  in this case , nato aimed for things and not people . 
  many fewer people were killed than could have been . 
  there is no such thing as a clean war or an insignificant bombing . 
  all people have parents . 
  most have siblings , many have children . 
  does n't matter if your government was right or wrong if your family is killed by the people fighting your nation . 
  not being able to understand what was being said , i was a little uncomfortable watching that . 
  until the end . 
  then i was cool with it . 
  it does n't help that the [ mercator projection ] ( http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/mapping/6434 ) is the standard map in most school rooms . 
  just make an eyeball comparison between europe and alaska on that first map . 
  it 's only ~ 1/3 of our land area , but looks like it equals more than half of yours . 
  if you stare at this thing for years at a time , this sort of thinking seems very rational . 
  i lived in czech republic for a year . 
  i knew maybe one person who used a tumble dryer . 
  agreed . 
  some of the social sentiment in poland and serbia gives me the creepy crawlies . 
  it 's mostly people like [ this ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/067/college-liberal.jpg ) , cuz people like [ this ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/319/almostpolitically.gif ) know it actually cost all your freedumz being taken by comunism . 
  i lived in the czech republic ( brno ) for about a year . 
  i was good friends with a woman who was born in 1980 . 
  she could still remember being told how to be a good little socialist youth . 
  she did n't really have any political slant to her , but she shook her head in bewilderment at the typical american/brit ideology of ` individualism , ' saying that we think about ourselves far too much and do n't consider how our actions affect the greater whole . 
  according to her , many older people missed the stability and security of the old regime . 
  it was a place where you did n't have to worry about losing your job or your house , and most people had the same sorts of things . 
  even outside the moral and cultural aspects of communist unity , there was a security in being one of many and knowing the state would take care of you . 
  now things are cut-throat , the government is weak , and life is uncertain , even for pensioners . 
  i lived in brno , czech republic , for a year and visited vienna a couple times . 
  i 'm kind of jealous , it 's a very cool city and one of the few places that i really wanted to move to . 
  most of the people in this thread are spot on and you should listen to them . 
  this relates to one of the shoe [ comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/145hi8/im_an_american_student_studying_abroad_next_year/c7a6da6 ) central european clothes/fashion are different from american norms . 
  generally speaking , everyone dresses like grownups . 
  giant logos or t-shirts covered in writing are n't normal and neither are most eye-catching colors . 
  they wear pants that fit well , including in-seam length . 
  i usually felt like clothing was expensive or cheap there , but you always got what you paid for . 
  also , five years ago when i was there , the '80s look was big . 
  jean jackets , mullet-ish hairstyles , etc. 
  come to think of it , lots of popular music was like that , too . 
   illegal immigration is a major reason why working americans have n't seen a real pay rise in forty years despite record productivity levels . 
  uh ... nope . 
  nuh-uh , not true . 
  for one thing , it 'd be the lack of enforcement on employers , not the immigration itself . 
  moreover , the [ us economy transitioned ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-24/news/mn-10100_1_service-economy ) from a goods-based model to providing services . 
  all those factory jobs and the jobs that supported the factories went away to be replaced with fast food , dog walkers , and uber . 
  if ` illegal ' migrants , or migrants in general , were keeping us wages down , why did all the manufacturing dry up and blow away ? 
  human sacrifice , dogs and cats living together ... mass hysteria !, 
  heaves to mergatroyd , imagine the chaos !, 
  i actually intended the eu when i said everybody 's . 
  and you 're going to sink or swim together on that one . 
  greece and macedonia make it pretty clear that it 's against their self interest to settle or control those who arrive there looking for a way to somewhere else . 
  filthy freeloaders : there are two basic schools of `` keep 'em out ! '', 
  that i see popping up over and over . 
  one is the racists , and who really wants to talk about those assholes . 
  the other is the people who claim that there 's not enough room or money to take people into their country , that the refugees will reduce the whole country 's level of material well-being . 
  that was the reference . 
  everybody 's . 
  and , as several other have pointed out , there 's plenty of room in north africa for building great big ghettos in the desert , if you just ca n't stand the idea of those filthy freeloaders coming into your system . 
  keep them on the edge of an active warzone ? 
  sounds great !, 
  then all the non-state military forces can recruit among them , run rackets , and smuggle through the camps . 
  i think that 's a given . 
  germans ( from well before their 20th century debacles ) were huge parts of the nation . 
  the irish and the italians went from shunned , ghettoed peoples to cornerstones of the american experience . 
  more recently , first-generation mexicans and other latin americans have been the backbone of our building trades , food services , and cleaning companies on the way to full integration . 
  plus there are the huge numbers of asians ( southeast , sino - , nipponese , etc. ), 
  that own small businesses or have come for education and gotten jobs . 
  ** tl ; dr - ** america is definitively an immigrant nation , and we have always depended on them to do the jobs no ` self-respecting ' natural citizens would stoop to do . 
  you 're right . 
  there is no room for ethical debate here . 
  sinking those ships would be murder . 
  what 's more , they would be pointless murders . 
  such a simple obstacle would not turn back the human tide . 
  they would just move on . 
  perhaps to gibraltar , or more through greece . 
  the idea of deterrence from sinking a few boats would be laughable if it were n't so completely callous and foolish . 
  you are correct about the sort of people who prey on these desperate migrants . 
  the migrants are not stupid people . 
  they might not know details , but they know what they 're up against . 
  and guess what ? 
  they come anyway . 
  they leave their families and everything they know . 
  they pay ludicrous , exorbitant sums of money . 
  they risk life and limb . 
  they keep coming because they judge those risks and costs to be worth more than the lives they lived at home . 
  most of these people come from places like eritrea , somalia , yemen , iraq , syria , and plenty of other places europe likes to look down on . 
  when war and mayhem are normal , when even the good times are full of men with guns who you have to worry about , then what 's a little added risk on the way to a softer , better life ?
