op should re-post without the time stamp . 
  as an american who has traveled to the majority of europe i can say this . . do n't do it !, 
  yes the us has some advantages ; but , so does the limited power of the eu . 
  nationalism 's can be a bad thing ; but , they also solidify your uniqueness . 
  i honestly think it would be difficult for you to solidify all governments . 
  if you do wish to pursue this , tread with care and do not let it end up being the corrupt corporate driven monster that is the us of a. 
  you would have to create a new capital area which is outside the influence of state control as well . 
  well , i am not one of those high and mighty americans who believe that they are an elite member of the planet earth . 
  america is certainly responsible , directly and indirectly for it 's fair share of terrorism . 
  this is not a secret , it does n't take very much reading about political involvement with the rest of the world to make that determination . 
  the statement i have made simply shares my perspective and interpretation of what terrorism represents . 
  i support ukraine , being war history buff , it understand the difficulties facing the new ukrainian government . 
  i also can appreciate the concerns of the crimea region . 
  they have just as much rights as their ukrainian counter parts . 
  a two party government is a difficult government to balance . 
  we 've been at it for over 200 years and we still have tons of problems . 
  as an american that lives in the south , i can appreciate the feeling of pride that both sides have . 
  we still have people waving the confederate states of america flags and that government was dismantled 150 years ago . 
  war in general is never a favorable process , civil wars are even worse . 
  i believe that few people want this as a result . 
  which may be enticing crimea to rush back into the russian federation . 
  obviously that is a fight that ukraine can not win alone . 
  in the event that it drags the rest of into it , then no one wins . 
  seriously , no one will `` win . '', 
  the fighting may cease at some point and one side may have taken the territory they wanted ; but , at what cost ? 
  from what i understand of it , crimea wants their recognition . 
  they have a rich heritage of russian affiliation and they want to keep those ties intact . 
  i just hope they do n't get taken for a ride by russia . 
  russia has nothing to lose by allowing them accession . 
  they will then control the black sea . 
  no longer having to worry about the lease on their military base . 
  from the outside it just seems like russia might be playing this up for their own gain , and not concerned with the crimean people . 
  this is my take on the present situation . 
  obviously being separated by thousands of miles and a complete language barrier , relying on multiple media outlets for information that may or may not be skewed . 
  i may not have a full grasp of what is actually going on . 
  so , i may be wrong . 
  in the end , no country or government is perfect . 
  there will always be corruption and injustice . 
  they are all run by people . 
  all people are fallible . 
  i do n't want to over extend the use of the word terrorist as much as the next guy ; however , if they are `` terrorizing '' a population using terror tactics , then they are by fundamental definition terrorists . 
  rushing civilians and taking their belongings is indeed banditry . 
  isolated incidents could just be considered banditry ; however , if they are using this tactic to ** oppress a population ** then it becomes more than just banditry . 
  ** edit : ** instead of oppress a population , i should have stated , '' ... to gain a political agenda . '', 
  using media black out tactics to keep their organizational operations a mystery . 
  oppression is usually a byproduct of such actions . 
   are you implying that poland could have done anything to prevent holocaust ? 
  if you do , you should stop posting on reddit and rethink your life . 
  i 'm certainly not saying the poles could have prevented the holocaust even if they wanted too . 
  i 'm just illustrating the fact that poland has no excuse to hide behind the occupation for it 's injustices against the jews . 
  back to the point of my initial argument , mattel simplified and generalized a situation by calling it nazi poland , i do n't believe they had intentions of declaring that the poles were part of the nazis . 
  the game card is about schindler 's list , just detailing a blurb about the events of the movie . 
  the video declaring this oversight on mattel 's part as an implication is bullshit . 
   what ? 
  as in , 20 million jews ? 
  the 20 million was the surviving population of poland as a nation . 
   if someone else is already living in that house and you do n't have any way to prove that it 's actually yours ? 
  chances are no one was living in the houses they returned to , especially from the cities , they were decimated during the attacks and counter attacks as the russians made their way back through . 
   do you really think an average polish farmer knew anything ? 
  i do n't pretend to know what a polish farmer knew what was going on , i do n't pretend that most people knew was going on ; however , a large population being rounded up concentrated in ghettos and then moved away `` to some far off place '' is a little suspect . 
   try harder . 
  try harder at what ? 
  do you want me to prove to you that no one like the jews and wanted them around . 
  read anything historical . 
  people still do n't want them around . 
  the issue is that no one is willing to accept them as human beings . 
  funny part is , they have been around the longest . 
  the belief in a single god and the hebrew faith have existed since the ancient egyptians . 
   blame the allies . 
  they did n't even bother to bomb train tracks leading to death camps . 
  blame the allies ? 
  the allies knew only rumors about what was happening . 
  they believed the only way to stop hitler was to win the war . 
  bombing missions cost enough lives just getting to the cities where factories were . 
  i 'm not saying that we can shirk responsibility , just thing about the resources at the time what could they do ? 
  the allies were n't above antisemitism either , even gen. patton wanted to keep the jews in the camps and under guard to ensure they `` did n't spread like locusts . '', 
   they widely supported independence and they widely did n't . 
  as far as mentioning jewish support in the formation of the polish republic was just to point out that regardless of how jews act , feel , and , think , non-jewish people were blaming them for their problems . 
  considering there were many communist parties all over europe at the time it made no difference of whether they were jewish or not . 
  some jews even supported the german nationalism that led to the nazi party taking power . 
   bottom line is you need to start blaming people actually responsible for holocaust . 
  bottom line is blaming people for the holocaust is getting us no where . 
  blaming others is what causes situations that end up in terrible events like the holocaust . 
  we all need to stop blaming others for our problems . 
   name one keilce 1918 [ lwow ( lemberg ) 1918 ] ( http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9f0de6df1f39e13abc4953dfb0668382609ede )  because someone else lived on the properties they were returning to . 
  you 're surprised that caused hostility ? 
  btw . 
  if you 're claiming `` many jews faced brutal attacks '' , you 're gon na have to provide data to back it up . 
  regardless , if you were forced out of your home and neighborhood and effectively enslaved for years , after you were freed and the truth of what happened came out , would n't you have a reasonable expectation that you would be welcome to return where you came from . 
  only around 200,000 jews returned after the war in a population of around 20 million . 
  the jewish population prior to the holocaust was representative of ~ 10 % of the population . 
  they returned less than 1 % . 
  you 're telling me that those few people disrupted the remaining populations everyday lives enough to warrant hostility ? 
  granted it was now a war torn landscape and most of what everyone had was destroyed anyways . 
  as for `` providing data to back it up '' pick up some books and read . 
  i suggest [ `` neighbors '' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/neighbors-destruction-jewish-community-jedwabne/dp/0142002402 ) and [ `` fear '' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/fear-anti-semitism-poland-after-auschwitz/dp/0812967461/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1429973289&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fear+anti-semitism+in+poland+after+auschwitz ) both written by jan t. gross a polish born historian and sociologist . 
   now i know you 're just stupid . 
  they went to isreal ... well now we all know that you 've also proved a point of the antisemitic climate of europe and the rest of the world at that time . 
   i do n't even know what that means . 
  are you sure you 're american ?
