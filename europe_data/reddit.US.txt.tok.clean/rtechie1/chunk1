where 's your cite ? 
  `` gendered behavior '' is not the same as `` gender role '' . 
  but if you want an example : soldiers . 
  in every culture men have overwhelmingly ( 95-100 % ) been the front line combatants . 
  and that 's clearly tightly connected to biology , men are bigger , stronger , and more violent . 
   you ca n't say either way because it 's not really possible due to all of the gender messages youth and adults receive from all around us . 
  unfalsifiable . 
  also a conspiracy theory . 
  you 'll have a very tough time finding a danish virgin that 's 25 . 
   a judge with half his attention on getting re-elected is n't going to to apply the law as fairly as one who does n't have that distraction . 
  and judges that are n't elected are n't accountable to the people for corruption or incompetence . 
  if a judge applies the law unfairly , he wo n't be re-elected . 
   a jury only being provided legally acceptable evidence is less biased than one which has evidence from elsewhere . 
  unless the law itself is biased in the evidence you 're allowed to present . 
   the info was released as there was a clear public interest reason for making the video available to the public - they needed to catch the guy they needed to accuse him publicly of murder to present the video ? 
  pc richard armitage , said : ** `` this racially aggravated assault had absolutely devastating consequences for the victim , who lost her baby as a result of the attack . 
  ** our thoughts are with her and her family at this incredibly difficult and sad time . 
  `` a thorough investigation is under way and we would like to speak to the man pictured as he may have information which could help with the investigation . '' did the pc ** have ** to say the part in bold and if he did n't say those exact words would the video have erased itself ? 
   juries have only 1 role - look at the evidence presented in court , look at what the law says and decide if that evidence proves the law was broken . 
  then why have a jury at all ? 
  if the beliefs and opinions of the jury are irrelevant and they 're not allowed to bias the verdict , why should that possibility be allowed ? 
   the defendant has to be able to respond to every piece of evidence used against them , that 's impossible if the jury are using information from outside of the trial . 
  would n't this rule make it impossible to convict anyone of anything ? 
  since it 's ** possible ** a juror made his decision with outside information , the only way to keep this from happening is to never convict anyone . 
   i can see why the us justice system has such a bad reputation if this seems normal to you . 
  its modeled after the one in the uk . 
  you 're hopelessly naive if you believe judges and juries in your nation are unbiased . 
   it 's not like the us where mugshots of people who have n't been convicted of a crime are printed in the local newspaper for everybody to see . 
  that is literally 100 % exactly what 's happening here !, 
  this story is showing the photo of a man and claiming ** he murdered a baby ** ( this would be murder under us law ) and that creates no bias at all ? 
  are you for real ? 
  at least in the usa he can talk to the press , or more likely , have his advocates talk to the press . 
   and even then , only what is said in court will be reported during the trial - anything else risks the integrity of the trial . 
  nonsense . 
  like many people i talk to from the uk you act as if everything * de jure * , the written law , is automatically factually true and there is no difference between * de jure * and * de facto * , actual reality on the ground . 
  for example : in theory , libel laws in the uk protect the little guy from being smeared . 
  in practice , libel laws are exclusively used by the wealthy and powerful to suppress critics in the press . 
   his time to speak and defend himself is in court , where he can say anything he wants in his defence . 
  of course he does n't , but you would have to accept that you 're being naive about the effectiveness of the uk legal system . 
  what 's actually happening here is that the crown is generating bias against the defendant , by putting his face out there and saying , quite loudly and publicly `` this man committed a murder '' that 's generating bias . 
  and he 's not allowed to respond to that . 
   juries are not about public opinion , they 're about ensuring the law is applied fairly . 
  this makes no sense . 
  juries are not experts on the law , by definition . 
  if you wanted the law to be applied fairly you would have a legal expert aka a judge , make that decision . 
   what you 've described is n't justice , it 's a formal lynch mob where the decision was made prior to the trial . 
  no , it 's a jury making a decision based on their personal knowledge and biases , the whole point of a jury system . 
   there is transparency , this information is only restricted when it can adversely affect the trial . 
  that 's clearly not what we 're seeing in europe . 
  what we 're seeing is police letting middle east immigrants get away with major crimes explicitly because they do n't want to be accused of racism . 
   you have no right to know anything - it has nothing to do with you , it 's between the law , the victim and the accused . 
  you 're endorsing smear tactics . 
  the police are allowed to publicly smear this guy , accusing him of a `` racist '' attack , but neither he nor the press are allowed to report on any of the details ? 
  or to say the victim is a liar ? 
  where are his rights to speak ? 
   because one can not change their race so to descriminate along such lines is unfair and wrong again , you 're stating contradictory ** principles ** . 
  there is no reasoning or logic behind what you 're saying , it 's just `` this is what feels good to me . '', 
  fine , but i do n't think law in the us or eu should operate under that principle , and it does n't . 
  you should move to a dictatorship where laws are capricious , like the uae . 
   if someone chooses to join a ideology that disregards basic human rights and runs like a mafia ( conservative sunni islam ) then there 's nothing wrong with soneone choosing not to serve you . 
  that may be your opinion , but it 's not the law in the us , uk , and eu . 
   and no in many places in europe you would get imprisoned for holocaust denial so i do n't think your using a good example . 
  last i checked , holocaust denial is only explicitly illegal in germany , and i repeated over and over again that i was talking about law in the united states of america . 
  commitment to free speech is the main thing that makes the usa better than europe . 
   except that 's a crap comparison because religion is a choice , and even within islam the hijab is a choice , totally irrelevant . 
  change it to `` i do n't want to serve people wearing sports apparel for teams i do n't like . '', 
  you do n't get to do that either . 
  let 's take it even further . 
  let 's say a patron walks into an entirely jewish-staffed business wearing a shirt that says `` the holocaust was a good start . '', 
  according to us law , that staff ** must ** serve him . 
  businesses can * claim * the `` right to refuse service * , but that right does n't exist . 
  as neo-nazis are incredibly unsympathetic defendants , that jewish-run business could probably very easily get away with denying the nazi service , but that does n't change the fact that they are technically required to do so . 
   i believe in free enterprise and the right for private busdinesses to make thier own decisions . 
  how do you justify the arbitrary rule of `` this only applies to religion '' if you think businesses have a '' ** right ** to `` make their own decisions '' ? 
  you have made it clear that businesses ** must ** serve black people . 
  how is that justified under this principle ? 
   when on a jury , you 're only supposed to use the information provided in court to come to a conclusion that 's actually the exact opposite of what juries are supposed to do . 
  the whole point of a jury is to insert the bias of ** public opinion ** . 
  let 's say there is a woman on the jury that thinks that any woman that dresses `` slutty '' deserves to be raped . 
  the purpose of a jury is to insert that opinion into the trial . 
  a random jury selection would show that opinion was common , even though you do n't like it , and that should be reflected at trial . 
  let 's say you 're a white person in a very white power racist town and you murder a black person . 
  the empaneled jury is mostly white and they do n't actually think killing a black person is a serious crime , so they vote to acquit . 
  that exact result is the ** intent ** of juries . 
  they are ** intended ** to reflect the biases of the public . 
   the only time information is released to the public is when there is a clear public interest reason , like the police needing the public 's assistance in finding someone or appeals attempting to establish if a suspected serial attacker has additional victims . 
  fuck that . 
  i do n't have blind trust in government . 
  i want transparency . 
  what blind trust gets you is police covering up rape gangs and child rape rings in the name of `` political correctness '' . 
  dalvik is essentially an arm port of the jvm . 
  microsoft and google did , in terms of coding and development , exactly the same thing , they created a custom jvm that produced incompatible bytecode . 
  this specifically violated the java license . 
  the ** only ** supposed difference is that microsoft called their product `` java '' a few times in documentation , but so did google . 
  but somehow microsoft was forced to axe j + + and google got to keep dalvik . 
  and it 's because google got away with the argument that what amounts to a arm port of the jvm is n't actually java . 
  there is zero chance of that happening . 
  it would cripple hundreds of eu businesses and wreck the economy . 
  governments will just force them to sell assets in the eu . 
  there was nothing `` clean '' about dalvik .
