it has everything to do with it . 
  post-ussr russia was in a tragic economic state , putin is credited as the guy who really turned things around . 
  rebuilding military not so much , but there 's definitely an increase in focus on rebuilding russia 's glory since putin came into power . 
  but even then , comparing putin to hitler specifically because of some just remotely similar moves being made is stupid . 
  that type of language sounds eerily fascist , and this is coming from a socialist who wants workers democracy . 
  seriously , the soviet war machine was absolutely massive . 
  hitler himself was scared shitless as far back as 1942 when the germans started `` liberating '' ukraine and found tens of thousands of tanks being made at just one single plant . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clr9tcpkzec ), 
  well you kinda * did * have an empire that mined a shit ton of diamonds from africa , so i would say there 's little surprise there , even for today . 
  is n't tatarstan pretty secular or am i wrong there ? 
  yeah i think they 're fine with being part of russia . 
  `` but you do n't understand , gypsies are * actually * all uncivilized thieves !, 
  american 's just do n't understand this fact ! '', 
  i did n't say that , you said anything that prevent russian imperialism is in democratic interests , which is false . 
  is fascism in the interests of the democratic world ? 
  what about having an oligarchy which thrives off of trade with the eu ( which has been increasingly ukraine 's situation for the past 20 years ) ? 
  this is the kind of mindset that puts dictators into power . 
  does supporting people like yulia tymoshenko , who stole many millions or even billions from the ukrainian people both in and out of politics , count ? 
  does supporting actual fascists in government count ? 
  no matter how you view putin you ca n't deny that pro-european or anti-russian leaders of ukraine do n't have a very good track record either . 
  you do n't have to support one side of the other , ukraine is just filled to the brim with corruption . 
  oh dear , not the whole `` ussr was literally nazi germany but lasted longer '' again . 
  stalin was horrible , so horrible in fact that the ussr openly rejected stalinism after he died and made an attempt to rid the country and its satellites of his image . 
  what about the [ people before profit alliance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people_before_profit_alliance ) ? 
  that looks to have potential , but i 'm sadly not very informed about irish politics so i would n't know . 
  where do you live that it is n't the biggest news story on tv ? 
  at least in new jersey it 's sensationalized and spread around to seemingly no end . 
  i would think the sf would be more like the german `` die linke '' than the spd , would it not ? 
  ahh , til . 
  well for the us it 's not nearly as big at least . 
  but yeah , the mafia is still big especially in sicily . 
  in that case though , albania seems more than qualified to me to handle eu membership and the eu seems able to handle it . 
  it 's a stable country , has a nice standard of living , a `` democracy '' that 's really not much worse than many other member states , and good relations with pretty much everyone except maybe greece . 
  i can understand why membership in the near future would be an issue just because of the political climate of the eu right now , but i do n't see any reasons why it ca n't be a member when things start looking up for the eu . 
  i think it 's accepted universally that eu is for europeans , and albania fits that standard . 
  i do n't know what albania does n't have that italy or greece or romania/bulgaria or ireland or spain , etc. , has . 
  i was also suggesting that oman does not have a good standard of living at all , only a small few in the country , unlike albania which has very low inequality , so its population is doing fairly well altogether . 
  hell , it 's like saying americans should hate italians too . 
  the italian mafia was huge for the first half of the 20th century . 
  and oman is n't european nor does it have nearly as much equality as albania . 
  not suggesting that albania is a socialist utopia or anything but it 's not oman . 
  also , libya is a very developed country , even after the war . 
  if it were european , i could see it being a potential member . 
  haha i definitely knew that before ... 
  fair enough . 
  golden dawn controls much of the country 's police force , i think vigilantism is perfectly acceptable in this context . 
  i like to participate in / r/europe threads occasionally , and there 's no rule here that says it 's europeans only , so i just thought i 'd drop by . 
  ** america ** * socialist kshama sawant wins the seattle city council # 9 seat , being the first socialist to do so in 97 years . 
  * there was a cool show in san francisco where a kid with leukemia was able to be the batman . 
  i personally found it too flashy and over-the-top even for a kid but to each his own . 
  * lots of infighting in congress about insurance and obamacare and yadadada , what else is new ? 
  really , this week was pretty boring . 
  i ca n't really think of much else that happened in america . 
  i do n't see global revolution as too crazy anymore these days either . 
  the planet is completely ruled by global capitalist policies dominated by the us , and the international working class is becoming united in their hatred for this system . 
  look at something like occupy , no matter how it was viewed by the other side it was a global movement against capitalism . 
  of course the german does n't get it , 
  and children/parents ( unless you raise them to be pink floyd-loving pok\u00e9mon fans and not some pop-loving cod plebs of course ) . 
  seriously , every week there 's the same fucking askreddit thread again , `` parents of reddit , do you like having kids ? '', 
  or `` old people of reddit , do you regret not having kids ? 
  '' , and every time it 's `` dae absolutely hate kids were so matur for our age fuk the little annoying expensive brats were totally childless upvote me now '' ... . . i need to really stick to smaller subreddits . 
  i 'm aware , i was referring to the few buildings standing amongst the rubble . 
  oh wow , are those buildings still standing there ? 
  and somehow european cities work out even better by looks than american cities usually . 
  though , then again , places like barcelona [ dig the square city blocks ] ( http://barcelonaprojects.gatech.edu/city2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/barcelona.jpg ) * and * have beautiful architecture . 
  who would want to have sex outside in finland though ? 
  do n't waste your time , canada has been becoming america # 2 for quite some time now , ever more so than the uk . 
  or washington , wall street or the white house for america . 
  i think a japanese pm would be pleased with the banning of porn , seeing how peni and vaginas are banned in japanese porn . 
  that 's for a separate category : underemployment , which is hard to take data of . 
  / r/polandball is of invasion !, 
  err , not even close . 
  iraq had a pretty nice economy before the gulf war , and the sanctions prevented any possibility of iraq recovering . 
  iraq could 've easily become a secular saudi arabia in economic terms , but the `` un '' ( us/uk ) sanctions sealed off the entire country . 
  the iraqis did n't get murdered , they * starved * . 
  and we allowed it . 
  still better than having it federally unrecognized . 
  and happy cake day !, 
  it more or less refers to the idea of judea , not really israel . 
  the area of judea comprises palestine and parts of jordan , lebanon and syria as well as israel . 
  the extremists that have governed israeli foreign policy are * these * zionists . 
  if anyone 's wondering , i did an [ askreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/s0w3o/was_anyone_here_living_in_a_communist_country/ ) about a year ago asking people what it was like before the fall of communism . 
  people generally held positive views , especially about yugoslavia . 
  cuba was for like 5 years as an actual colony , and the rest are not former colonies because they 're still part of the u.s. 
  * philippines - the asian mexico , except instead of drug lords they fight off islamists and they have nice hookers . 
  most people here do n't seem to be aware that they were a colony for half a century though . 
  we do n't really have any other ` former ' colonies though , unless you count client states . 
  we sorta think we liberated spain 's last colonies , even though we treated the filipinos like dirt as well . 
  poland stronk, 
  is china beating us yet ? 
  dammit they even beat us in inequality !, 
  step it up america . 
  wow , so is this rejection of the bailout a good or bad thing ? 
  it seems to be a good thing for the cypriot people , right ? 
  ignorant american here , can someone eli5 what 's going on ? 
  burger and fries with a cherry coke . 
  wrong subreddit ? 
  it 's actually mostly from india/pakistan , and there are also lots of wealthy westerners in the u.a.e. 
  the gulf countries , most notably in dubai , have loads of `` slave workers '' who are promised better lives and more money in better off muslim countries , and then are forced into debt , never to see their families back in their home country again . 
  it 's a pretty well known and disgusting practice , which dubai has changed little .
