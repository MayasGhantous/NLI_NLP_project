  ffs ca n't we make some more nuanced comparisons once in a while . . 
  sway to who ? 
  has there ever been any serious discussion about finland wanting these lands back or russia refusing to give them ? 
  actually curious , since these tongue in cheek comments always appear when this topic comes up . 
  right !, 
  i was trying to remember where i 'd seen this dramatized . 
  i 've thought often recently about that final scene with the ocean , as apt an analogy for today as it was for a century ago . 
  tragic . 
  i remember two years ago when inflation was ramping up russia was criticized for subsidizing vodka prices . 
  i believe it was to prevent deaths like this from moonshiners and other idiocy . 
  not sure that 's the right route . 
  [ rzd shows no stops ] ( http://pass.rzd.ru/timetable/public/ru?structure_id=735&amp;layer_id=5370&amp;refererlayerid=5354&amp;train_num=014mj&amp;numtrain=014%d0%9c&amp;src_code=8000101&amp;departuredate=19.12.2016&amp;firststation=%d0%91%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bd%20%d0%9e%d1%81%d1%82&amp;laststation=%d0%9c%d0%be%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b2%d0%b0%20%d0%9a%d1%83%d1%80 ) between brest and minsk , so the detour looks wrong .

  it 's only a two hour flight but then there 's needing to arrive at the airport early , transportation to and from the airport ( as opposed to center city train stations ) , anxiety from the long airport security checks and lines ( i really feel inhuman in airports , such a bizarre experience these days ) , possible delays . 
  biggest advantage may be the freedom to carry whatever weight and odd sized luggage you want . 
  and as a tourist , i simply like the idea of making that trip by land , flying is so unromantic ... 
  but yea , at about hour 15 i may be wishing i just put up with the damn airport . 
  well my first reply was removed so i 'll try again : i do n't recommend duolingo . 
  they never bother to even teach the alphabet , instead they dump on you a bunch of random phrases with lots of impractical vocabulary . 
  [ this , on the other hand , is a really well thought-out and free online course .

  our methods have changed but the intention appears to be the same . 
  remember [ our call to iraqis to rise against saddam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_iraq ) in 1991 . 
  they got the impression they would have our backing , which they did n't get after all , and this led to their slaughter afterwards . 
  rather different circumstances today in syria , admittedly , but ca n't help but see a parallel . 
  saddam hussein [ was verifiably a monster ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/16/newsid_4304000/4304853.stm ) , but should we have invaded ? 
  even with his record we had to [ invent an imminent danger to the west ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plame_affair ) ( fake news , anyone ? ), 
  in order to justify his overthrow . 
  with assad and gadhafi we have skipped the imminent danger dance and cut straight to `` bad guy , take him out '' .

  investors have seen opec talks start and fail many times the past 2 years but this time oil is up ~ 15 % . 
  seems to be the real thing this time , the saudi 's have cried uncle . 
  you 've updated your comment since i responded so i 'll address that too . 
  as to spoiling an uplifting story , i 'll mention that these groups have been [ a part of the discussion by the us congress ] ( https://conyers.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/us-house-passes-3-amendments-rep-conyers-defense-spending-bill-protect ) regarding aid to ukraine . 
  it does n't go unnoticed that there is a sort of `` hush hush '' going on when it comes to these groups , which i believe is harming the public perception of ukraine . 
  should ukrainians accept the presence of these groups ? 
  if that is their opinion , i want to hear it and know why , for the sake of an honest discussion . 
  ignoring it or shaming those who ask about it is dishonest . 
  and the issue is not so distant to me , i 've talked face to face with refugees from donetsk , have spent considerable time living with ukrainians , visited affected regions , and my elected representatives visit ukraine and give them my tax money . 
  my assistance is pleaded for and at the same time i 'm told to keep my nose out of it . 
  the votes i make will affect the region and the policies , so how am i an outsider to this ? 
  honestly i 'm afraid of ongoing harassment or even doxxing so i 'm not eager to try . 
  thanks for at least now giving a constructive response , maybe one day i 'll actually hear from a / r/europe ukrainian on this . 
  this is a submission featuring ukraine 's leader directly asking for specific policy and aid from my government . 
  seems like a relevant topic to ask about these groups which are molding a segment of the future ukrainian population . 
  i realize that any mention of this makes me labeled a ` kremlin-bot/useful idiot ' , i 'm willing to put up with that in order to get just a few ukrainian opinions on this unpopular topic . 
  i do n't want to get all of my information ( or any of it , really ) from / r/russia or / r/worldnews so i ask here . 
  i provide plenty of links to back up my question , sorry if it look like propaganda or copy-pasta or whatever . 
  i used the links i found myself in one other thread , was accused of making a `` strawman '' argument , so now i 've asked again in a thread relevant to ukraine . 
  and thanks for your answer , but i 'm curious about ukrainian opinions . 
  i know these groups exist in other countries and in the us , but cancelling concerts like this would be big news if it happened in any other country . 
  is this really an unfair question ? 
  look , i found this out just by googling nastya and popot after listening to a track of theirs . 
  i saw youtube comments about their concerts and checked the news . 
  i like to provide sources when making posts . 
  to answer your question , kkk and neo-nazis are not all that active in the us as a coherent group . 
  they may do some marches but are usually spoiled by a large counter-protest . 
  they are n't illegal but if they did anything like this sokil group does , it 's be huge news and they 'd be arrested . 
  does sokil get the attention of the police after actions like this ? 
  that 's all i wonder . 
  ukraine is asking for help from the west ( including my country , the us ) , so only fair to ask about some ukrainian opinions on these events last week : [ cherkasy ] ( http://vchaspik.ua/region/408266-v-cherkassah-aktivisty-protestovali-protiv-koncerta-dueta-potap-i-nastya ) [ kiev ] ( http://lb.ua/culture/2016/11/16/350956_aktsiya_protiv_kontserta_potapa_nasti.html ) [ kherson ] ( http://strana.ua/news/39139-anonim-soobshil-o-minirovanii-zala-vo-vremya-vystupleniya-potapa-i-nasti-v-hersone.html ) ( bomb threat was called in and cancelled the concert ) [ lviv ] ( http://www.unian.net/society/1593942-posle-teplogo-priema-v-hmelnitskom-potap-i-nastya-otmenili-kontsert-vo-lvove-smi.html ) ( blood and smoke bombs were thrown in the lobby ) for non-ukrainians , what 's happening are protests by [ the `` sokil '' nationalist group ] ( http://www.sokil.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/sokil/2016/02/dd4dwqgtnec-600x500.jpg ) against the pop-group ` potap and nastya ' , using threats and violence to cancel concerts in cities across ukraine . 
  [ more about this group ] ( https://vk.com/sokil_cherkasy ) and their [ cherkasy leader 's twitter . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/max_shylo ) what 's the discussion in ukraine about these [ neo-nazi groups ? 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/max_shylo/status/722552177345081344 ) do police bother with these guys or do they do this stuff with impunity ? 
  nothing alarming at all about hitler praising , weapon brandishing ultra-nationalists destroying property in the streets of a european capital . 
  nope , let 's all move on , they 're the good-guy brown shirts so it 's ok . 
  yea i get it , there 's a not-so-clandestine russian occupation in eastern ukraine , and a lot of russians/wannabe russians on reddit are touchy about it . 
  we read about it every day . 
  in the meantime , i wonder why more sane people are n't also alarmed by [ actual neo-nazis ] ( https://vk.com/sokil_cherkasy ) with weapons and funding in ukraine . 
  yea that sub has become unreadable , but what do you think would happen [ if i posted this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5e71kp/populist_potential_in_europe/daaptl3/ ) in / r/ukraine ? 
  or asked a question about how they [ feel about tolerance of these groups ? 
  ] ( http://www.sokil.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/sokil/2016/02/dd4dwqgtnec-600x500.jpg ) whatever , `` whataboutism '' , but we hear about russia every single day while little attention is paid to these [ openly neo-nazi groups ] ( https://twitter.com/max_shylo ) marching around cities in ukraine . 
  europeans in this sub sure do have a lot of faith in the good-intentions of the defense industry . 
  you 're cheering on a machine which , once it gets moving , is unstoppable and rapidly turns public wealth into tons of rusting of steel and bureaucrat salaries . 
  and this new turn towards love for the death merchants seems to be solely because of ukraine . 
  i understand that what 's going on in ukraine is not insignificant , but this response is disproportionate and based on many `` what if '' scenarios . 
  a lack of skepticism is going to cost us all unimaginable amounts of money ( ie. , our future ) . 
  in the spirit of concern about populist movements in europe and the us , i 'll share a bit of what 's been going on in cities across ukraine last week : [ kiev ] ( http://lb.ua/culture/2016/11/16/350956_aktsiya_protiv_kontserta_potapa_nasti.html ) [ cherkasy ] ( http://vchaspik.ua/region/408266-v-cherkassah-aktivisty-protestovali-protiv-koncerta-dueta-potap-i-nastya ) [ kherson ] ( http://strana.ua/news/39139-anonim-soobshil-o-minirovanii-zala-vo-vremya-vystupleniya-potapa-i-nasti-v-hersone.html ) ( bomb threat was called in and cancelled the concert ) [ lviv ] ( http://www.unian.net/society/1593942-posle-teplogo-priema-v-hmelnitskom-potap-i-nastya-otmenili-kontsert-vo-lvove-smi.html ) ( cancelled after smoke bombs and blood was thrown in the lobby ) [ the `` sokil '' nationalists group ] ( http://www.sokil.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/sokil/2016/02/dd4dwqgtnec-600x500.jpg ) is protesting against the ukranian pop-group ` potap and nastya ' for having performed in russia . 
  [ more if you 're curious ] ( https://vk.com/sokil_cherkasy ) and their [ cherkasy leader 's twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/max_shylo ) , do n't think it 's a secret that [ these guys are neo-nazis . 
  to sit here and claim territory changes that happened centuries ago were good or bad is presumptious and of course biased . 
  it 's history . 
  the european obsession with questions like these only make people hate each other over a line on a map or notes in a history book . 
  yea , seems that 's where cold-climate europeans like to travel to , but the advice i 'd get as an american in europe the first time was usually the above . 
  for most europeans any place that is not italy/spain/france / germany , or their own country , is `` a strange place to visit '' . 
  exceptions are the obligatory one or two `` surprisingly nice '' eastern european cities . 
  i did well to ignore tourism advice from friends when traveling . 
  the most memorable places are the ones you find on your own or are truly magnetized towards . 
  there was a play written about von choltitz that was made into a decent film recently , [ diplomatie ( 2014 ) .

  let 's say i was an american studying spanish , if i went to mexico and did [ anything remotely political i could be imprisoned . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_mexico#article_33 ) but that 's a poor reason to not study a language . 
  i study russian , and i think only arabic has more political baggage than this language !, 
  but if you really love it , why let that stop you . 
  so many presumptious comments from people absolutely sure about the personal beliefs of people they 've never met . 
  right , i found his name in connection with those protests last year as the `` chairman '' of sokil in one of the cities where they shut down the concerts . 
  small town , small branch , but still sad that my quick googling of their local leader brought up all this nazi junk . 
  [ it does n't take a paranoid imagination ] ( http://www.sokil.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/sokil/2016/02/dd4dwqgtnec-600x500.jpg ) to get the idea that a lot of these guys are neo-nazis . 
  ~ ~ and yea it does look like the camp in canada has existed for a while , but it 's possible that what 's happening in their camps in ukraine in these videos is happening in canada too . ~ ~ * ( but as i updated my post above to say ... yea , just a common name and my lazy googling to blame ) i 'll make a final edit and thank you for mentioning svoboda is out of parliament , good news , and that admittedly i 've been out of the loop on this junk since last year . 
  calling in bomb-threats , destroying property , and throwing fake blood and chemicals into lobbies is `` blocking '' a concert ?
