   that column is openly unfair to the german position and it 's , after all , published in an american newspaper so krugman has bi-weekly column , but there 's other ny times columnists who are uniformly more supportive of germany 's position ( none of them have a nobel prize like krugman does though ) . 
  it 's not a matter of an american newspaper being unfair to germany . 
  krugman has been beating this anti-austerity , anti-german drum for years now . 
  was n't aware that china was preaching austerity . 
  should read `` paul krugman , '' not ny times . 
  was n't aware russia was such a hot destination . 
  yeah it is . 
  [ this estimate on wikipedia puts the mongol invasions right behind ww2 for death toll . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll ) i have no idea how accurate it is though . 
  the chinese market is n't developed , and the eu and canada are * existing markets * ; they do n't offer a replacement for a market the size of the u.s. 
  without reading the article , this headline seems like it might be dealing in just a bit of hyperbole . 
  ambassadorships typically end up going to wealthy donors these days - especially ambassadorships in europe - instead of people who are actually qualified for the jobs . 
  it 's unfortunate , but true . 
  not nearly as fast as china 's would . 
  supply chains and factories can be rebuilt , enormous markets for chinese goods are harder to come by . 
  i 'm pretty sure this is really what the bible was talking about when it talked about the apocalypse . 
  we 've been misinterpreting it for centuries thinking it was about the end of the world , when in reality it was describing something much , much worse . 
  and every two years technocrats that work in the u.s. treasury put out a report with an analysis of the global economy . 
  is your problem that that a u.s. government office issues bureaucratic reports , or that the bbc mined it for news ? 
   dictators fell . 
  only to be replaced with new dictators ... 
  broad-based growth in the eurozone is what 's best for the u.s. 
   this is only a counter-attack against the recent statements of german politicians on the nsa-scandal no , it 's a pretty vanilla critique of accepted macroeconomic analysis of imbalances in the eurozone economies . 
  it matters a great deal to the u.s. that the eurozone starts growing again , and that imbalances are corrected . 
  hahaha . 
  i think a lot of the people that live in az like to imagine it as the wild west , and that 's why gun laws are more lax ... 
  but 100 years ago people in the state had just finished fighting geronimo , and these days the state is mostly filled with retirees that like to golf during the winter , and keep a few guns in their cabinets because it makes them feel safer or more powerful , or something like that . 
  why do you say that ? 
  i always assume there 's more people that do conceal carry , and in az you do n't even need a license for concealed carry anymore ... 
  but the logic behind the laws that allows anyone to openly carry holstered firearms , but requires licensing for concealed carry , is that if someone has their gun openly holstered you know they have a gun on them and could take precautions if need be . 
  the only bars they would be allowed in would be like the bars at big restaurant chains , but most bars where they would be legal do n't allow firearms inside . . 
  i have seen people from time to time in places like mcdonald 's or wal-mart that were carrying that have made me really nervous because you they looked like thugs , or looked to be addicted to drugs . 
  the guy was a very , very big man haha . 
  the gun is probably a .9 millimeter . 
  i agree , if it were a news article . 
  but it 's more of an essay , so i think the title is appropriate . 
  you 're right though . 
  it could be extended to a bunch of different countries around the world . 
  in a lot of states - especially in the west - it 's totally legal to bring holstered firearms into grocery stores , restaurants , offices , etc. 
  in arizona you 're even allowed to bring guns into some bars - like sports bars that primarily serve food . 
  of course any business could put a sign on the door prohibiting it , and in those cases people ca n't bring their guns inside . 
  well , it 's written by an italian about italy , so i think the headline was trying to be specific to what the piece is about . 
  it 's pretty goofy , but i personally found it hilarious . 
  hahaha you 're probably right . 
  america loves its food and guns - [ as evidenced by this picture i snapped in a pizza joint a while back . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/pi09oab,oms43zy ) maybe posting this secretive picture i took of someone in a comment thread about spying is a little ironic haha . 
  there was a movie made several years ago called [ dodgeball ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qupzaw5kw7m ) . 
  i loved playing that game , and still do . 
  we 're trying . 
  what do you think the mars rover is for ? 
  i ca n't believe i still have n't made this list . 
  i guess there 's always next year !, 
  [ looks like italy , france , and the uk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-ballistic_missile#current_tactical_systems ) all have capabilities . 
   wait till they denounce capitalism , nationalize everything and kick out the foreign bankers and corporations . 
  the threat of force is very real , just think of all the coups in latin america . 
  this is pretty damn stupid . 
   yeah , cause it 's totally normal to have foreign bases on your soil . 
  the u.s. has both canadian and german military facilities here . 
  allies help each other out strategically , and sometimes that means allowing them to put bases on their soil . 
  this is pretty basic stuff . 
  gfk seems to be using their owner definition of what purchasing power is , while the wiki definition is for purchasing power parity ( ppp ) , which is the common way we usually compare income levels in countries around the world . 
  if they 're using purchasing power parity ( ppp ) then it would take into account cost a of living , and a host of other things . 
  in theory $ 5 ppp is the same everywhere in the world . 
  [ here 's a basic rundown ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ), 
  not a problem . 
  this link appears to be paywalled , but if you access the link through foreign affairs ' [ facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/foreignaffairs/posts/10151671583302016 ) , there should n't be a paywall . 
  it 's really an excellent piece . 
  the two articles are n't even remotely relevant to one another . 
  they 're written in different styles , by different people , and about different topics . 
   so i did n't , in fact , say that . 
  hence my use of `` implied . '', 
   because just like with the editorial about chavez , this article does n't even attempt to seem impartial . 
  there you go again - you 're making an erroneous comparison . 
  if you want to point out where you think this ny times article is n't being impartial , be my guest . 
  but just linking to a completely unrelated editorial from 10 years earlier as an arbitrary point of comparison does n't tell me anything , except that maybe you are n't very intelligent . 
  it was implied . 
  why else would you even bring it up in discussion about russian policy towards its neighbors ? 
  an op-ed penned by the times ' editorial board more than 11 years ago discredits a a run-of-the-mill news article printed in 2013 ? 
  you know that editorials are n't supposed to be impartial , right ? 
  hence the term `` editorial . '', 
  i 'm not sure if your thinking is more of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallacy_of_composition ) or [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallacy_of_division ) . 
  or maybe [ this ? 
  ] ( http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/ad-hominem-tu-quoque.html ) if there were a game show called `` pick your logical fallacy '' you would be a star contestant !, 
  what does that have to do with russia and its neighbors ? 
  minnesota has those crazy lutheran 's though . 
  i knew a guy who went to some bible college up there , and came back a fanatic ... talking about the pope being the antichrist and what not . 
  there 's a bunch of protestant mega-churches in the u.s. that operate almost like mcdonald 's franchises . 
  they make big bucks , and pay no taxes . 
  it 's actually just the opposite . 
  i just remember the first time i visited when i was 8 being told that the people living in mobile homes in certain parts of the country were called `` tinkers . '', 
  this was way back in the early 90 's . 
  they 've pulled back each time . 
  it 's a difficult political situation right now . 
  a lot more goes into currency valuations than just confidence though . 
  when we talk about reserve currency , we 're talking more about bond issuance than we are about currency markets . 
   yes , among the anti-eu crowd . 
  hence why this plays well into the us ' hands . 
  that 's just conspiratorial bullshit . 
  markets are still worried that a country like greece , italy , or spain would pull out of the euro , and decimate its value . 
  there is no `` anti-eu crowd '' in the us haha .
