  the decision of european allies to join up with the bank illustrates where interests might divide . 
  with less us military involvement , it is possible that the gap would be filled with european strength sufficient to reassure eastern european nations that their sovereignty will be defended . 
  i wonder how credible the threat of russian encroachment on eastern europe seems to the western nations who hold all of the real power within the eu . 
  as a us citizen i certainly prefer an empowered eu only insofar as that does n't mean brussels can prevent tallinn and warsaw from requesting us military support . 
  us military intervention that exists outside of the eu is predominantly focused in east asia where we single-handedly defend the right of taiwan to exist independently of china , we ensure maximum us forces prepared to defend the people south korea should there be a fight with the north and we patrol disputed territory to ensure that shipping lanes remain open for japan . 
  in the middle east the most important goal the us has is the continued sovereignty of the jewish state of israel . 
  it is extremely unlikely that this goal will change , and there is a potential rupture in eu-us relations as europe seems increasingly hostile to the jewish people . 
  if a critical europe means curtailed encroachment of israel on palestinian land then this counterbalance may be a positive . 
  i think from a legal standpoint it is questionable if there is sufficient evidence of assad committing genocide . 
  does n't that undermine the sovereignty claim ? 
  could you qualify how the us is throwing the uk under the bus ? 
  and this is literally the first time i 've heard that obama is anti-british so i 'm curious about that as well . 
  i 'm not following if your math is comparing the us with the uk per capita or per square km , but either way i think you 're right to stress the importance of treating others as equals . 
  this certainly includes canada , they should n't be relegated to a `` lesser power '' because of limited population density in their northern regions . 
  it has become popular among democracies , particularly the us , to parse population and government and then claim admiration for the former while despising the latter . 
  it seems like the nature of democracy ought to minimize this , but for whatever reason that is n't the case . 
  once i know the specifics of your frustrations , if you would like i can reason through them both from a citizen 's standpoint and potentially the government rational . 
  would it be in the us interest to have a weak eu ? 
  ** pros ** a weaker eu would struggle to negotiate as a single economic bloc , meaning that business with the us is more attractive . 
  dependency on the us for military support might mean more sales of us arms to european countries , as well as preferential trade . 
  dependency on us favor might pressure countries like sweden into not granting asylum to edward snowden and people like him . 
  a united , strong europe might oppose us interests in the region . 
  ** cons ** the us becomes a scapegoat for problems within the eu which might hurt brand reputation within the eu . 
  european nations free-ride on the defense agreements the us enters . 
  a weak europe means lower buying power in european countries , and thus less business for us companies . 
  political will in the us is limited , leaders do n't want to have to spend it on aiding an ailing europe . 
  overall i think it 's unlikely that us leaders have made the calculation that a weakened eu is preferable . 
  i 'm sure there are loads more pros and cons , i was just listing some to show my train of thought . 
  no no , it 's short for `` romanian '' , right ? 
  i can understand frustration , but the relationship between the us , the uk , and canada is almost certainly the strongest we 've ever had . 
  with an alliance as strong as the one between these three , it makes more sense to focus on absolute gains , not relative gains . 
  `` used to '' ? 
  you could credibly say that for the next 20 years . 
  is n't that only true for certain parts of morocco ? 
  same with algeria ? 
  had no idea that german intelligence worked [ that way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg_ll9m7cl4 ), 
  after the brexit ( if there is a brexit ) could the us negotiate free trade with the uk independently of the eu ? 
  or would there still be a trade bloc to deal with ? 
  welp , the russian students at my school drive $ 90k + cars , so not all of your countrymen are suffering !, 
  the one guy who co-signed with his parents for $ 145,000 + saying he felt a bit guilty about his parents and that they were worried about losing their house . 
  and then the next paragraph was basically how he just wants to forget about america and focus on europe now . 
  yeah , those poor parents . 
  edit : ah , the parents moved out of the country too . 
  well that works then , i guess . 
  public universities are still quite expensive , it 's not unreasonable to imagine incurring this much debt at one of them . 
  since almost every single line in this comment section is against these kids i think i 'll say a word or two in their defense . 
  it 's extremely common here to near graduation and have your parents pressure you into school . 
  it used to be that parents would help with the cost of school , but the laws have been changed in such a way that a 17 year old kid does n't need a co-signer to take on ~ $ 10,000 per semester of debt that bankruptcy can not eliminate . 
  parents push their children into this debt with no negative repercussions if their kids fail . 
  so there is n't the pragmatic push toward valuable degrees . 
  the fact that a bankruptcy does n't eliminate the debt means that risk assessments become unnecessary , and a high-risk teenager who 's never had a job in their life can be given tens of thousands of dollars in debt . 
  maybe this sub is unforgiving and libertarian enough that the onus falls exclusively on these students , but i dislike the degree to which we seem to be absolving government-sanctioned , structural , systematic exploitation . 
   figured that , going to an ivy league uni is as much of a status symbol as it is actual education . 
  ivy league degree is pretty functional , it 's not simply a status thing . 
  it is recognized as more significant than a regular university , and you 're likely to have contacts connecting you to whatever industry you 're trying to enter . 
  plenty of the ivy league grads have their job set a full year before they even graduate .

  it 's a smart moderating choice to mitigate notoriously unreliable sources and their presence on this sub . 
   maybe even the rise of another hitler when germany needs the right to talk some sense into left-wing policies , it 's shitty that they keep getting associated with hitler . 
  we 're figuring this out , sensible immigration policies and refugee policies do not equal the holocaust . 
  the english dubs on miyazaki films are usually pretty good , especially princess mononoke , they got billy bob thornton and minnie driver for it .

   supporters and opponents of moldova 's new government , the * third * to be formed in * less than a year * , are again taking to the streets of the capital chisinau . 
  are opposition parties prepared for snap elections this time ? 
  because if they ca n't mount a campaign they 'll be back here again in months . 
  i do n't have the numbers , but this could be bad for sectors within the polish economy . 
  especially if poland is trying to create break-out , specialization in high-tech , that sector could suffer if adequately educated poles moved to work outside of poland . 
  the country specializes instead in labor-intensive production as opposed to capital-intensive . 
  that was predicted to be an initial issue with eastern and southern european integration . 
  the ruling party seems like such a contradiction . 
  extreme fiscal conservatism , even to the chagrin of fellow southern eu states , and yet highly radical in their approach to immigration . 
  would it serve as fuel for the `` no '' vote side of the upcoming referendum ? 
  what will be the british reaction if these 50 reach the shore ? 
  would it be different if britain were not a member of the eu ? 
  esa works with nasa all the time , it 's not exactly like the one precludes the other .

  i totally agree , i was around rauma/turku and there was always some lake or something nearby if you got too hot . 
  would that be the history of using the word ? 
  did english evolve to begin calling it germany ? 
  english has strong germanic roots and loads of cognates with german . 
  so , i 've always wondered why our word for `` germany '' is completely different from deutschland .
