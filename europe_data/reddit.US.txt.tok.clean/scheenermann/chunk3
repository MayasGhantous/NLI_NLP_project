  nationalist animosities are too entrenched . 
   a good example are the scandinavian languages . 
  they are mostly still mutually intelligible dialects of old norse and the people who speak them are very close genetically and culturally yet no one says they do n't exist . 
  a popular phrase for this in english is : `` a language is a dialect with an army and a navy . '', 
  the difference between language and dialect is essentially political . 
  danish and swedish could be considered the same language if their speakers so desired , but they do n't , so they are separate languages . 
  linguists do n't get involved in politics : if swedes and macedonians say their languages are languages and not dialects , they roll with it . 
  macedonian actually is n't even the most egregious case of language secessionism in the balkans . 
  romanian/moldovan and the four varieties of serbo-croatian are actually based on the same standard dialect , but they use different names and there is some local tinkering . 
  on the other hand , macedonian is not standard bulgarian with a different name : it is based on a macedonian dialect , whereas bulgarian was standardized on an eastern bulgarian dialect . 
  an american nation exists because the people of that nation perceive themselves as such . 
  that being said , there are multiple conceptions of the american nation . 
  the dominant one is citizenship-based , but some people have more exclusive views of what it means to be american . 
  that kind of drives home my previous point : nations are imagined communities . 
  `` country '' is a different term , referring more to the polity itself . 
  almost all nations are created or at least molded by external factors . 
  you really just proved his point . 
  nations are imagined communities . 
  are any of us real ?

  the fact that the balto-slavic language family is split , with lithuanian firmly in the baltic subgroup , * not * the slavic subgroup , should have ended this discussion before it began . 
  you may not see it , but there 's a very good reason why russia is n't testing it . 
  again , what standard ? 
  there 's no real continent-wide `` european '' standard . 
  unless the standard is industrial pilsners or lagers , which is a worldwide trend . 
   european standard . 
  care to explain the standard ? 
  have lived all over this continent and never discerned a standard .

  there 's no point in trying to say `` football '' if you 're an american overseas . 
  people expect you to say `` soccer , '' so it only makes things confusing . 
  besides , `` soccer '' is unambiguous and what we naturally call the sport , so ... edit : care to explain the downvotes ? 
  i 'm an american who lives in europe . 
  what i said is completely in line with my experiences . 
  it 's probably difficult to quantify what `` most of the english-speaking world '' calls it , especially since a lot of countries use both terms interchangeably , and this is n't a vote anyway so pure numbers mean nothing . 
  but soccer is not an * exclusively * american term , it was invented in the uk and is used in a number of other countries . 
  could you correct what you think is wrong ? 
  the reaction against the term `` soccer '' has been so negative that some people now actually think it was an american invention . 
  he 's quite blunt , but i agree with the spirit of his post . 
  `` soccer '' was a term invented in the uk and it was actually quite common there for a long period of time . 
  the uk then reacted quite violently against the term around the 1980s , to the extent that many today now regard it as an americanism or even an american invention . 
  this previously-common word now provokes foaming-at-the-mouth reactions like in every thread like this . 
  there are actually quite a lot of countries that call it soccer . 
  usa , canada , ireland , australia , south africa , japan , etc. 
  the term was invented in england and was actually quite common there in the past . 
  [ this paper ] ( http://ns.umich.edu/releases/2014/june14/its-football-not-soccer.pdf ) asserts that `` soccer '' was close to interchangeable with `` football '' in the uk from the 1960s to the 1980s , and it did n't carry an association with the us . 
  its use in the uk may have declined as a reaction against the us beginning to get more interested in the sport . 
  it 's usually brought up by greeks who seem not to know the actual history behind the name `` vardarska '' and the banovina system . 
  case in point , this thread !, 
  i know the history of the region quite well . 
  do you think a layman ( and an american at that ) casually knows about the yugoslav banovina system ? 
  i 'm the one who had to explain some history in this conversation . 
  honestly , man , you seem very nationalist . 
  i doubt we could have a useful discussion here . 
  cheers, 
   it 's what that area wall called before tito . 
  [ read my response to the other guy here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67x7yh/live_macedonians_enter_the_parliament_of_fyrom/dgvesd9/ ) if you 're implying that the region was known as `` vardarska '' before evil tito changed it to macedonia , then you are being dishonest . 
  `` vardarska '' was part of the banovina system created by the kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  the intention of the provinces was to obscure ethnic identification . 
  the borders were created to be incongruent ethnically ( the vardar banovina included parts of kosovo and southern serbia ) and the provinces were named after a geographic feature ( usually a river ) that nobody identified with . 
  the whole point of the name and borders of vardarska was supposed to be that it would n't inspire nationalist feelings . 
  even more , the system was only around for about ten years . 
  do you see why that name makes no sense as an option ? 
  i think greeks really hurt their cause when they make stupid suggestions like this . 
  and as the republic of macedonia is in the region of macedonia , the current name of the country is n't stolen . 
  sorry , man , i know you * feel * differently , but it 's a fact and it has to be dealt with . 
   they wont though ... too much nationalistic rhetorics and hatred . 
  they wo n't because `` vardarska '' is a terrible suggestion for a name . 
  greeks really need to stop suggesting it . 
   well it was done by a pretty credible american group out of pure skepticism ... apparently it does n't matter though . 
  / s  gallup is okay , though their record lately has n't been great . 
  they actually refrained from polling the 2016 presidential race because they were way off in 2012 . 
  i 'd also be careful about taking an american pollster working outside the us ( especially in a recently-annexed territory with an authoritarian government ) too close to heart - sure , it 's fun data to look at , but i 'm not sure how accurate it would be . 
   hillary has a 99 % chance winning .
