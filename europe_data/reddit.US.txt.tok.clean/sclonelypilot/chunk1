by that logic why did n't we see red army in world war 2 using lots and lots of german panzers and trucks ??? 
  you know why ?? 
   because when you capture something from the enemy it will probably be damaged , or out of ammunition or fuel . 
  it would maybe help you in a few battles but after that its over . 
  lostarmour.info identified  400 armored units that was captured by `` rebels '' . 
  that means they were repaired and put back in service , though lately a lot of tanks were salvaged for parts . 
  `` rebels '' got few factories to repair tanks , there are some videos on the net . 
  ukraine lost 800 armored units in the war . 
  rebels lost 210 armored units in the war . 
  the above figures includes captures , so half of ukrainian losses are spoils . 
  that 's quiet ridiculous . 
  edit : it does n't mean that russians did n't supply tanks or participated in the war . 
  there are 4 t72b3s in the database which were only made by russia . 
  what 's a religion ? 
  because atheism itself can be defined as a religion , i.e. 
  they believe that there is no g-d . 
  any context ? 
  the building has a sign : `` drug dispensary '' . 
   http://vk.com/vlegotkin?w=wall75344642_9884 tldr : ukrainian regional head of vk decided to introduce a flair specifically for ukrainians , because spikelets of wheat symbolizes ukraine . 
   so ... someone comes to your neighbourhood and threatens your family and you will not fight them ? 
  the local people from donbass mostly fight for dnr/lnr whatever they want or not - some are volunteers , some are forced due to lack of money or conscripted . 
  are they civilians , soldiers or terrorists ? 
   you really think those soldiers had a choice not to be soldiers ? 
  that 's a loaded question . 
  in reality some had a choice and some not on both sides of the conflict . 
   if someone would made invasion on us soil would you be civilian or soldier while defending your family ( assuming you are not soldier right now ) ? 
  i 'd be a soldier if i was a part of us military . 
  any breakdown of casualties : civilians vs soldiers/combatants ? 
   the page itself says : `` russian tsardom or the byzantine variant russian tsardom - the official name of the russian government between 1547 and 1721 . 
  the official name during this period was \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 . '', 
  that 's a creative translation , since you missed one part : http://i.imgur.com/hveodxr.png the proper translation is : '' ** also ** the official name during this period was \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 . '', 
   \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 = old east slavic name for the state . 
  notice how it 's a different word from \u0420\u0479\u0301\u0441\u044c . 
  what does say here about ivan the terrible , notice the spelling of rus : http://imgur.com/c5f2zdy, 
   ivan 's title was ** tsar of all rus ** you just literally spelled out exactly the same thing . 
   the state he ruled over was called \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 . 
  that state was never called \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 . 
  the state name is never mentioned , because ivan 's title is a couple of lines long , spelling out each of his titles . 
  \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 is coming from one of the seals , but again it is n't a state name by itself . 
  and it means the same things as rus . 
  even in modern russian , '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438 '' and '' \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 '' are two words . 
   what the hell are you spewing bile about ? 
  nowhere does it say `` otherwise . '', 
  how about you provide some proof , have n't seen any yet . 
   it does n't matter that the modern russian word for rus is `` russia '' . 
  what matters it the old east slavic word for it , which was rus . 
  i marked for you on the seal : http://imgur.com/kcd58ru, 
   during its time , the russian tsardom was officially called \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 how about some citations ? 
  the same article you 're referring to says otherwise . 
  if you 're referring to this name - \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/category:seals_of_ivan_iv#/media/file:seal_of_ivan-iv.jpg i '' ll just quote myself again :  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 / \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c is the same word . 
  or do i really need to highlight the part of the seal ? 
  definitely not ukrainian one . 
  what are we talking about ? 
  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e is the original name , not a translation . 
  russian tsardom is a translation . 
  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c was the name of the lands , ivan took the name for his tsardom . 
   it was a single entity for a time , until the death of grand prince sviatoslav . 
  not really . 
  novogrod is a good example . 
  it was a princely state in kievan rus . 
   modern russia did not keep the name , it adopted a foreign name . 
  the old east slavic word for it was rus , it was not russia . 
  they kept the name . 
  the name in russian was : \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e or russian kingdom or rus kingdom ( russkoe/rus is the same word ) so they borrowed the name , because originally the people of rus called themselves : russkie . 
  unless you 're talking about transition to rossiya which was much later with peter i. 
   you seem to have a political agenda . 
  no , that 's the history . 
  you can open ukraine in wiki and read what ukrainians wrote there . 
  kiev was under occupation for a very long time . 
  since you do n't know anything about ukrainian/russian history , we can stop this conversation . 
  kievan rus was n't a singular entity , it was a collection of smaller duchies . 
  originally they were organized under kiev , later duchy of moscow organised all these duchies under one banner . 
  russia/ukraine/belarus used to be the same people , occupation by mongols/lithuania/poland made them into 3 distinct groups . 
  culturally/linguistically they 're all descendants of kievan rus . 
  and i think you missed the point , my original words :  while modern russia kept the name , kievan rus was russia . 
  kievan rus was russia in name and everything . 
  modern russia kept the name , but does n't her make a legal descendant . 
  duchy of moscovia was ruled by ruriks , ivan the terrible is a direct descendant of rurik . 
  `` russia '' is in english/french texts . 
  mongols were beaten dmitry of moscow ( ! ), 
  at kulikovo and finally broken by ivan iii ( moscow ) . 
  kiev was under occupation of mongols then lithuania/poland and etc. 
  i provided a link that russia was the dominant name in romance countries . 
  who were the founders/rulers of `` the tsardom of muscovy '' ? 
  what was that dynasty that founded kievan rus and ruled russia until 16th century ? 
  russia was the latin name . 
  kievan rus spanned from finland to black sea , so russia/belarus/ukraine . 
   in the 11th century , the dominant term in the latin tradition was ruscia . 
  it was used , among others , by thietmar of merseburg , adam of bremen , cosmas of prague and pope gregory vii in his letter to izyaslav i. rucia , ruzzia , ruzsia were alternative spellings . 
  during the 12th century , ruscia gradually made way for two other latin terms , russia and ruthenia . 
  russia ( also spelled rossia and russie ) was a dominant romance-language form , first used by liutprand of cremona in the 960s and then by peter damiani in the 1030s . 
  it became ubiquitous in english and french documents in the 12th century . 
  where did you find those words ? 
  not in the article ? 
  the dynasty that founded kievan rus , also founded moscow and ruled it for quiet while . 
  while modern russian kept the name , kievan rus was russia . 
  comparing to the republican party , democrats are fairly united . 
  between the two parties , i 'd say the republican party is falling apart . 
  while his policies may not be perfect , they 're definitely brought the country to the better future than the ones by the previous president . 
  we can go over multiple metrics , but usa is in better shape than 8 years ago .
