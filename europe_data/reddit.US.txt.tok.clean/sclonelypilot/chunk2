   israel 's ministry of information do you mind linking it , so far cant find it : http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/state/government/pages/israel%20government%20ministries.aspx, 
   there were food shortages in estonia all the time . 
  maybe you lived in a very special place - i.e very far from fast growing cities could possibly explain it . 
  population of estonia is about 1.5 million , my hometown is around a million . 
  coupons and that kind of stuff came around 1990 , was n't around 1982 . 
  i think you 're confusing eras , in 1989 and forward - food shortages . 
  and unless you 're like 40 + you would n't remember how it was in 1982 . 
   lets pretend that i had said `` heart of a dog '' for example . 
  bulgakov died in 1940 , master and margarita was n't finished when he died . 
  he did n't censor his own work , he did n't finish it . 
  you implied that you could have gone to jail for reading master and margarita in 1982 , i 'd like to see any proof . 
  or lets say any of bulgakov 's work . 
  in 1982 soviets named an asteroid after him : https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/3469_%d0%91%d1%83%d0%bb%d0%b3%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b2, 
   70 % of american jews vote the way i described . 
  left ? 
  like american left , which is the right for europe ? 
  this is mostly for cooperation on military level , i think it 's fluff that they 're talking about ukraine . 
  russian military does n't make decisions , they follow orders . 
  nato just wants to talk to the military commanders so they would chill about their silly show off tactics . 
   these uneducated american dimwits . 
  sure , i see one . 
  the coupons were n't around in 1982 . http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-30/news/mn-5767_1_soviet-union  ** the first time since rationing of food was suspende ** d in 1947 , leningraders will have to produce coupons to buy food at state-subsidized prices starting saturday . 
   sure it was . 
  at least people 's basic needs were provided for , eeryone had a job and some general stability , the corruption was lower , and there were no oligarchs . 
  why else would people long for communism ? 
  on the other hand , all this was true in other communist countries , but there was one big issue : it was basically a russian occupation . 
  no matter how good it was , it was an occupation . 
  even if the people were given free gold , they would still think it is an evil system put in place by an occupying power . 
  ask any estonian . 
  we 're talking about russia , the poll has very little relevancy about estonian feelings . 
   i can understand that you find the hours standing in line to buy mere low quality sausage very hard to believe , but it is a sad truth and does not really reflect well on the supposed greatness of the socialist paradise . 
  very hard to believe , because i lived there ( ukraine ) . 
  the soviet groceries stores were ok , cheap quality . 
  but markets were available to buy anything you want , that 's where we went for food shopping . 
  in 1980-85 there was n't a shortage of food . 
  the consumer goods were lacking though , that 's true . 
  yea , that 's the only improvement russia/ukraine has over soviet union . 
  i 'd even say that 's the food quality went down also . 
  yes , it got all nice packaging - but it 's tasteless . 
  i think food shortages were closer to the very late 1980s , but its hard to remember if it was when were in ukraine or ussr . 
  we could n't buy a lot of things in ukraine , i still have that worthless paper that was called money - few millions . 
   the first fully uncensored version of `` the master and margarita '' was released in 1989 in the soviet union . 
  check wiki - it was 1974 . 
  here is a copy : http://alba-books.com/alba-books/%d0%91%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%8f-%d0%b3%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f;-%d0%a2%d0%b5%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9-%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd;-%d0%9c%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%80-%d0%b8-%d0%9c%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b0-%d0%91%d1%8f%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0-%d0%b3%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f;-%d0%a2%d0%b5%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd-%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd;-%d0%9c%d0%b0%d0%b9%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b0-%d0%b8-%d0%9c%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b0-%d0%9d%d0%b0-%d1%80%d1%83%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8-%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b8%d0%ba-[%d0%9c%d0%b8%d1%85%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bb-%d0%91%d1%83 ( it seems that the bot hates url shorteners ), 
   soviet union gdp ca n't be really calculated . 
  yea , it can be and it was . 
   what you can know is things like that in 1982 every wednesday was a sausage day of a week . 
  that was a day when stores had sausage and people lined up for hours to get their allotted norm . 
  lol . 
  i know it 's 4/20 today , but wait until 4:20 to smoke that much . 
   n the 1982 usa a russophile could enjoy reading uncensored version of bulgakov 's `` the master and margarita '' , while in russia having this illegal book found on you threw you into deep trouble and possibly jail time . 
  it was printed in soviet union since 70s or so . 
  the uncensored version . 
   by the way it is absolutely false that life in the 80s was better even for russians . 
  by what measure ? 
  life expectancy ? 
  gdp ? 
  for an example - 1982 : * usa - gdp per capita - $ 14400 * ussr - gdp per capita - $ 5800 and now ( 2013 ) : * usa - $ 53040 * russia - $ 14611 * ukraine - $ 3900, 
  the poll is n't very clear : about which soviet union are we talking about , so i am interpreting it : soviet union in 80s was better than russia right now . 
  president as the brand for cheese and butter . 
  * russia - stoli * germany - bmw ( cars ) * france - president ( cheese and wine ) * finland - nokia * belgium - godiva ( and various other chocolates ) * uk - carr 's, 
  loose compare to what ? 
  new mexico does n't even have ownership requirements . 
  delaware requires some disclosure , quiet comparable to other states . 
  can not be number one , delaware will only reduce state tax liabilities not the federal ones . 
  putin is n't on the list . 
  and we know that putin is the bad guy , now poroshenko seems to be in the same league as putin . 
  yea , it 's big for ukraine . 
  if comrades do not read russian ( and you should ! ), 
  read here : https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gazeta.ru%2fpolitics%2f2016%2f03%2f30_a_8151107.shtml  a team of international lawyers , associated with the russian government , is currently working in the archives of the us congress in an attempt to find ways to challenge the sale of alaska usa procedure russian in the time of alexander ii . 
  according to experts , due to violation of legal procedures for filing a claim in a us court can achieve a positive outcome . 
  in the united states , in turn , is seriously concerned about the possibility of losing alaska . 
  glory for the motherland !, 
  why obama needs to do anything . 
  we already blew up few countries back to stone age . 
  i do n't think it helped much with terrorists , if europe wants to respond then they should do it together . 
  usa is n't part of europe , but we will help with a support role . 
   you can taste the difference in fruits and vegetable from spain , eh spain - the stuff i bought from mercado/carrefour was pretty tasteless in spain . 
  supermarket wise france is better than spain . 
  portugal was ok , continente was about the same as whole foods . 
  so not sure who told you that americans regard that food as `` high '' quality . 
  nyc has great veggies , plenty of local farmers upstate . 
  i was wondering myself :-) i guess because the bread mixes came from ukraine . 
  no clue . 
  it depends i traveled a lot in europe and even between countries there are a lot of differences . 
  in general if you go to a cheap us supermarket , you will get cheap products . 
  we are shopping at the local `` expensive '' supermarkets and the products i would say about the same or better than in europe . 
  our `` expensive '' supermarkets target russian-speaking community so ukrainians , russians , jews , etc. 
  and for an example bread mix comes from ukraine , so it 's the same bread that we ate in ukraine . 
  they even put `` made in ukraine '' label on the bread , even though they baked right there at the supermarket . 
  the downside is the price , those are premium supermarkets : http://gourmanoff.com/ http://www.cherryhillgourmet.net/, 
  in sweden minors can get way with a murder ? 
  perfect hitmen !, 
  those hospitals do n't have anything on roofs : https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2015/11/04/fact-checking-russias-claim-that-it-didnt-bomb-a-hospital-in-syria/ one of the reasons , because the regime was targeting hospitals based on markings . 
  at least that what i heard . 
  we 're committed to take 10000 , 2800 are already here . 
  the same way as many legal immigrants in usa are against illegal immigration . 
  it 's a real pain to go through immigration legally , there are multiple checks in place , interviews , medical exams , financial reviews , educational background checks . 
  refuges are n't immigrants , they should be sheltered for a bit and returned back home when it 's safe . 
   they had to take a few thousand and they took none .
