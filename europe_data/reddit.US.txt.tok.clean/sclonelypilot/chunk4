  it 's quiet common to bring parents over to canada so they get better healthcare than in poland/ukraine . 
   i know romanians who were refused visas to visit their adult children which are canadian citizens . 
  you know that 's exactly why they were refused in the first place . 
  it 's very common for parents to stay with children illegally and then abuse the state wellfare . 
   common term in the us and so on . 
  common term in `` common '' laws countries . 
   for example , in russian `` rape '' is '' \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' ( root word `` violence '' ) , while statutory rape is '' \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' or '' \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' ( root word `` filth '' ) . 
  uh my russian is n't that bad , but root for \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 is \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430 - force and for \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 is \u0442\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044c - rot . 
  * ) could n't understand the actions . 
  now i completely disagree with / u/trycatch1 russian laws are very similar to us laws . 
   we are talking about the german term `` vergewaltigung '' ok , so this term means rape . 
  fine . 
  now how do you call in common german when an adult has sex with a minor . 
   this is an age dependent crime , while rape is not . 
  not sure what you mean . 
  according to you it 's impossible to rape a child in germany , because different section of the laws covering those crimes . 
  for an example if you rape an adult and that adult dies it 's called :  section 178 : sexual coercion and rape resulting in death for a child :  section 176b : sexual abuse of children resulting in death, 
   germany is not rape , period , no way to get around that . 
  it 's still a rape . 
  does n't matter what exactly it says in the law , still a rape . 
  we 're talking about a common term between people not legalese that was written exactly in the laws usa 's legalese varies between states and can be : criminal sexual contact , aggravated sexual assault or whatever . 
  or in plain english - rape . 
  because it 's an english term , i would doubt that it would be in the german laws . 
  but according to german laws : penal code \u00a7 176 : '' ( 1 ) whoever commits sexual acts on a person under fourteen ( 14 ) years of age ( a child ) or allows them to be committed on himself by the child , shall be punished by imprisonment from six months to ten years [ ... ] '' that 's clearly defines statutory rape in the german laws . 
  in usa , i would tell them : got a warrant ? 
  rule 1 number : never knowledge anything . 
  if you confirm that you twitter a lot , you could compromise yourself . 
  if you lie then you could still make yourself liable . 
  the best answer is never knowledge anything . 
  do n't talk to polish sb , sbu , fsb , or fbi/nypd . 
   serious question ; did you read it ? 
  its like radical musllims saying ' i do n't approve isis but . . ' it 's like turks saying that they do n't support isis , while providing them with means to kill kurds and everybody else . 
   if you think it does n't mention pkk you clearly do not have a clue what is written there . 
  you 're welcome to quote relevant parts here , especially the petition is only around 300 words or so . 
  the petition is here : http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2016/bia140116.html it does n't even mention pkk . 
   how would you people react ? 
  it seems it still is n't a crime to be a muslim in usa . 
  so your example is bad . 
   i do n't twist facts . 
  yea , you do . 
  you picked a quote from something you believe in , not a fact . 
  i can randomly google internet and pick a fact : http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/03/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/  the total figure of civilians deliberately killed under stalinism , around six million , is of course horribly high . 
  that 's an order of magnitude less . 
   and it is russia who is building monuments for one of the biggest murderer - stalin . 
  those are built by private parties on their private land . 
  talking about twisting of facts . 
  can you get an amazon phone or a tablet ? 
  it does n't have a playstore . 
  google does n't sell as many phones as apple , my samsung phone came with samsung services not google ones . 
  amazon even removed all google services from their devices , even though it 's still android, 
  not really . 
  while i am super upset about our elections , it does n't mean usa is going down the flames . 
  both parties ( and screw trump ) are still with europe , we love you and you have our support . 
  nothing will change that , internally we many need to figure out some stuff . 
  i highly doubt that trump can reverse reagan 's legacy , so russia wo n't have much luck with their ambitions . 
  personally have n't paid much attention to polls , so these results came as a big surprise . 
  both parties fucked us over . 
  personally i am a libertarian , which would align me closer with democrats . 
  but i am not happy about many of their policies . 
  clinton was n't a great choice or the other candidates . 
  just old fuckers looking for fame , so it 's a crisis of identity in usa . 
  what we need our young blood . 
  generation x or even millennials in power , i am a gen x or a very old millennial :-), 
  oh it 's fucking unbelievable , we 're fucked short term and somewhat long term . 
  there are 3 supreme court judges are up for grabs and it may have a huge impact on the civil liberties in usa . 
  edit : pa and fl went to trump , it 's official now - he won . 
  those two states usually decide the outcome . 
  electricity cost is 0.08 , the rest is delivery and taxes . 
  and it 's about $ 0.24 or eur 0.22 in nyc . 
  actually i can see canada , just not usa below it . 
  it seems that op is right , originally 112 . ua tv broadcasted this and then russians picked it up . 
  the same way as the syrian ngos claimed that only civilians were killed . 
  * ruaf : 259 civilians , 7 gunmen * coalition af : 13 civilians , 0 gunmen * ypg : 17 civilians , 0 gunmen snhr 's report in question : http://sn4hr.org/wp-content/pdf/english/1481_people_were_killed_in_november_2015_en.pdf they stopped recently publishing gunmen deaths , since it 's clear that their statistics is made up . 
  yea , you did . 
  if american black ops murder anybody in holland under official orders from usa . 
  they 're immune from prosecution and dutch law . 
  so if hague tries to try any american servicemen and american special forces kill a number of civilians in order to release these servicemen then american special forces fall under american law . 
  you signed the sofa agreement : http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/sofa.htm, 
  usa passed `` the hague invasion '' law and our allied countries signed an agreement to never prosecute american personnel . 
   whatabohtism aside snhr is a pro rebel website , the numbers are meaningless . 
  any rebel will be a civilian . 
  we can even see from your post that numbers are meaningless since everybody is making up them on the fly , even snhr does n't say 3800 . 
  yea , i apparently thought that black salaries were mostly common in russia/ukraine . 
  i guess now i know who taught them !, 
  it 's very uncommon in usa , but handymen/construction contractors love cash . 
   i ca n't find a single reliable and ** independant ** source to support this claim . 
  there is no such thing as an independent source . 
  i read plenty of * independent * sources that recommended to invoke section 891 in retaliation . 
  until this spectacle plays out it 's a pure speculation to guess what will happen next . 
  the tax laws are very complicated and can be interpreted in many ways . 
   this article explains it well : that 's a shitty article and this piece says that usa will pay billions just not a full 14 billions bill . 
  just because a some random cpa says something it is n't a fact . 
   but that would only occur if apple brings all its offshore money home through fully taxed dividend payments . 
  specifically this bit , i do n't recall any part of the tax law to require that . 
   they ca n't claim money that should be paid by apple-ireland on apple-usa 's tax returns unless they bring back this offshore money into the us before paying in ireland . 
  they wo n't bring this money back unless us tax code is modified . 
  money are in apple-bermuda , not apple-ireland . 
  both apple-bermuda and apple-ireland are wholly owned by apple-usa . 
  they can not bring money back from apple-bermuda to usa without our tax , but can claim apple-ireland 's expenses . 
   they did n't paid taxes on money earned abroad .
