  * all tv channels must be mostly in ukrainian , either spoken or translated ( not subtitles ) . 
  you ca n't have a foreign language channel in ukraine at all . 
  * all ** internal ** documents of civic organizations , political parties must be in ukrainian - no exceptions . 
  i do n't have time to read the rest , but its true that ukrainian became an exclusive language in ukraine . 
  there are few exceptions , but in majority its exclusive . 
  you pretty much can only talk a foreign language in private , but you ca n't send a telegram in russian ( funny enough there is an article for telegrams ) . 
   at the same time no single german civil servant is allowed to give you advice that is in any language but german . 
  got a link to the law ? 
  iin some situations like crossing a border control would force ukrainian citizens to use only ukrainian language ( no exceptions ) - article 14 . 
  and there are tons of other articles that enforce use of ukrainian language and limiting other languages mostly to private conversations . 
  an another example : if a ukrainian citizen wants to name his kid nikola , nicola or nikolay - he ca n't . 
  because he must use ukrainian version of the name . 
  ( article 36 ), 
  ok . taskforce is saying that russian news is spreading fakenews about the new ukrainian language law that was n't enacted yet . 
  i am saying that russian news are n't that wrong , since in some situations like crossing a border control would force ukrainian citizens to use only ukrainian language ( no exceptions ) . 
  and there are tons of other articles that enforce use of ukrainian language and limiting other languages mostly to private conversations . 
  an another example : if a ukrainian citizen wants to name his kid nikola , nicola or nikolay - he ca n't . 
  because he must use ukrainian version of the name . 
  ( article 36 ), 
   ohmy . 
  i 'm genuinely sorry that i missed that this entire time , but it would also have been easier if you would have just linked it . 
  =p i tried . 
  this sub deleted my comment due the link shorteners in the damn pdf . 
   and no restrictions have ever been enacted limiting that choice so the future law does n't fit this category because it was n't enacted yet ? 
  i used your pdf ( page 3 ) : https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/disinformation_review_02.02.2017_eng.pdf  did you consider that instead of the eu taskforce `` spreading fake news '' they were told that part was bullshit , they acted properly and hence it was removed from all future versions of this . pdf ? 
  because https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/disinformation_review_26.01.2017_eng.pdf is not the latest . 
  i am quoting the actual law . 
  not what newspaper articles wrote . 
  this is original content , sadly since you cant read ukrainian you can try to google translate . 
  that 's two difference agencies . 
  do you understand the difference ? 
   i 'll believe you when you can find me an actual citizen who is refused entry because s/he does n't understand the state language . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  it 's an idiotic law . 
  stopfake is wrong and so eu taskforce . 
  how about that ukrainian citizens ' names must follow ukrainian language rules . 
  so no more nicola , nikolay , but must be mikola . 
  article 14 has no exceptions for ukrainian citizen , there is an exception for foreign citizens . 
  a ) i am from ukraine ( i left 22 years ago ) b ) i already said that stopfake.org is wrong . 
  c ) i did n't read the rt article , i opened the actual law in ukrainian . 
  d ) http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/jh4di00a.html here is the webpage of the law , i read it and commented . 
  here is the source of my sentence . 
  search for this :  it is an often repeated disinformation that russian is or will be banned in ukraine . 
  according to ukraine 's constitution and the law on languages , every person is guaranteed the right to choose the language he or she wishes to speak and no restrictions have ever been enacted limiting that choice a gem from the law : now if a ukrainian citizen wants to cross a ukrainian border control that citizen must talk only in ukrainian while foreign citizens can talk any . 
  eu taskforce itself is producing fake news . 
  i picked an article about new ukrainian language law and its nonsense . 
  the new law pretty makes ukrainian almost exclusive , but not 100 % . 
  eu taskforce is blindly publishing stopfake.org 's disapproval article without doing its own due diligence . 
  no , that 's democracy = rule of majority . 
  some countries like usa , have electoral college to avoid some pitfalls of `` tyranny of the majority '' . 
  but obviously it wo n't alleviate the problems , since democracy worked for a long time . 
  majority voted for clinton , but she lost anyway . 
  so here we go . 
  i do n't buy it . 
  cia was prepared for all outcomes and this was one of them . 
  us has plans for taking over any country in the world and these plans are updated constantly . 
  that 's just good planning . 
  pretty sure he can , he writes a law like that `` all german cars that were made outside the us have 50 % import tax '' - done . 
  wto is something after the fact , it does n't prevent him . 
  edit : trump is a wild card and our legislature wo n't stop him since they 're all republican controlled . 
   he ca n't raise tariffs on german goods , we have a single market so he 'd have to raise it on all european goods . 
  pretty sure he can quiet easily . 
  most/all of the germans cars are n't made in usa , while ford actually makes them in europe . 
  2 other branches ? 
  gop owns the legislature right now and will own high court very soon . 
  the latter one was one of the most important defeats that liberals had , the supreme justices are elected for life and that will haunt us for ages ( trump most likely will pick 3 out of 12 supreme justices in the next few years , unless the 2 justices decide to stick out a bit longer ), 
  sure , you can . 
  eu is quiet larger than usa . 
  not ethnic russians , but russian speakers . 
  plenty of ukrainians and jews that would be more than willing to cause problems for russia . 
  a lot of them are second generation immigrants , so they do n't have any ties to soviet union / russia . 
   how many americans under the age of 30 speak russian ? 
  you would be surprised , come to brighton beach and you can hear russian speech miles in any direction . 
  i thought by moving away from brooklyn to staten island would change that ? 
  guess what - our saturday school for toddlers is about 75 % russian speaking , even the american teacher learned russian now . 
  walking through my office i can hear french , spanish , russian , hewbrew , bulgarian , serbian, 
  i am kinda surprised about that , one thing that soviet union got right ( or better than in us at the time ) was women rights . 
  and the bill is strongly supported by a woman !, 
  may be her husband should beat her up once a year . 
  edit : fixed a typo, 
   by the way , it 's not the first time russisms are found in fakes . 
  and it 's not the first time ( rather , a pattern ) , when russian media is the first one to report fakes when they appear i do n't doubt that . 
  `` russisms '' are part of surzhyk , using \u0437\u043d\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d does n't imply that a russian person wrote that . 
  could have been a ukrainian . . that 's literally in my first post here . 
  i am acutely aware that many ukrainians speak/spoke russian mostly and due to recent events some of try to speak ukrainians with surzhyk elements . 
  i have a feeling that you 're arguing just for the sake of it . 
  so take care . 
  why do n't you google \u0417\u043d\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d and see how times it comes up aside from the last 3 days ? 
  i can see plenty of users using it . 
  you 're focusing on the wrong thing , it 's like me pointing out that : it is n't it ' ** l ** , but it ' ** s ** . 
  that was a copy & paste mistake , since i do n't have a cyrillic keyboard . 
  my point was about surzhyk and i was right . 
   but wrote a totally different thing nah , i did n't . 
  you wrote a different thing . 
   you were trying to communicate that surzhyk is any russism which is far from truth lol ? 
  i did n't say that , i said surzhyk is simply a collection of dialects that ukrainians speak , other ukrainian redditors made statements that surzhyk is about using russian words in ukrainian language and that part is wrong . 
  why do n't you argue with these redditors and not me . 
  i meant more '' \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0430 '' , which would be quiet different in russian . 
  in any case , you agreed that surzhyk is also applying russian language rules to ukrainian words , that what i was trying to communicate . 
  tell me is it : \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044f\u043c\u0438 or \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044f\u043c one of them is surzjik , the other one is proper ukrainian .
