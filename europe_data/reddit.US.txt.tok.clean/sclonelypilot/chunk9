  there is no russian word here , it 's a ukrainian word . 
  surzhyk does n't really have rules , it 's a mix of two languages . 
  these words are n't proper in ukrainian nor russian . 
  i can see hundreds of thousands hits for \u0441\u0456\u0447\u0430\u0441 , so you 're wrong . 
  as for \u0437\u043d\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d , they could have simply misspelled it . 
  the same way the wrote : \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 instead of \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 . 
   no , there is no dialect of ukrainian that allows shortened forms of adjectives ( which are allowed in russian ) um i wonder if you 're even from ukraine . 
  nah , google translate gets right :-) but i never though that `` e '' - '' \u0438 '' is a common mistake . 
   right , but '' \u0437\u043d\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 '' is an acceptable form too , so not like he was `` completely wrong '' . 
   he mistyped one letter . 
  such wrong , very completely . 
  wow . 
   , and they painted the ukrainian flag wrong , and then misspelled a ukrainian word in the way a russian-speaker would ( '' \u0437\u043d\u0438\u0449\u0415\u041d '' instead of '' \u0437\u043d\u0435\u0449\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0419 '' , like in russian '' \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0415\u041d '' ) . 
  haha , the way you spelled that word '' \u0437\u043d ** \u0435 ** \u0449\u0415\u041d ** \u0418\u0419 ** '' is completely wrong . 
  that makes you a russian collaborator , right ? 
  or it 's simply ukrainians do n't speak ukrainian properly , there are a number of dialects . 
  that 's being pedantic . 
  skyscrapper is a building that is at least 100m tall - https://www.emporis.com/building/standard/75/skyscraper i counted at least 25 skyscrapers in paris : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_the_paris_region, 
  it 's grand paris , parisian metro goes there . 
  no skyscrapers ? 
  can you actually backup any of your statements ? 
  i 'd like to see any prove that pinchuk is fighting extradition in austria ? 
  pinchuk is associated with kuchma and supported euro maidan . 
   for having ukrainian flag in donetsk one can be tied to a pole and beaten . 
  or jailed and beaten in ukrainian jails for being a `` sympathizer '' . 
   he is like a super conservative red neck killing an ambassador from a muslim country after 9/11 ... thats the best way to put it . 
  the funny thing is that i do n't recall any red neck killing muslim ambassadors . 
  europe/america is outraged because an ambassador was killed , turkey failed its obligations to protect him . 
  your arguments do n't add up . 
  the communication was established before , it 's like a lojack for cars . 
  now it 's irrelevant if a stolen car was sold to an another person , it 's quiet legal to receive telemetry data from your own car . 
  why is it unusual ? 
  according to the article fpo 's founder was a member of ss . 
  well he was 41 , the article did n't mention that and i wanted to know . 
  it means country for / u/surfingduude , period . 
  got it . 
  you wrote nonsense then changed it to an offensive post . 
  linking to a polish word kraina instead of the proto-slavic version ? 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-slavic/krajina now crtl-f and type `` country '' ? 
  nice stealth editing . 
  that the word was used in 12th century ? 
   i 'll repeat it once again : kraj also means country or land in proto slavic word kraj\u042c - always meant edge . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-slavic/kraj%d1%8c https://oesteuropastudier.dk/ordbog/index.php/term/%5bsla-eng%5d+derksen&amp;%23039%3bs+slavic+inherited+lexicon,kraj%d1%8c.xhtml, 
   the name appears is derived from `` kraina '' ( country ) , not `` kraj '' . 
  ukraine that 's modern interpretation by ukrainian nationalists . 
  kraina is a ukrainian word and the name ukraine predates by few centuries . 
  the word ` ukraine ' meant borderland and not territories of modern ukraine , but it just happened that ukraine was mostly a borderland back then . 
  it evolved over centuries to become the `` official '' name of ukraine at the end of 19th century . 
  its mostly because the official name - little russia became derogatory in russian empire . 
  and how he got antibiotics off amazon ? 
  pretty sure it was n't antibiotics . 
  no difference from munich agreement when chezslovakia was divided . 
  oh then i should use russia as a moral standard ? 
  what an awesome idea / sarcasm, 
  oh we are blaming polish now ? 
  since they wanted to survive i do n't blame them . 
  its either polish were nazi allies as soviets or not , not `` friendly '' . 
  since major western powers decided to appease nazi , there 's no blame that soviets and polish made pacts with nazis . 
  oh so it 's ok for poland to annex a supposedly ethnically polish territories ? 
  but for soviet union it 's bad , they must be nazis allies ? 
  the lands that soviet union occupied were ethnically ukrainian and historically belonged to ukrainians . 
  that 's why this whole thing is bullshit , western countries appeased nazis , divided countries prior to soviet union doing anything in europe . 
  it was pretty much free for all . 
  if uk and france would stand up then may be 100 million did n't die in ww2 . 
  when i read jointly for me it means at the same time . 
  because nazis broke polish defenses prior to any soviet attacks . 
  poland had no chance to survive nazis . 
  you also forgot munich agreement that divided czechoslovakia signed by all major powers , but soviet union in 1938 . 
  poland also annexed a part of czechoslovakia as part of this agreement . 
  so all of these countries were allies of nazis according to your twisted logic . 
  let 's not forget that you also missed that slovakia attacked poland with nazis together and got back the territories that poland took a year before . 
  50000 crossed the border . 
  now how many were before the visa-free regime ? 
  probably about the same . 
  i am not buying european !, 
  oh wait most of the stuff around is made in china anyway : / now on the serious note you could say that you wont buy any trump related products , because most of our tech companies cant stand trump . 
  our president is very bad for us . 
  well we got 3.5 years of scandals and tweeter bitching . 
  may be trump will be busy with that so he wont do any long term damage . 
  most of large companies operates a number of offices throughout europe , uk offices may take a hit depending on the divorce . 
  but actual americans working in uk is a fairly small number nor these people are poor . 
  they can either relocate to eu or move back to states . 
  the whole divorce affair offers a lot of opportunities in the first place . 
  that is a strawman argument thrown around and has no base in reality . 
  why buy lower quality stuff that no one wants to watch , when they can simply leave higher quality content ? 
  if it was profitable they would put more european shows , so its either too expensive or crap that no one wants to watch . 
  neither this law is solving , so netflix should remove the american crappy content . 
  so netflix needs to reduce its american content to match the quotas , some lower rated movies will be removed . 
   you seem to have a pretty optimistic view of american shelters . 
  nyc has 61000 homeless , 58000 sleep in the shelter . 
  that 's 95 % . 
  if shelters are over capacity nyc rents out hotels . 
  i think this is great , the other 5 % got issues - crazy , violence in shelters , etc. 
  a lot of homeless are out of town , nyc has the best social programs so they all come here . 
   yet you see them everywhere in us and hardly any in russia , i 'm talking about cities at least . 
  i was in moscow like 5 years ago , parks were full with homeless . 
  in nyc , all homeless can go to a shelter . 
  the ones that sleep outside chose to , not because they have to . 
  i saw more homeless in europe/canada than in nyc , but that 's most likely that homeless tend to beg in touristic areas . 
  i can see this post .
