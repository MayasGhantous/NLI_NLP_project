every other increased debts significantly while whining `` austerity hurts , austerity hurts '' not by any choice of theirs . 
  austerity during a recession ** will not work ** as further gdp declines will wipe out any decline in spending . 
  furthermore , mandatory unemployment insurance and/or bailout spending will further worsen the debt/gdp ratio ( see spain , which had no government spending problem until the economy tanked and they wound up on the hook for billions in benefits with a shrinking economy ) . 
  you have to recognize that the cold war was , by today 's standards , an extremely machiavellian period in world history . 
  the us and ussr both allied themselves with regimes that were starkly contradictory to their own ideals ; the [ ussr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union_and_the_iran%e2%80%93iraq_war ) befriended shiite islamists in iran and liberal democrats in latin america while the us was in bed with a long line of dictatorships , including the avowedly communist dictatorships of china , somalia , and even pol pot , if they 'd agree to oppose mother russia . 
  the israel-palestine conflict is not completely but heavily a legacy of this dynamic , where the us ' support for israel and the soviet support for the palestinians during the 6-day war largely created the militaristic israel and occupied palestine that exists today . 
  if you look at apartheid south africa in that context , it was a purely machiavellian geopolitical move and one of many that the us , its allies , and the soviet union all conducted during the slow-motion world war 3 that took place from 1945-1991 . 
  this is a semi-sarcastic account .

  they 're just tools . 
  what wretched world is it where immortal companies have the rights of persons and persons are reduced to human resources ? 
  corporations are collections of citizens and should n't be able to vote twice or claim constitutional privileges twice .

  i 'm aware of one country , two systems , but binding oneself to a treaty like this would probably require beijing 's tacit consent . 
  and note how sadly all the nordic pms and major parties believe charlatans like this and are actually * listening * to complaints that their countries are too expensive for business . 
  as a dutchman , you 're probably aware . 
  and note that he 's not saying that the most vibrant european countries like the nordics and arguably germany and austria have stronger welfare states than greece or italy . 
  thanks, 
  interesting . 
  probably would n't get along well with the western nationalist/eurosceptic parties , which are either wishy-washy ( df , pvv , and ukip ) or openly pro-kremlin ( front national , golden dawn ) . 
     pertti kurikan nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t this is n't translating on google . 
  what does it literally mean ? 
  is the conservative people 's party pro-russia or pro-europe ? 
  the nationalism would make me think it is russophobic but right-wing eurosceptics tend to be pro-putin . 
  the difference is that both gatt and uruguay were truly global deals that included almost very country on earth and that were highly formalized , aiming to create an equivalent to the un for trade disputes . 
  in contrast , ttip , tpp , and tisa only share the us in common and , by virtue of their liberalizing goals , will essentially require a capitulation of non-american countries on almost everything except for banking . 
  [ you have to remember that pretty much every country in the world is to the left of the us , and therefore pretty much any trade deal that aims to liberalize relations will be a concession to the us .

  but the fact that you 're bringing it up when it 's a pretty tiny minority is a sleazy arguing tactic at best and defamation at worst . 
  it would be like me saying that `` britons are patriotic at best and bnp/ukip members at worst and being british is slang for being nationalist , basically '' and saying that that 's a fair analogy because most people who are into bnp/ukip are british .

   a lot of people into beastiality would be into the furry fandom when you 're dealing with such lopsided numbers , yes , but that is vacuous . 
  i 'm pretty certain the vast majority of kkk members are americans and the vast majority of russian gangsters are russians , but that says very little about russians or americans because of the small proportion of americans who are klansmen and the small proportion of russians who are active gangsters . 
  this is only one of several massive trade agreements that the us is negotiating . 
  there is also ttip ( of course ) and the tpp , which will include canada , japan , australia , new zealand , and most of southeast asia ; china has asked to join but has not yet been accepted . 
  this is the nwo-like stuff that conspiracy nuts salivate over . 
  extracts from the wikipedia :  once a particular trade barrier has unilaterally been removed , it can not be reintroduced . 
  this proposal is known as the ` ratchet clause ' . 
   the eu has stated that companies outside of its borders will not be allowed to provide * publicly funded * healthcare or social services . 
  emphasis not mine . 
  the tisa countries are :  australia , canada , chile , chinese taipei , european union , hong kong , iceland , israel , japan , liechtenstein , new zealand , norway , republic of korea , switzerland , united states colombia , costa rica , mexico , panama , peru , turkey pakistan , paraguay and collectively account for ~ 75 % of the world 's gdp ( although seeing * paraguay * in there was amusing ) . 
   in the american electoral system it is possible to win an election without a direct majority voting for you this is also true in * any * country that 's not a pure two-party system or a runoff system like france . 
  in the netherlands , you can have five or six different parties that each get 10-40 % of the vote and the `` majority ' is picked after in closed-door coalition talks . 
  in the elections where the winner of the popular vote did not win the election , in each case there were third-party candidates . 
  2000 's election was : al gore 48 % george bush 47 % nader 3 % other 2 % ( i 'm fudging the numbers , the actual ones are at http://uselectionatlas.org/results/national.php?year=2000 ) . 
  no candidate won a majority , so what would have happened in europe would have been a gore - nader or less likely a bush - nader or bush - gore coalition . 
  in any case , at least 52 % of the population would have voted against the winning candidate .

   we are fascists and we are proud of it . 
  at least in the us , the college students are the progressive ones . 
  huge kudos to these students for at least being honest about their lunatic beliefs . 
  in the same way , i have more respect for european and nordic businessmen who say `` the quality of life i.e. 
  cost of labour is too high in our country '' ; it 's twisted , but at least they 're honest about why they 're opposed to the welfare state vs. the american `` job creators '' bullshit . 
  but he was a better leader of the serbs than any before or after . 
   tito does not deserve to be in a dungeon . 
  god is a serb , you know , and will break him out . 
   southern black culture also gave us mlk jr. . let 's not paint with a broad brush . 
  it 's a specific `` rebel '' image of southern blackness that we 're talking about . 
  it 's not so different from the `` rebel '' redneck image of southern whiteness , i would add . 
  agreed , and that 's why i emphasize the `` southern '' aspect . 
  the fact is that only a small percentage of whites grow up in that rebel poverty culture but a vast percentage of locally-born black americans do . 
  middle-class african americans , afro-caribbeans , and africans are much closer to europeans politically ( strong support for the welfare state , gun control , and nonviolence ) than they are to either the ` hood or to the white middle class . 
  also , one of the overarching features of chavs is that they tend to be racist against the same minorities whose culture they adopt . 
  in white uk ghettos , it is not uncommon to see a young man or woman wearing a gold chain ( stereotypical african-american ) and a tracksuit or hoodie ( ditto ) while eating fried chicken ( ditto ) and listening to hip-hop ( ditto ) or extreme rock/metal ( origins in 1950s african americans ) , all in between attending edl or previously bnp/nf rallies . 
  skinheads , the most feared white supremacists , originated out of a subculture of extreme reggae fans ( not af-am , but the irony remains ) . 
  if you 're looking for southern blacks , that 's the answer to another question . 
  the correct question would be , `` what is your country 's equivalent to gypsies/muslim migrants/yardie gangs ? '', 
  ed : it 's mostly southern slave descendants who cause trouble . 
  haitians , jamaicans , nigerians , eritreans , and ghanaians are all fine and generally hate southerners .

  this is why i love the balkans ... actually we 're all macedonians !, 
  are there any numbers on the origin of slovene albanians ( albania vs. yugoslavia ) ? 
  i 'd imagine based on the poor history between tiran\u00eb and beograd that the majority are probably of the latter . 
  about the us , you and i agree :  congress has about a snowball 's chance in hell of ever allowing a foreign body to make laws for it which would effectively sink any prospect of eu integration . 
   iceland is a part of europe . 
  also , the eu has expanded beyond continental europe . 
  the u.k , ireland and cyprus are not in continental europe . 
  cyprus is a part of asia . 
  i concede this although i 'm just wanting to be clear . 
  although cyprus is geographically in asia and malta is arguably in africa , both are essentially parts of larger , unambiguously european countries ( greece and italy , respectively ) that were colonized by the uk . 
   a direct flight is flight between two places with no change in flight number , which may include a stop at an intermediate place at least in the us we talk about not having to get off the plane . 
  it 's still way more inconvenient than cape verde or barbados . 
  i probably meant nonstop . 
  it 's just that relations between albania and yugoslavia were shit during the cold war http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bunkers_in_albania so it might have been a mistake ( kosovars or montenegrin/macedonian albanians would have been more likely ) .
