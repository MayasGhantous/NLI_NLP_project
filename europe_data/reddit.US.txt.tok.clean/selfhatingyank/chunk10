  sd and the social democrats should have agreed to a budget that would cut immigration and adopt a take-no-prisoners stance on welfare , solidarity , and foreign trade . 
  basically , in order to vote or collect benefits you should pledge to keep your religion private ( to weed out the muslims ) and to respect the scandinavian tradition of inclusiveness and social democracy . 
  on the converse , if the sd said that they were `` absolutely committed '' to the welfare state and would leave the eu if ttip passes leave the imf and global markets if are not compatible with the nordic model of caring and social democracy and require all immigrants to down a shot of vodka to register to vote and require all voters to sign a pledge to social democracy and secularism they 'd get  50 % of the vote . 
  wtf wtf wtf wtf is going on with europolitics ? 
  regardless of where on the political spectrum someone lands , when they actually get into office they try to out-thatcher thatcher . 
  yes . 
  who on earth is pushing reaganomics on the countries of europe then , if not the imf ? 
  but you probably have more of that ancestry than i do ( mainly british/irish/german and a touch of benelux ) . 
  glad not to have any of that `` ethnic '' northern european ancestry . 
   mostly in northern europe so scandinavians are black ??? 
  angola & mozambique, 
  cutting foreign aid reflects the greedy plutocrat teabaggers who are seizing europe and imposing the american form of capitalism on it . 
  the last time capitalists forced themselves on a european country , you got oligarchs who created putin to protect their loot.i, 
  which of these comments are inaccurate ? 
  seems like a good summary of the crisis and ttip . 
  which ... 
  amazing how fast chechnya has turned from being in open rebellion to being where putin gets his most feared enforcers . 
  first they take your media . 
  then they take your welfare state . 
  then they take your work life balance . 
  then they take your healthcare and consumer protection laws . 
  then , worst of all , they take your accent . 
  americans are some bastards . 
  rupert murdoch would approve . 
  during the '11 somali famine , he ran a cartoon saying `` why worry about any crimes my papers have committed because people are starving in africa ? '', 
  meanwhile he was hiring hackers to get scoops from private phones . 
  when done right , aid is also a form of soft power and an investment in finnish companies doing business in burkina faso . 
  a lot of aid is also fixing the mistakes of western comp anies ; a moral obligation but also a classical protection racket . 
  there are bad aid programs that lead to corruption and cronyism , but let 's not throw the whole concept down the drain . 
  i thought this was the basic income government . 
  the last time europeans weregforced to cut and privatize to this extent , putin was the result . 
  i do n't see a future for western europe that is free of illiberal regimes . 
  i am aware of the massive gulf between the radical traditionalist conservatives of europe and the market fundamentalists who aim to turn europe into a clone of the usa . 
  i think using the word `` conservative '' to refer to both is misleading , especially considering that most major parties at least acknowledge the neoliberal argument . 
  outside of the us it is questionable how `` conservative '' these policies are . 
  by your standard , the french socialist party and the norwegian worker 's party are more conservative than front national or danish people 's party . 
  these are very non-traditional ( arguably anti-traditional ) policies in most of europe , and while historically europe did have intervals of great inequality ( the high middle ages and the industrial revolution come to mind ) , they were rarely caused so unambiguously and deliberately by globalization and neoliberal policy . 
  politicians fighting ttip ? 
  the only party i know of that has said they 'd rather leave the eu than abide by it has been syriza , in greece . 
  i doubt cameron , merkel , hollande , and miliband are opposed to it and even if it does n't pass it already has served as the roadmap for recent policy.canada has already begun implementing what it believes will be in its evil twin tpp . 
  the problem is that european electorates can not see what the end result is ( texas !, 
  ) , and if they do they ca n't stop it . 
  most europeans love their cheap education and healthcare , excellent infrastructure , work life balance , and absence of deep poverty , but regardless of who 's in office the global corporate takeover continues . 
  the precedents are sobering for what happens when a large , rich country is pressed to accept outside influence and a strange , arguably inferior standard of living ; 1910s turkey , 1920s germany , and 1990s russia respectively ended in the armenian genocide , the shoah , and putin . 
  what seumas milne is calling for is * not * radical change , it is continuity with 30 + years of european ( and most other non-us developed countries ) social democracy . 
  ttip , cameron , and austerity are radical changes that are unprecedented in most europeans ' lifetimes . 
  funny , i always thought there was a correlation between affluence and strong national identity , but i never saw it being inverse . 
  finland is the only developed country up there with the likes of morocco , png , and kenya . 
  are more nationalistic . 
  than * serbs * . 
  but no one gets it right consistently , not even the dutch . 
  not . 
  holland . 
  ] ( http://www.hollands-venetie.nl/contact/ ) ( beating with wooden shoe intensifies ), 
  so in dutch , the netherlands is ( translating ) `` netherland '' and the low countries ( benelux ) are `` the netherlands . '', 
  and in informal contexts even the dutch refer to [ the whole ] ( http://www.rosita.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/p-39759-4332b662b1e192599b24d93f7c2ad5b1.jpg ) [ enchilada ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ik_hou_van_holland ) [ as ] ( http://www.frieslandholland.nl/ ) [ holland ] ( http://www.hollands-venetie.nl/ ) . 
  it seems like even the dutch ca n't get [ it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_iupineuc ) right . 
  it gets muddied when you look at the history further . 
  during napoleonic times , the kingdom of `` holland '' included [ all but the southern parts of the netherlands and * parts of germany * , including what is now known as east frisia . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_holland ) what are now the hollands were called amstelland and maasland . 
  i do n't speak dutch so i would n't know , but as other comments have stated i 've heard the holland usage in media and sporting contexts . 
  i do n't speak dutch so i would n't know , but as other comments have stated i 've heard the holland usage in media and sporting contexts . 
  deutschland does n't exist ?? 
  eastern european/eurasian . 
  never fully westernized in spite of a white-looking population . 
   immoral westerners russia is not western anymore ( if it ever was ) . 
  but what if estonia had invoked article 5 and declared that the kidnapping was an attack on all nato ? 
  considering how stubborn putin is lately , i 'd say that the risk of an all-out world war would increase tenfold . 
  there 's a good reason estonia decided to weasel out rather than call up the us , uk , and france to launch a war against russia . 
  i 'd say the real issue is realpolitik . 
  article 5 only works as a deterrent ( if you attack us , we sic the us on you ) ; if you 're actually invoking it you 're too late . 
  just like nukes . 
  if estonia or nl had dragged the us into a war with russia , the result would * not * be pretty . 
  i 'm not saying that the us would just lie down and * let * estonia be invaded , but the estonian and dutch governments know that an article 5 declaration against russia would result in at least a full-blown cold war and possibly a world war iii . 
   [ co/us   so now it 's only two countries , of which one is totally insignificant . 
  what did you say ? 
  just because we do n't have hot colombian women in the us does n't mean we 're insignificant . 
  you say that like it 's a good thing . 
  i believe there is an international consensus that cultural genocide is a crime against humanity . 
   bulgaria are the slavic languages really that close ? 
  i can not understand german . 
  under communism ? 
  the same happened in the glorious ussr . 
  where 'd he get the citizenship ? 
  ukraine just giving its citizenships away to anyone who can help govern it is kind of hypocritical for what we 've been told is an ultranationalist neo-nazi regime . 
   three people were collecting signatures against planned mandatory refugee quotas in city of olomouc . 
  they were attacked by group of 15 - 20 arabs ( medicine students ) who destroyed their stand and screamed `` wait some years and you will be our slaves ! '', 
  four police cars had to intervene the arabs are discovering central/eastern europe i take it . 
  although [ olomouc ] ( http://www.hanacky-dvur.cz/temp/photo_olomouc_zoom_horni_namesti.jpg ) * is * a pretty nice looking city . 
   82 % disliking gypsies that must mean that even some gypsies dislike gypsies . 
   an unlikely coalition between the left-wing red-green alliance , classically liberalist liberal alliance , and the right-wing to far-right nationalist/culturalist danish people 's party seems to be possible if ( more likely when ) the three parties get a total of 60 seats . 
  all three parties are eurosceptic and agree that there should be public votes on certain laws that are currently decided by the european union , even if issues do not involve giving up sovereignty . 
  i 'd like it more if you swap sf instead of liberal alliance . 
  both dpp and red-green are strongly pro-welfare state , and then you throw in the american-lite liberal alliance ; they 'll only really agree that the euro is baaaaad . 
  republicans ? 
  seriously ?? 
  are n't pretty much all non-american politicians at least moderate democrats ? 
  he means `` italian mafia * s * . '', 
  give him patience , most people only know about the cosa nostra . 
  i think it 's purely motivated by greed and americanization .
