  i see a lot of parallels between what my ancestors did to the original americans and canadians and what wall street is doing to indigenous european cultures . 
  instead of smallpox and trails of tears , today 's american colonialists are using stocks , bonds , bubbles , lobbying , and financial speculation . 
  economic/cultural terrorism ... france should not have to have a 40 + hour workweek just 'cause the us does . 
  denmark , sweden , norway too . 
  yeah , right . 
  front national is already preparing a [ frexit ] ( https://euobserver.com/tickers/128872 ) referendum . 
  or leipzig ? 
  1989 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhmuvabvzi8 ), 
  this actually began as a russian mafia investigation before the feds uncovered all the fifa stuff :  the four-year f.b.i. 
  investigation grew out of an unrelated inquiry into aspects of russian organized crime by the eurasian joint organized crime task force in the f.b.i. 's new york office , according to people with knowledge of the case 's origins . 
  so russia has reasons to be scared .

  why not china ? 
  i 'm normally not big on the death penalty for nonviolent offenses , but [ they take corruption f ` cking seriously . 
  ] ( http://time.com/3700907/liu-han-execution-china/ ), 
  where 's the livable basic income that we were promised ? 
  it 's classic global megacorps trying to scare non-americans . 
  note that europe , canada , and australia are being singled out , but the us which has had at least two isis-inspired attacks is n't : [ isis-inspired murder in oklahoma ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/30/opinion/robbins-oklahoma-nolen/ ) [ botched isis attack in oklahoma ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/us/garland-texas-prophet-mohammed-contest-shooting/ ), 
  so where were all the fifties gay weddings and abortions ? 
  the us in the 50s was a * lot * more culturally/socially conservative even though conservatives have become louder . 
  homosexuality was not an issue because even liberals were opposed to it and/or closeted . 
  the size of it . 
  the fact that one country borders china , azerbaijan , and poland is pretty amazing . 
  also the multiethnic history as a truly eurasian country . 
  so do most other countries . 
  except israel , i dare you to name * one * country where the republicans are in good standing compared to the dems . 
  maybe pakistan , but that 's because of drones . 
  even poland , saudi arabia , and singapore are too `` socialist '' for most repubs . 
  maybe somalia ... 
   bigotry , religion opposition to gay marriage among republicans and conservatives was higher 50 years ago than it was today . 
  the usa as a whole ( including conservatives ) is a lot less religious than it was 50 years ago , although conservatives have n't secularized as fast as liberals and moderates . 
  the moral majority religiosity would 've been mainstream in the 1940s-1950s throughout the west ; it 's just that since it 's a minority now in the us and almost extinct in other rich countries ( except poland ) it gets branded as kooky . 
  what 's really the difference between a 2015 homophobe in minnesota , a 1930s homophobe in new york or london , and a 2015 homophobe in eastern poland ? 
  what 's more european than tacky americanization ? 
  chavismo is basically democratic socialism + expropriation + nationalism + o ften anti-americanism . 
  because of the last two , it has a fan base in the far-right ( eg front national ), 
  we 're ignorant and violent , not backward . 
  one bombs defenseless brown people for fun , the other still reads by candlelight . 
  used to be social democracy and being `` cultured '' , but that 's going away . 
  now i 'd say it 's probably eurovision . 
  did a moldovan just call a romanian backward ? 
  that 's it , now i 've seen everything . 
   poland - the most homogenous country in europe , working towards a common goal . 
  like , [ more homogeneous than japan or south korea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_immigrant_population ) . 
  ukraine * would * be homogeneous if they could n't get over their orientation bullshit ; they 're all pretty much the same ethnic group . 
  however , ethnic homogeneity is no guarantee of prosperity even among rich countries . 
  examples : japan ( in perma-recession according to the global press ) , portugal , finland ( thanks nokia !, 
  this mixing is more common than you think . 
  i always get a kick out of the flemish politicians geert bourgeois and yves leterme , who served jointly with the francophone didier reynders , as well as the german-speaking south tyrol politicians silvius magnago and oskar peterlini and the romanian-speaking moldovan leader vladimir voronin . 
  everything the us did , aside from not having a figurehead , was already done by the uk . 
  the american revolution was not a big deal , aside from launching lafayette 's career , from a global perspective as it was simply the british democratic system minus the king . 
  the french army that largely had renounced those liberal reforms by the time of the napoleonic wars and was back to absolute monarchy ? 
  let 's be honest , the success of french democracy endured in spite of napoleon , not because of him . 
   the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen is still a cornerstone of international law and european culture . 
  written by du motier and allegedly jefferson long before napoleon came on the scene . 
  most of the other `` napoleonic '' achievements , except the code , are revolutionary achievements . 
  particularly since 2010 . 
  if only a few young americans could sit down with merkel and tell her what the economic right wing is really like , she 'd end the crisis tomorrow . 
  it 's infinity in norway . 
  somehow they 're still doing fine for now . 
   will it pass ? 
  probably not . 
  initiatives from the left opposed by the economy almost never pass . 
  why ? 
  is there a conservative streak among the swiss or is there electoral fraud ? 
  the economic right wing has a pretty lousy track record ( see the usa and forcible austerity in greece ) . 
   no genocide ... yet , although the threats to bomb libya rather than fix migration policy are a sin themselves  ( almost ) no nazism but a motley crew of chavistas , neo-nazis ( in greece ) , and softcore fascists and gangsters with parliament seats could easily get ugly fast . 
  [ the legality of unpaid internships in the us is up for debate . 
  ] ( http://fortune.com/2015/01/29/unpaid-internships-legal-battle/ ), 
  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mqrkkvq6ose and not just the national language but the dialects too . 
  do n't have a geordie accent ? 
  good luck moving to newcastle even if you 're fluent in english . 
  when , at least economically , has europe come this close to american capitalism ? 
  the scrawny us welfare state and paycheck-to-paycheck existence of most americans has survived thanks to apocalyptic faith-only protestantism and deep racial and geographic divides , but i doubt that small , 80 % white countries like sweden , finland , portugal have any history of this sort . 
  the last time europe moved rightward during a crisis , literal nazism and genocides ensued . 
  citation needed !, 
  just because you have the * legal * right to move within the eu does n't mean it 's that practical . 
  in parts of northern england [ it is perfectly legal to put a clause in the deed that prohibits non-cumbrians from buying them . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/advice/propertymarket/3314055/strangers-not-welcome.html ) [ if you were n't born in some english villages , do n't have kids in school there , and do n't have a job in the village you can legally be denied housing . 
  ] ( http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/news/bakery-builds-five-village-houses-but-for-locals-only-1.384085 ) this is an extreme case ( the lake district ) but this would be unthinkable in the us and i do n't know how commonplace it is in continental europe . 
  way to attack a straw man . 
  i dare you to find * one * progressive european who would say that it is okay for things like this to happen and/or that there is not a problem with criminality , gang activity , and backwardness in roma gypsy communities . 
  it 's just that one side thinks the best solution is to bring gypsies out of backward rural areas , spend more on education and women 's empowerment , etc. 
  and the other side thinks the best solution is to give incendiary speeches and/or segregate them further . 
  google `` welfare reform work requirements '' . 
  they make you find a job but they do n't `` let '' you take a $ 3/hour job . 
  never thought i 'd be saying that europe is * too * right-wing compared to the us , but the past couple years have been bizarro land in european politics . 
  at least the us has n't been this naked . 
  to get welfare , you have to work , but you still have to work at minimum wage . 
  [ sweden ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/jobs/article/sweden-should-ban-slave-job-trials ) has it too , only it 's completely free labor . 
  but people in the first world are using more of the resources . 
  from an environmental perspective , one kenyan is still much much better than one australian . 
  seriously, 
  global gdp is still too low to give everyone a standard of living higher than that of costa rica or montenegro, 
   mainstream not even in parliament .

  you have a lot of right-wing chavistas too , likely attracted to the strident anti-americanism and conspiracy rhetoric . 
  front national is the big one , and you also have attack in bulgaria .
