  and yet sweden regularly arms tyrants in the middle east so the swedes can harvest black and brown children for cheap labor and to break up the welfare state . 
  but would you rather live in sweden ( fast growth , sure , but mass immigration = hideous political divides , runaway housing costs , radical islam , daesh recruitment , and nazis and commies fighting on the streets ) or finland ( technically in a deep recession , but like 1/4 of the immigrant share so fewer social problems ) or japan ( doing just fine , thank you , in spite of constant attacks by the migrationist press that `` they 're gon na run out of people '' and `` they 're in a crisis !!, 
  ! 1 '' ) gdp is n't everything , you know . 
  ** quality ** growth is more important than ** quantity ** growth in the context of a rich country like sweden . 
  while idealistically we should care about global inequality ( european lives are not inherently better than non-european lives ) , from the functioning of institutions , violent crime , extremism , etc. 
  perspective local inequality is much more important . 
  a poorish but equal country like poland functions well , as does a rich but fairly equal country like norway . 
  however , if you were suddenly to merge the two while layering the income distributions on top of each other , you suddenly have 4m rich norwegians and 39m poor poles , which historically is a recipe for trouble . 
   cultural assimilation issues these are really the only problems with mass immigration , that a lot of the recent crop of `` immigrants '' are n't grateful for the opportunities that they have been given to live among danes/swedes/italians and to raise their children to ( hopefully ) marry into danes/swedes/italians . 
  there is [ a long ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080609172919.htm ) [ history ] ( http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/05/ancient-viking-mtdna-from-denmark.html ) of near eastern immigration to denmark , yet until recently you did n't have little arab and kurdish villages on the outskirts of danish towns where sharia or pre-islamic arab/kurd customs dominated . 
  similarly , after the reconquista you did n't generally have little insular communities of spanish muslims who continued stoning adulterers and beheading converts ; they generally assimilated or gtfo , to the point where roughly [ 1/5 ] ( http://www.livescience.com/37092-southern-europeans-have-african-genes.html ) of spanish dna can be traced to the maghreb , which itself is a melting pot of european , arabian , berber , and sub-saharan dna . 
  it could be worse . 
  - nigel farage, 
  compare to china , with a much bigger gdp but pretty cordial foreign relations with everyone except maybe vietnam . 
  china has even `` agreed to disagree '' with * taiwan * , for chrissakes . 
  [ there 's an appenzeller , who eats cats and dogs !, 
  hang him !,

  except the french ... 
  and on top of it , either he or she is probably corrupt . 
  apparently , neil denied being a danish resident for tax purposes in 2010 even though his wife was the pm of denmark ; charges were dropped after he explained it as a [ big sloppy error . 
  ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/europe/56490/helle-thorning-schmidt-five-facts-about-danish-pm ) whoops . 
  that is the question , but humans are not strictly rational and do n't necessarily answer questions literally . 
  i think the reason russia does n't get much credit is that , while it `` won the war '' in the sense of defeating the nazis , it did n't `` win the war '' in the sense of preserving democracy and national identities . 
  proportional also works well in the nordic countries , which have strong political coalitions on the left and right that allow them to function as two party systems . 
  the first real fuck up in sweden just happened last year . 
  i can actually see why both fptp and proportional have their reasons to be supported . 
  in a true two-party system ( which fptp encourages ) you always know that the winner got the majority of the popular vote , even if the winner is n't the `` best '' candidate . 
  while proportional representation yields a much fuller picture of folks ' preferences , it has the downside of being * completely dependent * on coalition negotiations . 
  a proportional election such as this ( loosely based on sweden 2014 ) : - mainstream left 45 % - mainstream right 43 % - populist right 12 % can be interpreted three ways : - a resounding 57-43 defeat for the incumbent mainstream right - a 55-45 victory for the right - an 88-12 blowout defeat for the populists the party leaders chose ( after extensive lobbying ) to interpret it in the third way , resulting in a dreadfully incompetent and weak grand coalition . 
  essentially , the concern with proportional ( or any other coalition-dependent system ) is that when you are dealing with globalization and lobbying it means that a lot fewer people ( mainly party leaders ) must be `` bribed '' in order to get the best result . 
  that 's why i 'm a big fan of the two-round system ( which your country , as a breton , presumably has ) , as you have the clear majorities of fptp ( when there are n't third parties ) but the diversity of proportional ( you actually have factions called `` miscellaneous left '' and `` miscellaneous right '' ! ), 
  raising taxes , maintaining your own currency if you want to maintain an autonomous government , external devaluation to increase gdp , and cutting tax evasion , corruption , etc. 
  clearly the `` crisis '' is not motivated by govt debt , though , or else spain ( similar debt-to-gdp ratio as the us pre-crisis ) and finland ( even better debt-to-gdp ratio than the us * to this day * ) would not be facing the same bullshit sustainability rhetoric . 
  fuck , even the nordic countries are so expensive that people are struggling to make ends meet ( household debt-to-income is up to twice as high as the us and southern europe in the three scandinavian kingdoms ) . 
  i 'm at a loss here , but all our institutions are set up to enrich the ultra-neocon wing of the usa at the expense of the rest of humanity . 
  notice all of the think tanks , banks , etc. 
  saying that comfort , long life expectancy , and no need to breed like rabbits are all bad things . 
  american and brussels capitalism are truly warped in that they believe economic development is not a good thing . 
  i personally think austerity is a load of bs and is a result of european leaders being too receptive to american ideas on capitalism . 
  how else do you explain the fact that denmark , sweden , finland , norge , and culturally european canada and australia are also engaging in plutocracy and crony lobbying in spite of having the best fiscal pictures on earth ????? 
  maybe you can tolerate that kind of misery in a country full of slave descendants and where the poor are `` different looking '' from everyone else , but cutting the safety net in an ethnically homogeneous country like greece or denmark is a recipe for fascism . 
   rely on legal immigration to keep our population numbers steady . 
  second-generation immigrants either assimilate , which means their birthrates drop right on down , or do n't , which means they scrounge off welfare while retaining their alien ways . 
  we need to fix the retirement system to not punish people for being comfortable , living long , and only having as many kids as they can invest in . 
   while europe has a luxury problem where most people live comfortable enough lives that they do n't feel the need to have more kids . 
  o_o why the heck is this a bad thing ??? 
  the fact is that global `` economics '' ( tm ) is punishing countries for being too comfortable spits in the face of centuries of western history . 
  this explains part of why economics is so broken . 
  having unplanned babies and a shorter life expectancy is n't something to be rewarded , and having a small number of highly-invested children ( ie most of europe ) and a population that lives well into the eighties should * never , never , neverrrr * be something that bankrupts a country . 
  fuck banks , fuck sustainability rhetoric , fuck corporate sheep , and fuck politicians who think that social democracy is n't sustainable . 
   by your definition , the us should cut itself out of global currency dominance just because you think it should n't spend more than it has -- even though it can print money at will tomorrow , for any amount it desires . 
  even though it can never technically default . 
  a ) this is something only the us ( and maybe japan or the uk ) can get away with . 
  a greece that never adopted the euro could n't just print currency either . 
  note that sweden , uk , norway , denmark , canada , australia , new zealand , and [ even japan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abenomics#austerity_policies ) have pursued policies that would fit completely at home in the eurozone in spite of having their own currencies . 
  b ) the us does n't have to run a deficit to be in debt . 
  norway runs a surplus and has a sovereign wealth fund but still prints bonds for corporations and investors . 
  even though norway, 
  to simplify , the eu is in an unpleasant limbo where you have the euro ( a currency without a country ) and greece ( a country without its own currency ) . 
  countries that control their own currency can in theory inflate away much of the problem ( by external devaluation ) if they are n't hopelessly corrupt or dysfunctional , but it helps to have a large economy that is mostly denominated in your own currency . 
  the us has a completely floating currency while a revived drachma would not be a cure-all because many financial obligations ( loans , consumer goods , government debt ... ) are issued in usd or euros ; this is actually a problem in china where the government has binge-bought us debt to depress the yuan , which squeezes chinese corporations that owe billions in usd . 
  in order of currency freedom : the us , which can do whatever it wants japan the uk canada * a hypothetical drachma * the eurozone countries so an orderly grexit or even not joining the euro might 've been helpful , but a ) there is no guarantee that greece would be as developed as it is now without the euro b ) a lot of obligations would still be in non-drachma currencies and c ) there 's no guarantee that corporations would be any more willing to invest in greece . 
  i was thinking of casting a giant metal padlock for a guinness world record and that image made me giggle for a second . 
  [ of course , i come from a country that is famous for the world 's largest ball of twine . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biggest_ball_of_twine ), 
   we are filling a big lock , the article says it is the biggest lock in the world . 
  canal lock , not padlock . 
  russia probably has racked up a good dozen casus belli from nato ( eston kohver , disrupting the baltics , mh17 , interfering with osce observers , seizing nordic assets in sankt peterburg ... ) and a non-nuclear , non-security council power who did the same would probably face airstrikes at the least . 
  russia probably has more casus belli than any other world power excepting the us . 
   i do n't remember seeing a lot of immigrants in z\u00fcrich or geneva . 
  a lot are from the neighboring countries ( especially [ germany and italy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_switzerland ) ) , with a smattering of french and a fair amount from portugal and the balkans . 
  non-western immigrants are mostly from turkey and kosovo . 
  amazing how many people wonder where all the world 's fairs went when they just changed the name a bit . 
  branding makes a world of difference . 
  the czechs , though , [ mostly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita#who_statistics ) drink beer . 
  [ almost 50 % more than anyone else . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita ), 
   mcdonald good old anti-americanism . 
  hooligans like this make legitimate criticism of the usa look foolish . 
  it 's a world 's fair basically . 
  and yet absolutely no one outside lombardia cares in spite of probably 1.5 x the damage of baltimore because a ) whites do n't riot b ) no jews or americans = no news, 
  1 ) i am not implying that europe is any sort of paradise , just that most of it previously offered a better quality of life in many ( most ? ), 
  respects than a comparable american would enjoy . 
  no intention to be patronizing . 
  2 ) the modern downturn in social services , orwellian espionage , political acrimony ( up to and including nakedly political riots ) , `` it 's not sustainable '' rhetoric has originated after the modern eu/eurozone emerged in the early 2000s , * not * the european coal and steel community . 
  i am aware that the eu did n't * cause * the downturn , but it sure as heck did n't help by : - including eastern euro countries with far lower wages and scrawnier safety nets before they developed a western welfare state - a currency union without a political union ; greece thought its debts were guaranteed but germany begged to differ - a single concentration of power , brussels , that is deluged with corporate lobbyists - a politicized conception of trade agreements as `` removing barriers '' and of all social benefits , gov ' t spending , and regulation as `` barriers '' . 
  this invariably benefits the economic right , both within countries and between countries ( i.e. 
  it benefits the us more than sweden or italy and it benefits the european people 's party more than the pes ), 
  putting the interests of the us above those of her own country ? 
  there 's a word for that , and it 's `` treason . '', 
  i could see that being grounds for * reinstating the fucking death penalty * , not just resigning to a comfy estate in bavaria . 
  imagine if a us president was revealed to be doing what the bnd did under merkel . 
  if there 's a poland circlejerk these charts belong on it . 
  holy hell is that egalitarian . 
  tl ; dr : scandinavia is to poland what the us is to canada in terms of being the land of inequality . 
  they 're being cut in a lot of countries . 
  they 're coming under pressure while the eu is in operation . 
  i never implied a causal relationship . 
   europe and it 's good old values   that 's to a large extend violence , clay grabs and war .
