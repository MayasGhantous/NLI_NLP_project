  but it 's also government support for the vulnerable , free or affordable healthcare and tuition , economic equality , economic mobility , no one dying because they can not find a job , a true culture of human life , freedom from worker exploitation , strong environmental protection , amicable politics ... all things that are imploding under the eu 's watch . 
  i at times have thought of leaving the us ( denmark at least has a green-card visa that i 'd qualify for and germany has free tuition in case i want to grab a phd ) but i 'd have even less of a voice in the face of the global `` deep state '' that incorporates most of the us as well as the elites of europe , canada , japan , and australia . 
  the fact that the professor is based in the uk explains a lot . 
  outside of the house of commons , the entire uk government is a bullshit job ( lords ca n't vote on jack and originated this whole idea of harmless middle-management and any other agency , including the supreme court of the uk , can be overruled by parliamentary sovereignty ; the supreme court is 1 part americanization and 1 part creating the illusion of an independent judiciary ) . 
  also , as someone who works in a bullshit job i take offense to calling the financial sector a bullshit job . 
  it is a parasite job that destroys economies . 
  so basically an african version of russia ? 
  only because the elites have realized how easy it is to rape it and turn it into a larger , more docile usa . 
  africa and asia need to return to a sustainable population and the suffering needed to do so will allow them to grow back stronger and leaner . 
  backwardness and religious poison have led to unsustainable population growth and some dieoffs will have to happen , but it w will be better for humanity in the long run, 
  i do n't think that the op can possibly be european as riots have happened up and down the continent : polish hooligans , finnish independence day in 2013 , pegida , the teenage riots between far-left and far-right swedes , karrtorp ... no police killings = / = no injustice and riots or even less . 
  what would be unprecedented in western and central europe would be the riots evolving into civil war . 
   however there is a difference between straight up cutting down services and doings structural reforms . 
  however , the overall effect ( less services , particularly for the poor , more inequality , and more giveaways to employers and big business ) is still the same . 
  not to mention that those are n't mutually exclusive ; [ finland is cutting ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/costly_treatments_to_be_cut_from_public_healthcare/6855086 ) [ spending too . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/pt_economists_employment_would_suffer_from_more_state_spending_cuts/7888463 ), 
   for starters it 's an empirical fact . 
  maybe in greece but not in , say , sweden , norway , denmark , finland , or even china . 
  or because they 're poor . 
  there is n't really much of a state to speak of in somalia , sudan , or even a kenya or laos compared to , say , norway . 
  also , compare `` growth '' ( which does n't really help most people ) to `` quantifiable standard of living for the average person '' ( which makes a slow-growing economy like switzerland or finland suddenly look a hell of a lot better than the faster-growing usa , australia , or india ) and you 'll see that using gdp growth as a trump card over the european welfare state is ridiculous . 
  sadly , far too many europeans are convinced that social democracy is a failed experiment and/or a relic . 
  the true white european countries stand up against the americanized islamofascists of the eu !, 
  we have our lobbyist-infested washington , you have your lobbyist-infested brussels . 
  in finland and denmark , the government and opposition are basically identical neoliberal twats . 
  the `` socialist '' danish government is the most capitalist in postwar danish history . 
  things wo n't get better until the washingtonwall street mafia is crushed . 
  this can happen whenever there are more than two parties , especially in a system with an intermediate layer of fptp ( the electoral college ) . 
  in a proportional country , 2000 would 've resulted in a hung parliament with either a gore-nader or weak gore-bush coalition . 
  the latter is very similar to the sitting german and swedish governments . 
  and since you live in a small open economy you have to deal with our mistakes . 
  if you think an american 's vote does n't count , an estonian vote counts even less . 
  the eu is recommending security software to protect against the same sort of spying that european governments do ? 
  like i 'd ever trust these clowns . 
  norton and kaspersky are gon na get richer , though . 
  97 % of the * seats * = / = 97 % of the vote . 
  it 's a quirk of the british voting system , which kind of breaks down in a non-two-party system . 
   by who ? 
  http://www.newsweek.com/best-countries-world-71817  and this matters because ? 
  the euro crisis is characterized as a debt crisis , and if your debt is not an issue then you have no need to cut . 
  explain why the same disastrous rightward shift is affecting not only finland but greece , canada , japan , uk , and a number of us states like kansas and wisconsin ( which each have ** vastly ** different financial and regulatory climates and different levels of indebtedness ) . 
  some things are just too entertaining not to pass up , especially as someone who really loves europe . 
  i do n't agree with it ( especially not the kooky zionist stuff in the comments ; how do you know they support israel ? 
  are you just trying to disguise your anti-semitism ? ), 
  but it is reassuring to know that there are other people out there trying to reconcile the recent events in europe with its seemingly high quality of life . 
  the only way i see things changing is maybe if the us elects a [ pro-european ] ( http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/nov/06/jeb-bush/us-workers-least-mobile-developed-world-jeb-bush/ ) [ anti-police state ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/20/us-usa-politics-paul-idusbrea2j0la20140320 ) or [ socialist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernie_sanders ) president who can get the global bankers in order . 
  no country will ever use nukes * because * of their deterrent . 
  you are putting the cart before the horse . 
  even though you are considered to be `` the best country in the world '' , with less government debt to gdp than the us or germany , you still have to cut ? 
  it is getting harder and harder to understand contemporary european politics without resorting to conspiracy theories . 
  cut , cut , cut away the whole safety net and high wages which are what makes europe so much more pleasant than the usa . 
  it 's all being directed from wall street . 
   most of the people here could already go to the one in the us untrue . 
  there are only [ 65,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h-1b_visa ) stem visas available per year . 
  basically , the us is better at stuff that is bad for us but good for the leadership and shortsighted one-percenters . 
  therefore , europe is moving in its direction and until the us government is somehow taken down peacefully or otherwise , [ even republicans concede that the oligarchs have gone too far ] ( http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/nov/06/jeb-bush/us-workers-least-mobile-developed-world-jeb-bush/ ) , europe will remain in serfdom . 
  [ canada ] ( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150423/16043930780/canada-extends-copyright-terms-finally-giving-musicians-who-released-works-more-than-50-years-ago-reason-to-create.shtml ) for instance has already started unilaterally implementing the tpp even though it has n't been finished . 
  once again , another election where policies are chosen by the global markets rather than by national leaders . 
  it is infuriating that europe is an occupied territory to such a great extent that leaders must govern more like americans than like social-democratic finns . 
  what exchange ? 
  [ even in the relatively rich and enlightened czech republic , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiziganism#cite_note-39 ) ethnic gypsies are regularly discriminated against . 
  [ hungary ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/08/european-schools-quietly-segregating-roma-children.html ) is even worse and i 'm sure romania is a shitshow . 
  if you live in western europe you do n't really experience this ( most native born western gypsies are fairly assimilated , irish travellers excepted ) but eastern european gypsies are paranoid as fuck and think that white folk are out to get them , it is n't worth going to school as they 'll get discriminated against , mixing with other ethnic groups is dangerous ... throw in the semi-feudal character of the romanian communities in particular and you get begging , slavery , and unemployable losers who turn to petty crime . 
  guyana ( the english-speaking one ) is probably the most boring of the three for vacationers . 
  its main attractions are a waterfall , the headquarters of the caribbean community ( caricom ) , and the historical site of the jonestown cult massacre . 
  * guyana ( the english-speaking one ) is probably the most boring of the three for holiday-makers .

  there are some people who have called for the [ bloody yanks ] ( http://www.guyanausa.org/ ) to annex it , which is quite daft if you ask me . 
  i 'm opposed to the politics , not the people , and if you 're on / r/europe you 're probably one of the good ones . 
  i actually am more angry at europe right now as they 're making our mistakes after seeing the results . 
  seriously , punching someone over their * political beliefs * ? 
  i know politics has gotten ugly but this is a bridge too far . 
   first king of the kalmar union margrethe was most definitely * not * a king . 
  in two of the three kalmar countries , she was only a [ consort . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/margaret_i_of_denmark ), 
  it 's not like they were beverly hills before decolonization , though . 
  i 'm trying to be * nice * !, 
  i could complain about all the lobbying , [ inequality ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/piketty-warns-scandinavia-of-growing-threat-of-income-inequality ) , coziness with american megacorps like goldman , [ tacky-americana fashion ] ( http://hansamalmo.se/butiker/lexington/ ) , and espionage that have arrived in scandi but i 'm not in an anti-american mood at the moment . 
  one of the most pro-russian countries in central europe ( serbia ) alongside two eu/nato members , including the fiercely anti-russian romania ? 
  this is going to work out just fine . 
   we 've grown by at least 10 % in the same time ...   damnit ... because tito . 
  you started from a more cosmopolitan commie than poland . 
  montenegro , your southeastern neighbor , was one of the few places were politburo and hollywood could share a swimming pool . 
  wallonie , though . 
  all hail the mighty romerican empire !, 
  9 out of the top 16 are romanian and 3 are american . 
  suck that , japan and western europe . 
  you 're just envious because even with 25 % unemployment your brothers are richer than you . 
  do n't you understand ? 
  poland built scandinavia and together with estonia , latvia , and lithuania ( pell ) , the baltics will succeed the overpriced , sclerotic , and decadently americanized nordics as the most sought-after region in europe . 
  plus , they wo n't wimp out when the russians come . 
  the mighty rzeczpospolita bought freedom to europe and unified scandinavia . 
  america bought freedom ( tm ) to europe and 7-11s and reality tv to scandinavia . 
  pretty shitty comparison . 
  well , the first king of the kalmar union ( denmark , sweden , and norway united ) was from [ dar\u0142owo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eric_of_pomerania ) . 
  so poland did unite some states ... of scandinavia . 
   the party leadership were explicitly told not to help , because those who starved were enemies of communism it was just as much about the fact that stalin 's first priority was maintaining a trade surplus than it was about killing `` enemies '' . 
  most of stalin 's and mao 's killings were * manslaughter * , via incompetence , pursuit of ideology over human life , and negligently letting people starve based on their perceived disloyalty :  more significant is the question of the degree of intentionality . 
  stephen wheatcroft ( 1996 ) has argued that the balance between intentional and unintentional homicides or , in english law , between murder and manslaughter may have varied between the two regimes : under stalin manslaughter appears to have predominated , whereas hitler was mainly a murderer . 
  his famine victims , for example , appear to have died mainly because of policy errors and delays in evaluating and acting upon evidence of food shortage ; evidence is lacking that stalin wanted millions to starve ( ellman , 2003 ) .
