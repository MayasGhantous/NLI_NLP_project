  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.195.3111&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf that is why i hate any attempts to compare hitler , stalin , and mao based on their death tolls ; intent matters in courts of law and should matter in the court of public opinion as well . 
  also , marx would 've rolled over in his grave if he 'd seen what was done in the name of communism . 
  pioneering fascists , however , would not have felt the same revulsion at the shoah . 
  communism is a * failed * ideology while fascism and nazism are * evil * ones . 
  find your russia ... before russia finds you . 
  especially on math , [ there are some * huge * philosophical divides on teaching it ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/01/09-timss-pisa-loveless ) which mean that in some tests finland performs no better than the usa while on others the usa is basically third world . 
   it 's pretty rational after all in the short run , at least . 
  in the long run , dystopia is n't fun for anyone . 
  sweden ( which is not immune from crisis politics but did avoid it until 2012-13 ) has more [ billionaires for its size than the usa ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/business/billion_to_one/2013/10/sweden_s_billionaires_they_have_more_per_capita_than_the_united_states.html ) and billionaires in the usa tend to flock to areas , [ like san francisco , nyc , seattle , or the rockies ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/in-climbing-income-ladder-location-matters.html ) , that are free from the worst excesses of american cowboy capitalism . 
  you do n't see billionaires flocking to live and retire in the hardcore ` murica of houston , atl , or ohio unless they grew up there . 
  as an american , reading european news feels like watching a slow motion train wreck . 
  you can not rationally expect to make our same mistakes and get different results , be it rationing healthcare , embracing crooked banks , or militarizing police . 
  is the us culturally western/european ? 
  very different attitudes , particularly towards wealth , social benefits , and capitalism , from the `` rest of the west '' and indeed from [ the majority ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2004/allpolitics/09/20/schneider.world/ ) [ of non-western countries and belief traditions too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/towards_a_global_ethic:_an_initial_declaration ), 
  in the border regions ( including miami ) you pick it up fast . 
  it 's not particularly mutually intelligible with either english or spanish , y por eso \u00e9 mi 3er idioma tho it 's completely useless . 
   can africa handle its own demographic boom ? 
  [ it 's happening ] ( http://images.forbes.com/media/2010/07/29/0729_chart-africa-economic-growth_398.jpg ), 
  the same thing is happening even within english dialects . 
  in 1990 , `` flats to let '' was the predominant way a londoner would advertise his house . 
  now , it 's `` apartments for rent '' , in the american way . 
  one of the first results on google for [ `` flats to let '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?biw=1320&amp;bih=708&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=%22flats+to+let%22&amp;oq=%22flats+to+let%22&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i30j0i24l9.1459.3979.0.4262.2.2.0.0.0.0.99.191.2.2.0.msedr...0...1c.1.64.img..0.2.190.sgrl9fkhjoq#imgrc=jezszgcrilhxmm%253a%3bbbtz7g46s-krkm%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.flattolet.us%252fhome%252f180012097%252f180012097%252ftopbar%252fdb%252fbanner%2525202%2525203.jpg%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.flattolet.us%252f%3b975%3b247 ) is a landlord in the historic british county of ... beaumont , texas . 
  the problem is that there are two types of dead languages : 1 ) languages that run out of speakers ( cornish , manx , livonian ) 2 ) languages that change so much that they are deemed to have died ( latin ) sweden is unlikely to die by definition 1 ) but could be at risk of becoming type 2 ) where 1800s-era swedish texts become as mysterious as latin to a francophone . 
  interestingly , old english is completely unrecognizable to a modern english speaker even though it is not normally thought of as `` dead '' in the latin sense . 
  english spanish spanglish, 
   there are legal channels for immigration yeah right . 
  it 's damn near impossible for an educated american or canadian to move to europe without a highly specific degree or ancestry ; how much chance does a hardworking malian have ? 
  current immigration laws reward the cheaters at the expense of the hardworking and law-abiding . 
   i 'm not sure i agree with the idea that all successful non-western countries owe it to the west . 
  the only non-western country that is not at least somewhat of an emerging market is japan . 
  there are tens of thousands of american troops stationed in japan . 
  americans , in spite of their vastly different politics from the rest of the world , are considered western because of their majority european ancestry . 
  we need to recognize that these countries were far better off under western rule and that every successful non-western country , like japan , receives extensive western support . 
  give them the option to be colonies again !, 
  we should give africans and asians the opportunity to rejoin the colonial empires . 
  things were generally better under direct western rule, 
  yes yes !, 
  why does no one recognize the role of cultural assimilation in successful integration ? 
  the problem is that no western countries , except israel , recognize culture as an immigration criteria . 
  you can be completely danish culturally but have no route to legal residence while some arab with a phd gets a green card . 
  if the eu required immigrants to assimilate and not force their religion or culture on the natives , most `` immigration '' problems will go away . 
  unfortunately , those who make the rules do n't care and would rather divide and conquer . 
  why did n't they announce this on st. patrick 's day ? 
   trade agreement the problem is really that the whole paradigm of `` trade agreements '' is about reducing `` barriers '' , not harmonizing regulations - essentially a race to the bottom that is a huge giveaway to the center-right ( i am not saying `` the right '' as a lot of right-wing parties in europe are essentially * chavista * , such as front national ) . 
  ttip , tpp , tisa ( which governs most of the world 's economy , including the eu , japan , usa , canada , taiwan , and [ parts of china ] ( https://servicescoalition.org/negotiations/trade-in-services-agreement ) ) , etc. 
  essentially enshrine right-wing pro-business `` us cowboy capitalism '' achievements in international law while not granting the same treatment to their left-wing counterparts . 
  as currently construed , these multilateral agreements are an ideological tool that benefits the republicans , moderate democrats , and the `` centrist '' parties of europe to the exclusion of everyone else . 
  and yet the countries that are most out of line with the ttip ethos , like [ denmark , sweden , and italy ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/ ) are strongly in support of it even though a study by tufts university ( usa ) says that the nordic countries in particular would lose 2 + % of gdp to it . 
  when did i imply i wanted him to run * now ? 
  he would be an awesome mp to take back nationalism and criticism of radical islam from the right . 
  as an american , infuriating !, 
  you 're repeating so much of our economic model when you have a lower debt-to-gdp ratio and a small homogeneous population ... we should have filed for copyright on neoliberal economic policies first . 
  you mean japan , which * executed * anyone who engaged in unauthorized trade and is now the most developed nonwhite country , or south korea which was so isolationist it was known as the `` hermit kingdom '' before opening in 1895 . 
  both turned from [ multi-ethnic , semi-feudal ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/32i9vz/queen_elizabeth_ii_is_black_british_and_emperor/cqbpygs ) societies into strong nation-states as a result . 
  china , on the other hand , was open and was rewarded with ... opium , concessions , and famines as late as the 1950s . 
  kongo ( west africa ) adopted portuguese customs , names , and catholicism and today is the asscrack of africa ( kinshasa and northern angola ) . 
  other way around . 
  argentines will be so stuck up compared to the `` slovenly , americanized brits '' that they will refrain from gangsterism . 
  http://www.taringa.net/posts/noticias/17076250/argentina-esta-mejor-que-europa-y-usa.html source : know argentines , speak spanish , google europa site : taringa.net or argentina white meme . 
   lack of funds is n't the problem . 
  here are the problems : - the way the healthcare industry is set up . 
  drug companies rely on the huge profits of the us , which is why they 're pushing on countries like denmark ( persuaded to significantly ration public healthcare ) and the uk ( ca n't get into an nhs hospital without a passport ) . 
  even drug companies based in thriving social democracies like bayer ( de ) are lobbying against the same systems that keep their employees happy , comfortable , and free from fear . 
  - fear of `` outside influence '' in the us . 
  the us ' belief is that it has the greatest system in the world ( tm ) on everything and that improvement upon it is is impossible , even when it flies in the face of [ every other sovereign state ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=if+the+world+could+vote&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=uraxve_mloyryatp6yhybw&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaw&amp;biw=1320&amp;bih=708#imgrc=c2w1ljqgauaavm%253a%3bjn7cs_xmczlcym%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.monster-munch.com%252fimages%252fiftheworldcouldvote.jpg%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.monster-munch.com%252fif-the-world-could-vote%252f%3b500%3b321 ) and [ spiritual tradition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/towards_a_global_ethic:_an_initial_declaration ) . 
  the us ' attitude , if globalized , would 've kept us all in caves . 
  - path dependency . 
  it takes a long time to change something . 
   yes you are perfectly right . 
  when the government provides a service however , it is very common to see it referred to as `` free '' . 
  you also should know that * everyone * benefits from a functioning welfare state with a healthy level of inequality . 
  look at how many billionaires move to london or davos vs. how many move willingly to s\u00e3o paulo or texas . 
   respectful muslims and legal immigration are by no means dangerous to europe . 
  that 's the real problem . 
  most muslims nowadays are brainwashed to a * much * greater extent than historical caliphates and empires because of western and russian/soviet intervention . 
   - they are made to be illegal to marry in europe . 
    - they are made to be illegal to adopt baby/child in europe . 
  that completely destroys the point of immigration policy ... which is to make sure the immigrants blend in . 
  you are in effect creating a caste system and * discouraging * them from treating their host with respect . 
  it would be like telling a guest at a restaurant that they get to pay but they do n't get the food . 
  because the us model of capitalism is so respectful of european countries that it does n't try to interfere with them , spy on them , etc. 
  the values and concept of human rights are pretty incompatible , and all the spying demonstrates that the us is a cancer on european governments . 
  unless you like the death penalty , opposition to affordable health care , no maternity leave ( even the congo aspires to ) , surveillance and guns, 
  most africans and asians are like that . 
  instead of trying to copy european successes and get their own house in order , they move to the nearest western country or invite western troops before assaulting and stabbing their diplomats ( china and japan ) . 
  it 's a shame that instead of westernizing they demand visas and welfare and then riot when they are n't located in a big city . 
  if they 're in lebanon they just see it as a way station to scandinavia . 
  for lack of a better word , asylum seekers ( especially those from the levant ) are greedy . 
  they do n't just want to get away from where people are shooting at them , they want to get to a rich country . 
  they do n't just want a rich country , they want europe . 
  they do n't want europe , they want sweden . 
  [ they wo n't even settle for rural sweden ; they riot if they do n't get into malm\u00f6 or g\u00f6teborg . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150101/refugees-protest-rural-sweden-re-location ) if you 're a true refugee you should n't care where you 're going as long as you are n't hungry and are n't being shot at . 
   assign asylum seekers based on a sensible system - but do not let them choose where to go . 
  asylum seekers who express willingness to abide by european customs and laws should be let in . 
  send the rest to a poor but peaceful country like senegal or djibouti . 
  and peaceful hindus and buddhists killing muslims happens too . 
  one could conceivably argue that radical nationalists in burma and sri lanka are only putting muslims in concentration camps out of self-defense , but the claim is weak . 
  but islam is a religion with over a millennium of history that includes periods of relative tolerance for blasphemy , atheism , jews , christians , hindus , buddhists , and even lgbt individuals alongside periods of bloody jihad . 
  muhammad was a far more humane and well-respected general than the butchers of today 's islam .
