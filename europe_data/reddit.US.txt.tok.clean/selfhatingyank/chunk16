  if you see the buddha , kill the buddha . 
  slay the idolaters wherever ye find them , arrest them , besiege them , and lie in ambush everywhere for them . 
  now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .

  / u/trollabot trollabot, 
  i 'm saying the us brand of imperial capitalism is * soooo * dangerous that even the fascists in europe are more left-wing than it . 
   `` i am as black as al sharpton . '', 
  [ taken out of context . 
  ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/32i9vz/queen_elizabeth_ii_is_black_british_and_emperor/cqbiq53 ) i am impressed that a bot is able to find the most incendiary things that i say . 
   wingnutty left-wing anti-americanism is considered wingnut ? 
  let 's see what else is out there in the dregs of my [ gadfly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_gadfly ) career : / u/isreactionary _ bot selfhatingyank / u/trollabot selfhatingyank, 
  [ sort by controversial . 
  it 's # 1 .

  does n't every developed and developing country aspire to be more caring than the us , though ? 
  comparing yourself to a country where many people believe further progress to be impossible - lacking the orientation that got us out of caves and separates humans from lesser animals - is a low bar . 
  poland and the baltic countries are the most right wing areas in europe though . 
  right wing ultra capitalism . 
  the architecture , while it may be a bit chilly , is n't always bad : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/cabanon_le_corbusier.jpg http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/chauxdefonds/amb_01.jpg https://utopiadystopiawwi.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/corbusier-citrohan-house.jpg?w=545&amp;h=363 http://monoskop.org/file:corbusier_le_towards_a_new_architecture_no_ocr.pdf the urbanism , however , was very damaging from an environmental , energy use , and urban vibrancy perspective . 
   who says this ? 
  who believes this ? 
  nordic governments and think tanks : http://www.thelocal.se/20150204/swedish-defence-slammed-in-international-report http://www.thelocal.se/20140219/swedish-freeriders-applaud-tallins-fee-free-transport http://www.thelocal.se/20130709/48952, 
  but a lot of nordic governments ( from what i hear ) are actually looking to `` estonianize '' their political economy because they view the nordic model as `` too expensive . '', 
  maybe household debt is high , but worker productivity , equality , life expectancy ( except denmark ) , employment , pro-business ratings , sovereign debt , and even billionaires per capita are among the highest in the world . 
  saying `` nordic countries are failing because soooooo expensive '' is the same sort of cherrypicking as saying `` usa has highest average income in world !, 
  usa # 1 ! '', 
  or conversely `` usa does n't have paid maternity leave , africa does , therefore usa worse than africa '', 
  the us is not part of western civilization in the same way that canada or even greece are and is a shitty cannibalizing ally for europe . 
  front national or even golden dawn would be better . 
  romania is not really a european country ( especially not the szeklers ) ; at least architecturally , it 's closer to kazakhstan or mongolia . 
  cape verde is more european than romania . 
  most immigrants are ingrates . 
  immigration policy should be based on willingness to assimilate first , human capital second , and need third . 
  a large amount of europe 's economy and media are controlled by the american-oriented neoliberals . 
  most parliamentary parties in europe ( except a few of the nordic far-left and far-right parties ) are shills . 
  europe should consider walling itself off from on outside world that is seeking ideologically motivated revenge on it . 
  i am pro-life ( consistent life ethic , which is hard to explain to most americans and many europeans ) but believe banning abortion is not the answer ; a social-democratic welfare state has been proven to lower abortion rates far more than throwing doctors in jail . 
   attitude this is far more important than gdp : india http://media.newindianexpress.com/kozhikode-city.jpg/2013/12/13/article1942637.ece/alternates/w620/kozhikode-city.jpg cape verde http://www.ecaboverde.com/data/media/11/ilha_do_sal_-_espargos_3.jpg cambodia http://www.asienreisender.de/images2/sam_5374-76--kratie,%20cambodia--03052013.jpg bhutan http://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_dyr_thdyi/hqdefault.jpg ethiopia http://haguereethiopie.wifeo.com/images/176-dire-dawa-avril-2008-.jpg all poorer countries than russia but somehow less slovenly than http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/81/99681-004-90ccec99.jpg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/a_view_from_hotel_sortavala.jpg ( karelia ) http://russiatrek.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/kaliningrad-oblast-architecture-remains-4.jpg kaliningrad is still kind of a backwater within russia , though . 
  is that a lego store in one of the finnish pix ? 
  do they have lego stores throughout the nordic countries ? 
  if so , time to look into visas . 
  i know , but why are countries like finland messing with their systems ? 
  if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . 
   same as assad is on way to victory for fifth year ? 
  [ any day now , my friend , any day now . 
  ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-29/syrian-islamist-rebels-deal-blow-to-assad-with-capture-of-idlib ), 
   the reform of the health system is not even close to be done , changes need to be done and that fast . 
  it probably will end up in a catastrophe once finished too , especially for the countryside . 
  why the heck do europeans ( including brits ) think that their health system is in an urgent crisis when it performs so much better and is cheaper than that of the us ? 
  pretty much every other developed country is dealing with a manufactured healthcare crisis that is being used to ration and/or only make things worse . 
   nobody knows why the fuck it happens . 
  agreed here . 
  it 's like economists promote something until it fails : let 's try american plutocratic capitalism . 
  oh wait , housing bubble and many aspects of deep third-world quality of life in spite of a lot of very rich people . 
  on to southern european protectionism . 
  let 's try southern european protectionism . 
  oh wait , debt crisis . 
  on to nordic welfare state . 
  let 's try nordic welfare state ; that seems to work well . 
  oh , what is this employers are saying about it not being profitable anymore ? 
  what is this business about household debt being twice income . 
  oh sh ... on to chinese state capitalism . 
  let 's try chinese state capitalism . 
  oh wait , housing bubble and massive environmental impacts .

   2nd nope , only third-generation immigrants born to a ) two second-generation parents or b ) one second-generation parent and one native dutch . 
  `` autochtoon '' [ has a specific meaning in the dutch language . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allochtoon )  greater threat to the jewish community proportionally , it 's still muslims . 
  only about 5 % of dutch are turkish or moroccan but they commit 13 % of anti-semitic crimes . 
  and then , because of the ongoing westminster-stormont feud over austerity , the uup northern irish unionists create a `` legitimate united kingdom '' with capital in belfast and guaranteed social democracy backed by the uvf . 
  why not scotland ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  or calling people nazis ? 
  the latter sounds lazy simplistic and hackneyed and reduces the complicated problems that plague modern islam to a bumper sticker slogan with no explanation of how to stop islamism . 
  it 's a classic hollow campaign pledge that lays out no real solution . 
   ruotsi this is the same word that ( via the kievan rus ) is the origin of russia . 
  `` russia '' is derived from the finnish term for a bunch of swedes who settled in ukraine . 
  you can see why putin is so antsy to conquer ukraine ; it 's the real russia !, 
  just as they were in denial that their economic models and way of life ( usa = laissez-faire capitalism , southern europe = protectionism , northern europe = high-labour-cost social democracy ) would ever come under serious challenge because `` they work , right ? '', 
  ** the parallels are uncanny between now and that dark period in european history that birthed stalinism and fascism : ** crippling debt , disenfranchisement , unemployment , and monetary and health insecurity , in the west formerly restricted to the american inner cities and to indigenous reservations , are now affecting large shares of the population ( in many cases the majority ) . 
  europe is in a near-1930s depression . 
  rising ultranationalism , old rivalries , expropriation of property , conspiracism , [ nakedly ideological rioting ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/violence-breaks-out-at-far-right-demonstration-in-germany-1414418541 ) [ that goes beyond just burning and looting ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20140321/police-seek-leftwing-activist-over-attempted-manslaughter ) [ to attacking people because of their ideological views ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/alternative_independence_day_riots_and_shadow_celebrations/6973184 ) , large authoritarian political movements that openly challenge the legitimacy of the state , an air of paranoia , a feeling that democratically-elected governments ( including the eu ) are controlled by `` special interests '' ... 
  this is the stuff that wars are made of . 
  [ france , new zealand , israel , and the usa all have fertility rates above 2.0 ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html ) . 
  it would help if we worried about the quality of children and not the raw number . 
   the only thing of real importance this week is that police is now allowed to read out all data on your phone without needing a warrant .
