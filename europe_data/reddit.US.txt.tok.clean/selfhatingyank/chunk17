  so europe gets all outraged about the snowden revelations and then , country-by-country , elects to do the same thing or even more ? 
   almost feels like something has pushed him into action it 's not like [ russia already invaded estonian soil once under his watch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver ) . 
  this is a global problem that is perhaps [ the single biggest threat to the global economy ] ( http://economist.com/node/21647622/comments#comments ) . 
  not only are rural areas depopulating , but economic interest is going to the densest and busiest cities in a given country . 
  in hungary , this means that even szeged and miskolc are getting fucked . 
  even rural [ denmark ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/denmark/comments/2xet66/what_is_going_on_here_is_denmark_really/ ) , a relatively dense and very prosperous country , is considering abandoning its countryside or else it 'll turn into a `` mini detroit '' full of the old and the desperate . 
  no , existing villages are turning into suburbs . 
  england , parts of scotland/wales/ireland / ni , the netherlands , and parts of germany are a ) dense enough that most locations are commutable to larger , relatively vibrant towns and city and b ) have a continuous network of villages ready to be revitalized . 
  it 's not like the us ( except maybe parts of new england ) where there 's tons of farmland , woods , and shit in between the towns and where most development is brand-new sprawling subdivisions . 
  [ typical `` rural '' england ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/liskeard,+cornwall+pl14,+uk/@50.5394129,-4.7642987,8917m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x486b629613dd369b:0xa99bbeb9feaeb9fa ) [ rural usa ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/tucumcari,+nm+88401/@34.9467273,-103.3260746,11270m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x871b3865e7ec4185:0x31feda0f1b630f7c ), 
   honestly , we were pretty happy when they did that . 
  though that was in 1945 . 
  and that 's what drives me crazy about the american ultranationalists who say that `` if we did n't save your ass , you 'd all be speaking german . '', 
  no , you 'd be speaking russian . 
  portuguese vodka is best vodka . 
  do you support putin because : a ) he 's actually competent b ) he 's a bastard , but he got us crimea c ) at least he has n't sent my uncle to the gulags ... yet d ) i do n't want a couple of chechens with guns roughing me up or worse, 
  from my knowledge of uk culture , chavs are the type who listen to rap music and wear gold chains while telling black people `` go back to africa , you bloody wanker '' and eating kebabs in between punching muslims . 
  are n't they pretty much the same ? 
  the fact is that a lot of the most racist people in the uk are the same ones wearing hoodies and gold chains and listening to grime rap . 
  but if they dropped the g-bomb without downplaying the number that would probably be enough to force the armenians to retreat a bit . 
  and the usa too . 
  i 'd rejoice that they were finally excluded from the club of developed countries but then you get fuckup hungary and the islamic caliphate of turkey . 
  why is turkey so unwilling to acknowledge a genocide that happened almost a century ago during a world war by a dying empire ? 
  ca n't they just say : `` we agree that , in its dying days , the ottoman empire resorted to genocide in a desperate attempt to remain on the winning side of wwi but we , as a republic , bear no responsibility for it '' ? 
  similar to how the ddr formally repudiated nazi germany and how austria has attempted to sever any ties to the third reich . 
   gypsy footbal club [ here ] ( http://img.blesk.cz/img/2/i_article/2090652_fotbal-tj-roma-decin.jpg ) is a picture of them . 
  til czech gypsies look like serbs, 
  american in a bad way . 
  they 're not getting all the good music , greasy food , and / r/murica that comes with the whole package . 
  so strong that you nearly imposed a begging ban ? 
  http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/12/ban-beggars-norwegian-cities-homeless and the fact that finland is in a recession and all four continental nordic countries have the highest levels of poverty , homelessness , and housing shortage in a good decade while their politicians twiddle their thumbs and cheerlead for the ttip treaty that will gut their economies !, 
  cutting spending , cutting services , humiliating the unemployed and the poor , cutting back on healthcare , becoming more `` american '' ... 
   public building than a summer retreat it 's kind of both as it 's designed to be an official retreat for a head of state . 
  monticello ( in the us ) was the private home of thomas jefferson but also had more of a public `` presence '' than your typical luxury house . 
  one could complain about richardsonian romanesque being a degenerate american import , but it has almost as long a history in finland as it does in the usa . 
  the folly needs some work , definitely ; concrete does n't weather well compared to stone and crumbling concrete reflects poorly on infrastructure maintenance in finland as a whole ( if they ca n't maintain a couple dozen doric columns at the president 's official residence , how are they going to keep all of finland 's infrastructure going ) ? 
  also , greek doric is a lot chubbier than roman and that appears to be a greek revival folly . 
   conspitards and anti americanist cognitive dissonance can do that . 
  many europeans and progressive americans were caught off guard , for instance , by the rightward political turn in europe and have resorted to conspiracy to explain the world around them . 
  i would n't be surprised if your average czech is any different . 
  but what are they going to suggest ? 
  no one has any idea how to keep social democracy ( the `` european model '' ) alive anymore and right now it is all a matter of trial and error . 
   that concrete doric folly is absolutely hideous . 
  and the house looks like something out of the shawshank redemption . 
  his main residence is quite neat though . 
  it would be nice to see a comparison of all the different presidential residences in the eu . 
  i disagree . 
  while it looks a bit like a castle on the outside , it is plenty light , bright , and modern inside and nicely reflects the turn of the century [ romanesque ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richardsonian_romanesque#architects_working_in_the_style ) style of eliel saarinen and others . 
  the doric folly reflects a strong tradition of `` nordic classicism '' that straddles the traditional/modern line . 
  the main residence looks like an airport hotel on the inside even though it is cool outside . 
  organic frank lloyd wright/alvar aalto modern is great for a private house but does n't have the right look for a presidential palace . 
  the `` palace '' is obviously quite historic and is obviously not a family home . 
  what is an elegant and palatial interior for a civic landmark is kind of fussy and russian oligarch/grandmotherly for an actual house . 
  i take it i 'm in the minority , though . 
  a much higher % of estonians and latvians are of russian communist descent vs. poland and estonia . 
  estonia and latvia were much more sparsely populated than lithuania . 
  let me guess ... you want a smaller government , less `` red tape '' , less regulation , etc. 
  that 's what `` reform '' generally means in a european context and that would be considered `` conservative '' in the historically right-wing us . 
  and the rest of europe is any different ? 
  most of europe in general is drab and modern ; at least the postwar stuff in romania is fascinating even if it is from the mind of a madman .

  `` chaotic neutral '' is probably the best way to describe it ; they have an incredibly egalitarian and `` cultured '' ambiance , four native languages , and will gladly accept the moolah of anyone ( thief ? 
  nazi ?

  they housed the largest concentration of un facilities outside the us even though they were n't a member for decades . 
   france ca n't forget that they 've pulled off the only three successful western military interventions since 2000 ( car , cote d'ivoire , northern mali ) and that they have a muslim-majority department ( mayotte ) , the charming and historically-rich caribbean islands of guadeloupe , martinique , st. barts ( shame about all the oligarchs tho ) , europe 's space facilities ( kourou ) , and a hefty chunk of the south pacific including world-famous bora-bora .
