  by those standards the dutch or austrians are more nordic than the finns . 
   nobody speaks a north german language per se http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noarootsi_parish would beg to differ . 
  this article is not explaining at all * why * the moderates started this wave of immigration . 
  it was n't so much bleeding-heart charity so much as `` we need to lower the cost of labor and look like the good guys while we sell weaponry to the world 's worst regimes . '', 
  the same fiscal belt-tightening is happening in sweden 's neighbors like finland and denmark , which have arguably even * worse * economies but far less mass immigration . 
  did you read the article ? 
  the roma beggars are simply the justification that politicians are using to usher in policies that are hitting white norwegians too . 
   but there are plenty of norwegian-born homeless too , if more hidden from view . 
  the majority of these are single mothers , victims of violence in the home . 
  a fifth are 18-25 years old , half are addicted to drugs or alcohol , and 40 % suffer from psychiatric illnesses . 
   yet despite this wealth , 75,000 norwegian-born children lived below the poverty line in 2012 . 
   sandnes is the norwegian city with the worst problem proportionally : 3.6 homeless people per 1,000 residents .

  no , traditional architecture is not a stereotype but a time-honored tradition .

   appalachia of western europe poor , industrial , red brick , and mountainous , and pittsburgh is a major city that has similar landscape and architecture to appalachia ( although less poor ) . 
  wallonie is the most pittsburgh-looking area in europe : https://rutheh.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_8875-version-4.jpg?w=950&amp;h=633 https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcsmy-yogfakx71scufbdet8p9hosojnx4pbc7ev-efnpi13-gb2 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/lawrenceville.jpg/300px-lawrenceville.jpg there is even a pittsburgh suburb called [ charleroi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charleroi,_pennsylvania ) . 
   flemish do n't forget wallonia , which is basically the appalachia of western europe with hills to boot and is not conducive to cycling infrastructure : http://connaitrelawallonie.wallonie.be/sites/wallonie/files/styles/featured/public/semois.jpg?itok=ejxn6nxa http://d1vmp8zzttzftq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/the-center-of-the-town-of-dinant-with-citadelle-and-church-at-the-meuse-river-in-namur-belgium-1600x1066.jpg heck , even the hilly parts of the netherlands ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocede7izmwy ) attract the spandex-and-helmet crowd more so than the commuters .

  if baltic russians are so oppressed , why are they literally * pouring * into latvia to gain residency ? 
  or threatening article 5 if he is not released promptly and if russia does not agree to seal the border with east ukraine . 
   attacking one of its members it already did . 
  russian troops entered estonian territory to seize him . 
  taking full control of , say , narva would be a different ballgame but they still could keep apprehending various members of the city 's government on trumped-up charges . 
  why no article 5 ? 
  his detention is the result of russian invasion into sovereign eu/nato territory and is being essentially legitimized by the russian judicial system . 
  this is a clear attack on nato . 
  the difference is that the eston kohver case is a pretty clear-cut example of a ) russian boots on the ground d ) deliberately and with planning c ) in an eu/nato country d ) that has been legitimized by the russian government as kohver is still incarcerated in russia . 
  with mh17 , there was far more plausible deniability than here ; there is no doubt that russian forces crossed into estonia without tallinn 's permission , which is the definition of invasion ( even if temporary ) and a clear article 5 situation . 
  mh17 happened outside of nato or the eu and was not legitimized by the russian government ; even if russian forces were responsible for shooting down the plane ( which they almost certainly were ) , moscow could easily blame some rogue trigger-happy missile operator . 
  cough eston kohver cough cough, 
  i also think we should hear french and dutch views . 
  wallonia in particular is pretty backward and would be a liability for france : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/eu_regional_policy.svg/2000px-eu_regional_policy.svg.png, 
  however , the fact that american republicans are more positive on europe or canada than * actual europeans or canadians * is still like something out of a harry turtledove novel . 
  even [ jeb fucking bush ] ( http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/nov/06/jeb-bush/us-workers-least-mobile-developed-world-jeb-bush/ ) is more pro-europe than most of the european crisis politicians . 
  the real problem is that european countries are very afraid of nuclear war . 
  there has been at least one clear-cut incident in which russia invaded a nato country ( estonia ) in the past year to minimal response ( eston kohver ) from nato . 
  if this is how the west is going to deal with outright russian invasions , then we 'll never be able to stop further aggression . 
  did you just give a semi-serious answer to an april fools post ?

  an isolationist shogunate a la tokugawa .

  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/rick-santorum-is-right-about-europe/2011/10/12/giqauiebfl_blog.html as i posted before , it 's a strange world we live in . 
  zizek ( an avowed marxist ) is closer to rick santorum than he is to most mainstream politicians in europe in his respect for the traditional european model . 
  while americans are starting to realize that they 'd almost all be better off in europe and canada , actual european and canadian politicians are ever deeper in denial . 
  either the world 's most successful economic model is unsustainable ( what brussels thinks ) or an american republican knows more about europe than actual european national leaders .

   america latvia more diverse than entire western hemisphere !, 
  it 's a mindset problem more than anything else . 
  the only reasonably developed countries that have consistent natural increases are israel ( where most of the babies are born to religious zealots or muslims ) and the us ( highest rates of poverty , illegitimacy , and unplanned/teen pregnancies in the developed world ) . 
  until we change our mindset to focus on quality rather than quantity , this problem can not be fixed . 
  it is an imaginary problem that say norway 's birthrate is only 1.8 children per woman when those children will grow up to be as economically productive and socially adjusted as 2.5 american children . 
  i just find it amusing that an american politician ( and a republican to boot ! ),
