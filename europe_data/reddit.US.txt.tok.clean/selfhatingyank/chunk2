   albania kosovo albanians or albanian albanians ? 
  because kosovo albanians were yugo citizens .

  the joke flew over you , my friend . 
  the 21st chromosome is the one impacted by down syndrome . 
  i 'm doubtful on all of these . 
  in descending order of size : * the us . 
  * while there would definitely be hangups over the death penalty , guns , food safety , etc. 
  the big issues would be structural . 
  the us is pretty protective of its sovereignty and congress has about a snowball 's chance in hell of ever allowing a foreign body to make laws for it . 
  even more fundamentally , the us has roughly * three times * the population of germany and roughly a third of the new super eu and would have an incredibly lopsided effect on any eu lawmaking . 
  then you have the numbers ; the largest economy in a `` european '' union being located entirely in the americas ( except for a few military bases ) would be very odd , and the idea of fusing 45 % of the world 's gdp and half of its military spending into one alliance would give / r/conspiracy an aneurysm - doubly so if the us insisted on including israel . 
  before ' 08 , the political and values differences would have been a bigger barrier , but the erasure of george w. bush from the history books and the rise of ultra-neoliberal politics , as well as the dubious human rights record of full eu member hungary and the dubious economic regulation in estonia have made that look foolish . 
  you might also see some racist concerns about 30 million `` ghetto blacks '' gaining full eu citizenship , although they would n't be that blunt . 
  the political differences between [ the us and ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2004/allpolitics/09/20/schneider.world/ ) [ europe , nay the * world * ] ( http://www.iftheworldcouldvote.com/polls/results/usa-presidential-election-2008/ ) [ could always ] ( http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://blog.scope.is/.a/6a00d83451e3e669e2010535d73fbd970c-pi&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.marketingsafari.org/marketing_safari/2008/11/why-if-the-world-could-vote-matters-and-what-it-means-for-the-usa.html&amp;h=284&amp;w=729&amp;tbnid=-u2eauwf_z3g9m:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=wes_n4ujvb43zm&amp;itg=1&amp;ei=wv3yvoz3coplsatgm4gyaw&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0ccuqmygimag ) [ come up , though ] ( http://jeffreyhill.typepad.com/english/usa/page/81/ ) [ in a potential union ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/04/us-election-international-poll_n_2066972.html ) . 
  these countries would have a lot of difficulty with eu environmental regulations as they are predominantly resource-based economies with environmental protections as low , if not lower than , the us . 
  * new zealand * . 
  geographically , it 's as far from europe as it gets and if it 's included a whole bunch of westernized caribbean and latin american countries would ask why they are passed over . 
  no direct flights to europe would make it very hard to integrate . 
  plus , there 's a shit-ton of maori who do n't feel european at all and annexing nz into the eu would be a slap in their face . 
  however there is n't a continent in between greece and cyprus and cyprus ' main ethnic groups , greeks and turks , are both indigenous to other eu countries ( greece , obviously , and italy both have indigenous greek-speakers and bulgaria , romania , and northern greece all have indigenous turks ) . 
  cape verde might be able to get in as it 's pretty close to madeira and the canary islands and speaks a romance language , portuguese creole . 
  reunion , martinique , and guadeloupe would be question marks as they have an ocean and/or a continent between them and europe . 
  i 'm not talking nonsense right now . 
  i 'm in a fine mood . 
  i 'm just curious where extreme ideologies are the most common in the eu/eea . 
  never mind . 
  come to think of it , i work closer to 45 including lunch although no one tracks hours . 
   since the turn of the century , the netherlands have been swept up in the same rightwing anti-immigration anti-muslim anti-welfare state anti-eu bullshitry as every other european country ( or so it seems ) . 
  on the plus side , there 's less culture shock for american tourists . 
   but if it does n't conform to the stereotype that spain is literally worst country in the world , most spaniards wo n't believe it . 
  til spaniards are americans in reverse . 
  i 'm more curious how they claim to have a mandate when they did n't get a majority of the actual votes . 
  i know in the us the popular vote winner does n't always = the actual winner , but how does this happen in a country with proportional representation like spain ? 
  if you can make the argument that france is artificial , you can make it about almost any european country . 
  even small ones like denmark have complex histories and tons of regional dialects . 
  i think that you could say that the us manifest destiny ideology is incompatible with most nationalisms , but denying the legitimacy of a country over ideology is dumb . 
   weirder still though that he thinks of the us as a nation-state . 
  i 've actually heard that the us is a nation of `` temporarily embarrassed millionaires '' , not a nation or community . 
  is that what you 're getting at ? 
  or crime films . 
  finland 's pretty much the only country in the eu that 's still in recession . 
  germany , austria , and netherlands are probably the easiest for an american to get a visa ( germany offers free education to qualifying students , netherlands offers residency through the daft treaty , and both germany and austria have blue-card programs for professionals ) . 
   dark literally . 
  it 's finland . 
   how would i get a visa to look for work in the us ? 
  it 's 1000x harder than an american ed : getting a visa to work in the eu for a european to get a visa to work in the us . 
  tl ; dr : it 's hard for an american to get a work visa in europe . 
  it 's impossible for most europeans to get a work visa in the us . 
  try somewhere in canada near the border ; they 're more tolerant of people from other developed countries . 
  shame finland is n't working out from him , but he could always take some [ suomi ] ( http://www.viinarannasta.ee/images-shop/1280830072-suomiviina32_10x50pet.jpg ) with him to his final destination . 
  all the westernized pro-booze pro-assimilation anti-zealot syrians are the ones turning back . 
  the only people who want to stay in the nordic countries are the burqa bandits . 
  i say we give him a visa just because his desire to get smashed means he 's already assimilated to finnish culture . 
   no bars  muhammed such a shame that the migrants who obviously * are n't * radical muslims are turning back . 
  if there 's any muhammed who would fit well in finland , it 'd be one whose first thought upon entering finland is `` where can i get drunk ? '', 
  so you 'd be electing me then ? 
  europe as a whole has become that way . 
  the fact that hundreds of thousands of refugees are pouring in and no one is taking responsibility for housing them can do that to a continent . 
  i 'm sure you 've overheard very similar rhetoric offline from friends , neighbors , and politicians . 
  we need to resist outside influences and keep europe european !, 
  * wearing harley davidson jacket , shirt with american flag , baseball cap with confederate flag , all underneath a kkk uniform *, 
  do you want to get shot by the russian army ? 
  i did n't think so . 
  and guess what , good luck going back through a dozen european countries that are muchsmarterababout security now . 
  face it , they 're stuck in scandinavia . 
  good luck getting back to the mediterranean , though . 
  if they want to get back to turkey they 'll have to pass through sweden , denmark , germany , austria , hungary , serbia , macedonia , and greece . 
  sorry , you 're stuck in lapland unless you want to try to get into russia , which does n't fuck around . 
  it 's all fun and games until the oresund is sealed . 
  actually , just the opposite is happening . 
  isis , instead of uniting the world , has become an excuse to aggravate almost every conflict in eurasia . 
  serbia v croatia , denmark v sweden , uk v continent , turkey v kurdistan , and arguably even the rise of militarism in japan . 
  personally i think the entire syrian war could 've been orchestrated by ustasha swine to harm serbs and divide europe . 
  schengen is now just a memory . 
  1970s , 1980s , 1990s . 
  socialism , not cutting healthcare , guaranteeing a decent standard of living for all citizens , being careful about foreign corporations , espionage , and illiberal government . 
  economically , trade , and public spending/deficit at least are almost uniformly to the right of the historical consensus . 
  also , he 's working within the current party system . 
  the 2015 political consensus in most if not all western european countries would be viewed as unthinkably right , almost fringe in 2005 . 
  and both centre-left and centre-right parties have moved right themselves , to the point where the centre-left of 2015 is the centre-right of 2005 . 
  one can argue that it 's necessity , euro crisis , people have n't moved that far right so much as been forced by circumstances , but the end result is a * muuuch * more right wing , often usa-lite , platform in many countries . 
  if i were paranoid , i 'd say that the migrant crisis is an excuse/a plot to turn european countries against one another . 
  but i 'm not . 
  this is how the next wave of yugoslav wars begins . 
  like , on the nightly news . 
  have most romanians even seen a syrian refugee ? 
  i live in the us and have never seen gun violence aside from on tv . 
  it takes about two decades for members of a baby boom to enter the workforce . 
  this would unite the far left and far right ; the idea of the eu taking over greek national defence would be too much even for golden dawn . 
   this party attracts the uneducated and the self-absorbed elders depend on government welfare welfare is the centerpiece of danish culture . 
  you and your neoliberal poverty-mongering should seriously consider going to the us or uk because you do n't fit in with danish values . 
  i as a socialistic american am probably more danish than you politically speaking . 
  nope . 
  df is only tough on people who do n't vote for df . 
  let the middle east solve their own problems . 
  only take in people who agree not to force their religion on others . 
  taqiyya is exclusively a shiite doctrine ( iran , a minority of arabs and afpak ) , and even then it is mainly attested in cases of war or persecution , often from sunnis . 
  unless all of islam is a lie . 
  even if they are converting for residency , i 'm fine with them staying so long as they do n't commit crimes or leach off welfare .
