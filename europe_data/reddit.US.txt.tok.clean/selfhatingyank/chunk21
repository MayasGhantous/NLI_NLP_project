  at the same time , the gdp per capita of non-american countries has generally increased and overall violence has gone down during the `` pax americana . '', 
  while a friendly , multilateral world with an end to all imperialism is a nice idea , russia spitting in the face of all the world institutions is not going to bring it any closer to reality . 
  also , the four examples / u/ucstruct cites are all * de facto * nato members . 
  if someone were to god forbid invade ireland , sweden , or finland would there be any doubt that nato would respond ? 
  the eu has a large degree of integration and an attack on any one eu state would likely be considered an attack on all of the eu , which is * full * of nato members . 
  http://quotes.dictionary.com/history_repeats_itself_first_as_tragedy_second_as the crisis is well past the greek tragedy stage and is now deep in farce , to quote the brilliant philosopher but clueless economist karl marx, 
  still , there are a lot of people ( even americans ! ), 
  who would be considered left-wing even in most parts of europe . 
  european policies ( although out of necessity ) have moved quite a bit rightward in the past couple of decades . 
  the hostility towards radical islam also would put quite a bit of reddit in line with [ the danish far-left ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red%e2%80%93green_alliance_%28denmark%29#cite_ref-aalborg_25-0 ) , which has a strong secularist streak . 
  american here . 
  europe is the birthplace of western civilization , is home to the best cities in the world , and is a beloved father/uncle to my country , even if relations are a bit strained at times . 
  plus , i feel that even most default `` international '' websites are us-centric and so i have to crawl the different other continents to get a truer picture of the world . 
   what you mean to say is that you are surprised by the sentimentality that goes along with environmentalism in europe ? 
    that may have something to do with the fact that europeans , especially western-europeans , have less space and pristine nature areas left . 
  though that would probably not be the main reason . 
  this actually means that the attitude of europe is * more * utilitarian and driven by economic efficiency than the us . 
  the us is content destroying the global climate so long as there are still unspoiled wildernesses within the lower 48 , while europeans actually value their economy and their children and do n't want to pull out the rug from underneath themselves . 
  i feel like the whole us economic system needs to be reported to a suicide helpline as our economic/environmental system is inefficient and self-defeating and i for one do n't want to grow old in a neo-medieval post-apocalyptic shithole . 
  i actually heard that part of the reason global warming discussions in the us focus on polar bears is that americans are more sympathetic to furry animals than to brown people in asia , africa , or latin america . 
   20-30 something neo-liberal/libertarian no . 
  i 'd probably say most american redditors are pretty hard-left by us standards . 
  whether that makes them neoliberal/right wing by eu standards i dunno , but i 'd probably say die linke , snp , enhedslisten , podemos , and syriza would come in # 1 or # 2 if american reddit was a country . 
  heck , podemos is essentially reddit launching a political party ( / r/podemos ) and there are thriving socialist , communist , and even stalinist collectives on our fair website . 
  the one far-left party i do n't see getting much traction is f !, 
  because it is a vehicle for obnoxious rich girls to whine about how `` oppressed '' they are . 
  / s with regards to f !, 
   russia 's only gulag memorial is redesigned to celebrate the gulag  russia 's growing number of political prisoners  ` ovd-info ' reports on rising levels of repression so the soviet reunion is official , i take it . 
  explains why the polls say 88 % of people would vote for putin ... the other 12 % are suicidal . 
  ossining is not somewhere you 'd expect a norwegian billionaire to come from kind of a blue-collar [ immigrant town ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ossining_%28village%29,_new_york#demographics ) . 
  it would be like if one of the richest people in the us grew up in east oslo . 
   in a rich country it should be possible for the poorest of the poor to at least have food , shelter , utilities and basic healthcare . 
  in any country this should at least be the stated goal with the available resources . 
  even a poor country can aspire to this ; indeed the vast majority of developing countries do consider this statement to be the definition of development . 
  the us and the austerians are more the exception than the norm worldwide . 
  europe 's been dead for a while ( at least 5 years ) . 
  i know i can be a bit troll on occasion , but many people even in the nordics either [ do n't realize how good they have it ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/nordiccountries/comments/2wi3tm/is_complacency_killing_the_nordic_model/ ) [ or are n't aware of what 's going on behind the scenes ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-excel-depression.html?_r=0 ) . 
  argentina !, 
  costa rica !, 
  maybe norway , but as an eea country they are effectively a nonvoting member of the eu . 
  how about we abolish lobbying completely ? 
  politicians can get anything they need from wikipedia anyway . 
   well if even the americans have done net neutrality then we need to i understand that at almost all continents are like this , but seeing europe as the progressive beacon against the conservative-kleptocrat us has made it hard to square the past 5 years against reality . 
  how about the king john conspiracy ? 
  every president except for van buren ( full blooded dutch ) was descended from [ the king who signed the magna carta . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2183858/all-presidents-bar-directly-descended-medieval-english-king.html ) pretty rich for a country founded on the rejection of royalty , although the parallels between the magna carta and the constitution imply that democracy is in their blood . 
  arabs are closer to romani than they are to russians or serbs ??? 
  but europe is supposed to be a place where even the right-wing is to the left of the us !, 
  how these sorts of dolts can hijack the eu/eea perplexes me . 
  a few observations : the four clearest russian allies are all far-right . 
  the only `` left-wing '' party that is unambiguously pro-russia is the people 's movement against the eu in denmark , which is a big tent and includes many centre-right voters . 
  also , only one of these parties is stridently anti-american in the `` george bush era '' sense , front national . 
  ( i disagree with them but they have an awesome name and logo ) , and maybe golden dawn and the greek communist party would also be considered to be hostile to the us ; wilders has a decent fan base among the us right-wing and secularist communities . 
  podemos at least takes inspiration from obama ( their name literally means `` yes we can '' ! ), 
  which is hilarious as pre-crisis obama would 've been considered right-wing in most of europe excepting the baltics and poland . 
  i 've acknowledged it before , but the irony of a libertarian conservative party like ukip aligning with a country that is the antithesis of libertarian conservatism ( russia ) because of their mutual hatred of brussels still gets to me . 
  i could see a compromise in which romania annexes * some * of moldova , possibly all excluding transnistria , as a deterrent to russian expansionism without antagonizing the large russophile population of moldova . 
  even just giving moldovans the choice of romanian citizenship would deter putin as there would be millions of eu/nato citizens that would have the same linguistic claims to romania that eastern ukrainians have to be part of russia . 
  wow thanks !, 
  retracting what i posted earlier . 
  would european union membership be immediate , though ? 
  it took a couple years for mayotte to accede , even though under french law it was as french as corsica . 
  would eu membership be instantaneous ? 
  france integrated mayotte a couple years ago and i do n't know if it 's fully part yet . 
   the truth about israel `` we only like them because they hate muslims and got the jews out of europe '' i 'm guessing . 
  both generally are . 
  but i 've seen dna studies that show jews as having no more middle eastern descent than greeks or greek-speaking cypriots , who are both viewed as white . 
   pro-israel this is true but most parties in western europe ( yes , even syriza ) are at least nominally pro-american . 
  the far right tends to be more pro-russia ( front national , golden dawn , ukip , pvv , pegada-endgame in thuringia , and to a more muted extent dansk folkeparti are all viewed as far-right and anti-american ) . 
  i actually propose `` anti-american nationalist '' as a euphemism for `` far-right . '', 
  only to the same extent that they cooperate with russia or the usa . 
  nothing special or norwegian about it although at times norway does appear to be a non voting member of the eu . 
  but the infamy associated with attacking a truly defenseless country would not be worth any benefits that would come from it . 
  so says someone from norway . 
  this wo n't affect you one iota . 
  but no one would ever attack a country that completely abolished its military , like costa rica . 
  nothing beyond police , and yet they 're doing fine . 
  but the liberals ( who are generally centre to centre-right ) are the fiercest advocates for it !, 
  why does germany even need a military ? 
  they 're in the same position as austria ( surrounded by peaceful , stable nato-members ) and do n't need to spend a dime . 
  if the us can do net neutrality , and the free market liberals can do net neutrality , then why ca n't the eu and the left-leaning parties do net neutrality ? 
  you have to end the us occupation before you can go about recovering territories . 
  france , the uk , and russia are looking mighty hungry [ for more land ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied-occupied_germany ) . 
  romania is the only country with `` roman '' in its name . 
  therefore , rome is romanian . 
   this is n't just american . 
  or even a capitalist value . 
  in stalinism a man 's value was purely based on how much he contributed to the state . 
  in feudalism on how much he contributed to his liege . 
  but europe was able to avoid this for most of a century , especially but not exclusively in northern europe . 
  the arrival of this christian zionist workaholic logic in crisis-free scandinavia is a tragedy and i see no evidence that any of the other sources , like feudalism or stalinism , are in play . 
  and that 's why the cruel us work ethic is not creeping into europe and why ttip is raising us standards to european ones ... oh wait ... a culturally americanized eu is not a true european government as long as humans are valued solely based on how much they contribute to the economy . 
  while empires eventually fall , the us ' influence has been so global and great that its successor will undeniably be in its image unless cuba becomes a superpower . 
  do n't forget the us ' # 1 bitch , israel . 
  the only rational reason to support russia is to balance the us . 
  neither china nor europe are willing to step up as great powers . 
  and if you believe those polls , only a single digit percent of europeans , excepting greeks , see the us as an enemy or threat . 
  yay brainwashing !, 
  sheeple, 
  i 'd argue that they are equally bad , but only the us has the capacity to make economic war on anyone who does differently .
