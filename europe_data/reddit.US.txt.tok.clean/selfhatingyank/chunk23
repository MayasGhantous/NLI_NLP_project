  in 2015 , what is the status of devolution ? 
  will it * actually happen * ? 
  and if not , will there be any consequences ? 
  in a number of european countries , the major far-right party is economically to the left of the old-guard mainstream parties ( both left and right ) . 
  these include : denmark ( df ) finland ( finns ) france ( front national ) as the more classic examples . 
  how likely would it be for the far-left and far-right to team up on a pledge to defend european/nordic social democracy whatever the cost , withdraw from the global / `` us-dominated '' order , and crack down on religious muslim immigration ? 
  would it work in terms of stopping the suffering and the fraying of the social safety net ? 
  i know this is a very pro-eu subreddit historically , but i am wondering to what extent the eu and eurozone caused the ongoing austerity/depression and significant cutbacks in welfare states throughout the continent , in canada , in australia , and in japan ( among others ) . 
  pre-2010 , these sorts of crises with imf-directed `` structural adjustment '' ( i.e. 
  privatization and adopting the worst aspects of us kleptocrat capitalism ) were largely thought to be the province of the developing world , with europe and co. largely thought to have found the perfect form of capitalism . 
  however , the euro-crisis has provided a huge excuse for politicians both in crisis-free nordic countries as well as in countries outside europe to renegotiate a 20 + year old social contract . 
  my question is , did the common currency and strict deficit rules of the eu unleash this pandora 's box or was it simply a product of global capitalism ? 
  this might be a leftist american pipe dream , but with the current greek government i 'm having fantasies about a left-right anti-neoliberal coalition emerging in the nordic countries in particular , although france could pull it off too . 
  denmark , sweden , and finland all have `` far-right '' parties that are to the left of the mainstream on economic issues , and in all three the old guard parties are either in coalition with one another or are essentially identical ( in denmark , the nominal social democrat `` gucci '' helle has presided over an explosion of homelessness , crony deals with goldman sachs , teachers ' union busting , near-american levels of wealth inequality , tax evasion , and a broken housing market that has created calls to cut off government funding to rural islands while copenhagen grows more expensive - she has led the most capitalistic government in denmark 's recent history ) nordic countries have also been enthusiastic supporters of ttip and sanctions against russia . 
  after the recent terror in copenhagen , what are the chances of the far left and right uniting to reverse any changes to the social system that has been the nordic identity for decades while cracking down on religious zealots ? 
  there is a common slogan among the far-right that goes : africa for the africans asia for the asians europe for the europeans ( it is generally phrased as `` white countries for everyone , '' but that is something they 're condemning not endorsing . ), 
  you know i have a perverse fascination with the far-right and with extremists in general , so which nationalists would be willing to take that to its logical conclusion and hold hands with anti-colonialist anti-western nationalists in africa and asia ? 
  what are some of the more subtle differences that you 've noticed when travelling outside europe ? 
  in my case , i 've noticed : vehicles apparently you can legally drive four wheelers/quads on roads . 
  i 've noticed them in sweden and overseas france . 
  an acceptable use for a beach in many north sea countries is ... a motocross race . 
  fiat cars are ugly , at least the models they make for the eu market like the panda . 
  excellent rail transit does not mean fewer buses . 
  cities communist housing blocks can be found in western europe as well . 
  i noticed more heading from the paris airport than from prague . 
  although attendance is lower , churches look nicer than in the usa . 
  many buildings in urban cores have tons of advertising on them . 
  midroc in sweden is a particular offender . 
  broken english is commonly used on signs and in ads ; a non-english speaker in the nordic countries needs to have at least some understanding of english . 
  what are some other little differences that you 've noticed ? 
  i generally get the impression that the former east germany is among the most `` radical '' large regions ( e.g. 
  states , provinces , and counties ) in the eu/eea region . 
  particularly , i often hear about radical anti-americanism anti-islamism marxist-leninism and neo-fascism in the east , particularly thuringia and dresden . 
  are there any other parts of the continent that are infested with such radicalism ? 
  ^ yes , i know i am the court jester of this subreddit because of the vitriolic anti-americanism that i post after a bad day at work ( most often ) . 
  `` shout out to / u/eurofutur , whose new caledonia thread got me interested in this topic . '', 
  what do you see about the potential for the eu to extend beyond continental europe ( including iceland ) ? 
  here 's my rundown : * the us . 
  * while there would definitely be hangups over the death penalty , guns , food safety , etc. 
  the big issues would be structural . 
  the us is pretty protective of its sovereignty and congress has about a snowball 's chance in hell of ever allowing a foreign body to make laws for it . 
  even more fundamentally , the us has roughly * three times * the population of germany and roughly a third of the new super eu and would have an incredibly lopsided effect on any eu lawmaking . 
  then you have the numbers ; the largest economy in a `` european '' union being located entirely in the americas ( except for a few military bases ) would be very odd , and the idea of fusing 45 % of the world 's gdp and half of its military spending into one alliance would give / r/conspiracy an aneurysm - doubly so if the us insisted on including israel . 
  before ' 08 , the political and values differences would have been a bigger barrier , but the erasure of george w. bush from the history books and the rise of ultra-neoliberal politics , as well as the dubious human rights record of full eu member hungary and the dubious economic regulation in estonia have made that look foolish . 
  you might also see some racist concerns about 30 million `` ghetto blacks '' gaining full eu citizenship , although most european politicians would n't be that blunt . 
  the political differences between [ the us and ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2004/allpolitics/09/20/schneider.world/ ) [ europe , nay the * world * ] ( http://www.iftheworldcouldvote.com/polls/results/usa-presidential-election-2008/ ) [ could always ] ( http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://blog.scope.is/.a/6a00d83451e3e669e2010535d73fbd970c-pi&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.marketingsafari.org/marketing_safari/2008/11/why-if-the-world-could-vote-matters-and-what-it-means-for-the-usa.html&amp;h=284&amp;w=729&amp;tbnid=-u2eauwf_z3g9m:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=wes_n4ujvb43zm&amp;itg=1&amp;ei=wv3yvoz3coplsatgm4gyaw&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0ccuqmygimag ) [ come up , though ] ( http://jeffreyhill.typepad.com/english/usa/page/81/ ) [ in a potential union ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/04/us-election-international-poll_n_2066972.html ) . 
  these countries would have a lot of difficulty with eu environmental regulations as they are predominantly resource-based economies with environmental protections as low , if not lower than , the us . 
  * new zealand * . 
  geographically , it 's as far from europe as it gets and if it 's included a whole bunch of westernized caribbean and latin american countries would ask why they are passed over . 
  no direct flights to europe would make it very hard to integrate . 
  plus , there 's a shit-ton of maori who do n't feel european at all and annexing nz into the eu would be a slap in their face . 
  * cape verde . 
  * still probably too poor , but is in a similar geographic situation to the azores , madeira , and the canary islands which are all accepted as european . 
  also , they speak a [ variety of romance-based creoles , derived from portuguese , that are in good company alongside portuguese , french , spanish , italian , and romanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cape_verdean_creole#dialects ) . 
  * an independent guadeloupe , martinique , r\u00e9union , guyane , or mayotte * . 
  even though none of these are on the continent of europe , from a realpolitik perspective the eu would have to offer them citizenship or they 'd rejoin france in a heartbeat . 
  * an independent bermuda , cayman islands , aruba , curacao , french polynesia , or other overseas territory that is not a department of france * . 
  most of these territories are tax havens and may be concerned about surrendering sovereignty to brussels ; however , luxembourg does just fine . 
  also , they do not currently have full eu membership so it would n't be clear that something is being taken away from them . 
  * anglo-caribbean islands , the seychelles , and mauritius * . 
  these are among the most culturally european places outside of europe and barbados at least is considered a developed country by the un human development index . 
  they would probably demand membership if any of the others received an offer , or else the eu would look racist . 
  inspired by the us one , i 'd like to see how many of you would be interested in moving to the most radically different area within europe ( including the overseas parts of france ) . 
  how would a german like mayotte ? 
  how would a finn like madeira ? 
  how would a russian like sicily or tahiti ? 
  that 's what i 'm after . 
  http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21595437-america-no-less-socially-mobile-it-was-generation-ago-mobility-measured http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/rick-santorum-is-right-about-europe/2011/10/12/giqauiebfl_blog.html unfortunately , most european politicians are convinced that their countries are staring down an imminent crisis and are blind to their own countries ' success . 
  i never thought i 'd say europe needs a santorum but sadly american republicans are often more optimistic about european social democracy . 
  inspired by the similar thread for one 's own country ( that ran into flair issues ) , let 's see how well you can find guessable pictures of european countries * other than those in your flair . 
  * i 'll start : [ where in europe is this ? 
  ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/64400000/jpg/_64400760_64400755.jpg ), 
  thinking of some of the great european cities : pont neuf piazza navona l'eixample piazza san marco andrassy ut but ... [ red square ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/plaza_roja ) [ castle square , warsaw ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/pia%c8%9ba_castelului_din_var%c8%99ovia ) [ charles bridge , prague ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/pont_charles ), 
  i know there is a fragile government in sweden ; will this budget survive ? 
  if so , will it lead to a social-democratic renaissance in europe ? 
  i remember during 2000-2008 that the european left in particular was harshly critical of the us , but that seems to have dried up . 
  washington 's strongest critics in the west are almost uniformly center-to-far-right ( e.g. 
  front national , pegada/endgame/ndp , and chrysi avgi are among those that come to mind ) . 
  meanwhile , even * tsipras * [ looks up to the us and to obama 's vision . 
  ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/01/25-tsipras-washington-antholis-lombardi ) what happened ? 
  if the us is so economically right-wing , should n't the strongest criticism come from the * left * ? 
  it 's at once relieving and puzzling . 
  we had a post yesterday that was similar , but it disproportionately highlighted the * famous * small towns like halstatt , etc. 
  what are some that people outside your country do n't know ? 
  [ here 's one for the us . 
  ] ( http://www.cedarkeybedandbreakfast.com/uploads/1/3/0/2/13027056/9771394_orig.jpg ) and a few that i 've found either in person or on mapcrunch/geoguessr : m\u00f8gelt\u00f8nder , [ denmark ] ( http://moegeltoender.infoland.dk/wp-content/uploads/mg_9289-s%c3%b8nderby.jpg ) rudb\u00f8l , [ denmark ] ( http://cdn1.vtourist.com/19/2811022-nice_little_village_rudboel.jpg ) pals , [ spain ] ( https://expatalmanac.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/862.jpg ) ( dunno if this is obscure or not ) trasacco , [ italy ] ( https://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/1395785.jpg ), 
  inspired by [ this ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35l5cd/quick_question_for_reurope_who_are_the_people_at/ ) post , who are the most extreme left-wing groups in your country ? 
  in the us , it 's diverse : - some student organizations . 
  brown and amherst are particularly infamous for provocative left-wing organizations , exemplified by the brown rotc controversy in which the ivy league institution banned the rotc for not allowing openly gay servicemembers ; when congress reversed course , brown students doubled down , accusing the us military of [ the art of killing and torturing . 
  ] ( http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/02/05/makhlouf-16-rotc-return-criminals-2/ ) some sectors of the san francisco and berkeley left . 
  ] ( http://zombietime.com/ ) [ anarchist bombers . 
  ] ( http://www.salon.com/2012/12/06/4_anarchists_sentenced_in_cleveland_bridge_bomb_plot/ ) [ `` black panthers '' . 
  they have been denounced by real-life black panthers for their anti-white racism and are banned from canada ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_black_panther_party#criticism_by_former_members_of_the_original_black_panther_party ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands at least in english , holland is considered incorrect to refer to the whole country , although the native dutch-speakers i know ( one flemish , one from maastricht , and one from gelderland ) refer to it as such , as do some dutch-language media like `` ik hou van holland '' . 
  how do you refer to this eurozone member in your country/language ? 
  at least between northern europe , germany , southern europe and the us it seems hard . 
  the circle-jerk answer would be to say that everyone in * northern europe * would be considered 1 % ers in the us because of their guaranteed standard of living ( only the ultra-high-net-worth have the peace of mind of a poor norwegian or danish citizen ) , but i doubt that that is still true anywhere with the past 15 + years of centre-right governance . 
  plus , denmark , [ norway ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-13/nordic-crisis-waiting-to-happen-puzzles-krugman-assessing-debts ) , sweden , and [ switzerland ] ( http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/mortgage-market_homeowners-sitting-on-a-mountain-of-debt/34957624 ) are all leveraged to their eyeballs even when you account for their incomes . 
  while * southern europe * does n't have as much gdp per capita as northern europe , it generally has more homeownership and often higher life expectancies ( poor portugal being the exception ) . 
  * germany * seems to be the only country in europe where pretty much everyone has a decent life * and * relatively low household debt ( aside from finland , which is in recession ) .
