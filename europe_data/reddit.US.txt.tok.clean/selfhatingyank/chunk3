  if you 're willing to put nation above superstition , then i have a lot more respect than i do for most of the muslim immigrants . 
  you need to send [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti-kjvzin9w ) over . 
  one play of this song turned me , an american who 's never been east of prague , into a card-carrying ataka member . 
  we could 've just pulled a kosovo and not worried about un approval . 
  putin would never risk a nuclear war over syria . 
  how is that not racist ? '', 
  only europeans can legally be refugees . '', 
  it 's 2015 already !, 
  how is that legal ? 
  i know turks can be condescending towards arabs , but imagine if a western country said that only europeans can be refugees . 
  hence the hot potato situation as no one except germany , lebanon , and jordan is willing to take in refugees from some of the worst monsters of our lifetime ( qaeda , assad , and isis ) . 
  and it explains why asylum seekers are already moving on to finland . 
  no one likes modern muslims , not even other muslims . 
  the best way to explain it to a european is to think of the premium that is placed on having an american english slogan , speaking english , naming your business or neighborhood brooklyn or [ beverly hills ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/selfoss,+iceland/@63.9261499,-20.999908,3a,75y,174.33h,90.82t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1son8_1denf-sx-7jh-zr55q!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3don8_1denf-sx-7jh-zr55q%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d88.443741%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x48d65fcb879909cb:0x5c9977c988b43f11!6m1!1e1 ) , singing in a flawless american accent , etc. 
  the prestige associated with anglo-american culture in europe is the same as the prestige associated with western goods in developing countries . 
  no prob . 
  yes . 
  i most definitely did not write up an entire anti-american rant just to put in a black-comedy paedophile joke at the end . 
  that would just be too funny to happen naturally . 
  trolling of that sort is n't illegal in most european countries , right ? 
  i do n't want to have to wipe my hard drive and lose my stash of level 5 child porn . 
  / s on the last sentence . 
  if i could take the rest of the us with me , i 'd consider it . 
  again , all of these are just musings . 
  i myself am tiring of all the / r/politics leaking , though , and harmless memes , etc. 
  being turned into debates about tony abbott , immigration , and healthcare systems , things most americans and western europeans never really experience . 
  when did you last get personally affected by asylum seekers ? 
  life goes on , regardless of memes . 
  i 'm just trying to call out the twats on / r/news , / r/worldnews , etc. 
  who try to shit on my harmless memes . 
  i am actually tempted to vote republican just as a middle finger to them . 
   exactly . 
  open borders only works in a fully free market state . 
  economically . 
  politically at least this is even more untenable if you have the high inequality and scarcity of good jobs common in a full free-market state . 
  in us red states , every immigrant ( legal or illegal ) is seen as competition for workers who can barely make ends meet . 
  we tell it in the us , only it 's the rich , the middle class , and the poor instead of a banker , a european , and a migrant . 
  ah , some austerity humour !, 
   `` peter pls spell papa '' peter : `` papa '' director : `` very good you passed . 
  director : perfect you have passed , jos\u00e9 pls spell xenophobia . '', 
  american english translation . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're being serious . 
  this is n't / r/polandball . 
   benefit shopping i do n't think eu citizens are allowed to do that anymore . 
  they closed the loophole i think . 
   majority conservative government with ukip as the official opposition , most likely . 
  too expensive i guess . 
  colonies are generally a drain on national economies . 
  whoa ... a swede thinks this guy is out to lunch . 
  he must be pretty darn left then . 
  even scandinavia does n't want this guy , i think . 
  as far as i can tell he is n't even jewish . 
  why israel of all places ? 
  are there fertility differences among the ethnic groups ( magyar , rom\u00e2ni , and rromani/gypsy for instance ) ? 
  thanks for adding some nuance !!, 
  if i had gold , i 'd gild you . 
  simplification , but both blocs are pretty unpopular from what i 've heard . 
  denmark is basically [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/62/3d/eb/623deb87841808926ab50f525b2d0178.jpg ) right now . 
  the two `` super-parties '' ( red bloc and blue bloc ) are both rather unpopular and both have americophile neoliberals with a penchant for the finer things in life ( gucci helle and luxury lars ) as their leaders . 
  and poles . 
  you forgot poland . 
  time for us whites to go back and reclaim our homeland , which is iraq . 
  instead of zionism , let 's call it assyrianism . 
  we have no rights to germany , sweden , italy , or france ; all those are rightful baltic clay . 
  we 're all fucking arabs at the end of the day . 
  it 's just that some of us chose civilization while others chose superstition . 
  take it as you wish . 
  willing to sponsor me for a visa ? 
  do n't want to go the burn your passport and pretend you 're from syria route . 
  i hope so . 
  you need to get more cocky , though , because global geopolitics is ruthless . 
  maybe consider not recognizing the usa if the republicans continue attempting to sabotage a climate change containment plan . 
  some days i 'd gladly kill myself if i could take all 310m americans with me . 
  at least admit you 're superior on everything except maybe music and housing bubbles . 
  as long as international greed exists , the nordic countries can not be truly sovereign unless they pull a bhutan and try to hide from the global economies . 
  rip nordic model . 
   seriously , if germany wants to impose it 's politics on us , why ca n't we vote in german election ? 
  do you say the same thing when the us or russia use their leverage to bully `` sovereign '' european states ? 
  to the elite , nation-states are an obsolete construct . 
  stop buying oil and you 'll see how little separates saudi arabia from a clusterfuck like 2010-era somalia ... 
  and in mexico , the same dish will likely be called `` chilaquiles . '', 
  nachos are the gross gringo things that you only find along the border . 
  he definitely borders on the anti-american far-right territory of le pen et al but also is reminiscent of bernie sanders . 
  has he openly dabbled in any conspiracy theories ? 
  because if he has then i would n't hesitant to call him `` far-right '' by european standards , which paradoxically is often the far-left + kooky theories + nationalism + fear of immigrants , americans , and elites . 
  crazy europe when the left-wing is viewed as `` regressive '' and old-fashioned . 
  meanwhile the young in the us long for someone like a corbyn . 
  where am i saying anything about arab migrants ? 
  just because it has the `` m-word '' in the title does n't mean that i 'm drawing any sort of a parallel . 
  i 'm just emphasizing the transnational nature of the bratislava region . 
  * rolls eyes *, 
  did you read the article ? 
  below a certain level , poverty means people ca n't afford to leave . 
  but he 'll keep the muslim hordes out !, 
  except for the part about conflating upwardly mobile africans and asians looking to make a quick buck with legit refugees who are fleeing syria at gunpoint ... 
  this quadrupling would likely have such negative effects on african gdp per capita that it would keep migrants out . 
  as an american , i do n't know where to put pis . 
  they seem like a christian fundamentalist version of front national ... they 'd almost be considered right-wing in the us if they were n't so economically interventionist . 
  is it really that confusing that two europeans ca n't agree on something as basic as whether citizens of one country can just move to another . 
  ok deleted .
