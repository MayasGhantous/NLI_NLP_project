  there should be signs within 10 km that say `` you 're in the eu now and are under eu laws . 
  if you attempt to move to another eu country , you get kicked back to greece , italy , or bulgaria . '', 
  i do n't know why anyone thinks you 're a bigot just because you 're australian . 
  the problem with the australian plan is that all the countries refugees can go to * instead * of australia do n't want poor refugees either . 
  it 's not like turkey , egypt , and morocco are falling over each other to accept truckloads of syrians , just as it 's not like bangladesh and thailand are doing any favors for burmese refugees . 
  what the eu and australia need to do is to help poor but stable countries like serbia , algeria , bulgaria , and bangladesh handle refugees instead of turning a blind eye as country after country gives them the cold shoulder until they 're literally drowning in european waters . 
  moldova is going to be fun !, 
  and some broken pairs . 
  in googling ( hence the edit ) i found that the finnish word f or estonia it 's ... viro . 
  in pretty much every other language it 's est-something . 
  in spanish , they would be urruticoechea aguirregomezcorta aguirrezabalaga, 
  til there are at least three grammatically correct polish sentences that do n't have a `` z '' in them . 
  do n't speak either language , but i think the ed : finnish word for government is the estonian word for mold . 
  what do you mean ? 
  there are three of them : one above canada and two merged into the north pole . 
  why is the us the only place that has borders ? 
  i doubt that oklahoma is more consequential on the world stage than spain is , but basically everywhere outside the us seems to be part of one world government while the us ( east of the rockies ) is split into dozens of micronations . 
  a few observations : dat commonwealth . 
  lithuania 's state religion is rastafarianism . 
  denmark and sweden are in a personal union . 
  denmark , sweden , and norway 's crosses all have gone on a diet . 
  norway and `` england '' ( which has annexed scotland , wales , and northern ireland ) are now baltic countries thanks to their current right-wing [ governments ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2013/04/15/the-triumph-of-good-economics-austere-baltic-states-outgrow-their-european-neighbors/ ) . 
  [ cameron ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/world/europe/britain-elections-cameron-austerity.html?_r=0 ) and [ solberg ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/09/13/conservatives-if-want-to-win-look-at-how-erna-solberg-norway-iron-lady-did-it.html ) are happy . 
  i was making fun of the guy you quoted , not you . 
  i 'll see you one norway and raise you one norway , two swedens , a china , a mexico , an egypt , and a peru . 
  [ maine ] ( http://www.mainethingstodo.com/mttd/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mainesign.jpg ), 
  um ... `` liberal '' in europe = / = `` liberal '' in the us . 
  you mean more like `` progressive '' ; `` liberal '' is a right-wing term in europe that means free market , like estonia . 
  jeb bush would be considered an `` extreme liberal '' in many countries . 
  i 'm concerned that it seems to be ( by non-us standards , except maybe estonia ) a huge giveaway to the free-market right . 
  i 'd imagine that ttip would likely ever prevent a social-democratic and/or nationalist awakening in the us based on what has leaked and based on the increasingly partisan , ideological nature of other multilateral treaties . 
  the wto ( for instance ) has gone from mutual tariff reductions to openly promoting center-right ideology as the gatt treaties have been replaced with the [ uruguay and doha rounds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_trade_organization#uruguay_round ) , and what has leaked of the sister tpp has been very sinister and orwellian . 
  tl ; dr : the ttip would make bernie sanders an outlaw . 
  but if the us did n't do all those things , china would n't be able to criticize the west nearly like it does . 
  do you really think china would stand a chance in the human rights deathmatch against the rest of the developed world * minus * the us ? 
  also , how many european citizens have been held in gulags in the past 10 years vs. in gitmo ? 
  how many european politicians are beholden to beijing and shenzhen vs. washington and wall street ? 
  from a european perspective , china 's human rights issues are largely internal and/or neighbor disputes , while the us messes with ev-ery-one . 
  but the sgp runs in coalition with the pretty social democratic christian union . 
  poland seems pretty close to the usa , although maybe a bit less sadistic . 
  maybe the tidehverv wing in df ? 
  and repubs are either df , kf , or liberal alliance ... 
  the latter would really piss them off to find that american republicans are considered * extreme liberals * in europe . 
  too far left . . or too far right because ` murica ? 
  if the former , you forgot about [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_left_alliance ) guys . 
  the circlejerk answer would 've been sanders : the right wing of cdu/csu clinton ; slightly to the right of ndp most of europe seems to have moved right a bit these past few years . 
  i 'd say a part of the problem is that governments in europe in general are facing somewhat of a crisis of legitimacy . 
  while a disgruntled white european is several times more likely to join a far right party or street protest ( like pegida ) than to convert to radical islam , most of those outlets are not open to muslims . 
  isis is basically front national in a turban . 
   a lot of places are sort of `` out of bounds '' this year . 
  daesh ? 
  or bad economy ? 
  hey , at least yurop gets credit for selling off its healthcare and social safety net ... so the working class are the slaves and the gypsies are the natives . 
  which came first though ? 
  if the us were annexed by germany or canada tomorrow and all americans had some income and health security , had sensible gun laws , and had peaceful police , gang membership and violence would plummet within hours , as would the constant fear of losing everything . 
  gangs reflect a failure of society to guarantee security . 
  if you get rid of at will employment too , people will be less scared and les likely to turn to criminal syndicates, 
  a german company that makes a fortune exploiting americans . 
  if the us were to adopt single payer with centrally negotiated drug prices , bayer would have to squeeze europe and canada to keep its margins the same . 
  there are reasons bayer ag spends half its lobbying on insane anti-obama right wingers even though its execs all enjoy the german and swiss social democracy . 
   on some issues i am talking about [ incarceration rate ] ( http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52e24ad76bb3f7fa7f0fd548-1200-/smklibm.png ) and [ paid leave ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b71xxu8iuain-nm.jpg ) . 
  the us is the only country on earth where it is hypothetically legal for an employer to demand a 24/7 work schedule . 
  not everywhere is western europe . 
  most europeans do n't realize that the us is so much worse than their countries and so let their leaders sign all sorts of oligarch treaties . 
  not necessarily . 
  there are some things the us does that the vast majority of other countries with checkered human rights records do n't , and the fact that the country that inspired lafayette , fathered de valera and churchill , and axcounts for so much of europe 's pop culture is in some respects the world 's # 1 human rights violator is disgusting . 
  i 'm sure you remember the time when saudi arabia , unprovoked , invaded ed : iraq and sparked a nasty civil war that killed up to a million people while rejecting diplomacy . 
  or when china launched drone strikes on allies and enemies alike without consent or any sort of pushback . 
  or when we learned that merkel was so in bed with putin that she likely sold out her citizens to the fsb , which operates black sites in the baltics . 
  or the numerous european and canadian citizens who have been held without trial in iranian gulags in cuba . 
  just kidding , these are all us actions . 
  to be blunt , my guess is that the us can fuck up the eu much more than vice versa . 
  `` criticize our human rights record ? 
  `` whining about spying ? 
  how about we release merkel 's calls to bild ? '', 
  `` you say we need to stop healthcare lobbying ? 
  well in that case bayer will no longer be selling new drugs in france because the prices are too low . '', 
  it 's all a leverage game . 
  stop the espionage and stop pushing treaties that are detrimental to 90 % of europeans . 
  clean up the sleaze , send the lobbyists on a mandatory team-building exercise in donetsk , and resist foreign forms of capitalism , censorship , and surveillance . 
  it 's either the usa or mother russia for you , and mother russia is beholden to the same forces ( washington consensus ), 
  and the nsa and ttip are intent on turning europe into ferguson . 
  on some issues ( incarceration and working conditions ) the us sinks below the worst of the developing countries . 
  kind of hilarious seeing the us lecture china about its gulags and to see that china closes theirs first . 
  the infamy score of the us must be through the roof as almost everyone has a valid casus belli against them . 
  never underestimate big data . 
  a wave of cross-national comparisons on median wealth , income mobility , police shootings and beatings , paid leave , and incarceration rates ( all of which are intertwined ) have led even republicans to question some aspects of the us system . 
  all we need is for the boot-lickers in brussels to wise up ... 
  i do n't love putin , but saying that he is going to turn russia into best korea is a bit of a reach . 
   do blacks in africa frighten you too ? 
  actually , yes . 
  [ zambia ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/11/02/obama-is-to-america-what-scott-is-to-zambia/ ) had a white president for a few months last year and everyone compared him to obama . 
  0 % should really be '' < 1 % '' . 
  i 'm sure some dutch and italians speak russian . 
  the eu is as crooked , if not more so , as the usa congress , which is why it 's been such a disaster for europe . 
  it needs to be rebuilt * without * all the lobbyists as for now it 's a one-stop shop for american and other foreign countries looking to remake europe for their own short-term profit . 
  sweden 's obsession with american culture is reaching new heights ... 
  they should try it in wales . 
  they have the doctor on call for cases involving parallel universes and time lords . 
  the judge should award him one trillion euros for the defamation ... in a parallel universe .
