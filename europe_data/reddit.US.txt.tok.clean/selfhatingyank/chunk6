  basically , western europe can free ride . 
  the only western countries that have land borders to invade are norway , finland , and greece , and even though finland is not technically in nato its eu membership means that the us , france , uk , poland , and germany would never let it be invaded . 
  all the other non-post-communist countries are inside the iron curtain of hardcore nato members and , regardless of whether they 're actually in nato ( see austria , switzerland , and sweden ) are all effectively protected . 
  i 'm assuming that poland is still guaranteed by the usa . 
  as long as the eastern flank of europe is in nato , western europe will never be invaded by russia . 
   `` germany will fight to the last american '' it 's [ england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_slogans ) , not germany . 
  also , who cares about all those countries in the middle as russia will have to fight through the baltics , poland , and romania to get to the good part of europe ( unless they do the austro-hungarian route ), 
  north korea + latvia . 
  similar love for weaponry , incarceration , and misery as long as someone else is worse off . 
  also , brussels because of the lobbyists . 
  take a number . 
  canada , the uk , australia , sweden , puerto rico , and the philippines all got there first . 
  yes . 
  in danish tradition the flag literally fell from heaven during a battle , being divinely revealed almost as much as the bible . 
  denmark is pretty secular now bybut there seare still lots of stsuperstitions around the dannebrog . 
  ______ mina _____ would be the estonian version . 
  amazing how most of the indo-european and uralic ones make sense ( `` me '' / `` i '' ) and then you get ... un\u00eb in albania . 
  unfortunate that rioting was involved , but there are [ legitimate grievances ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/26/scandinavia-far-right-stolen-left-ground-welfare ) throughout the nordics that the mainstream parties are ignoring . 
  not just immigration , but welfare , education , business , language , and national security are being completely overhauled without the consent of the governed and the mainstream parties ( both in a pro-immigration society like sweden and in a strongly anti-immigrant country like denmark ) are more beholden to brussels , wall street , and washington than they are to their constituents . 
  until the mainstream rejects the bankers and spies and supports sovereignty and social democracy ( nordic values ) , the outsider parties ( finns , sd , enhedslisten , etc ) will grow and grow . 
   everything fragments this is kind of the way europe is going . 
  the major cities are very pro-business , relatively anglophone ( on the continent , especially in scandinavia ) , and generally american-oriented , while the second tier and rural areas are more `` resistant '' .

  not nearly as much as under katainen and stubb . 
  the banksters see what 's happening in the us ( bernie sanders openly wants to turn the us into a nordic social democracy and donald trump has supported single-payer in the past , and both support strict immigration restrictions ) and realize that between immigration , crisis to the south , and russia to the east that now is their best time to make a move against the nordic countries . 
  and the financiers see what 's happening in the us ( bernie sanders openly wants to turn the us into a nordic social democracy and donald trump has supported single-payer in the past , and both support strict immigration restrictions ) and realize that between immigration , crisis to the south , and russia to the east that they have the nordics over a barrel . 
  you mean the sdp ? 
  they were part of the disastrous five party coalition , right ? 
  allowed the national coalition to run rampant and cut , cut , cut . 
  being in a recession with double-digit * unemployment is , though . 
  i get the impression consistency is n't a strong suit of politicians in general . 
  dfhasadalternately supported sanctions against russia and blamed the eu for antagonizing putin , for starters . 
  i do n't have the link handy but the parliamentarian who suggested it mentioned `` 51st state '' in the proposal . 
  it 's more anti-americanization than anti-us . 
  see the `` english tax '' proposal . 
  they are fine with americans if they stay out of denmark . 
  counterpoint : finland has one of the lowest immigrant proportions in rich europe and its welfare state and economy are the most fragile . 
  japan also has almost no immigrants and a mass of over-worked , underemployed people . 
  methinks the global financial system as a whole is a house of cards . 
  that 's the one exception . 
  finns , sd , and df are all front national style chavistas . 
  bizarre ... are n't senior citizens , especially those in the rural and secondary urban areas , their strongest demographic ? 
  their campaign literature seems to be one giant smear on urban , english-speaking , `` creative class '' youth who want to turn denmark into a ed : muslim , culturally american country with danish as a secondary language . 
  greece needs to leave the euro . 
  the next few years will be painful regardless but in the long run greece will be better off . 
  they are parties like the sweden democrats . 
  they are deemed `` right wing '' or even far right because of their nationalism , opposition to immigration , frequent use of conspiracy theories and pro-russia/anti-american rhetoric , and often racist/fascist roots regardless of their current position . 
  bernie sanders ( pro-nordic welfare state , anti-free trade , anti-globalization ) would perversely be considered the far-right candidate in much of europe compared to the center right of hillary and jeb . 
  they also mention denmark as being divided between the pro-business , largely english-speaking , somewhat americanized big cities and the poorer rural areas . 
  this urban-rural , traditional-globalised divide was palpable when i visited sweden and denmark in early 2012 , before this current wave of neoliberalism . 
  definitely a fascinating cultural process ; i wish i knew how to preserve the nordic model but sadly i do n't . 
  fuck the english language . 
  whoever thought it would be a good idea two have two things named `` economic mobility '' can diaf . 
  in the us it depends on insurance but it might still be cheaper to fly to spain , get the procedure , have some wine , tour the prado , and fly back . 
  guys , i think i just solved the euro crisis : medical tourism !, 
  and is this before or after insurance ? 
   an example , in portugal if you need to visit an hospital urgency in a public hospital and you are from outside the eu you pay say 150 euros or something . 
  so the european `` uninsured '' price is less than the insured price in the us ? 
  you can see why all the lobbyists are descending on brussels ; like sharks , they see ~ ~ blood ~ ~ opportunity to raise prices . 
   `` north american '' which generally means canadian . 
  most of the times they 'll just refer to one of us as an american . 
  do n't know who ( aside from butthurt americans ) is downvoting you . 
  although admittedly the mobility numbers in the us are skewed by an african american underclass that most european immigrants ( white , black , or brown ) would n't really be competing against . 
   not allowed to work i see sweden is using the south park business model ... 1 ) ban asylum seekers from working 2 ) blame asylum seekers for not working 3 ) ???

  yes, 
  the problem is people like / u/eastindiacomp do n't understand the real motives behind immigration . 
  `` cultural enrichment '' is only a part of it ... the real problem is that many european economies are a pyramid scheme that relies on an ever-growing population and ever-shrinking social solidarity/welfare programs in order to remain solvent . 
  even immigrants who do n't work are beneficial as they increase strain on the welfare state , making it more profitable for megacorps , and ( allegedly ) harvest immigrant children as cheap labo ( u ) r and [ ( really allegedly ) kidnap them , gypsy-style , to increase the white majority 's genetic diversity . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3038084/norway-taking-foreign-children-away-parents-highest-rates-inbreeding-world-country-forced-deny-claims-lithuanian-child-taken-care.html ) copypasta-ing something i wrote in / r/futurewhatif :  there are two possible routes that a shrinking country could take , both of which are flawed . 
   1 ) accept immigration to fill the gap . 
  this will likely cause cultural friction and , in a welfare state , could lead to many of the immigrants complacently living off welfare . 
  a non-welfare state could be worse as native populations face direct competition for decent jobs with a minimal safety net and impoverished immigrants turn to crime to make ends meet . 
   2 ) do not accept immigration and attempt to decline with dignity . 
  this is almost as flawed , if not more so , for two reasons . 
  one , a declining population is skewed towards the elderly ( medically fragile and often retired ) , which in the long run burdens the younger generations . 
  two , in order to keep nominal gdp increasing and to keep banks solvent , the missing people need to be made up for either by higher inflation ( bad for consumers ) and-or sharp increases in per capita productivity ( which are difficult to sustain in an aging society ) . 
  short of periodically culling elders , these problems can be quite bad in the long run , leading for instance to a lost generation of overworked , underemployed japanese . 
   greater mobility like in the us not true . 
  only [ britain ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/imagevault/images/storage_edited/filename_pbtpgi4b5xz3ykgxgsqe.jpg/id_6167/imagevaulthandler.aspx ) is worse . 
  maybe there are some industries where you 'll do better in the us but the backwardness of the people and the cruelty of the political system means you need ~ $ 80k/yr in order to get the lifestyle of a mcdonald 's worker in france or italy , much less germany or scandinavia . 
  plus , it 's wicked hard to get in compared to canada or australia . 
  if there is a `` unity '' gay pride march against political divisions , that will be really a shame .
