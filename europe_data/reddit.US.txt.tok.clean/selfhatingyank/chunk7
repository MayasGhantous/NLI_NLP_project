  [ turkey 's tourist numbers are in the shitter already . 
  ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/business_already-beleaguered-tourism-sector-in-turkey-concerned-about-suruc-attack_394182.html ) #sisepuedaesh, 
  basically , turkey thinks it is futile to fight isis because they and assad are secretly cooperating ( because money and natural gas ) and assad thinks it is futile to fight isis because they and erdogan are secretly cooperating ( because kurd-hate and sunni islamism ) . 
   death cult much like imperial japan / r/badhistory is this way . 
  japanese ambitions were far more about leading asia ( and arguably all nonwhite peoples ) than about pleasing god and getting 72 ~ ~ virgins ~ ~ white grapes . 
  nope , none . 
  the usa most definitely has no plans to #nuke isis if that 's what you 're implying . 
   another policeman got shot and killed today , and one wounded . 
  riots ongoing in several cities . 
  the only thing worse than an isis caliphate is an isis caliphate that borders a country facing internal unrest . 
  those are the kind of situations that terrorists and criminals dream of . 
   i 'm not going to argue about this here , but you can research about pre-invasion cyprus , greece 's political situation , and ethnic tensions during that time . 
  [ tl ; dr a cold war clusterfuck with plenty of us meddling . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus#greek_military_coup_and_turkish_invasion ), 
   turkish army will just continue the tradition of never wanting to step outside of turkish soil . 
  the alternative , that a nato member that borders the poorest ( bulgaria ) and most fragile ( greece ) eu members will be dragged into the hornet 's nest of syria or alternately will face simultaneous kurdish and jihadist insurgencies , is too scary to fathom . 
  a three-way battle royale for diyarbakir would be a humanitarian disaster and could seriously destabilize all of turkey and spill over into the eu . 
  the difference is merely one of scale and ambition . 
  the us thinks europe , the middle east , and asia are `` its business . '', 
  most other countries stay in their continent . 
  also , the us has a lot of influence in a few really vital sectors : high finance , media , and technology . 
  most europeans want to remain social democratic and european , not peons of american capitalism . 
  most european governments have n't been doing much to preserve their country 's equality and independence . 
  i do n't know exactly how much more possible that is when elections are brokered by party heads in a closed-door meeting similar to that of ttip . 
  multiparty democracy breaks down the second party leaders and voters do n't see eye to eye . 
  it 's surprisingly easy to break a multiparty democracy regardless . 
  instead of needing to get a majority of voters or parliament behind you , you just need the support of enough party heads to get a coalition . 
  elections in germany , the netherlands , or finland are essentially brokered among the various party heads , resulting in perversions of democracy such as the nominally left-wing but extremely pro-business thorning-schmidt govt in denmark ( since ousted ) and undemocratic , unpopular grand coalitions in sweden , netherlands , and finland . 
  the fact that radical policies have spread unchecked in both two-party countries like france and australia and proportional countries like italy , greece , and denmark proves that proportional representation only works when party leaders respect the will of their voters . 
  and in today 's parade of national stereotypes ... * the german with no sense of humor . 
  i do n't consider croatia eastern europe . 
  ^ ^ eastern ^ ^ europeans ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ commit ^ ^ genocide, 
  sint maarten is french now ? 
  time to anschluss east friesland . 
  it does n't say that they actually did the bombing . 
  left-wing kurds make lots of enemies . 
  i have n't seen any reputable source say that nusra was involved . 
  the turkish gov ' t is investigating it as an isis attack . 
  i 'm channeling a bosnian nationalist . 
  they do n't want anything to do with serbs . 
  the paucity of new churches in turkey likely reflects a declining christian minority as much as it does religious hate . 
  the last two are formal written standards that almost no one speaks . 
  http://basilica.ro/the-patriarch-of-romania-at-saint-paraschevi-church-of-istanbul-33834-en.html there already is a romanian church in istanbul , along with a number of other churches and even a synagogue . 
  turkey is not saudi arabia or isisstan . 
  but that is comic book-level villainy . 
  i never thought it would leak out to the real world . 
   isis fuckkkkkkk ...  collecting toys for the children of kobane . 
  are they intentionally trying to be evil ? 
  `` what else can we do today ? 
  let 's blow up some people collecting toys for refugee children ! '', 
   greeks nope , greek alphabet . 
  bosnian muslims do n't use cyrillic ? 
  they could have just said cyrillic . 
  this is how you piss off a slav . 
  bosnian muslims and many croats hate being mistaken for serbs . 
  just googled it ...  o\u0161ve ( serbian : \u041e\u0448\u0432\u0435 ) is a village in the municipality of maglaj , bosnia and herzegovina . 
  [ 1 ]  serbian : \u041e\u0448\u0432\u0435  ** serbian ** [ and now my day is ruined . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/o%c5%a1ve ), 
  unfortunately , the west created a lot of these problems ( dysfunctional meddling in the mideast + selectively supporting islamists and dictators until it 's inconvenient + deliberately seeking unemployable migrants to erode the welfare state , especially in sweden ) . 
  queen anne ( stuart , scottish ) was born in the uk . 
  her successor was a hanover ( german ) . 
  the commonwealth * almost * counts as a legitimate english regime , except that [ cromwell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oliver_cromwell ) was a tudor and therefore a bloody welshman by descent . 
   frenchmen here 's the [ inspiration . 
  close enough . 
  if the palestinians deserve self-governance , do n't the english too ? 
  benidorm at least has 5 bland anonymous skyscrapers for every eyesore . 
  in qatar , almost every landmark building is startlingly and spectacularly ugly except for the one black-and-whitetower which is quite snazzy . 
  romans =  danes , frisians , and germans =  more danes =  frenchmen =  welsh =  scots =  more germans =  brussels . 
  tl ; dr : almost two millennia of foreign occupation . 
   but also look at dubai and shanghai . 
  dull towers , even though buildt by top class architects , they still collectively make the entire city look bad . 
  one modern city , [ qatar ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2011/3/25/1301085348571/qatar-skyline-007.jpg ) , is able to have a distinctive skyline . 
  distinctively ugly , i may add , but distinctive nevertheless . 
  i 'm asking from the perspective of / u/nycerine , who specifically asked about soviet buildings and sites from a tourism perspective . 
  latvia definitely feels like the most ` soviet ' of the three . 
  so you 're saying that countries have the right to choose their own way ... except for greece . 
  you mean turn a proud social democracy into texas ? 
  europeans are n't going to stand for that without a fight ... even comparatively modest edits to the danish social contract have allowed the boorish anti-islam , anti-english , anti-millennial , anti-german df party to rocket to second place . 
  that is the extent of the betrayal that syriza has pulled on the greek electorate . 
  not one iota !, 
  suspend austerity until greece has 2 % annual gdp growth and < 15 % unemployment . 
  because they also just so happen to be open fascists and at times neo-nazis . 
  much of their leadership is in jail , accused of violent crimes up to and including murder . 
  in terms of democracy , the canadian equivalent would be giving the ndp a mandate , having them put harper 's policies to a referendum , and then doubling down , gutting healthcare to an extent even the tories could n't pass . 
  leave the euro !, 
   nothing will be solved until those who should be jailed are jailed . 
  which will not happen until wall street is brought down . 
  do you want a golden dawn government ? 
  because that 's how you end up with a golden dawn government . 
  so this is n't music to invade turkey to ? 
  many of britain 's well-respected entertainers are [ romanichal . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanichal ), 
  there is also sacromonte , a very famous and very tourism-friendly [ * gitano * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sacromonte ) neighborhood in andalusia . 
  spanish even has a different word for eastern european roma , who are called [ z\u00edngaros ] ( http://es.thefreedictionary.com/z%c3%adngaro ) as opposed to the generally well-respected spanish gitanos . 
   not necessarily romani big deal in the uk and ireland . 
  the `` troublesome '' `` gypsies '' are as often irish travellers or new age travellers as they are ethnic roma . 
  that 's the thing about the uk . 
  the actual indian-origin british roma ( romanichal ) do n't really cause much of a problem compared to the `` white '' gypsies ( `` pikeys '' , who are ethnically irish , and new age travellers ) and the recent roma immigrants from romania and bulgaria . 
  examples : [ refusing money because of religion ] ( http://www.mercyseat.net/ssnarticle.html ) [ insurance is gambling ] ( http://www.wnd.com/2010/04/137221/ ) there is also a huge stigma associated with getting money from the government or from acknowledging that the government can help you .
