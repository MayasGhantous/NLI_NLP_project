   instead took advantage and basically flipped the government off . 
  you also have segments of the ( white and black , but especially rural white ) underclass that refuse to participate in social assistance because `` i 'm too proud to go on welfare '' or `` social security is the mark of the beast '' or `` education is socialist indoctrination ; i 'll homeschool instead ! '', 
  or `` i know that there are affordable healthcare options for me , but i 'd rather go uninsured because muh socialism ! '', 
  i do n't think you have those kinds of idiots in hrvatska . 
  that could be the most bulgarian thing i 've ever seen . 
  i do n't speak any slavic languages , so i just want to make sure there is n't some ultranationalist subtext to it .

  macedonians are serbs apparently , which explains why they 've got beef with greece . 
  you know your country is undesirable when migrants would rather * leave the eu * , risk detection , and cross through macedonia and serbia rather than stay in greece . 
  howdy y' all . 
  ( fiddles on banjo ), 
  same * language * , maybe , but same dialect ? 
  that 's a stretch . 
  when * the us * is supporting these `` radical leftists '' , that shows just how far right off the deep end the mainstream in europe has gone . 
   magically depreciate still unlikely even if greece had grexited four years ago . 
  plenty of countries with floating currencies have had financial crises . 
  plus , a lot of their debts would still be denominated in euros while their assets would be in drachmas . 
  the problem is that greece ( and to some extent iceland ) still have liabilities ( mortgages , auto loans , investments , etc ) that are sized for the economic bubble . 
  the reason greece ca n't just `` be as poor as romania '' is that romania has romania-sized debts while greece still has 25 % higher debt than it should for a gdp of its size . 
  finland , sweden , and austria are all eu members and are closely aligned with the us on many if not most geopolitical issues , particularly russia . 
  switzerland is also very close with the us ( see the fifa extradition as one example ) and the developed parts of the former yugoslavia , slovenia and croatia , are also in nato and eu . 
  i 'm excluding hungary because orban is very pro-russia . 
  if you think the us is closer to hungary than it is to sweden , i 'd be surprised . 
  like it or not , if you want to do well in this world [ you have to be friendly with the usa . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) the most developed countries that are * not * close yank allies ( `` puppets '' if you 're off your meds ) are cuba and hungary . 
  congrats on becoming a banana ~ ~ republic ~ ~ constitutional monarchy now !, 
  the us welcomes you to the club . 
  vote no !, 
  the euro is a failed project and there would be no euro crisis without it . 
  would it still be like this without the usa ? 
  i see how much my country messes with other people 's cultures , denying its own citizens healthcare while attempting to sabotage countries that do , and i wonder how much of the global crisis is american exceptionalism and how much of it is the natural order of things . 
   taking our medicine literally . 
  they are even coming after the nhs and the likes of it . 
  hell , they 're even coming after the nordic countries now . 
  bloody vermin scum . 
  cutting benefits , [ proclaiming the end of the welfare state ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-king-willemalexander-declares-the-end-of-the-welfare-state-8822421.html ) , and ttip/tisa come to mind off the top of my head . 
  there is no reason that countries like yours should be cutting their spending . 
  ( i 'm assuming dutch because you single it out ), 
   it is so much easier to sit in your cozy kitchen and hate the lazy greeks . 
  meanwhile , if you 're finnish or danish or dutch , your government is manufacturing a crisis for you . 
  [ shameful !, 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/opinion/paul-krugman-europes-many-disasters.html?_r=0 ) there is nothing that greece , denmark , finland , eire , the uk , and spain share in common besides the fact that they are rich , developed , and politically socialistic ( by usa standards ) , and there is no reason that they should be all taking the same approach . 
  it is unfortunate seeing how unsympathetic northern europeans are [ when the same is happening to their own countries to `` prevent them from becoming greece . 
  '' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/opinion/paul-krugman-europes-many-disasters.html?_r=0 ) at the same time , everyone is afraid of winding down the euro/eu and recognizing that europe 's defenses against crony lobbyists were n't strong enough to prevent brussels from becoming anything other than a den of corporate greed . 
  the distance from europe , combined with the lack of old ethnic hatreds and an actual awareness of the failings of radical capitalism , have allowed americans to be far more sympathetic than europeans . 
  would you accuse me of being sarcastic if it was n't for my username ? 
  also , there are at least two other americans volunteering at his soup kitchen :  american volunteers at sirinides ' kitchen said the world needs to be reminded of the human face of this crisis . 
   `` the government has n't been perfect , '' said natalie black , 23 , from arizona . 
  `` but that does n't disqualify [ greeks ] from deserving a fulfilling and successful life , just like everyone in america is always hoping and vying for . '', 
   `` we never would have thought that coming here we would be doing it this way , '' said leyla tulloch , 21 , from hawaii . 
  `` but whatever they need , we are here for them . '', 
  sounds like the good old bank of mattress is going to regain its market share . 
  the passed [ gatt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_agreement_on_tariffs_and_trade ) rounds are fairly innocuous . 
  most only involve tariffs , but they progressively become more openly right-wing ( neoliberal/free-market , not nationalist ) and farther reaching . 
  the current doha round will incorporate  tariffs , non-tariff measures , agriculture , labor standards , environment , competition , investment , transparency , patents etc. 
  being the farthest-reaching and potentially a huge giveaway to the americanizing right . 
  tisa is basically a mini-doha that is an attempt to short-circuit ongoing gridlock among the world 's nations . 
  there are a few in northern europe , [ although they are n't parties that people admit to voting in polite company . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red%e2%80%93green_alliance_%28denmark%29 ), 
  it 's not a conspiracy but it still fucks over non-americans . 
  which had a housing bubble , not a debt crisis . 
  only the fact that they did * not * have a bare-bones social system ( like the us ) and did n't control the world 's reserve currency that they could inflate away their debt ( like the us ) meant that they had debt issues as a result of the recession , not because of it . 
   apart from americans ... [ 47 % of us would beg to differ ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/bop-report-25/ ), 
   germany was an outlier . 
  the countries with the highest levels saying `` no , the us is * not * a free country '' are france , germany , the us , and spain , all close us allies . 
  only 43 % of russians and 37 % of chinese express concern about the usa 's human rights record ; that 's less than argentina , for pope francis ' sake . 
  even in / r/schland , obama enjoys a 73 % approval rating and a 50 % -45 % favorability split . 
  other [ pew global ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/05/07/germany-and-the-united-states-reliable-allies/ ) polls show generally decent relationships between the us and germany , with 62 % trusting the us . 
  well then why are countries like sweden !, 
  finland !, 
  the uk !, 
  and the netherlands !, 
  scaling back their welfare systems , putting all sorts of exclusions on their healthcare system ( no passport on hand ? 
  did n't call ahead ? 
  want a `` costly '' treatment ? 
  sorry , no care ) while ushering in gigantic amounts of household debt and uncontrollable urban housing bubbles ? 
  it 's a shame though because the libertarians are the ones stealing our retirement money and destroying europe . 
  i 'd much rather take a bigot who 's in * ed : favo ( u ) r of a decent standard of living than someone who 's pro-gay but pro-work till you die . 
  60 % of hispanic americans are mexican . 
  cuban exiles and mexicanos do n't see eye-to-eye and the various [ spanish-speaking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_pacific ) [ latin american ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_war ) [ countries and ethnicities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexico%e2%80%93guatemala_conflict ) do n't get along ... the texan thing helps though as cruz is kind of mexican-by-osmosis . 
  tl ; dr : taco and ropa vieja do n't necessarily get along . 
  if he gets the nomination ( or vp even ) and is n't too gaffe-prone , i could see ted cruz or jeb bush doing it ( cruz , while cuban , is texan y' all and jeb is married to a mexican ) . 
  or without perfect insurance . 
  however , the way cameron , merkel , thorning-schmidt/rasmussen , etc. 
  are treating european healthcare ( i.e. 
  as an atm ) , and how pharma companies are colluding with the [ eu ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/european-business-summit-2014/commission-tells-pharmaceutical-industry-lobby-better-member ) to raise healthcare spending , expect to see more ` murica in europe and less ` murica in ` murica . 
  welcome to financial capitalism .
