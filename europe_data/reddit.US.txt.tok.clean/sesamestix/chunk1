\u00c7orum massacre : nationalist sunni muslims targeted the alevi turkish minority and killed more than half a hundred of them . 
   mara\u015f massacre : more than one hundred alevi civilians in the city of kahramanmara\u015f , turkey , in december 1978 by the neo-fascist grey wolves . 
  fevzi g\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f , chair of the `` cultural association pir sultan abdal '' is convinced that the cia must have been involved . 
  everything is america 's fault , huh ? 
  nationalist sunni muslims and neo-fascist grey wolves ? 
  it 's amazing how competent america is at coordinating geopolitically unimportant massacres yet elects a reality tv star as president . 
   [ gladio organization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_gladio ) purpose : defense of europe from invasion by warsaw pact the horror !, 
  defending europe from a soviet invasion !, 
  beyond a conspiracy theory , which us-backed islamists have committed city-wide massacres in turkey ? 
  the pkk is just the us undermining an important nato ally ? 
  keep believing erdogan 's bullshit . 
  usa has massacred exactly zero people in turkey . 
  hosting refugees is not a competition , it is done out of goodwill . 
  war casualties are the [ lowest in history ] ( https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/ ) while evil america has been a superpower . 
  i do n't agree with our foreign policy , but over 15x as many americans died in 9/11 than any islamist terrorist attack on europe . 
  more than [ 3 million refugees ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/03/where-refugees-to-the-u-s-come-from/ ) currently live in the united states . 
  you 're simply ignorant . 
  here is actual evidence for each of those `` theories '' with `` no evidence '' found in one minute of googling . 
  can you provide any for america propping up erdo\u011fan ?

  right . 
  i understand what you 're saying , but i 've never heard of the us funding the akp or erdo\u011fan and ca n't find anything about it . 
  how is it the usa 's fault that turkey elected erdo\u011fan ? 
  oh , great . 
  lebanon had a 15 year civil war with 120,000 fatalities and palestinian refugees attempting to overthrow the government with force . 
  you have it backwards . 
  arab countries initiated war with israel multiple times because they already hated jews . 
  hell , egypt , lebanon , syria , jordan and iraq invaded the same day israel was founded . 
  fair point . 
  i was speaking about the adults that made their own decisions , not the children . 
  i ca n't believe you referred to isis fighters as illegal combatants in scare quotes . 
  how naive and young are you ? 
  isis 's goal is to establish a worldwide islamic caliphate and/or bring on the apocalypse . 
  they should be wiped off the planet , where us normal humans are just trying to live their lives . 
  it is kind of simple though . 
  those 271 people could cause multiple more bataclans . 
  fuck them . 
  they made their bed and they can lie in it . 
  ah , norway . 
  so easy to be politically correct with your [ 86 % homogeniety ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_norway ) and floods of oil money . 
  it is [ pretty desolate ] ( https://geopoliticalfutures.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/canada-population1.jpg ), 
  the unhcr can explain whatever they want to the uk and receive `` fuck off '' in response . 
  presuming ignorance of african issues is quite condescending . 
  nigerians , for example one of the largest demographic of migrants , have exactly zero reasons for claiming asylum in germany . 
  you 're right , true refugees do n't stop being refugees . 
  but there 's a clear pull factor to europe for migrants . 
  that 's a problem and will only get worse in the decades to come . 
  welfare states ca n't possibly work with open borders . 
  `` help the unhcr share the burden of refugees '' is so nebulous as to be meaningless . 
  plenty of countries tell the un `` zero , '' as is their right . 
  citizens come first . 
   refugees are not just migrants , they are people fleeing for their lives . 
  that 's not true and is pretty much at the core of the issue . 
  people are fleeing poverty and are incentivized to claim refugee status in europe by the generous system . 
  why are millions migrating from sub-saharan africa and central asia all the way to germany/uk/sweden ? 
  there are tons of safe areas en route . 
  the answer is obviously money . 
  countries are obliged to give a hearing to people who declare asylum within their country . 
  no one is obliged to fly tens of thousands of people from the other side of the world . 
  the convention on refugees clearly did not imagine and was not intended for the era of mass immigration and welfare states . 
   literally sinks them to the bottom of the ocean the collective weight of tourists is causing venice to sink ? 
  that 's a great solution outside of the fact only the rich could afford to see the jewels of human heritage . 
  maybe a lottery ? 
  first a winky face and then the gulag . 
  i can appreciate your style . 
  it 's funny that you think rich people just bury their assets in the ground and the only use of money is for consumers to spend it . 
  username checks out . 
  you 've changed my opinion . 
  majority christian countries are not all on the same page . 
  well it was more rhetorical than serious since i do n't believe it 's true . 
  i 'm sure there are minor counter-examples . 
  germany only recently allowed gay marriage , they certainly are n't at the forefront of lgbt tolerance . 
  i 'm not christian , but it 's weird that lgbt people consistently seek asylum in majority `` christian '' countries if they 're so intolerant . 
  people suffer in every country . 
  my understanding of the originally intended asylum system was to provide a refuge of last resort if all areas of your country are unliveable for you . 
  143 countries do not qualify . 
  it 's mass migration at this point . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  because you ca n't keep records of crimes committed by ethnicity you do n't statistically know what 's happening ? 
  lack of transparency usually does n't mean anything good . 
  good point . 
  that 's why i put white in quotes . 
  skin color does not a monoculture make . 
  but generally speaking the west is inarguably the most liberal on lgbt views . 
  fair points , but from the eurostats report :  citizens of 143 countries sought asylum for the first time in the eu in the first quarter of 2017 . 
  syrians , afghans and nigerians were the top 3 citizenships of asylum seekers . 
  asylum seekers from 143 countries points to economic migration . 
  and why are nigerians in the top 3 ? 
  the system is broken . 
  are homosexuals even oppressed by `` white '' countries anymore ? 
  i was at a 200,000 person lgbt pride parade recently and did n't notice any oppression . 
  according to google , `` get the fuck away from the fire and the missiles ! '', 
  yes , i do think there would be more foreign prisoners if looking and smelling funny was a crime . 
  in reality , otto was murdered for allegedly stealing a poster . 
  the list of foreign prisoners is surprisingly short , i agree . 
  theresa may sucks but i 'm not avoiding the uk just because of her . 
  our shitty president has minimal impact on daily life ( for citizens , as a caveat , probably not for illegal immigrants ) . 
  how has the guardian told you that we 're oppressed ? 
  i 'm not seeing it . 
  name one thing that you can legally do and i ca n't .
