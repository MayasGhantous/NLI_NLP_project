try victoria ii !, 
   and they really think they are n't spending too much on defence spending . 
  some of us do believe we 're spending way too much . 
  we seem to be in a minority , however . 
  first , congress likes their kickbacks . 
  second , americans value militarism to an extreme degree you folks have n't seen since the days of the prussian officer corps . 
  being `` weak '' on defense will give you outright mockery from the right , and skepticism from even the most liberal democrat . 
  the sad thing is , we could still easily dominate everything under the sun even if we were to make modest cuts . 
  waste is everywhere . 
  as an example , abram tanks are still being pushed out of a factory , only to go straight into storage , likely never to see use . 
  * but * if congress votes to stop that , they 'd be `` killing jobs '' and being `` weak on defense . '', 
  they would have to close the factory , eliminating manufacturing jobs . 
  it 's a classic example of a broken window fallacy . 
  this is to say nothing of our f35 , f22 and new class of aircraft carriers that are chalk full of issues . 
  in fact , many times our defense officials say we 're spending too much , only to be rebuffed by congress . 
  as an extreme and recent example , the navy said it was insane to keep battleships in reserve fleet during the modern era , but congress only recently struck them from our naval register within this last decade . 
  there was a long congressional battle to keep them ready for action , despite the huge upkeep . 
  that 's right , we had battleships ( the [ new jersey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_new_jersey_ ( bb-62 ) and [ wisconsin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_wisconsin_ ( bb-64 ) ) in reserve until 2006 . 
  they should never have been reactivated in the 80 's much less kept into readiness past the last century . 
  my country is not rational when it comes to defense . 
  i was against the war from the start . 
  but we at least attempted to go to the un first and waited more than just a few weeks . 
  we also did n't annex iraq . 
  this is like comparing apples and bicycles . 
  the fucking canadians . 
  shady motherfuckers . 
   now that uni fees are 9k a year i guess more brits probably are going to be unskilled ... 9k a year ? 
  as an american , i do n't know whether to laugh or cry . 
  nato is not a gradient . 
  it is black and white . 
  and ukraine was not a member . 
  we 're not obligated in any capacity to help a non member . 
  that 's now treaties work in the real world . 
  you 're wronger than a wrong thing that 's wrong . 
   because it could be the start of a wider , more devastating conflict . 
  you would only be prolonging the inevitable . 
  you think if we allowed them to take estonia without a fight , they would stop there ? 
  yes . 
  appeasement and isolationism is certainly the way to go !, 
  how in the world can you say the usa is responsible for this ? 
  genuine question . 
  do you have any links ? 
  i 'm willing to look at it . 
  sir , i advise you to put down the tin foil . 
   nato is an extension of usa . 
  no , it 's not . 
  operations in libya , for example , were spearheaded by european interests . 
  the us provided primarily logistical support . 
   that 's how us rolls and that 's how ussr used to roll nato was/is not anything like the warsaw pact or the soviet union . 
  nato does not have a say in their internal politics . 
  whereas , until gorby , all warsaw states were puppets of the soviet regime . 
  it 's apples and oranges . 
   america pushed for nato expansion and threatened russia and it 's allies . 
  actually , in virtually every case , the countries requested to join nato . 
  and co-opting the word `` imperialism '' for your own ends does n't give any validity to your point . 
  it 's not imperialism . 
  china had fought india multiple times ... 
  again , no . 
  surrender is not necessarily destruction either . 
  tell that to china , india and pakistan . 
  conventional wars can and do happen without nuclear weapons . 
   so : why remove them when there is little is so little to gain and a lot to lose ? 
  there is a minority in the us ( myself included ) that would like us see reduced military spending . 
  we have many things we could use this money on that would be more beneficial for our citizens . 
   the time nato has been occupying afghanistan has been the most peaceful since the soviets invaded and their standard of living has increased by every metric . 
  [ citation needed ], 
   and i 'm damn proud of what we accomplished there . 
  and that was what , exactly ? 
  keep in mind that as soon as we leave , any `` progress '' we 've made will disappear . 
  source ? 
  please understand that he does not represent all of us . 
  most americans now look at the last round of wars with a grimace at best . 
  that 's right . 
  us evil americans are all responsible for these horrible things !, 
  you 've figured us out !, 
  it 's very relevant . 
  but that 's okay , keep downvoting me . 
  do you truly believe a mig 29 could go toe-to-toe with an f-22 ? 
   they have the most nuclear warheads in the world and that means nothing . 
  a nuclear warhead is not going to enforce foreign policy on another country . 
  [ the mig-29 entered the soviet air fleet in 1982 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikoyan_mig-29 ) . 
  my best reading is behind a pay wall . 
  stratfor and such . 
  it 's hard to analyze hard financial figures because of the closed nature of the chinese government .

  in the iran-iraq war , and in the first and second gulf wars . 
   they dont even have very good arguments ( none jump out as being amazingly important ) . 
  really ? 
  china 's inability to produce their own domestic high tech sectors ? 
  virtually all the ip china produces is owned by us shareholders . 
  how about the frantic government movements to artificially inflate their employment ? 
  how about the massive brain drain ? 
  or the staggering economic divide ? 
  or the breakaway rebellions in the west ? 
  or , more importantly , the rampant corruption and cronyism that ultimately is inhibiting real growth and development within the market ? 
  there are * countless * indicators that china 's growth has hit its peak , including hard economic numbers . 
  it 's not a certainty , but it is very likely . 
   china has slowed down but there are no indications they will stop like japan .
