   ukraine is simply the battlefield for the geopolitical conflict between nato and russia . 
  i must have missed the part where nato was involved . 
  did ukraine join and i missed it , or are you just talking out of your ass ? 
  best not to . 
  avoid it like a plague . 
  i love that sub, 
  jesus , i knew where he was in real time and i am halfway across the world . 
  all the plotters had to do was put on cnn . 
  i ca n't believe people are falling for this . 
   why does all our stuff look evil ? 
  ... are we the baddies ? 
  i thought you said you did n't give a fuck about nations joining nato . 
  which is it ? 
  then what aggression against russia are you talking about ? 
  aggression ? 
  because other countries * requested * joining nato and we let them ? 
  it sounds to me like you have a problem with the baltic states and other former soviet surrogates having their own sovereignty . 
  i definitely appreciate that perspective . 
  however , you have to remember how wonky our political system is . 
  [ trump and hillary were nominated with only 9 % of the american vote , respectively ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/01/us/elections/nine-percent-of-america-selected-trump-and-clinton.html ) . 
  there is a reason why these two candidates , trump especially , are literally [ the two most disliked candidates in our political history ] ( http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/ ) . 
  no , it 's how people are treating trump . 
  he was n't `` joking '' and even if it were , it was entirely inappropriate . 
  his actions are indefensible . 
   for me it sounds very much like an appeal to emotion , more than a political platform . 
  that 's exactly what it is . 
  a month ago : `` i like trump because he means what he says ! '', 
  now : `` pfft ... did n't you know he was kidding ? '', 
  what a joke . 
   the us is still spending trillions of dollars in order to contain the shitstorm they triggered with their little adventure in iraq more than a decade ago we are very , very good at destroying countries . 
  we 're not good at rebuilding them . 
  jesus christ ... with friends like you , who needs enemies ? 
  there is no `` s '' . 
  that is literally his platform . 
  japan, 
  uh ... religion * is * the core issue . 
  yes , and that excludes assassinating your political rivals using mob or vigilante justice . 
  do n't be obtuse . 
  actually , i did not , but i can believe it . 
  something important to note , though : all that trouble did n't stop russia from occupying them . 
  actually , it 's the exact opposite . 
  [ hillary has nearly a 90 % chance of winning ] ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/ ) . 
  but that 's the entire point . 
  if it were n't for nato , there 's a very real possibility the baltic states would be russian oblasts now . 
   guilded age it 's [ gilded age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gilded_age ) , 
   before ww2 usa was not a thing in global economy . 
  uh ... before wwii the us had the largest economy in the world . 
  [ in fact , by the early 20th century , the us was already there ] ( https://www.quora.com/economic-history-at-what-point-did-the-us-become-the-biggest-economy-in-the-world ) . 
   usa would sell than weapons to all sides and join the war at the end . 
  this is n't 1917 . 
  we are a part of strategic alliances and pacifism in the us is as dead as a dodo . 
  if nato is attacked , our response would be immediate . 
  there would be no vote . 
  there would be no debate . 
  it would n't even be up for discussion . 
  if the russians invaded a nato state , our reaction would be immediate . 
  if you do n't think russia considers the baltic states their sphere of influence , you are gravely mistaken . 
  how about an actual * reason * to do anything outside of throwing our dick around ? 
  we have no business in ukraine . 
  insults and saber rattling are not enough reasons to do anything . 
  yes , but he 's not wrong . 
  do you really expect a country to have any other interest than its own ? 
  our walmart scooters will block out the sun !, 
  there is no reason to believe that those nukes are not in safe hands . 
  erdogan is still a significant player in nato . 
  despite all the saber rattling , that is unlikely to change . 
  i agree that the us and allies were n't fully aware ( or even cared ) about the genocide that was going on . 
  but the goal was still to liberate europe , if only for the fact that the us could n't defeat germany without doing so . 
   but that also was n't really the reason for the us to join . 
  seriously ?!, 
  we were attacked by japan and then hitler declared war on us !, 
  do they not teach basic history in schools anymore ? 
  yeah , man . 
  we should have just let those nazis to their business , amiright ? 
  that 's besides my point . 
  regardless of the reasons , american soldiers were far less barbaric than soviet soldiers . 
  now , if we had gone through everything the soviets had gone through , i 'm not confident that we would not have done anything different . 
  no , that 's the reality . 
  there was a reason why every german would much rather have surrendered to allied forces in the west over the soviet forces in the east . 
  and he would be * wrong * . 
  yes , the us was not perfect , but they were a long way off from the soviets . 
  hitler declared war on the us . 
  it 's not like we preemptively striked them or anything . 
   russia won wwii and was no different than america . 
  no different than america ? 
  are you serious ? 
  uh ... yes . 
  even erdogan does n't deny it . 
  this was mostly a romanov dream that died with them . 
  nobody cares about `` czargrad '' anymore . 
  [ i think we all know the truth behind these `` diaries '' . 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/070/452/its-a-fake.jpg ), 
  you know , i would have read all of this and responded to all of it , but i 'm done with the insults . 
  apparently civil discourse is too much for you . 
  same reason the coup failed and the ussr collapsed . 
  i 'm not sure i understand your question . 
  well , i guess i should say if your goal is humanitarian . 
  if your goal is to crush opposition , that 's pretty easy . 
  you just keep killing people . 
   it 's not a turkish exclusive base it houses ten times as many american personnel that would literally be 500 men .
