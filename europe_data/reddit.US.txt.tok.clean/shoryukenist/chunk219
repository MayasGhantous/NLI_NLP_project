  i 'll never get tired of germans defending vw , it 's hilarious . 
   ~ ~ sauerkraut ~ ~ ** liberty cabbage ** will do that . 
  it 's good ( in both meanings ) though . 
  better to fart and be in good health than the contrary !, 
  niemcy , yuo are of genus !, 
  indeed , did you curtsy to the governor general yet today ? 
  yes , the pipes can be found on many vw models . 
  obviously , the best syrup in the world is from ny . 
  it will be like prohibition all over again , smuggling illegal syrup into the us . 
  no , it will be paid by a tax on maple syrup imports . 
  ugh , then we are going to have to build a northern wall . 
  it 's just smart diplomacy towards the eu on his part , that 's all . 
  is there any chance they do not get the next round of funding ? 
  perhaps what i 'm proposing is n't possible then , but a crisis every single time debt needs to be rolled over is very unhelpful . 
  a `` one and done '' deal would keep the money flowing as long as greece complied . 
  if they do n't comply after forgiveness , then you have to let them fall into a failed nation , and provide food/medical aid , and not much else . 
  no , the staus quo is pretend and extend . 
  the myth that the debt can or will be repaid hangs over greece like a black cloud . 
  if they still are irresponsible after forgiveness , then you will have to let them fall into a third world hell hole . 
  i do n't think spines grow back . 
  irredentist works too . 
  greece would have to agree to have their budget controlled and approved by the eu for a lengthy period of time in order to secure forgiveness . 
  kind of like how in us bankruptcy court debt can be forgiven with a very strict plan put in place . 
  my ex lived smack dab in the middle of alicante and valencia , and was a catalan speaker . 
  wow , niw it makes a lot more sense to me why there is not much sympathy for the greeks . 
  still , debt should be forgiven due to simple math , and on the condition that the greeks live within their means afterwards . 
  leak this stuff !!!, 
  please !, 
  yes , though more strident than most places , i.e. 
  even bannon does n't propose not allowing dual citizenship . 
  there is literally no chance of the yen happening , japan depends on us for defense 100 % . 
  japan also takes their defense seriously and is a dependable partner . 
  ditching southern europe and having a northern euro is much more realistic . 
  you guys have much fewer options economically and for defense than many here believe . 
  i do n't think there is a great alternative to the dollar , especially with greece coming back i to the limelight . 
  it 's an empty threat . 
  it worked for a long time , but it does n't anymore , that 's why we are having these issues . 
  and obviously we do n't want it to continue . 
  personally i see this as a threat to euro solidarity , as i expect ee to be very upset if we ramp everything down . 
  i think it will cause a lot of friction in europe , but hurt us much less . 
  even if trump gets impeached , the american government is going to be less interventionist , and willing to withdraw . 
  all this squabbling is getting old , i think europe and the us need to resolve this one way or another . 
  if we withdraw , we withdraw , we 'll live . 
  how about doing it for solidarity with ee ? 
  i 'm not sure how representative many of these comments are of real life , but it looks like many germans looks down on easterners as ridiculous children . 
  even think of the long game , a secure europe without nato . 
  keep equal footing ? 
  the whole point of this is that it is n't equal at all . 
  you said you have italian citizenship ? 
  my friend had 2 cousins from italy try to move to the us because they can not find work no matter what . 
  granted , one of them is low skilled , he worked at a restaurant in italy which was affiliated with the mafia , and they did n't pay him . 
  they threatened him when he complained , and he came to nyc to be a bus boy and have fun . 
  his visa ran out , he tried to sneak back in through canada , got busted and deported . 
  the other one has some kind of programming degree from an italian college , and was able to get an internship in the us . 
  if she wanted to stay any longer , there were some kind of huge fees that either she or the company she interned with would have had to have paid , so she went back . 
  she is currently unemployed . 
  things can be good in some parts of europe , but it 's not always better than here , and often much worse , especially for young people . 
  i 'd get one if i was back in chicago , but that 's pretty much it . 
  people have been trying to trigger spaniards with that well before trump . 
  kind of like how you can mess with a canadian about being american . 
  is this the area around alicante ? 
  ok , makes sense . 
  serbo-croat ? 
  this is the scary part :  the drop in 2016 is not linked to an economic crisis , as both blocs are growing steadily , but is part of a wider reduction of global trade . 
  and it 's all global trade , not just us/eu . 
   and now the jews ... french jews catch it from all sides , huh ? 
  he was born in benton , illinois , he 's american . 
  btw , in case you are being serious about the right to privacy , if you want to do any reading , google 4th amendment jurisprudence . 
  it is very complicated , but that is what we have courts for . 
   the fourth amendment of the u.s. constitution provides , '' [ t ] he right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly ... https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment, 
  so what ? 
  his father was american . 
  his father was american as fuck , serving in the 82nd airborne in wwii . 
  maybe ? 
  dad is from kansas city , and mom is from kentucky . 
  if people can mess with americans for claiming heritage , i can mess with euros for doing the same .

  i can only deal with so much appropriation in one thread . 
  john malkovich born december 9 , 1953 ** christopher , illinois , united states **, 
  alfred matthew yankovic born : october 23 , 1959 ** downey , california , u.s. ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22weird_al%22_yankovic do n't appropriate muh culture bruh . 
  do n't forget kaiser wilhelm .

  who told you that ? 
  i 'd bet money that a diesel pickup here is still strictly regulated . 
  heavy trucks are too . 
  europe going so hardcore with diesel was an indefensible mistake . 
  it 's immediately damages human health . 
  yell , tell them to go to their room , take away nintendo for a week , no ice cream , etc. 
  i 'm old , and i was never hit by my parents , and somehow i became a mostly law abiding , productive human . 
  never change balkanites , never change . 
  i drag down our gdp . 
  ama . 
   that being said , us barbecues and spring break look very fun in hollywood movies . 
   it 's fun irl too :-d, 
  not bad . 
  obviously it 's working very well in germany . 
  and then you have holidays on top of that ? 
  you start out a comment with `` yeh thats the reason lol . '', 
  and i 'm antagonistic ? 
  good one .
