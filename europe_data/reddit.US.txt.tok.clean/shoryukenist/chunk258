  i would like to gauge numbers against the recent european elections . 
  thx . 
  the hypothetical here is that there is a eu force , under multinational command in brussels , which has replaced nato . 
  could germans be stationed in poland ? 
  could poles be stationed in lithuania ? 
  could the english be stationed in romania or bulgaria ? 
  ( i joke , i joke ) what other countries have a history that might lead to local opposition to foreign forces from a particular nation being stationed there ? 
  is this an actual impediment to an eu force ? 
  does this even exist at all ? 
  thx, 
  presumably , this would also entail the dissolution of nato , but i suppose for the sake of argument , we could say withdrawal with the continuation of nato would be an option . 
  i wanted to know if the anniversary is commemorated in anyway in the eu area , or if it has been in the news . 
  the scars are very deep for the survivors . 
  additionally , everyone remembers the failure of the dutch troops ( rightfully so ) , but most people forget that they called french general bernard javier for close air support and were denied five times in the days leading up to the massacre . 
  if so , why ? 
  edit : perhaps a better phrasing is : `` are you opposed to germany possessing a military commensurate with it 's population and economy . '', 
  [ question inspired by this article which make bidets sound great ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/technology/personaltech/electronic-bidet-toilet-seat-is-the-luxury-you-wont-want-to-live-without.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=homepage&amp;module=mini-moth&amp;region=top-stories-b ), 
  no , not just anybody can do a job for $ 100k , but most college graduates can . 
  to give perspective , in this area , suburban cops and teachers make $ 100k . 
  yes , it a a good job , but pretty standard for a white collar worker . 
  and by good , i mean good for the nyc area , it would be unheard of in a rural area . 
  healthcare is probably 200-500 , taxes : https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=goo__fed_taxes_search&amp;gclid=cjwkeajw2qzhbrchlowxgoxdpyasjab01io0d1hzbm5ozozhpdtueqjcwd-8p9adlsy28zx6t3gejrocbtnw_wcb#ve8pinifar, 
  ah , not bad at all . 
  sounds like you have to decide if you want to move back for your family , not sure we can give you advice on that . 
  the $ 100k is before taxes and healthcare , if that makes any difference . 
  i would n't even know the difference between living costs . 
  he 's in stamford , connecticut , which is not a bad spot at all , lots of high rise apartment buildings . 
  no offense intended to op at all , but $ 100k is n't considered a very high salary , though it 's nothing to be a shamed of at all , probably standard for a office job with that many years of experience . 
  that 's assuming he is working in the nyc ` burbs ( where i live ) . 
  i agree we do n't have enough info , but it seems like op is doing very well here and is torn about his parents aging . 
  no one can really give him much advice on that matter . 
  i 'm sure he means annual compensation . 
  now ? 
  it 's looked like that since 2003 . 
  absolutely , i 'm just saying the un is a non-starter . 
  what do you mean maybe not ? 
  100 % not , russia said the rebels did it . 
  i 'm not making a statement on the actual bombing beyond saying that un never would have authorized anything . 
  most americans who actually watch a rugby game like it a lot . 
  i watched my first one at a bar in dublin , it was great . 
  russia will veto any sc action , un authorization was not going to happen . 
  [ i 'm interested in this grand national ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/fb/30/13/fb301366dd53df342b7bcc434dc14123.jpg ), 
  nope , i 've actually been to italy , and have hung out with real italians over there and over here . 
  i have three friends whose parents were born in italy . 
  it is not uncommon in nyc . 
  my grandfather 's family left sicily in the 1860s :-d . do n't worry , i 'm 100 % ` murican . 
  yes , i know all about the good old days of diesel in the us . 
  but the reason that it did not regain popularity here is because our particulate standards make it expensive to do so . 
  and that is the reason our cities are not covered in smog , unlike paris , milan , etc. 
  because particulates are awful for human health . 
   old car exhaust that smells like fuel i want to have cologne made from the exhaust on my '72 lesabre, 
  my friend 's dad had this year burban when i was a kid . 
  love it !, 
  i 'd take that deal in a heartbeat . 
  may i ask what kind ? 
  i have a jewish background , and dated a girl from the alicante area for a long time . 
  her cousins came to visit us in nyc , and they literally had no clue what judaism was , they were asking all these questions . 
  that was a bit surprising to me . 
  you are a rare jew ? 
  trumpville, 
  you know there are french people other places , right ? 
  studied with a whole bunch of them in london , louisiana never came up . 
  been to quebec plenty of times as well , did n't hear it either . 
  never seen it online , or ever heard of it being a thing . 
  if it is , feel free to show me it , i 'm just saying i 've never heard of that . 
  i have heard about the expulsion of the acadians . 
  yes i have , for 8 hours . 
  took the eurostar . 
  one could argue that we genocided native americans . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  we got a great deal on that . 
  funnily enough , i 've never heard a french person cry about the louisiana purchase . 
  we call the first one car camping , or rv ( recreational vehicle ) camping . 
  the other one is called backpacking , where you bring everything with you , and stay somewhere inaccessible by vehicle . 
  i was n't talking about two americans meeting , i 'm talking about europeans not really considering these 2 people american . 
   the default assumption in the usa is that everyone 's american unless something gives you reason to think otherwise . 
  exactly , which is why they were a little upset with being asked where they were `` really '' from . 
  honestly , i think it 's mostly just linguistics . 
  you know how it sounds horrible to euro ears to hear an american say they are italian ? 
  it 's the same thing for an american to hear `` but where are you really from '' when it 's painfully obvious you grew up in the us . 
  i assume what those people were asking is `` what is your background . '', 
  an observation deck in nyc might be your highest . 
  north : slieve league , co. . donegal , ireland 54.6401 \u00b0 n south : george town , grand cayman , cayman islands 19.2869 \u00b0 n east : zagreb , croatia :15.9819 \u00b0 e west : la push , washington ( state ) , usa 124.6352 \u00b0 w highest point : mount whitney , lone pine , california , usa 14,505 feet ( 4421.0 m ) lowest point : sea level , lots ' o places, 
  actually i think it 's for a totally different reason , not because people think they are chinese , it 's because people do n't think they are american . 
  a long , long time ago i did a semester abroad in london , as part of a program put together by a ny state school . 
  lets say there were 20 kids ; 17 white , 1 black guy and 1 indian-american ( not native american ) guy , and 1 indian-american ( not native american ) girl . 
  i was very close friends with both indians . 
  how many times do you think us white folks and the black guy were asked if we were american ? 
  not once . 
  how many times do you think the indian kids were asked ? 
  all the time . 
  i should say that no ukers made those comments to them , but certainly germans and italians did . 
  i also do not think anyone intended to be hurtful to them . 
  here is how i saw it go down :  euro student : hi , where are you from ? 
   indian-american student : nyc  euro student : oh , but where are you * really * from . 
  i 'm sure you understand how that would get very irritating , especially when none of your countrymen are getting the same questions . 
  in fact ( as we see on reddit every day ) , most europeans get annoyed/amused when an american claims some distant ancestry . 
  so if you are a brown/asian , etc. 
  american who sees every white american being told `` you are n't italian , you are american ! '',
