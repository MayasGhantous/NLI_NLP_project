  in the uk patriotism is considered a somewhat vulgar thing for overseas people . 
  :-) yet you are often accused of being so in this very sub !, 
  no , i do not mean nyc . 
  the land is far too valuable for that , they make condos and whatever else out of abandoned industrial facilities . 
  ny state is quite large , 40 % the size of germany . 
  the whole industrial revolution and american industry was formed around the erie canal and hudson river . 
  this way we could get to the port of nyc and ship our products anywhere . 
  even today , 80 % or 90 % of nyers live within 20 miles of those two waterways , espcially since rail and highways were built next to them as well . 
  but ever since the 1950s , upstate ny has been deindustrializing and depopulating . 
  plenty of space for vw !, 
  you are clearly more pragmatic than i. 
  are you a solicitor or barrister ? 
  i am fairly certain qc have to swear to the queen , i recall some ni barristers being upset about it . 
  when i was swore in , i had to affirm that i would adhere to the constitutions of ny and the us , and that i would not advocate for the violent overthrow of the us ( thanks cold war ! ) . 
  to become a british ( or canadian ) citizen , you do have to swear an oath to the queen . 
  as far as the northern european monarchies , i did n't claim monarchy was an actual hindrance , just that i find it offensive and incompatible with modern western thought ( especially in those countries ! ) . 
  as for the queen being totally immune , i see where you are coming from with regard to the english development of law , but to me , having one person above the law denigrates the law . 
  now we have some aspects of sovereign immunity in the us , but those are immunities for governmental entities . 
  so it is n't so much the theory , it 's that the entity is a human . 
  correct me if i am wrong , but the uk has abandoned the concept of ex post facto prosecutions . 
  so if the queen killed someone while she was immune , you could remove that immunity and prosecute , right ? 
  suppose i can not counter the soft power argument , though i do n't think it 's worth it . 
  i think the uk would do just as well without them . 
  shocked to hear many want charles to be queen , maybe i 'm getting a skewed view through the prism of uk redditors . 
  i recently worked on an english law matter ; in terms of contract law , it is almost identical to american , which kind of makes sense , since we got it from you . 
  i had a chuckle at some of the opinions which criticized continental concepts of contractual interpretation . 
  also , on a conceptual level , i can not wrap my head around the idea that a person `` is '' the nation , or patriotic loyalty to a person . 
  but i suppose that is from years of indoctrination by a country which fought to overthrow royal control . 
  that is quite interesting . 
  i would expect all kinds of opposition in tennessee to that . 
  we have plenty of old abandoned factories they could rebuild here in ny ... 
  lower wages in the east ? 
  no , you are thinking of the chicken tax thing : http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb125357990638429655?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle%2fsb125357990638429655.html it effects vans . 
  otherwise we get cars from everywhere . 
  i 'm just saying outside of their own country , the germans adapt themselves for maximum profit . 
  nothing wrong with that , just doing business . 
  ironically enough , bmw and mercedes have factories in south carolina and alabama , where workers have pretty much no rights . 
  they stayed away from the unionized north . 
  this is very interesting . 
  so are you saying that german companies should invent the machines that automate the rest of the world ? 
  meaning germany profits from automation , while the rest of the world get automated ? 
  i 'm actually very comfortable with the level of innovation coming out of america , though of course it makes sense to study places like germany . 
  what america really could learn from germany is the collaborative labor model . 
  i 'm 37 and live in nyc , my friends and i all graduated college and grad school when the economy was amazing . 
  we all did well , and are now entrenched into positions with a lot of upward mobility . 
  but since the financial crisis , it 's all about `` do more with less . '', 
  there has been no wage inflation , and people are expected work way more hours , for not more money . 
  it is total bullshit . 
  it is so hard for many people to have a decent work/life balance . 
  i know many of these people would be happy to make a less money , and manage more employees , so that they could actually see their kids . 
  and for kids graduating now ? 
  they are competing with people who got laid off and took what were entry level jobs , and older folks who just are not retiring . 
  mind you , these are kids with mountains of debt . 
  the middle class is dying . 
  `` germany actively coordinates these factors , creating a virtuous cycle among them . 
  germany innovates in order to empower workers and improve their productivity ; the u.s. focuses on technologies that reduce or eliminate the need to hire those pesky wage-seeking human beings . 
  germany 's innovations create and sustain good jobs across the spectrum of workers ' educational attainment ; american innovation , at best , creates jobs at amazon 's fulfillment centers and in apple stores . '', 
  good luck to anyone trying to stop automation . 
  we will need a radical rethinking of our entire economy and monetary system , but automation is going to be a great thing in the end . 
  just think of how many hundreds of thousands of people who are not going to die because automated buses , taxis , trains , etc. 
  yes , on a principled basis . 
  my father was an attorney , as am i ; the fact that there is a hereditary , privileged class ** in law ** is quite disturbing to our sensibilities . 
  so he passed this on to me . 
  i 've made many lists of the various laws , immunities , and exemptions the sovereign of the uk is entitled to , but here are two i remember off the top of my head . 
  for example : https://www.royal.gov.uk/monarchuk/queenandthelaw/queenandthelaw.aspx] `` although civil and criminal proceedings can not be taken against the sovereign as a person under uk law , the queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law . '', 
  aka - you can never do anything to me , but i promise to be good . 
  trust me ;-) i found this article interesting as well : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2400003.stm a monarchy is really just the .001 % that established themselves centuries ago as the government or part of it . 
  in the us we have a big .001 % problem as well , and they de-facto have all kinds of privileges , but we do not swear allegiances to them , we do not put their faces on our money , so on and so forth . 
  even filthy rich politicians can be voted out of office or can be prosecuted . 
  furthermore , it undermines any semblance of `` merit . '', 
  while the example i am going to use , has no application to the modern day , it is illustrative . 
  kaiser wilhelm was an impetuous , immature , militaristic child , of middling to lower intelligence . 
  the civil government did all they could to contain him ( in a constitutional monarchy ) , but it was hard to do . 
  if it was merit based , he would n't have been as much as a private in the army . 
  of course prince charles will cause no such problems , but is he the person the the people of the uk want to be their sovereign ? 
  personally i would guess not , but you have no choice , because he is entitled to it by law . 
  hereditarily entitled to be the sovereign and source of law by dint of birth !, 
  i 'm not advocating any change in the form of your government beyond parliament ( or by popular vote ) electing a largely ceremonial sovereign who would carry out the same functions . 
  it also strikes me as contrary to most aspects of mainstream uk thought ; things like everyone should get healthcare , that people 's basic welfare should be protected . 
  that there shall be a privileged class , who lives in luxury during austerity does n't seem like something that would fit into modern british thinking . 
  then again , no american has ever deciphered the british class system , so i am probably missing something but i do n't think they are going anywhere , and it is not the most evil institution on the planet or anything . 
  i just think it is crazy to maintain in this day and age . 
  but i also understand it is cultural , and most of the world thinks we are insane for letting everyone have guns in this day and age . 
  i do wish the queen would at least use a teleprompter or try to memorize her speeches . 
  when she travels all over , and reads of a piece of paper , it strikes me as undignified . 
  it is like she is quite literally a puppet who is just reading what is handed to her . 
  this would be especially so for the opening of parliament . 
  i like the whole ceremonial aspect of assertion of the parliament over the queen , but why have the queen herself read something that was written by the government ? 
  have the ceremony , and she can delegate the reading to the pm , or the like . 
  i 'm just nitpicking , but i do find the very principle of monarchy an affront to human dignity . 
  apologies for my rambling , and hopefully none of this was too offensive . 
  we learned from watching you !, 
  maybe in the rest of the world , it is still ** the city ** here , but there are lots of other great cities that have become more important since the 90s . 
  so we have to share our airtime a little more . 
  people get mad when you make the `` us is so big argument , '' so i did n't use it . 
  many americans ( my sister-in-law included ) are quite obsessed with provence . 
  stunning countryside . 
  i totally understand your annoyance with the continentals on this topic . 
  in the us , the geographical area know as `` europe '' would be [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jbhitxf.gif ) . 
  which is why my friend `` corrected '' me .
