  http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_move_expc_s1_a.htm when is all this capability coming online ? 
  yes , but even the government is sick of spending it on europe . 
  we are pivoting east . 
  i do n't see the point of such a massively expanded nato . 
  by continually pushing east , we have forced putin 's hand . 
  could n't we have stopped at a unified germany ? 
  nato made no sense in the post cold war period , so it ended up starting another cold war . 
  and i totally agree with your comment that most of the allies can provide no support at all . 
  we fight wars to keep the arms industry going and to keep poor people occupied in the army . 
  you forgot to mention that this is all for your nato ally turkey . 
  i 'd think most your military is defensive in nature , to protect a much larger enemy . 
  yes , i 've noticed a lot less `` murica , stfu , you are not world police ! '', 
  comments too . 
  uk and france have taken defense seriously , but i do n't see a strong eu without a strong german military . 
  but i 'm not sure how comfortable the germans are with that , and the english might not love that either . 
  and it 's not like we hid this , we have been begging for nato nations to improve their capabilities for years . 
  and people wonder why the uk distances themselves from the continent ? 
  what in the fuck ? 
  all we do is get bashed for interfering everywhere . 
  i ; m sorry that the more developed nations of the eu did not see fit to properly arm themselves for the past 20 years . 
  they have failed you . 
  canada has a dual french/english regime , it could be a model . 
  of course , quebec came pretty close to seceding , but they are ok now . 
  could you find me a source on the norway thing ? 
  no wonder they are so damn rich . 
  i do n't think we have any operational lng export terminals in the us right now . 
  my best friend 's dad escaped in ' 56 . 
  lived in the woods for months . 
  i do n't think that will happen again thankfully . 
  damn . 
  curious that it is such a big deal , though i know it is like that in spain with catalan . 
  all about identity ... 
  north american is n't an ethnicity , it 's where he lives . 
  you are a north american now . 
  how difficult is it for ukranian and russian speakers to converse ? 
  to most people speak both ? 
  hungary was so pro-eu ... 
  i love how crazy politicians now blame the jews for everything ... 
  the ukraine president just released a statement that russian incursions would be the start of a war . 
  wow . 
  i am in shock about this whole thing . 
  what is the public reaction in hungary ? 
  all depends on how your electricity is generated ... 
  so really , you guys would be in a bit of trouble , though at least you would get to the warm months . 
  i 'm not sure what the story is over there , but in the us , a lot of our power is generated from natgas . 
  so it would be a huge issue . 
  maybe you guys still have a lot of coal , and would be ok . varies in every country i 'm sure . 
  then i should move to eastern europe , because it 's cold as hell here , and we are getting another storm sunday . 
  does natural gas play a large role in electricity generation ? 
  yes , that would be wwiii territory , and we 'll all be dead . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  you mean storage , or in the ground reserves ? 
  yes , yes you would . 
  eh , sorry for the accusation , people get pissy here sometimes . 
  i remember this whole bit : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4574630.stm apparently it has been a thing for awhile : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_disputes correct me if i am wrong , but i assumed in eastern/central europe that you need heating until the beginning of april . 
  though i suppose there are stockpiles enough to heat until then . 
  not sure you could pivot your that much energy infrastructure by next winter . 
  and i also assume a lot of that gas is going to year round electricity generation and industrial use . 
  someone suggested the us could export lng , but i 'm not sure we have much capacity to do that now . 
  ha , that would be great ( for us ) , but i do n't think we have that kind of export capacity up and runnng . 
  you have any info on that ? 
  of course if it got real ugly , russia could blow the lng ships up . 
  it will take them longer to run out of money then it will take for people to freeze . 
  ~ ~ and thanks for the downvote . ~ ~, 
   if that does n't work just the eu stopping trade with russia will instantly remove over 50 % of all of russia 's trade [ 1 ] , while the same number for the eu is 9.7 % [ 2 ] , which would destroy the russian economy over night and just give us a light bruise . 
  you think you have so much leverage ? 
  what happens when putin shuts down the [ pipelines ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4uzctiy.png ) ? 
  they need to keep their black sea fleet at sevestopol , that is what they care about . 
  their leverage is shutting off the gas to most of eastern europe and italy/gemrany . 
  what is anyone going to do about it ? 
  uh , right . 
  your flair , i feel it may not be accurate , or maybe you an expat . 
  could eu powers at least pretend to carry the water for a bit ? 
  maybe engage in some joint exercises in poland or something . 
  we are pivoting to the east . 
  western european nations had since 1989 to learn to militarize , but they did n't want to . 
  i mean the uk is competent , and all , but i 'd prefer we sit this one out . 
  i 'd say putin has some serious leverage with control of europe 's gas supply . 
  [ ukraine is weak !!!, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/i5epezcodna?t=17s ), 
  and eu ? 
  i think you mean `` and uk and maybe france . '', 
  do not underestimate the drug of nationalism . 
  will this be like libya , when france and uk were all gung ho , but lacked the capabilities ? 
  all russia has to do is shut off the gas to europe . 
  the mere threat of that limits options . 
  we are very tired of wars . 
  you can expect a lot of complaining from washington about how most of the rest of nato has not lived up to their obligations . 
  being an island can do that to you . 
  i 'm glad we have good neighbors giving us energy . 
  :-) also glad we have a lot of our own !, 
  buy when there is blood in the streets . 
  i 'm sure you can understand he might be upset , since russia has basically invaded his country . 
  under the common law , you can void a contract on the grounds of intoxication . 
  do n't think they had they common law in the ussr though . 
  yeah i was aware of that , i thought you meant he was of ukrainian ethnic origin . 
  khrushchev was born april 15 , 1894 , [ b ] [ 1 ] in kalinovka , [ 2 ] a village in what is now russia 's kursk oblast , near the present ukrainian border . 
  [ 3 ] his parents , sergei khrushchev and ksenia khrushcheva , were poor peasants of russian origin [ 3 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikita_khrushchev#early_years, 
   probably to ensure that each republic is n't too homogeneous and to prevent it from peeling off without any trouble . 
  see , i knew you would be aware of the intricacies .
