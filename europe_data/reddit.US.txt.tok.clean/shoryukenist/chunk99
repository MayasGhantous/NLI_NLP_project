  i 'm not exactly surprised . 
  the let in every refugee on earth guilt . 
  ouch . 
  seriously . 
  could they at least be grateful for you helping them out in srebrenica . 
  is that where their guilt comes from ? 
  you 'd come in as wales , ni , england , scotland . 
  please redo your math . 
  or as i call it , `` war juice . '', 
  that shit will fuck you up bad , at least the homemade stuff . 
  drunken leprechauns was n't very nice either . 
  guiess you 've never heard of herr fritzl . 
  incest, 
  is this a thing in europe too , or do you hang out in / r/imgoingtohellforthis a lot ? 
  see them and lbbw all over the place ( did n't realize lbbw country was in the east ) . 
  if this country wanted to be more fair , we would give dc statehood status . 
  it really is bullshit . 
  very cool !, 
  thanks ~ !, 
  it 's so interesting that germany and italy were unified so recently , but the rest of the world only thinks of them as one country . 
  though i know way less about italy , even though i 've been there and not to germany . 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  but thanks for trying . 
  very interesting !!, 
  i do some work which includes german banks every once in awhile . 
  they always use the word landesbank in their name . 
  are there any of them that use a different name ? 
  every state has one , right ? 
  what did i get ? 
  a prize ? 
  is there any difference between lander , stadstaaten and friestaat ? 
  or is it just nomenclature , like how massachusetts and virginia are commonwealths instead of states ? 
  greece has the gdp of connecticut , and is blowing up the euro ? 
  no , you can keep it . 
  thx tho . 
  so fucking good . 
  my family drove only saabs for 20 years . 
  very good cars , but the parts and maintenance were obscene . 
  i did 235kmh in my mom 's 9-5 wagon , fun . 
  anyway , i never meant to imply that germany is n't great at engineering , just that they have have really made a brand of it . 
  for example , volvos are great cars , and have the best accident avoidance systems in the world , makes mercedes look like a joke . 
  but over here at least , you will never hear `` swedish engineering '' or british or italian for that matter . 
  then how do you explain my old saab ? 
  fuck him . 
  i 've definitely seen more ferarris around than hellcats , in fact , i do n't know if i 've ever seen one . 
  of course there are tons of regular challengers . 
  i 've noticed an absolute ton of maseratis lately . 
  love those . 
  oh man , this is kind of funny . 
  the first car is a dodge caliber , and is generally regarded as a terrible car . 
  that being said , i had a 2007 model for a station car , and i really liked it . 
  sold it to my nephew in college for cheap , and it had no problems until he pulled the e-brake on ice , and smashed all the wheels off on a curb . 
  floor got rusty after that . 
  the second car might be the most mocked car in the us , it is the nickelback of cars , the pt cruiser . 
  there are reddit threads about it . 
  http://jalopnik.com/pt-cruiser-owners-explain-tragedies-that-led-to-pt-crui-1561858079 https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/22k59y/pt_cruiser_owners_what_tragedy_burdened_you_with https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/22knki/whats_wrong_with_the_pt_cruiser/ so , if that is what we are selling over there , no wonder people think it 's crap !!!, 
  my friends made fun of my caliber !!, 
  a lot !!, 
  ( still loved it ) now here is a really cool dodge : http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/1407_2015_dodge_challenger_srt_hellcat_first_test/ the 4 door does 204mph, 
  what dodge/chrysler models do they have there ? 
  the dodge dart is a rebadged alfa romeo . 
  and i 'm not surprised in montenegro that people would n't think of driving american . 
  just as people here think little hatchbacks are just for teenagers . 
  old beliefs take a long time to go away . 
  `` today , the jewish population of hungary is approximately 48,200 people , the sixth largest jewish community in europe . '', 
  less than 50k people is worth getting worked up about ? 
  as an american who is culturally jewish , it just seems crazy . 
  yes , and i know there has been a bit of a revival . 
  `` today , the jewish population of hungary is approximately 48,200 people , the sixth largest jewish community in europe . '', 
  that still is n't a ton . 
  yes , i 'm aware of how bad the past has hurt american auto manufacturers . 
  there are certain magazines here that are notorious for only loving german cars , and even they are like `` holy shit !, 
  this american car is really good ! '', 
  besides ford , i do n't think there will be other strong american brands in europe . 
  chrysler is owned by fiat , and they are bringing their models over here and rebadging them as american brands . 
  they are good cars . 
  i think gm has given up on europe , but they are doing very well in china with buick . 
  http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1089550_buick-sells-four-times-as-many-cars-in-china-as-in-u-s and of course , most of the models they make for our market would not even be suitable for europe ( too big , use too much fuel ) . 
  i am a bit interested to see how the mustang does over there . 
  in the higher prices models , generally it is though that german cars do have better interiors , but as far as performance and reliability , us cars do not trail anyone . 
  ford especially , has caught up and is doing quite well with its `` world car '' program , which sells the same models in all markets . 
  is that really true ? 
  are n't there barely any jews there ? 
  if they had megathreads in hungary , this would have never happened . 
  well , i 'm not going to say german cars are bad , because they are not . 
  but they are n't leaps and bounds ahead of other euro cars , japanese cars and na cars . 
  here is some info on it : http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2012/05/are-german-cars-reliable-myth-german-engineering.html it is great advertising though .

  lol . 
  no one uses our technology . 
  let me guess , you are a big fan of `` german engineering . '', 
  best propaganda ever . 
  most americans would agree with that as well . 
  this is totally unworkable , and useless . 
  they function differently and are built heavier . 
  they can basically go forever . 
  rabbits are n't rodents though . 
  i have a '72 buick i use for errands occasionally , 45k miles . 
  insurance is 100 a year . 
  get 13 mpg on a good day .
