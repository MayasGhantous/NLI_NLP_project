  i honestly think some yelling , scoffing , and name calling went down in that meeting . 
  what i 'm really curious about is whether any of the other leaders floated the idea of a carbon tax on the us, 
  this makes me think that talks on the paris agreement went worse than what we actually know goddammit, 
  that honestly makes me fell good , i love both of those . 
  thanks !, 
  would this translate into seats ? 
  are n't you nice . 
  love from us < 3 < 3 !!, 
  i 'm bored, 
  yes , truly unbelievable . 
  i really hate trump , but i honestly feel a teesny bit insulted . 
  so blatantly savage, 
  the far right man ? 
  i honestly think macron purposely left him for 2nd to last , just so he could get one more fake in, 
  hmm you may be right . 
  the savagery is off the charts !!!, 
  going for the far right person handshake just before reaching trump is the icing on the cake . 
  not just one fake , but * two . 
  * my god france , what training did you put this man through ? 
  had to give him the win there , he played trump in his own ridiculous game . 
  basically the same as trudeau and macron , but a little more silliness, 
  will do, 
  i do n't think i 'd like being ruled by an immortal being, 
  got ta share the info !, 
  that 's where i first saw it, 
  ** canada : ** https://i.redd.it/idvxkvzpknfy.gif cant beat the skill of justin trudeau . 
  he was ready after trump pulled the classic trumpshake and rekt the japanese pm . 
  braced the arm on the shoulder , pulled slightly downwards , and completely neutralized trumps advantage ( abbreviated r/canada description ) . 
  nothing to fancy or savage for mr. trudeau , great way to showcase that canadian politeness . 
  ** denmark : ** look how prepared the danish pm was , courtesy of a u/gaardsanger below https://m.9gag.com/gag/ayxopgw beautiful , really caught potus off guard . 
  you can see the uncertainty in his face . 
  i mean , who could possibly be ready for an overhand approach like that ? 
  well-done . 
  8/10 , danish pm wins it ** france : ** and as seen above , macron brings home a victory for france . 
  beating trump at his own game . 
  remarkable !, 
  ** and wow ** , a new development for me . 
  macron throwing absolutely massive shade towards trump in this video , and then trump attempts to enact revenge . 
  if you watch closely , macron goes for the pm of belgium handshake just before reaching trump . 
  ** not just one fake , but two ** . 
  macron even gives him a little pity pat at the end of the shake . 
  just unbelievable savagery here by the french president . 
  gives germany the consolation prize from merkel 's last meeting with trump , while simultaneously snubbing the potus . 
  ** expect an angry tweet later , france . 
  ** https://twitter.com/hollandreid/status/867751717387063296 ** germany : ** and as we know , poor merkel was denied participation . 
  got ta say home team wins by default . 
  better luck next time , germany . 
  got ta be more aggressive for that handshake , we all know trump is a germa ** ( n ) ** phobe https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yizpjzoeyrs ** japan : ** shinzo abe vs trump . 
  no denying this one . 
  absolutely taken for a ride . 
  the defeat is prominent on shinzo abe 's face . 
  japan has some work to do . 
  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t6vebs2avcu ** ireland : ** the pm of ireland in fact called trump out for his unique handshake !, 
  i 'd have to say trump did n't really try here , as he must 've been too intimidated to attempt the trumpshake . 
  ireland wins this round . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/16/donald-trump-reigns-widely-known-dominant-handshake-irish-prime/ ** tajikistan : ** ~ ~ not to be outdone by world powers and eu countries , tajikistan attempted to counter the trumpshake as well . 
  unfortunately , the president emomali rahmon fell prey to a new trump maneuver , which appeared to consist of spastic twitching/jerking . 
  tough luck tajikistan . 
  i doubt even justin trudeau/canada could 've countered that one . ~ ~ i 've done a review of this one , as suggested below . 
  i think emomali rahmon did attempt to counter this one , and it does look like he had a strong stance and was prepared for the jerk . 
  however , it looks like trump noticed he was in trouble , and seeing that he had never heard of tajikistan , could n't possibly let himself be one-upped by this country . 
  so he attempted a new maneuver , the previously described trumptwitch . 
  it definitely threw emomali rahmon off guard . 
  i might have to make this one a draw , perhaps a tajikistan edge . 
  trump clearly panicked , but he did manage to exert a small amount of control towards the end with the twitch . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ude9grckb4u ** montenegro : ** recently got word that montenegro entered the fray as well . 
  however , it appears you 've definitely fared worse than japan/germany , as your pm du\u0161ko markovi\u0107 was not even granted a trumpshake , but instead a shove !, 
  unbelievable !, 
  there 's simply no recovering from that one . 
  personally , i would resign . 
  http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/25/politics/trump-pushes-prime-minister-nato-summit/index.html ** united states : ** as a bonus , we 've got mike pence stepping into the ring too . 
  definitely a trump victory , but overall a net loss for the united states.https : / / www.youtube.com/watch?v=cba5ngr0ene alert your leaders folks , they should be ready for this final : final score trump with a 2-5-1 , win/loss/draw record . 
  and a loss for the us as a whole . 
  good night europe . 
  good luck with our potus tomorrow, 
  * sigh *, 
  no one said our logic is sound, 
  they 're nothing . 
  no ideals , standards , and convictions . 
  all they have in common is hate for muslims, 
  i 've only been to paris and some of the country side/small towns outside of it . 
  i stayed little over a week , and it rained almost everyday . 
  is that common ? 
  food was delicious , and i saw all of the classic paris sights , but i did n't want to be too much of a tourist . 
  i know a decent amount from ww2 history . 
  people like to joke about france surrendering , but no one every mentions just how scarred the country was from ww1 . 
  france was instrumental in ww1 , and as a result , lots of soldiers were killed and the military was n't really up for another invasion , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  and then there was the vichy regime , which was southern france , right ? 
  also , the us owes france for their efforts in our revolutionary war . 
  thanks for the freedom , france !, 
  sorry about the whole freedom fries bit , you guys were totally right on that one . 
  also , doctors without borders was founded in france/by the french , and i very much hope to join one day . 
  la grave is an amazing ski resort , and i hope to go one day . 
  it 's featured on my skis http://skipass.fr/p/news/115541/micro-news-k2-coomback-la-grave-9a6a2-1.jpg ( if a french speaker would translate , i would n't mind ) and you have lots of nuclear power ( 75 % ish ? ), 
  which is a great idea and i wish we had more of that . 
  thank you for the freedom france !, 
  so it looks like the polls were spot on, 
  holy shit dude, 
  on a serious note , what 's the atmosphere like tonight over there ? 
  ah yes , france , the third world hell hole ( ? ),
