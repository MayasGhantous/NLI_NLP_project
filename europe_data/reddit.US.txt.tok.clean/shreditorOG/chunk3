  the putinbots are working overtime over at r/the _ donald, 
  tonight or tomorrow ? 
  what mountain range ? 
  what time do polls close ? 
  pro eu crowds protesting against essentially ( kind of ) pro eu government about being pro eu ? 
  portrayed like that , or do their policies reflect that ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  is the current government anti eu then ? 
   largest american aircraft carrier, 
  what kind of power does the french president have ? 
  i suppose macron at least wants to stay in the eu . 
  do n't they have binding regulations ? 
  otherwise , go melenchon . . ? 
  so who 's got the best policies to tackle climate change ? 
  oh thats perfect thanks, 
  looks like an awesome climb . 
  jealous, 
  that 's a great view, 
  indeed !, 
  as a result , mn is a bit more progressive than its neighboring states . 
  also we have lots of saunas and the climate is similar . 
  gets pretty frigid indeed . 
  but beautiful wilderness , like the boundary waters, 
   minnesota my grandpa was slovene and he started our family in mn, 
  you 'd like minnesota, 
  ooh sorry bout that  . 
  i lived in co last year so i had to hide my wild support . 
  i think mn has a couple swedes !, 
  also fun fact , probably not as big a deal in sweden , but cool if you 're a hockey fan . 
  the team that played the miracle on ice game had mostly college kids who grew up within 30 min of where i live , up in rural mn . 
  a guy who scored went to my high school . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miracle_on_ice#the_soviet_and_american_teams sweden got the bronze that year !, 
  oh jesus i did n't know . 
  i see that map , its a pretty solid division of liberal/conservative states . 
  im not surprised . 
  im pretty sure it does n't happen in school anymore thankfully . 
  in homes , as a form of discipline . 
  but it seems to be rare now, 
  ooh i like hockey too . 
  im from minnesota , so i 'm all about that mn wild . 
  except they shit the bed this year in the playoffs , thats pretty standard for minnesota sports, 
  ha yeah what the heck are all of you swedes doing up already anyway ? 
  is it cause the sun rises at 1am now, 
  hah yep !, 
  it 's also kind of a cultural thing here still , like `` you better hush up and listen to your parents , respect your elders , dont be a sissy '' type culture . 
  especially in more rural/conservative areas , like where i grew up, 
  it 's legal here in the us still . 
  i recall my parents spanking me once or twice , but never actually caused any real pain . 
  arguably deserved it . 
  my parents are fantastic , they 're not abusive lol . 
  but my grandmother spanked my whenever i misbehaved . 
  she would use a wooden spoon sometimes . 
  never anywhere but my bum . 
  my mom and dad told me stories of how their parents used to spank them and their siblings for misbehaving . 
  it sounded pretty extreme . 
  but it 's dying out , even in the us . 
  i will not be hitting my children, 
  banned ? 
  what country , if you do n't mind me asking, 
  east germany had the fastest woman in the 400 meter dash https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marita_koch no one has come within 1 second of her time , which is a huge gap , especially at the olympic level . 
  there was also a drug use controversy around her https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heike_drechsler#doping_allegations, 
  no powder ? 
  i want to go to reine very badly right now, 
  have fun !, 
  i used to live there ( co ) . 
  silverton and steamboat are my favorite resorts .

  good pick of states, 
  how does the 15 % of your income factor into the rest of your taxes ? 
  that 's a good question , never thought of that . 
  we do n't know though !, 
  we thought he was dead lol, 
  i 'll ask my parents , i never knew my gpa . 
  died when i was very young e : u/alenizslo , apparently he was born around planina , but he was in maribor during the war . 
  other relatives of his were in ljubljana ( those are the relatives we know now ) we 're * pretty * sure he fought with the resistance in the area . 
  thing is , he never talked about it much to my dad , aunt , or uncle . 
  most everything we found out was from relatives that are still in slovenia . 
  that 's kind of you , but we really deserve it, 
  sorry for not answering as someone from europe , but my grandfather was slovenian , and came to the us to escape his village , which was apparently wrecked by the war . 
  we hold family reunions once every few years with relatives still in slovenia , and we 've managed to trace our ancestors to 1605 . 
  a guy named simon !, 
  interesting people , we all thought my grandfathers brother had died in the war . 
  turns out , he made it to south america somehow . 
  and had several kids . 
  during our search for ancestors , we found a friend of a friend of his who told us he made it to brazil . 
  we actually met relatives of mine born in brazil , with very slovene last names . 
   too many dumb people blindly following a ` strong ' leader who 's really just a pussy that ca n't handle criticism [ :( ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/donald-trump-lashes-out-at-saturday-night-live-says-alec-baldwins-impression-stinks ), 
  what is this ?

  ah well , when we say dating , it usually means in a relationship with . 
  like your girlfriend or boyfriend .

  i do n't know , i did n't mention american dating .
