operating and conquering are two very different things . 
   but has never proven itself technically true , but only because no country ( read : russia ) has dared test it militarily , which is due to the us 's power and presence . 
  the industrial revolution that started in the uk , a capitalist nation . 
  and there has always been human labor so i do n't know what that was supposed to mean . 
  capitalism : the reason we are able to produce a global surplus of food in the first place . 
  voluntarily withdraw from the richest market in the world ? 
  bold move , cotton . 
  from now on i will choose to believe this is what the us flag looks like to dogs and the color blind . 
  yes . 
  as i said :  that 's literally what the treaties are for . 
   question is where you eventually stop nato and major non-nato allies ( japan , s korea , australia , etc ) . 
  that 's literally what the treaties are for . 
  i believe what he was implying was that we would not risk nuclear war for ukraine because it is not a nato or major non-nato ally . 
   a full list of 39 incidents since march 2014 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/full-list-of-incidents-involving-russian-military-and-nato-since-march-2014-9851309.html, 
  that would be just as bad from the russian pov . 
   pac-3 no . 
  iirc there were plans to do so under the bush administration but obama canceled them when he took office . 
  poland was not amused . 
  huh , i did n't know turkeys had balls that big . 
  til, 
  what about total production ? 
  that seems more relevant to me since exports is just part of overall production . 
  wow ... france has almost as many people employed in the agricultural sector as the us . 
  your link says france had 1.42 mil ( 5.6 % of all jobs in france ) in 2012 . 
  [ the us had just 2.13 mil in 2014 ( 1.4 % of all jobs ) ] ( http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm ), 
  how much of the food do they produce with that land i wonder ? 
   many many farmers sounds inefficient . 
  that 's probably why they need so many eu subsidies and also why these same farmers literally destroy the product from other eu nations while the french police looks the other way . 
   they need urgent subsidies , and guaranteed quotas of wine , purchased by the government i was watching a geopolitical lecture the other day and the lecturer said 20 % of all eu agricultural subsidies go to france . 
  minority russian wheat was obviously being oppressed by neo-nazi farmer so putin was forced to liberate . 
  clear as day . 
  wow , so much is wrong in this post i do n't know where to begin . 
   they do n't have a unified healthcare system we also do n't have doctors going on strike because they make so little money . 
   they have crippling poverty for the first world [ us poverty rate = 15.1 % , uk poverty rate = 16.2 % ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=69 )  they have extreme wealth inequality [ yeah , it 's sooooo much worse than the uk , right ? 
  ] ( http://insidestory.org.au/are-the-rich-getting-richer-and-the-poor-getting-poorer ), 
   seato seato was dissolved in 1977 . 
   i 'm ok with being europe 's safety net against russia , but right now we are a hammock i 'm stealing this . 
  it 's too good . 
  yeah , but legalizing things can be seen as being ` soft on crime ', 
  that 's because they are not known to do it illegally in vast numbers . 
   i get the feeling that it isnt a high regard for trump so much as a widespread desire to burn down the establishment . 
  on the conservative side that amounts to backing trump , on the left it amounts to backing sanders . 
  yes . 
  that 's this election cycle in a nutshell , folks . 
  no no no , he was a * stupid * buffoon , not a * crazy * one . 
  because the republicans also brand themselves as the ` family values ' and ` tough on crime ' party . 
  cool , thanks for the tip !, 
  that 's a great description . 
   foucault 's pendulum i loved that book . 
  [ that 's a lot of nuts !,

  a 10 years old device is worth shit . 
  and yes , even pauper need leisure , weird . 
  this is still pathetic . 
  home gaming systems did n't become widespread until the 1980s , so according to your ` logic ' anyone who existed before then had no options for leisure . 
  what an idiotic and desperate argument to make . 
   except the data you provided are after various gov. 
  help . 
  ca n't read your own sources properly ? 
  amazing . 
  then provide a picture of a starving american . 
  you ca n't because they do n't exist . 
  and maybe you should look to your own country before feverishly exaggerating problems in other countries : http://www.france24.com/en/20150214-down-out-paris-homeless-france-poverty-sdf-housing http://www.thelocal.fr/20150203/france-growing-homeless-crisis http://www.prainc.com/homelessness-in-paris/ , 
   30 % of poor household have a `` video game system '' ( and i assume the gov ' do n't make the difference between a 10 years old device and a recent one ) . 
  lol . 
  `` oh those poor people using an xbox360 instead of an xbox one ! '', 
  the fact you are outraged over that is pathetic . 
   so , are you going to say to those 6 % it 's though luck and they do n't deserve it because their neighbor got an xbox ? 
  no , i would just realize that no system is perfect - including the european ones . 
  [ also , just because people are hungry does n't mean they are starving to death . 
  it just means they utilize the food assistance programs already in place . 
  ] ( http://www.nutrition.gov/food-assistance-programs ) i know you euros like to pretend we do n't have programs like these but ... 
  those stats are from the us dept of energy , but i would n't expect you to know that since you probably did n't even read it . 
  [ air conditioning , cable tv , and an xbox : what is poverty in the united states today ? 
  ] ( http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/07/what-is-poverty ) oh those poor americans !, 
  yeah , but has the british government ever told the london times they expected germany to have kittens after they sank the bismarck ? 
  i would just like to point out that when the simpsons first started gaining the huge popularity it now has way back in the late 80s/early 90s that president bush sr. mentioned in a speech that he believed the show had a bad influence on the precious , innocent children of america ( america `` ought to be more like the waltons and less like the simpsons '' ) . 
  this of course only led to the simpsons becoming even more popular than they already were . 
  fast forward to 2016 and the pentagon 's top policy official on russia has actually used a bart simpson catchphrase ( `` have a cow '' ) in remarks to the ny times when describing the reaction the russians will have to a military buildup . 
  god bless america . 
  that is all . 
  thank you for the source . 
  the timing of the airbus cancellation with this [ announcement yesterday of increased equipment purchases by the us for eastern europe ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/world/europe/us-fortifying-europes-east-to-deter-putin.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=homepage&amp;clicksource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;wt.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0 ) is perhaps not just a coincidence . 
  it all may very well be part of a larger deal that will also include more nato bases in poland that they have been asking for . 
  that 's not a source . 
   us government has broke the promise once . 
  you do realize the primary purpose of that shield was to shoot down missiles from small rogue states like iran/north korea that would have only very few missiles or terrorists who may acquire one ? 
  that shield would not have much practical use against russia if they launched nukes in great numbers . 
  only mad is an adequate deterrent for that and only the us provides that . 
   i 'm sorry , but you 're completely missing your point . 
  no i 'm not missing your point , i just think it 's absurd . 
  you said :  how this makes you a better partner than france in troubles with our eastern neighbor ? 
  if you think russia is more worried about france than they are the us then you are delusional . 
   i do n't believe that he has seen the documents at least once . 
  have you seen them ? 
   it was all about selling worse product by using the false cause of supporting polish workers and industry . 
  i 'd like to see the source that has determined the lockheed product is worse , please . 
  did france build you a missile shield then ? 
  fair enough , i was only remarking on what this article said . 
   the choice was whether it would be airbuses new factory ( it was already arranged it would be located in l\u00f3d\u017a ) or using the already existing lockheeds one .
