  cancel the purchase of a few f-22 and f-35 planes . 
  do n't contract out food services - instead , have the military peel their own potatoes and cut their own vegetables . 
  do n't build fast-food `` restaurants '' that look just like the ones at home . 
  do n't spread out military factories all over the place . 
  do n't allow generals and admirals to have jobs at defense companies within 10 years of retirement . 
  our military has a ton of waste in it that goes to the ceos and politicians of the infamous military-industrial-congressional complex , leaving very little for soldiers . 
  if the cost of making a bottle is only one penny , it might actually be worth it . 
  as long as you do n't write it down in your records as if you somehow sold a $ 100 bottle of wine . 
  the criminal part was the way that the collapse of subprime assets could impact the prime assets . 
  if the subprime assets were totally isolated , then even if their value went to $ 0 , there would be little to no impact . 
  are we actually seeing the end results of a scheme to move money from european taxpayers into a few banks , laundered through the piigs governments ? 
  maybe i 'm trying to relate this to the us crisis too closely . 
  * state of play in previous 4 euro years ( last 2 tele-conf ) * moscowicz 's ( moscowiez 's ? ), 
  round up, 
  malta - old people retiring with a nice view of the sea ? 
  til that istanbul was constantinople until ** 1930 ** i had previously thought that it was first renamed when it was conquered by the ottomans . 
  the classic problem of polls - they only represent people who take polls and are willing to spend long hours on the phone , answering many questions . 
  the only reason that polls work in the usa is because that is the same demographic that votes often . 
  * let the banks fall , but guarantee personal deposits with sovereign funds . 
  * let the government credit rating fall . 
  they will not be able to get loans for a long time . 
  this is actually ** okay ** . 
  * use a new currency , but do n't hyperinflate . 
  do ** not ** try to pay any foreign debts with the new currency . 
  just let those debts go to junk status . 
  * the government must now successfully restructure its bureaucracies to maximize efficiency , switch as much paper as possible to electronic , and in general run things competently . 
  this is the hard part . 
  * aggressively pursue government investment in something that will be important in the future , like robots , new road technology , or w/e . 
  the problem is that 1 % - ers do n't like step 1 . 
  they would rather that all governments somehow have a aaa credit rating and that banks would stay propped up , even if the people all turn hollow . 
  1 % - ers for some reason hate the idea that the whole trans-government loan system would just stop due to too much risk , but the people could make a living with solid goods and technology . 
  man i hope / r/europe does n't turn into / r/news - constant titillating shock and horror based on individual events, 
  hey it 's / u/koleye !, 
  more on-topic - marshall plan 2 should work , if we can also get the 1 % greeks to pay their taxes . 
  but we have a hard time doing that in the usa . 
  / r/paradoxpolitics by the way we could always use more commenters and submitters, 
  you tell the military to just get it over with . 
  quickly . 
  no nation building . 
  just make a desert and call it peace . 
  preferably attack the * correct * countries , too . 
  rather than the country that 's in the opposite direction of where the terrorists are coming from . 
  only reason why things have n't been resolved yet is entangling alliances and oil politics . 
  once upon a time they were but now , bronies have become their own subculture . 
  they like cute ponies only , to the exclusion of all else . 
  they may not even be aware of furries anymore . 
  i 've seen furries try to create pony content to reach out to the bronies , but to no avail . 
  they 're effectively competing styles of art . 
  now i want to see a map of furry preferences , both in europe and in north america . 
  what if there was some secret hessian club of foxboys , waging war against the rostock sharkgirls ? 
  the euro makes us european . 
  makes us more than european . 
  makes us european no more . 
  fear the old euro . 
  the british would say that they have a historical place , already used for one famous individual , that just needs a new airport . 
  as if the nsa ever actually did anything useful with their data or the fbi ever paid sufficient attention to actual terror plots or the cia ever stopped manipulating and disrupting countries just to show that they can , with no regard for long-term consequences or military intelligence was ever interested in anything other than an excuse to procure and use more expensive yet broken equipment, 
  that 's an american style of school funding hope that cz is able to get the hell away from that, 
  americans do n't want the death of the eu , that would make tourism near impossible . 
  euro - problem is that either the requirements to adopt it are too loose , or countries have rushed into it too quickly, 
  so sayeth winston churchill, 
  it looks more like / r/europe has gotten invaded by english defense league members wearing scary masks . 
  i come to this sub explicitly looking for bilingual comments because they seem to make all * reasonable * people more happy , and more comfortable with sharing their unique cultural flavor . 
  i 'm not saying it was aliens , but ... aliens . 
  that 's hella tight and looks wicked sick yo , be all like less cray-cray than the old school stuff know what i mean ? 
  * this looks better !, 
  hey , i liked burial 's `` u hurt me '', 
  russia seems to be using the north korea strategy - it 's okay to burn down your own country and become enemies with all neighbors , as long as the leadership can party like crazy . 
  as someone who spends hours on soundcloud.com every day , the dutch djs surely compensate for the other things . 
  the first two images make it look like cameron is interested in getting special treatment from merkel - and he is having more success than george w. bush . 
  in all seriousness though , why did n't cameron use this channel of communication earlier ? 
  it seemed like he hyped up brexit and the like before having a simple `` define-the-relationship '' conversation with europe . 
  disclaimer : not a european ... in fact , a non-white american * medieval and renaissance architecture * traditions relating to odin / wotan , perkunas , and the like * roman ruins * archaeological finds of roman , germanic , nordic , etc. 
  battles * stone structures that have been continuously under construction for 500 + years , with sections that obviously come from different architectural eras * romance , germanic , and finno-ugric languages that are very different from each other , even within short distances . 
  * knights in full-plate armor wielding two-handed straight swords * laws about things like - if a foreigner is caught with a longbow then he may be killed , but if he has a sword then he can infiltrate without any hassle . 
  but ... are the stamps in the list of recognized kolechian visas ? 
  ah-ha , so the vampires left transylvania to live in serbia , where people will vote for them to rule over the world . 
  sjws include a few people who have actually been bullied, 
  so if he wields a crossbow or sword then he is free to infiltrate ? 
  i do n't know about that . 
  it seems like gibraltar 's main role is to serve as a special district for eu corporations . 
  imagined the article being spoken in a [ danish accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  til that `` cooooool '' is translated as `` cooooool '' in france . 
  with pay like that ... you 'd basically have to put your hopes on gi bill education and other such benefits in order to make any decent profit . 
  the first image looks like it needs walking butts with trumpets, 
  i support solar panels , but i also support ... * nuclear * !, 
  can we fight now ? 
  sounds like the north korean strategy, 
  alexander died before he could have a big military loss . 
  / r/news is full of reactionaries and other sorts of folk who post hate on all the news sites , and anything good is probably a repost or a repetitive issue / r/worldnews is full of various spy agencies and shills trying to control public discussion / r/europe at least seems to appreciate facts , evidence , and thinking about things about 10 % more . 
  edit : also a big fan of certain comics and games , which the majority of americans do not like so much, 
  surprising ? 
  there is always that one commenter who says `` why are you so surprised ? '', 
  the important thing is to overcome the feeling of learned helplessness , and to slowly build up alternative , parallel , independent social orders and systems , then suddenly pull out the rug from under the rich when the time is right . 
  which explains a lot about his doom 2 maps and his games . 
  price . 
  american corporations are spending all the h1b visa slots on indians , with occasional chinese . 
  american corporations would also rather have illegal mexicans , than citizens who have rights . 
  they could easily get cheap citizen workers from the poor parts of the usa , but they do n't . 
  student visas go to the spoiled children of wealthy chinese businessmen . 
  and i say this as an ethnic chinese .
