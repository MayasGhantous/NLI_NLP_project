  i imagine it 's something similar for the roma . 
  poverty is obviously quite common amongst them . 
  couple that with centuries of an us versus them mentality , existing prejudices which make it hard for roma who want to improve to get a job and a general cultural taboo against mixing too much with ` outsiders ' and you get group that is liable to commit more crimes . 
  i 'm from the states as well but i do have a related story . 
  i 'm aware it 's purely anecdotal but it 's just my experience . 
  my grandfather was a us navy chaplain stationed in naples for a few years . 
  i was going to europe ( italy included ) for a student trip so i asked him about some things i should expect etc. 
  he goes on about a few different things but then he goes on a little rant about ` gypsies . ', 
  apparently my grandmother had gotten her purse stolen when they first got there because she stopped to give money to a roma child begging and another guy cut the strap and ran with it . 
  new sailors/officers and their families occasionally had this issue . 
  i of course write this off as just my grandfather being a somewhat racist old man ( which looking back was out of character for him being as i had never heard him utter a racist sound before ) . 
  the third day in rome , the story changed a little . 
  we were having a bit of free time to browse the shops . 
  our tour guide even warned us `` there are a lot of ` gypsies ' begging around here , do n't pull your wallet out to give them money . '', 
  of course one girl ca n't help but do it and get 's her wallet snatched . 
  from talking with the italian tour guide , who we had for the whole trip , she basically had the opinion that most roma were not bad , it was just enough of the group that you had to be wary . 
  overall the feeling that i got was that people in europe had a very negative view of the roma . 
  the best way i can describe it to you is think of the way racist people in the extreme deep south ( alabama , mississippi etc ) view black people . 
  this is something people forget about texas . 
  we seem to be just like the rest of the crazy republican states , but if you actually listen to us we are more of a crazy libertarian state masquerading as a crazy republican state, 
   qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois i 'm not sure you know what you 're getting yourself into there . 
  never forget may 29 , 1453 . 
  i vote more bombs . 
  that always seems to work !, 
  * in a stunning news report , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdo\u011fan has renounced many of his previous actions that have been perceived as authoritarian to many in the world community . 
  when asked about his sudden change of heart , erdo\u011fan stated `` well i read this comment by / u/freefight on reddit and it totally changed my mind about everything i 've ever done . 
  and on the bright side , while it 's just as utterly incomprehensible , afrikaans sounds waaaay cooler . 
  while i think europe is doing well overall , do n't mistake your idea of ` enlightenment ' for anything else but its own specific ideology . 
  the ideas behind european democracy are themselves an ideology . 
  oh shit no . 
  in my state we would have killed him . 
  hints why i said it was out of their normal viewpoint . 
  people have differing opinions on what justice is . 
  if you have a set viewpoint that the death penalty is wrong , pushing for the death penalty for someone who killed someone you know is just vengeance . 
  if you already believe that the death penalty is a form of justice , then pushing for it is consistent with your view of justice . 
  while i personally do n't agree with him , i respect him it takes a lot of conviction to live through that kind of experience and not want to go out of your normal viewpoint for vengeance . 
  yeah in us prisons , child molesters are almost always put into solitary because they 'll be killed . 
  in a prison full of hardcore murders and rapists , the one thing nobody tolerates is someone who does that kind of stuff to kids . 
  eh , they 've been friends a long time . 
  i can imagine it would rub off . 
  it became more of a joke than anything . 
  my guess is the uk will just get some more exemptions, 
  revealed many things to me , the force has . 
  it was a little joke since it would be 10 years from now . 
  he should have been out of office by then even if elected to two terms . 
  there are really a number of possible ones . 
  ** most likely : ** really not that different from europe today . 
  uk will the eu probably leave but that is n't a major blow . 
  more security inter-cooperation and surveillance . 
  ethnic ghettos are probably larger and more of a problem but not an immense one . 
  social systems have probably degraded some . 
  schengen exterior borders are more secure . 
  ** likely : ** things did n't go well . 
  schengen has totally disintegrated under the pressure of mass-migration . 
  large populations of poorly assimilated muslim immigrants exist with extremely high poverty and unemployment rates . 
  lots of homegrown extremists thrive in these conditions . 
  social systems are very strained . 
  the uk and some other nations left . 
  the eu makes the un look like an effective organization with lots of real power . 
  ** unlikely : ** things went well . 
  the mass migration was dealt with using a combination of strong borders , stabilizing missions in the me/africa , assimilation and deporting those who failed to get asylum . 
  eu stretches all the way to the russian border with a unified security policy , fiscal policy and currency . 
  schengen borders are nigh impenetrable without being allowed in . 
  and the best part is the uk left and wants back in but they 're not being allowed . 
  ** vastly unlikely : ** shit really hit the fan . 
  mass migration , terrorism and ineffectual leadership has caused the eu to almost totally cease to exist . 
  far-right parties dominate most of the continent . 
  mass deportations and riots have caused most muslim immigrants to leave . 
  nationalism is on the rise again and germany has elected a leader with a funny mustache . 
  uk is unfortunately still in the eu . 
  ** i can taste the colors of the alphabet : ** everything is halal . 
  the ec has submitted to the will of allah and the prophet . 
  the niqab is mandatory for all women . 
  all pigs and dogs have been removed from the continent . 
  it 's armies wash across the world burning the infidels wherever they come across . 
  already the great satan 's capital has fallen along with most of the east coast to armies of al-andalus . 
  president trump has ordered a wall to be built along the appalachians and `` those europeans will pay for it . '', 
  in the east , the armies of sheikh winnicki has successfully invaded russia in the winter , there is talk of it being partitioned . 
  to the south , the armies of the blood-crazed caliph francis have conquered all of africa , the middle east and now march on india . 
  soon all the world will kneel before the ec . 
  the uk has adopted the euro . 
  what is wrong is a fundamentally perspective concept ( not talking about scientific facts ) . 
  it 's one of the concepts i struggle with the most . 
  what 's ` wrong ' with any idea and what makes some ideas more ` right . ', 
  i 'd love to tell you that the majority makes things truly right but we know that 's not true ( look at jim crow laws ) . 
  is it treason ? 
  depends on which side your on and who wins . 
  the only difference between revolution and rebellion is who wins . 
  to the crown the american revolution was treason . 
  to the loyalists it was baseless rebellion against our sovereign rulers . 
  to the patriots it was a just revolution . 
  and technically the declaration of independence is not a document in the legal framework of the united states government . 
  i would say that everyone has the right to overthrow an oppressive ( again with words that change based on people 's perspective ) government , but that those who support the government also have the right to fight back . 
  we should oppose the government if it 's wrong . 
  that concept is literally why my nation exists in the first place . 
  although armed revolution should always be an absolute last resort and only done when truly oppressed and totally unrepresented by the government . 
  not acknowledging the fact that people have different religions and languages is just pissing in the wind . 
  data can be used for bad things but it can also be used for good things . 
  if a hurricane hits an area with a high muslim population , sending a lot of spam in the relief goods is probably not a good idea . 
  it can also be used poorly as gerrymandering of political districts in the us has shown ( although i think the root cause is more because of how minorities typically vote rather than purely based on race ) germany 's anti-nazi laws are outdated .
