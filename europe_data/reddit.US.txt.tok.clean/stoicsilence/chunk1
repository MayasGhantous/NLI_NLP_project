  i wonder if singing kumbaya was a part of the curriculum . 
  we 're not racist !, 
  we just finished building the one world trade center and we do n't want it blown to pieces !, 
  do you know how much our insurance premium went up because of the little kerfuffle from the last two ? 
  is it uphill both ways ? 
  my university was like that . 
  true , the university only had 1400 students and the school of architecture only had 300 students with a student to professor ratio of 15:1 , but that level of faculty with a hands-on approach can be said of so many medium sized universities in the us of 20,000 students too . 
  did it give the king catharsis ? 
  there is a bit more to the japanese case . 
  i believe it has to do with the japanese notion of saving face . 
  confronting that past is a avenue to perceived dishonor . 
  however , as an american , we 're partly responsible for giving japan a `` soft '' treatment of its history after the war . 
  with the cold war revving up , we had bigger fish to fry and needed allies in the far east . 
  big sandcastles , ja ? 
  hahaha , i thought my comment was wrong , however given 3 upvotes thus far agreeing to that most basic of foreign policies i thought it unlikely . 
  little did i think it had to do with injustices that may or may not be justified , yet read as a non sequitur to the topic at hand !, 
  it 's good now that 's all cleared up . 
   edit : spelling, 
  clarify . 
  the point is to gradually nurture the nation such that it would never wean itself back to russia , even in its most dire of circumstances . 
  when shit hits the fan , we would like serbia to look to the eu first and the states second for support . 
  not russia . 
  by that same metric we 're both right . 
  corruption is the result of a `` culture of rampant selfishness and anti-community narcissism that permeates all levels of society and socio-economic classes , '' including government institutions . 
  somewhere in my parents generation something went wrong . 
  corruption before the 1960 's was limited to wall street not main street . 
   i see this argument thrown in a lot but i do n't think there are that much people like this . 
  and if there are n't much why make the life of everyone more complicated just to avoid a few people using the system . 
  in many ways a nation 's culture dictates the intentions of the welfare recipient . 
  in the states , it would seem we have a lot of welfare abusers . 
  a culture of extreme self righteous individuality leads to a culture of rampant selfishness and anti-community narcissism that permeates all levels of society and socio-economic classes . 
  ok so same thing then . 
  a sub-prime lending crisis . 
  wait wait . 
  explain ? 
  sounds eerily familiar ... oh wait ... our housing bubble ... 
  keeping them in the union does n't help either . 
  greece , italy , and spain are bound to a currency that is stronger that what their economies can naturally produce if they were alone , the drachma , lira , and paseta . 
  moreover , their economies are consistently and easily crushed by the weight of france , spain , the low countries and other strong and resilient countries . 
  there are only 2 ways to resolve the issue : a stronger central federal government that can support and rehabilitate their economies by overriding the decisions of the local national governments , and that takes on managing the loan of money from the creditor countries . 
  ( what 's happening now , to use the america example , its as if the wealthy states of new york and california loan money to the poor and bankrupt state of michigan . 
  its forbidden for states to loan each other money , so when a state borrows money its always from the federal government , or in this case , it would be from the collective tax revenue of the european union ) this method is unlikely to happen . 
  again superimposing an american style stronger federal government on the union would be politically disastrous at the current time . 
  i can only imagine the freedom demonstrations and the unfounded anti-german expansionism rhetoric . 
  the culture of being independent is centuries deeper than the culture of working as a collective group . 
  the uk not joining the union at the most superficial levels is a prime example of this . 
  the second alternative is that they break away from the union and the drachma , lira , and paseta are restored . 
  remember how i said if the southern countries broke away i would contemplate my real estate options for a vacation villa on the med ? 
  there 's alot of truth behind that joke . 
  how strong would the american dollar , the british pound , the euro , the yen , and the yuan would be against the southern currencies ? 
  for regions that rely so heavily on tourism , how cheap would it be for me as an american , or for the northerners to have a vacation in the med ? 
  how cheap would it be to open factories and create manufacturing jobs in `` relatively '' stable countries with an educated workforce and pay the workers in the local currency ? 
  political instability aside , why would n't i invest in a new super cheap country with so many discounts and deals to be had and flood it with my money ? 
  the germans have different demographics , different industrial structure , and most importantly of all , a different culture , a different group psychology . 
   this is actually a more surreal conversation when considering you 're from the us , since you are in particular a fiscal union , a true union of transfers , with a common federal budget and financed via mutual debt . 
  that offsets the unbalances a common currency brings to the weaker economies . 
  europe is ( shamefully ) lacking those mechanisms . 
  this is only possible with a strong and politically united federal government that reigns preeminent ( and ideally libertarian ) over all the client states . 
  if michigan does n't want to pay back the loans it received through treasury bonds , the federal government will hold them liable . 
  would the union be more cohesive if brussels could force its client states to pay back their loans and remove from them the ability to say \u039f\u03c7\u03b9 ? 
  possibly . 
  from my , as you pointed out , american experience it would be . 
  but i 'm more reluctant to impose an american federal system on europe , for the same reasons i 'm reluctant to wholeheartedly adopt a nordic style welfare state here in america . 
  a system only works so far as what the dominant culture allows of it . 
  from my perspective , there is n't at the current time a strong enough pan-european cultural identity for a political union to support an economic union . 
  3-5 years is rare even for me . 
  in southern california , the last time it snowed in any of the coastal beachside cities ( mountains do n't count ) was 70 years ago . 
  its probably a similar situation in australia , south africa , and chile . 
  but they are different in very key ways . 
  what i 'm saying is that the climate in the mediterranenan region is like taking one slice out of a pie that happens to be apple , and then calling the rest of the pie apple when in fact , it is mostly cherry . 
  what i should have said , to ease the confusion , is the rest of the world 's `` mediterranenan '' climates should be classified as something else . 
  the med clearly gets more snow in the winter , but the insularity of the med sea retains more heat , allowing for more humid summers and more prevalent [ hot-summer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_climate#hot-summer_mediterranean_climate ) climate conditions . 
  the rest of the the word 's `` med '' climates gets cold currents along their coasts flowing from the arctic to the equator , decreasing the amount of sweltering summer time humidity , while ensuring a [ warm or cool summer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_climate#warm-summer_mediterranean_climate ) climate . 
  you still gon na call me retarded champ , or are you gon na take your downvotes as a valuable lesson in humility ? 
  do n't know if you 're deliberately acting like a troll . 
  the places i 've listed , though classified as having a mediterranean climate , have more in common with one another than the mediterranean region which gives the climate it 's name . 
  when was the last time it snowed * regularly * in perth australia , cape town south africa , or los angeles california if at all ? 
  when was the last time those places had summer humidity like barcelona or athens ? 
  put some effort into understanding what i 'm saying before you post disparaging clap trap . 
  great . 
  but again they 're not buying now and they wo n't buy after their decision to stay or leave the union because , in your own words , they do n't have the money . 
  so again what difference does it make ? 
  the northern countries are n't making money now and they 're not making money off of countries who do n't have any money to buy . 
  what 's yours ? 
  if theyre not buying german crap now and they wo n't buy german crap after they break away so what ? 
  your whole point before was that austerity has halted spending so in that sense nothing has changed . 
  they still lack key industries in which they will have to rely on their northern neighbors for goods and services . 
  the same people but now with tariffs in the way .
