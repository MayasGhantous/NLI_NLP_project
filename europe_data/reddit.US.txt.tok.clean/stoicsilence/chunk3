  investment , creating jobs through outsourcing , and slowly building a middle class over course of decades , may be such a resolution .

  but brits kinda already do that in med anyways :\\,

  i 'd say licking a [ cane toad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cane_toad#defenses ) would get you more bang for your buck as far as recreational pharmaceuticals go .

  americorp is actually a proud subsidiary of the shadow corporation formed by the comcast-timewarner merger that `` did n't '' happen . 
  i 'm not supposed to tell you this , insider secrets and all , but the * official * pentagon address is really just a mailing address where the defense contractors ship in contributions to the executive hookers and coke fund . 
  what actually happens is youre routed to a call center in new delhi and you 're placed on hold for several hours as russian troops storm the borders and a rendition of bruce springsteen 's `` born in the usa '' is sung over the phone in a thick indian accent .

  we do like exporting shit to make money . 
  r/polandball has been great for exporting bantz . 
  my personal goal is to capture the market share of all the british bantz through mergers and hostile takeovers . 
  its rather fitting in a way . 
  they lost at sport to the germans and the australians , they lost at being shitty tourists to the russians and the chinese , and they lost at empire to us . 
  we might as well buy out the bantz sector of their economy too . 
  careful with that ethnic fractional calculus there . 
  its gives the euros nosebleeds from snorting too much when they laugh . 
  you did diversify . 
  that celine dion export really took off . 
  23 $ an hour for a part time washer ? 
  the luxury :(, 
  would you drive a car with an `` underwater incident '' on its record ? 
  would you still drive it if you found out it was previously driven and wrecked by an italian ? 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  latvia still can not into potato . 
  can only into more much pain and suffer . 
  while moldova into nordic !, 
  such is life . 
  correct . 
  this is an adequate and justifiable response for an offender violating ones personal space . 
  tazers and pepper spray are grossly defective in that they leave the possibility open for additional violations . 
  but not in finland . 
  i imagine the difference is like that of a soloist to an orchestra . 
  sometimes suffering is all the sweeter when its harmonized in a choir . 
  them wacky nordics and their winter sports, 
  yeah but its not as if the selection has improved . 
  that 's like saying `` good news gay community !, 
  there 's more eligible bachelors ! '', 
  when you add in the statistics of misogyny and homophobia to the equation things look bleak . 
  shhhhhhh !, 
  do not mention `` the-sub-that-should-not-be-named '', 
  county . 
  as in the administrative district smaller than a state that lacks an `` r '' in its name . 
  mine has its lowest elevation at sea level and its highest point is 8831 feet or 2697 meters . 
  my county has higher peaks and we 're at sea level . 
  most of them were eastern orthodox too so thus far there have n't been any incidents, 
   but there are definitely problems with the idea of large numbers of people being unemployable for an extended period of time ( or employed in jobs that are pretty susceptible to terminations , say menial ones ) , while they also come from a totally different culture and in some measure harbour some ( understandable ) resentment against the west . 
  prepare for at the very least more disenfranchised youth and tribal gang violence . 
  r/europe = ( ( r/polandball - 5 continents ) + facts ) got it . 
  they voted to stay as a territory because of tax benefits the sneaky parasites . 
  and that 's why sweet murican baby jesus invented nevada . 
  ` verify ? ', 
  have n't you learned anything these last 15 years ? 
  we do n't waste time over thinking things . 
  only fat ass american cops eat doughn ... oh . 
  there it is !!!, 
  :d honestly i 'm surprised about the 8 hour difference between your comment an the initial posting of the thread . 
  one expects comments like yours to happen sooner . 
   keeping in tradition with such a thread , i need to add a few blanket-statements condemning an entire people based on the actions of their government , ahem : never trust the american . 
  the american never gives . 
  the american only steals , lies , and cheats . 
  \\* sigh * here we go again . 
  that 's how distractions are supposed to work . 
  my meme senses are tingling . 
  \\* opens link * my meme senses were correct . 
  as much as we tried to beat order and cleanliness into the vocabularic cunt of the english language , she still has more bits and pieces than frankensteins monster . 
  it does n't help that you prefer her as a gutter slut who will spread her filthy legs to any foreign tongue who dares to inkhorn her drippy pus tainted blossom . 
  dearest father , we do n't believe in perpetuating french linguistic venereal diseases from 1066 . 
  we are . 
  something something ethnic fractional calculus something . 
  as amusing as it would bel r/europe is not r/polandball, 
  mestizo blood . 
  to what end ? 
  i thought yuros find the whole colonial imperialism shtick a bit blas\u00e9 ? 
  i mean fashions and fads come in cycles but really ... 
  make ... greece ... great again ?? 
   it 's all done in the name of ~ ~ freedom ~ ~ though , george w. told me its okay freedom \u2122 ftfy, 
  our socially conservative element needs to kill itself off in a bloody world war . 
  get the fuck out of here and do n't leave your tin foil hat behind . 
   eurocentric russia clarify . 
   we 're all a little too bigoted for that . 
  it runs in the anglo family ... that and a penchant for imperialism , oppressing brown people , bad food , and obesity . 
  stroke faster i 'm about to cum .
