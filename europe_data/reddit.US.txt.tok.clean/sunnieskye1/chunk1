i seriously wonder how much translation impacts what putin ( or any other world leader ) says , versus what we are told he says . 
  nuance does n't come across well in translation sometimes . 
  they have had ~ 700 years to iron out the issues . 
  thant 's ok , ill buy an older one !, 
  does the eu have amazon prime , with instant video ? 
  specifically , i guess , does sweden ? 
  you 're right about that !, 
  i wonder what putin thinks democracy is . 
  in a country that has never known it , i wonder what thoughts they have about it ? 
  we do n't know that they carry out our wishes , that 's why i included gerrymandering in my comment . 
  i live in texas , and it has been screwed with gerrymandering . 
  and i think `` more democratic '' would mean actually tallying all votes and letting the popular winner take the position . 
  i 'm not sure how russia elects their government , having never participated . 
  the electoral college is an outdated concept , and does truly need to be done away with , along with gerrymandering . 
  these 2 things do beg the question about manipulation of the electoral process . 
  bears no smart . 
  germany has said repeatedly that they wo n't give him asylum , and the reasons are obvious , even as pissed as they are about the bugging of ms. merkel 's blackberry . 
  [ latest on the asylum issue ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-parliament-divided-over-snowden-subpoena-in-nsa-investigation-a-964293.html ) , plus he 's much safer in russia than in a nation which cooperates with the us , ie , most of them . 
  [ here 's another take on it ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10746273/frances-le-pen-ban-non-pork-meals-in-schools.html ) that also excludes special foods for those who practice judaism . 
  i am a little happy to see this , as the lines have become so deeply blurred in the us where separation of church and state is in the constitution . 
  government and religion are bad bedfellows . 
  was n't it that fn does n't want halal foods in the schools any more ? 
  the title does suck . 
  there is some talk in the [ shetland islands about breaking away from scotland ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/30/shetland-independence-vote-scotland ) , whether or not scotland stays part of the uk . 
  the rest of `` you '' ? 
  i really think the copenhagen zoo needs to reexamine the future of it 's zookeeper . 
  just because there 's a `` science-y '' reason for doing this does n't make it right . 
  if you had 2 dogs and were being gifted another would you kill the first 2 just because they were no longer vital ? 
  what that zookeeper is doing , aside from the `` rules '' the zoo and others in that group have set up being totally arbitrary , is inhumane and stupid . 
  disposable animals . 
  disposable technology . 
  disposable people . 
  disposable planet . 
  [ kerry doing some hands-on diplomacy ] ( http://www.theonion.com/articles/john-kerry-poses-as-masseuse-to-get-few-minutes-wi,35546/?utm_source=the+onion&amp;utm_campaign=519b42b568-the_onion_weekly_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_6a8b5ad20e-519b42b568-17181741 ) . 
  perhaps old wealth knows the difference between the genuinely beautiful and the genuinely tacky . 
  i think new wealth believes that price is equivalent to quality . 
  lol , sorry , i always stick on stupid with the # of states , so yes , yes you are ... and guam and the virgin islands are 52 and 53 .  actually there are 50 . 
  war * is * a violation of sovereignty . 
  the difference with the us and iraq ( which invasion i was and still am disgusted by - useless and deadly , stupid and baseless ) is that bush was n't trying to bring iraq in as a 52nd state - he just wanted the oil . 
  but ... but ... it 's wikipedia !, 
  it has to be true !, 
  ok , thank you . 
  the way this reads , ukraine is trying to hold on to a region that does n't and never wanted to be part of ukraine . 
  wtf is going on over there ? 
  ( it 's obvious with kiev ; not so in crimea , then . ), 
   if it is the democratic will of the people . 
  there 's the rub , though . 
  this `` persecution '' did n't start until yanuchovich bailed . 
  surely not every single person in crimea wants to be annexed back into russia - ukraine became an independent nation relatively recently - where were those who wanted to remain a part of russia when that was happening ? 
  i think he may be in for a quick reminder . 
   ` understand this . 
  that if you do not fulfill our conditions then things will be as we decide , not as you decide ' . '', 
  government of the people , for the people , by the people . 
  it 's the only way to be sure . 
  ukraine has the most beautiful chance in the world to do this and keep it real . 
  there is a huge difference between california and the rest of america . 
  i 'm sure you heard it referred to as the left coast . 
  there 's a reason for that . 
  california ( even though it votes mostly republican , which is conservative for us ) has a long history of being liberal and laid-back . 
  and you are right , the people are friendly , life is easier , and the whole state is gorgeous . 
  tell you what , i 've always wanted to live in sweden . 
  trade ? 
  thank you !!, 
  this is almost the identical question ( what can we do to help ) that was asked by a different reddit user . 
  it will be usefull !, 
  may i post your comment in r/news ? 
  we are having a discussion right now about how to support and help the opposition in ukraine . 
  edit : i posted the entire thread . 
  here 's hoping !, 
  words of necessity . 
  a major war could come of this if everyone is n't extremely careful . 
  i am nervous about our ships being at sochi - too close , way too close . 
  another rubens : [ prometheus bound ] ( http://www.rubens.net/prometheus-bound.jsp ) . 
  i saw this at the getty center in la at a show of rubens and breugel . 
  it is huge , amazing , and i cried . 
  rubens blows me away . 
  i am a little surprised that , given northern ireland is still part of the uk , there are so many uk citizens living in the republic . 
  i wonder if the emigration is coming from n. ireland or from the main island itself . 
  reply 2 : since turkey is n't a member of the eu , but is a candidate ( per the info i can find ) why would they invade or attack greece ? 
  that would certainly stop any hopes they had of becoming part of the eu ... 
  i for some reason never thought greece was militarized . 
  i suppose with all they 've gone through lately , that fear may be well-grounded . 
  ummmmm , just how badly did greece need ordnance ? 
  who on earth would attack them ? 
  that was to me the scariest dr.w epi ever . 
  daleks , cybermen , all of them pale when i 'm somewhere surrounded by statues now . 
  just ca n't watch them all at the same time ... 
  [ not really ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy_ry8j_jdw ), 
   in the criminal complaint , we ask to hear technical expert and whistleblower edward snowden as a witness , and that he be provided safe passage and protection against extradition to the us . 
  no , just no . 
  mr. snowden is safe right where he is . 
  skype him , or whatever else , but leave him safe . 
  our guvs already break enough promises . 
  i do now !, 
  beautiful and informative , thank you !, 
  12 , 15 , and 39 kinda say it all - and are those lingonberries in the vodka in 39 ? 
  those things are amazing !!, 
  i 'll take all of them . 
  i hope so with all my heart . 
  ( their largest export , no doubt ),
