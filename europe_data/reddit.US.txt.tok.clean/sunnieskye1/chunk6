  and i will say i have sweated buckets over obama anyway , because he is a first . 
  he did , and may still , receive death threats , which is unconscionable to me . 
  it seems the office of potus has lost a lot of respect in america over the last 20 years or so . 
  more reason to guard it as the powerful position it is . 
  true . 
  yet no us president has been killed in office since jkf , and he was in texas when that happened . 
  i just think we tend to be too hollywood when it comes to things we do , compared to other parts of the planet . 
  it 's sort of a vicious circle . 
  action and reaction . 
  we drama queenz !, 
  best tweet :  turns out all it takes to get americans to care about soccer is some good old-fashioned organized crime .

  i 'm glad that the deal fell through , for the last reason you gave , and for the fact that russia does n't get their ships . 
  france handled this very well , imo . 
  maybe they could make repayment dependent on the same conditions as the sale . 
  it 's an added sanction , yes ? 
  even though france now may lose on the ships , i think they handled this very well . 
  and as the article points out , the ships can be reconfigured . 
  what a deal !, 
  russia refuses to meet france 's conditions for the sale ( basically , gtfo of ukraine ) , and gets money from france for non-delivery !, 
  edit : do i need to put an '' / s '' on this comment ? 
  [ this should help ] ( http://www.freakingnews.com/pictures/89500/american-gothic-with-vladimir-putin-s-head-on-a-pitchfork-89605.jpg ), 
  or halvah !, 
  this stuff is delicious , made with sesame seeds and honey , yum !!!, 
  i love it !, 
  it is available in the specialty sections of most grocery stores in the us , and i 've never figured out why more people do n't eat it . 
  read the article the op posted in the comments . 
  there is so much going on there that affect decisions in the rest of the world . 
  here 's a list of [ organisations that are based in the netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:organisations_based_in_the_netherlands ) . 
  something that caught my eye while looking at the list was [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_sigint_cyber_unit ) . 
  also , the hague is there . 
  easy to see why nsa would want to monitor internet traffic in that country . 
  nsa unfortunately goes * way * beyond terrorists , it has an interest in just flat-out spying , as well . 
  think [ merkel 's cell phone ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/04/germany-inquiry-nsa-tapping-angela-merkel-phone ) . 
  oklahoma has been freaking , too , after a [ 5.7 in 2011 ] ( http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/tag/earthquakes/ ) hit in zones where drilling and fracking were going on . 
  maybe i 'm just crazier than the average bear , but it makes sense to me that when oil is pulled out out the earth 's surface levels , leaving vast pockets of nothing , tectonics are going to cause issues eventually . 
  jeez , it 's our only planet , pay fucking attention to what it 's saying . 
   the incident comes just days after landscape gardener daniel jackson claimed he was refused a meal * at the same restaurant * because he ` looked like a homeless person ' . 
  so it 's dickishness at the one restaurant , or astonishing reinterpretation of corporate policy . 
  i 've never understood the pig-headed nature of politicians who continue to place greed/pet projects/special interests over people . 
  just today , i learned that greg abbott , the rookie governor of my state ( texas ) has passed a law forbidding cities in texas to regulate if and where fracking can occur . 
  denton [ passed a referendum ] ( http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/29485-since-the-city-of-denton-banned-fracking-texas-gop-moves-to-pre-empt-local-control ) , after quakes were felt , that no fracking could be done within the city limits , and now abbott has tossed that back in their faces . 
  [ if the integrity of the wells can not be maintained with our current technology ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/fracking/11097487/fracking-doesnt-contaminate-water-supplies-faulty-shale-gas-wells-do.html ) , then it does n't matter whether or not fracking is ` safe ' . 
  in addition to well-water contamination due to faulty drilling methods , there is also the [ earthquake problem ] ( http://oilprice.com/energy/natural-gas/u.s.-government-confirms-link-between-earthquakes-and-hydraulic-fracturing.html ) . 
  i realise that correlation is n't causation , but how much mounting evidence do we need to halt fracking until it can be done safely , or discarded because it 's not safe ? 
  sorry for the rant , but this is a topic that really annoys me when the decision of whether or not to use it is left in the hands of inept politicians . 
  ferry your bad self across that mersey , friend !, 
  off topic , but old song week ? 
  i actually got to quote a joni mitchell lyric last night in a different sub . 
  i like it !, 
  well , that sucks !, 
  we have a pretty good selection of films from all over the world , here . 
  but sometimes you have to dig . 
  i found eastern euro , scandinavian , french , russian , etc. , by looking at the buttons/categories right underneath the ` director ' section of films when i check the description . 
  if you already did that , i apologize for assuming !, 
  netflix is weird that way , there 's a lot more stuff there that is n't in the `` popular '' genres . 
  it 's the same with amazon prime , i guess they ca n't list everything . 
  and yeah , i would think since you 're right in the heart , as it were , it would be easy searching !, 
  `` tell no one '' is a good jumping off point for french/eng subtitles . 
  netflix has a whole subsection of french films , and subgenres in that . 
  it no 's nothing . 
  you are completely overlooking the fact that congress has bucked obama at almost every turn , that he 's had to resort to vetos and executive orders to get anything of importance done in his presidency , and that though there is n't a lack of congressional support for rubio 's `` points '' , they are not the views of a majority of americans . 
  rubio is a warmonger , a conservative , and most likely will not survive to become gop contender for the presidency . 
  pretty poison . 
  read this article very carefully . 
  was there not someone overseeing this ? 
  maybe they might have notice the first `` restoration '' was not a big success ? 
  maaan , i had forgotten how much i love playing with ff !, 
  thanks , buddy !, 
  nah , i 've noticed that it gets crazier with every update . 
  i will check those , though , thanks !, 
  if i could use firefox eternally , i would be happy !, 
  pretty much , i use chrome for reddit , and ff for everything else . 
  i ca n't wait for win10 and the new and improved edge !, 
  i loved win8 and 8.1 ... what the heck , i 'm just really happy with ms in general right now . 
  firefox has been my browser for years , but it also has gotten buggy and crashy , so i use chrome part of the time . 
  lets hope edge kicks butt !, 
  looks like it was ie 's last stand , as well . 
  yeah . 
  we badasses . 
  these were swat team members , not just regular garland police . 
  they were there because pamela gellar runs a serious anti-muslim organization and because geert wilders . 
  it would n't have looked good for texas or the us if mr. wilders had been killed . 
  so basically , if people do n't have flair , disregard ? 
  i once thought about moving to sweden , and correct me if i 'm wrong , but their website tells me i need $ 10k to do that , plus a few other stipulations that are more easily doable for me . 
  why are they willing to absorb people who are n't able to/won ' t contribute because of language and cultural barriers , but i have to have all this money plus complete language courses , etc ? 
  makes no sense , it 's almost like naivety only more dangerous . 
  putting my faith in picolo . 
  he got the green . 
  thank you , you are the only one who actually answered my question . 
  i had no idea that it was that cliquish there , or that that would cause the issues it seems to be causing . 
  in a way , i respect sweden for taking in all the people they are taking in , but in another way , i think it 's going to be the demise of their amazing society and country . 
  but i 'm not there , so i really do n't know if what i surmise is true , or if the media has blown it completely out of the water . 
  it just seems a bit absurd to me , to think that an influx of people who do n't integrate is n't going to have an effect . 
  why ? 
  no offence meant , but is n't that like burying your head in the sand ? 
  right ?!? 
  i 'm hoping it 's just a phase they 're going through . 
  obviously , they are committing macroagression . 
  i am amazed at the concept of microaggression .
