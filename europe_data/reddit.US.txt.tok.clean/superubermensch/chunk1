damn , this along with what another german said in this thread about being associated with lower class is pretty brutal . 
  how important is it to get a job ? 
  must be tough on the older generation to stay competitive for work . 
  like trying to keep up with new technologies plus having to learn a second language to get a job . 
  thanks !, 
  i just looked it up and found the episodes on youtube with english subtitles . 
  awesome !, 
  edit : apparently there 's two seasons . 
  check it , you might have some catching up to do . 
  cool . 
  i remember there was a funny gif posted here on reddit once of a girl in a wheelchair being pushed into a gymnastics vault . 
  it turned out to be from a recent dutch comedy and i watched the first episode of it without understanding any of it and found it pretty entertaining . 
  anyway , that was a while ago and i do n't remember what it was . 
  would you have any idea what show that is and if it 's any good ? 
  nothing new perhaps but i bet there 's already parts of american culture you have in your country/region that you do n't mind ? 
  this might be different than what you are talking about because it is not `` groove '' or specifically about jazz but self-expression in general . 
  i think similar to the `` can-do '' american attitude others mentioned here , there 's a feeling of `` just go for it '' which translates well into art . 
  especially something like jazz , which is based on improvisation and where you ca n't be having too much fear of failure . 
  however , when i was thinking about this i was liking it more to the type of music that comes out of growing up and finding yourself in american suburbia . 
  there 's this unique american mania-filled anxiety with an explosion of curiosity and wanting to burst out to explore the world and whatever it means to be american . 
  i grew up in it and i know that feeling . 
  the sounds of bruce springsteen , nirvana , modest mouse and the sort . 
  for example , arcade fire formed in canada but at the same time you ca n't take out what i 'm talking about from win butler 's songwriting and performance . 
  he grew up in texas and they even recorded an entire album based on [ the suburbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_suburbs_\\ ( album \\ ) ) . 
  there 's a new generation exploring it in hip-hop and more modern types of music and it 's really interesting . 
  i do n't know if this is your cup of tea but check this out by [ kevin abstract ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rsqavg7_qi ) i 'm sorry if i went way off topic but i do think there might be something and it 's nothing `` superior '' but just different places express themselves different and maybe since jazz is an american art-form that 's what people are looking towards . 
  by the way , i consider jazz in france one of the few instances of american culture in europe that actually feels authentic . 
  i liked that bit . 
  is the show consistently good ? 
  funny , my least favorite part of my american history class was the beginning where it 's pretty much european history and it was because of all the royalty . 
  go outside and walk around . 
  just ask this question to locals when you get there . 
  i always felt the uk messed up by not having freddie mercury and queen write a national anthem . 
  something like * [ in the lap of the gods ... revisited ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iexcpzc0mjk ) * that song gives me national anthem vibes . 
  that just sums up modern pop-country though . 
  if you like johnny cash there 's plenty of other good outlaw country with good story-telling . 
  i 'm not the biggest fan either so i do n't know too much but i do know there 's lots of good stuff out there . 
  lyon blew me away . 
  i was in paris and spontaneously decided lyon was going to be my next stop just by looking at a map and knowing i wanted to go south . 
  i went there knowing absolutely * nothing * about it . 
  i did n't even look it up to look at pictures or anything . 
  walking around in the park and suddenly seeing animals was the best . 
  i also loved just walking around the city and learning about it that way like the lumi\u00e8re brothers . 
  going to an electronics store and there 's kids playing hardcore porn on the big screen tv , laughing about it and getting in trouble . 
  you know , the history . 
  the whole thing was just a huge surprise to me . 
  glad i went there . 
  what ? 
  do you mean traditional folkloric music from different countries and cultures or are you asking for american folk music like bluegrass by people from different countries ? 
  how come ? 
  every time i go to colombia there 's always loads of german tourists . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  when/why did it become so popular ? 
  i grew up in florida . 
  native american history was never ignored in any history class i ever took . 
  in elementary school we went to a reservation and also went to the florida seminole museum . 
  maybe you just went to a shitty school . 
  yeah , and there 's more pueblos and cliff dwellings like [ taos pueblo ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=taos+pueblo&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiggmnfms_tahwemyykhxfudm4q_auicygc&amp;biw=2554&amp;bih=1339 ) , [ acoma pueblo ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=acoma+pueblo&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjoqugyl8_tahvb5yykhquocvqq_auicygc&amp;biw=2032&amp;bih=1339 ) , [ bandelier national monument ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=bandelier+national+monument&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjy3ifems_tahwjyyykhfo4dmcq_auicygc&amp;biw=2554&amp;bih=1339 ) , [ montezuma castle ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=montezuma+castle+national+monument&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj--uwqnm_tahxjoiykhroxczoq_auicygc&amp;biw=2554&amp;bih=1339#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=montezuma+castle+&amp;imgrc=-ekfwntgq_enkm: ), 
  i think it 's closer to 60 % ( non-hispanic white ) , and yeah german heritage is the largest within that . 
  cool . 
  thanks !, 
  thank you , these are all very good points . 
  my local channel shows our baseball , basketball and hockey teams plus college sports . 
  there are more sports people watch , had n't thought about that . 
  the amount of games is also important , that 's true . 
  for example , as a kid my favorite sport to watch was baseball , in which each team plays 162 games in 180 days in the regular season . 
  i almost could n't imagine watching those games without those voices . 
  it 's definitely a change you have to get used to when someone retires or leaves . 
  also , if you do n't mind , i 'd like to ask another question that 's sort of related so i do n't have to make another thread about it . 
  in spain , or if you are aware of other countries in europe , do you have * any * local channels at all ? 
  here , the big national public channels ( like nbc , cbs , abc , fox , pbs ) all have local affiliates by county . 
  they all show the same stuff , primetime , daytime and late night talk shows and all that but some things like the news are all done locally for each county and they each have their [ call signs ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/list_of_television_stations_in_the_united_states_by_call_sign_\\ ( initial_letter_w \\ ) ) . 
  thanks . 
  that 's fine . 
  i 'm not saying one system is better than the other , i 'm just curious . 
  i 'm also a fan and feel the same of some of the people we have announcing national games . 
  i just like our local ones as well . 
  / u/mistshinobi made some very good points . 
  i had n't thought about how one sport , with fewer teams , and less games could dominate the entire country . 
  in that sense , it 's very feasible that one could watch pretty much every game . 
  so it 's not much of a problem . 
  yeah , what / u/reliesonblitz is exactly right , they each get their own booths . 
  sorry if it was confusing . 
  vin scully for the la dodgers is also a good example of how your teams announcers can become like the voice of the team . 
  yeah , i was just wondering about radio . 
  cool . 
  it really does n't . 
  they 're still professionals . 
  some are better than others . 
  that makes sense . 
  do you like the idea of it at all , though ? 
  i feel like they become part of the team family . 
  they can show more enthusiasm for when a team does well . 
  in national games it would look too biased . 
  i also appreciate their frustration and criticism more . 
  there 's a few cities with multiple sport teams in the same league here like nyc with the mets and yankees in the mlb ( baseball ) and they both get their own broadcast teams . 
  i guess if * every * team is going to be like that there 's really no point . 
  especially with the having different channels part . . 
  it 's like saying `` holy cow ! '', 
  instead of `` holy shit ! '',
