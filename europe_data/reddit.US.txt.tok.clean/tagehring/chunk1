i 'm curious , is your father more of a liberal or conservative ? 
  i 'm trying to get a handle on that mindset and failing . 
  i was n't , actually , i was asking for more information . 
  what i find most fascinating about this map is that the border is drawn along the pre-1919 frontier , not the pre-1945 one . 
  in other words , why is the so-called polish corridor , which has been polish since 1919 and had an ethnic polish majority before that , the same as the `` recovered territories '' annexed in 1945 ? 
  was the corridor ( sorry if i 'm using the wrong term for that area , btw ) also forcibly repopulated by poles from the east after wwii ? 
  should n't it look like the areas that were n't german if the root cause for the difference is the resettlement ? 
   it is something that we often do n't account for . 
  we usually look at a timespan of a generation or so , the distant past is so remote that we just do n't consider that it plays such a huge role . 
  a large portion of the us 's current political headache can be traced back to settlement patterns from the 17th century . 
  although it really was n't until the 18th century that the north/south divide became apparent ( and quite probably permanent ) . 
  anarchists !, 
  fwiw , for many years after the civil war , both union and confederate veterans marched side by side in memorial day parades . 
  you rebel , you . 
  you probably would n't have a balcony ( and the flat with it ) for long . 
  i would n't call one informer for every 6 citizens `` nothing . '', 
  if you were of interest to the stasi , they knew everything down to how you folded your underwear . 
  that has long been one of my favorite bits of trivia to bring up at parties . 
  i love the muff diving club . 
  go big or go home . 
  pretty sure people said the same thing in 1918 . 
  to say nothing of hungarian oysters . 
  whenever i tell my ( conservative republican ) coworker that the us has no functional left-wing party , and that our political spectrum runs from the democrats on the center right to the republicans off to the right and the tea partiers off to the far right , it drives him crazy . 
  as it does when i say i 'm not a fan of obama because he 's too conservative . 
  i 've always loved the symbolism there . 
  the people , sitting and sipping coffee while they look down at those who ostensibly are their servants . 
  how it 's supposed to be . 
  [ or virginia 's , it 's a classic .

  good artists copy ; great artists steal . 
  ... shit . 
  no , i did n't . 
  i guess you just aim it in their general direction ? 
  he got better . 
  there 's a dissertation in that , i can smell it . 
  630,000 is 0.002 % of the american population . 
  a drop in the bucket , in other words . 
  i imagine this would be rather different ( and more representative ) if it included all dwellings , instead of just apartments . 
  [ i 'm well aware of that , we 've seen that particular divide show up before . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliamentary_election,_2007#mediaviewer/file:wybory2007wgpowiatow_barry_kent.png ) what i 'm curious about is the amount of progress made in the last 25 years . 
  was this difference more stark in 1989 ? 
  is the main reason most of the apartments in the ziemie odzyskane have bathrooms because they were built after wwii ? 
  i 'd be curious to see how this map compares to a similar map from say , 1989 or sometime just before the end of communism . 
  someone 's been listening to eddie izzard . 
  i believe in you , england . 
  you can do it !, 
  fair point . 
  but i was trying to rebut the `` top down '' argument . 
  top down would have been if , say , the british crown had mandated a colonial union of some sort . 
  i just have to wrap my brain around austrian german . 
  i 'm having a hard enough time with hochdeutsch , and my grandparents spoke it at home . 
  i just think it would be cool to have a geopolitical entity we refer to as `` the federation . '', 
  mm , not quite . 
  the building was already done by the time that part of the country was established . 
  the original framework was hammered together by delegates of 13 very different colonies and spread from there . 
  do i need to show you my irish passport to be allowed to stay ? 
  in all seriousness , i 'm a graduate student in german history , attempting to learn the language , and hope to do doctoral work in germany in the near future . 
  i 'm supposed to grunt and say something like , `` because freedom '' or `` murika '' or something , right ? 
  ... that was part of the joke , yes . 
  / r/civ is leaking . 
  it 's the gift that keeps on giving . 
  well , it is n't * too * far from georgia . 
  i think that 's why it 's ironic . 
  i had to squint and look really hard to find it , but you 're right . 
  seems like they went for a dictator version of [ mr. potatohead ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1544&amp;bih=927&amp;q=mr.+potatohead&amp;oq=mr.+potatohead&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i10i24.887.2411.0.2555.14.12.0.2.2.0.136.922.10j2.12.0....0...1ac.1.42.img..0.14.930.axnevjsxtn8 ) . 
  i 'm familiar with the idea ( i 'm working on a graduate level degree in 20th century german history ) ; i just looked at that picture and my first thought was `` lenin '' because of the pose , and then `` stalin '' because of the lapels . 
  i ca n't imagine too many czechs would think more highly of stalin than of hitler . 
  * reductio ad hitlerium * is , as far as i know , a guaranteed way to lose an argument . 
  that looks more like stalin or lenin than anything else to me , too . 
  not sure where hitler comes into it . 
  i 'm dating myself , but i remember him saying it on usenet back in the '90s ; he 's frequently quoted and often misattributed . 
  that actually was n't terry pratchett : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_nicoll#.22the_purity_of_the_english_language.22, 
  that 's definitely a difference between british and american english . 
  americans do n't think twice about referring to their siblings . 
  in my case , it 's easier than saying `` my stepbrothers , stepsister , and sister . '', 
  after two overseas wars spanning almost 14 years , the american public is n't going to give a damn about a piece of paper one of the three signatories has already violated . 
  it sucks for the ukraine , but , that 's how it is . 
  all that treaty says is that if it 's violated , it 's taken to the un security council or the powers will `` consult '' with one another . 
  guess who has veto power on the un security council ? 
  thus , the treaty had no valid enforcement mechanism to begin with . 
  so , in a scenario where the invaded party is , legally speaking , closer to us interests than the ukraine , the us under dubya did n't put boots on the ground . 
  why are you griping about obama not defending ukraine ? 
  you mean the same dubya who used us military assets to save georgia from a russian invasion in 2008 ? 
  doubtful . 
  not very . 
  it was draw up to support a specific political agenda . 
  we shall beat you with a dead carp . 
  ... how ? 
  that 's a pretty accurate representation of the ethnic makeup of the region in 1918 , and he shows it as being german , not french . 
  a frenchman would put the border at the rhine . 
  he was part of the lithuanian nationalist movement , so a stretch is exactly what he was going for . 
  they were trying to establish a claim to as much land as they could before the peace conference . 
  some context , here . 
  this map was published by a lithuanian nationalist , juozas gabrys , with a specific political agenda . 
  thus the inaccuracies in that part of the map . 
  lithuanian , actually . 
  and the map was published in switzerland . 
  if i 'm writing or referring to something from german history , and it mentions say , breslau , to call it wroclaw in that context would be incorrect . 
  if you 're referring to the city post-1945 , then yes , i see your point . 
  for centuries , those cities * were n't polish .
