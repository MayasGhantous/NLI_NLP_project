  * to pretend that they were during that period , and call them by polish names when discussing that period , is nothing more than nationalistic whitewashing . 
  no , you 're right . 
  apparently the crimea was always considered `` russia , '' as i understand it . 
  i drew the comparison because they were both primarily used as warm-water ports for the soviet navy during the cold war . 
  which would have been the overriding consideration in the immediate post-wwii period . 
  i get that , but they were all part of one big happy soviet family just the same , and stalin was n't one to be bothered by niceties . 
  that 's the one !, 
  well , it was 1989-1991 or so . 
  no problem . 
  my specialty is history of post-wwii germany . 
  i 'd love to find some books or references for kaliningrad/koenigsberg , it 's sort of a black hole , historically , having been a closed military area for much of the cold war . 
  i 've always been fascinated by it . 
  who was it who said , `` i love germany . 
  i love germany so much i want two of her ? '', 
  part of the conditions for the ussr/us/uk and france assenting to german reunification in 1990 and ending the post-wwii occupation officially was that the newly reunited germany would have to renounce all claims to territory east of the oder/neisse line . 
  which they did . 
  and i do n't think lithuania or poland wanted to piss off the russians at that time , since both countries were just asserting their independence from moscow/non-communist governance . 
  what about formerly german cities by german names ? 
  '' ... frequently the idea of being a `` bridge '' between europe and russia comes up , which i 'm not sure i agree with considering how isolated it is ... '' there was talk in the early '90s of kaliningrad becoming a kind of `` european hong kong . '', 
  sad to see it did n't come to pass . 
  i 've got a flag . 
  yeah , that 's the one . 
  i 've had a subscription to ngm since 1981 and a collection that goes back to the '40s , so i 've always had access to it . 
  if you can get to a library that might have a digital archive of ngm ( they sell a dvd set for usd$ 30 , i think ) , it 's in there . 
  national geographic did an excellent article about the place back in the '90s . 
  really had some interesting interviews about how the locals felt about the ussr falling apart and the possibility germany would want east prussia back . 
  and with germans who were exiled after wwii who returned after the wall came down to see where they grew up . 
  fascinating stuff . 
  the party line was that it was an ice-free port on the baltic . 
  and it was of strategic significance . 
  keep in mind , at that time , the crimea was also part of the rsfsr . 
  they were n't , this is from 1952 . 
  ironically , nazis had a much harder time of it in the ddr ; communists are n't particularly keen on them for some reason . 
  there was a popular belief ( in east germany ) that the ddr had a `` clean slate '' because of how vigorously ( compared to the west germans ) they prosecuted or barred nazis from teaching , government service , etc. 
  during immediate post-war period . 
  yeah , the stasi made the gestapo look like amateurs , but they were trained by the kgb . 
  it was west germany 's intelligence service that was headed by a former ( albeit reformed ) nazi , reinhard gehlen . 
  ... it 's a link with a bunch of pictures of a city that looks like osaka or houston or any other major city . 
  what 's your point ? 
  do n't get me wrong , frankfurt would have made a good capital for germany , being where the us occupation zone hq was located , but it did n't go to bonn because of the french . 
  pretty sure it was more that adenauer was from that area and the cdu did n't want west germany to have a `` permanent '' capital , in the hope that one day they 'd be able to relocate to berlin . 
  i think you 're reading it wrong , germany and austria have the lowest unemployment . 
  there 's the community college system , as well as stuff like advanced placement courses ( taken in high schools by high school students for university credit ) , which may be counted . 
  it does seem like a bit of a reach for the us , however . 
  i 've always thought it meant what / u/annoyed _ freelancer said . 
  since , technically , * every * day is the first day of the rest of your life . 
  that 's mainly why i asked ; i 'm used to seeing things in multiple languages ( usually english and spanish in the us , occasionally english and french for stuff from canada . ), 
  i was surprised to see a swiss ballot in one language instead of all four . 
  forgive my ignorance , but what determines which language your ballot is in ? 
  geographic area , or do you register with the government as being of a particular language group ? 
  it helps that our country has basically become a caricature of itself . 
  lot of material there for jokes . 
  those are both the square ones with the corn , right ? 
  compliment . 
  definitely compliment . 
  we would n't do that to you guys . 
  it was the underlying issue that caused the dispute over how the union was supposed to work : namely , the division of powers between the state and federal government and also whether the union could be broken . 
  the south 's answer was that the union was dissolvable and they were going to leave . 
  the rest of the country differed . 
  5 years and 600,000 lives later , the question was settled . 
  the union is indissoluble . 
  once you 're in , you 're in . 
  earlier disputes were over federally levied tariffs ( traditionally the industrial north was in favor , the agrarian south was not ) , [ whether a state had the authority to nullify federal law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nullification_crisis ) , and over whether we should have a national bank , the [ bank of the united states ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bank_of_the_united_states ) . 
  these could have led to civil war in the 1810s-1830s . 
  in fact , [ the new england states almost seceded from the union in 1814 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hartford_convention ) over our involvement in the napoleonic war and the embargo levied by madison . 
  the `` original sin '' of the united states was slavery . 
  it was recognized as such by our founding fathers in the 1700s , but they lacked the ability or will to abolish it when the country was founded . 
  each generation kept kicking it down the field to the next . 
  as the country expanded westward and new territories were brought into the us , the issue became one of continuous compromise to make sure the delicate balance of power between slave states and free states was maintained . 
  this worked until the 1850s . 
  the breakdown of this compromise led to the 1860 election and subsequent rebellion . 
  so to sum up , slavery was a problem . 
  but it was one of many issues that fed into a more central debate that in some ways continues until today about how the country was supposed to work . 
  over how the european union is supposed to work ? 
  unfortunately , it took us a century or so of debating what exactly that means and we finally had to settle the question with a war that killed 600,000 americans . 
   maybe a better solution for all would be for england to join with flanders and for scotland to join with waloonie ... now that 's a novel take on the auld alliance . 
  i guess he did n't value quantity over quality . 
  north carolina is best carolina . 
  not that that 's saying much . 
  how do we know he did n't invent the thing ? 
  no , only the ones old enough to remember being occupied by the russians for a decade after wwii ended . 
  there is a difference between pacifism as a movement and pacifism as a governmental policy . 
  he wants to learn how to talk british . 
  i speak english as a native language ( mostly northeastern american with a very slight tidewater drawl when i 'm tired/drunk ) , intermediate german , elementary french , spanish , and latin , and want to learn dutch and irish . 
  pretty sure we got that from the brits , though . 
  it 's really not something you see commonly in the us . 
  not as well as you 'd hope . 
  we do , we just have to be hit over the head with it , repeatedly . 
  now if they 'd asked for the capitals ... 
  yes , but they 're not [ the one word that is beyond the pale ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=mo-62vxple0c&amp;pg=pt516&amp;lpg=pt516&amp;dq=douglas+adams+belgium+flat+country+with+eec&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qbdexi3bcy&amp;sig=vkgxcfuuaqnvmhvuvk2spxunol4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjl8oejjchnahxdlx4khvbwdeiq6aeiitab#v=onepage&amp;q=douglas%20adams%20belgium%20flat%20country%20with%20eec&amp;f=false ) , i hardly like to say the name of it . 
  i guess what i 'm getting at is , as the older generation dies off , what the general mood will be 10 or 20 years from now . 
  i know that 's highly situation-dependent , however . 
  you 're the very flat country with all the eec and fog . 
  i 'm honestly curious to see a poll done in a few months that would break down the pro-unification vote by age bracket . 
  do you think younger nirish would be more pro-unification than their elders if it meant staying in the eu ? 
  if they 're northern irish , do n't they qualify for a republic passport and could keep their eu citizenship through that route ? 
  for the night is dark and full of belgians . 
  truth , justice , and the american way . 
  switzerland loves you , though . 
  you make them 49th in everything .
