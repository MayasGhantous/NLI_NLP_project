damn , some people are pedantic . 
  if both are widely accepted , and both convey the same meaning , then it should n't matter . 
  it 's the meaning that counts . 
  at least there 's android/apple pay now, 
  i have n't seen them , but i noticed the menu screens behind the cashier at mcdonalds are electronic now , so there 's that . 
  what differs between fun and exciting ? 
  volkswagen is the `` jeep '' over here lol . 
  there 's still audi , bmw , and mercedes-benz , but they 're viewed more as upper class expensive cars . 
  true , but it 's long standing in canada, 
  i like the pages, 
  [ i was thinking of this for the got thing ] ( http://www.ctv.ca/show-news/latest-news/game-of-thrones-season-1-uncut-on-ctv ) interesting insight though , goes to show how you can only know the story after living it i guess . 
  i have n't been to canada , but i 've researched it extensively and know some canadian people . 
  from what i can tell , the differences are more jurisdictional than people based ( with the exception of quebec ) products are required to be bilingual in english/french in canada . 
  words are spelled the british way . 
  the accent is n't super different , but `` washroom '' instead of bathroom threw me off . 
  canada is more protectionist in its media . 
  a number of songs on the radio are required to be canadian , and the public broadcaster ( cbc ) is used as a safe space for canadian television shows . 
  the country as a whole is more progressive . 
  as an example , game of thrones airs primetime on local tv channels uncensored , and same sex marriage was legalized a decade before the united states . 
  the legal ages for things are lower in canada . 
  the drinking age is 18/19 vs 21 , and the age to see most movies that are 17 + in the united states is 14 in canada . 
  cities are laid out different . 
  as in europe , downtown areas are seen as the desirable place to live ( as compared to the us , where suburbs are ) , and public transportation is more common in canada ( but not ubiquitous ) . 
  high rises in suburban areas are n't uncommon in canada , and a smaller canadian city would feel larger than an american city of a bigger size . 
  canada has an lower obesity rate , and is less religious . 
  in ways that the united states eschews international norms , canada follows ( universal healthcare , the metric system , food brands , sugar in sodas . ) . 
  even though the benefits are comparable on average to the states , work/life balances are enshrined by law in canada . 
  gasoline , and most consumer products cost more in canada . 
  larger costs ( health insurance and college ) are typically cheaper in canada . 
  feel free to correct me if i got anything wrong . 
  preferably , but any will suffice, 
  postnord ... ( am i doing this right ? ), 
  wonder if jim is friends with the uk channel dave, 
  their fangs may be sharp , but their milk is sweet . 
  i have n't seen it , and i 'm from there . 
  more like tipadvisor, 
  o fer sure, 
  there 's clear water tho, 
  minnesotan accent is n't bad ( although i 'm biased ), 
  how much indonesian influence does the netherlands have nowadays ? 
  i know about the colonization , and i remember hearing about some nursing home over there with themed rooms having `` indonesian style rooms '' as an option . 
  kind of an odd question , i just find stuff like this fascinating . 
  i hope denk memes are a thing at least, 
  i make witty comments occasionally , but i count i guess . 
  you 're 16/17 's the way there, 
  i just spent 15 minutes looking at electrical outlets . 
  what am i doing with my life ? 
  `` pull down your pants , i need to know what korea you 're from . '', 
   ahem , my parents and i followed here a do n't ask/don ' t tell policy there 's the kicker , american parenting is way more direct . 
  it 's always `` who 's house are you going to '' , `` let me see your internet history . '' . 
  if you 're a child in public , parents will almost appear to be drill sergeants ( noticing this more as i work in retail ) . 
  it 's also not uncommon for parents to forbid their child from dating until a certain age ( 16 , 18 , until you move out , etc. ) . 
  hell , there 's still some `` control '' at older ages . 
  after voting the first time last year , i was pestered by my father about who i voted for . 
  i lied , of course , because i did n't want to open up a can of worms about voting for the `` wrong person '' . 
  my parents would n't have cut me off or anything that extreme , but it shows that you 're always `` part of the family . 
  because tests like that give us access to the `` dna vortex '' , where we can pull various european cultural artifacts out of the void . 
  [ you guys will get a kick out of this ] ( https://youtu.be/2j5n8kzpbcs ), 
  hell , you can just deem your website a `` game of skill '' and have it be legal in most states , even if online gambling is technically illegal . 
  [ these annoying ads are everywhere during sports games ] ( https://youtu.be/soniqkptlhe ), 
  i 'm not european , but i 've always liked the irish harp ones . 
  the harp and the font look good together . 
  how else can you enjoy the schadenfreude of an aardvark dropping it 's dim sum at a cafe ? 
  * jazz hands *, 
  christ that 's alot of data . 
  i pay $ 20 a month and get unlimited talk , text , and one gig of data ( and this is a `` low cost provider '' ), 
  [ it definitely looks like a funny movie . ], 
  ( http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcqxx7pj3uoldxpayufe0cm-vuj3ishr6kerm-nzwqcrfngj4fuf ), 
  looks vaguely scandinavian, 
  but it 's a hella lit word ... 
   artificial creation of ` needs ' for the sake of business . 
  has this ever happened to you ? 
  `` there 's a spider in my sandwich ! '', 
  introducing , the sandwich spider protector . 
  the fast and easy way to ... 
  i definitely agree with the northern state similarity thing . 
  [ cities like duluth , minnesota and thunder bay , ontario are very similar to each other ] ( http://soundquarters.com/bobsblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/thunder-bay-to-duluth.jpg ) a random small town texas vs a random small town in quebec however ... 
  my main wish is that we had a question time over here . 
  something about it adds personality to government . 
  hopefully it can happen eventually . 
  the federal government stepped in at the last minute and added a status quo option to the most recent plebiscite , so i 'm not holding my breath . 
   the people born there are born as american nationials , not citizens , and so they have almost all of the same rights as citizens ( free movement , constitution applies , etc. ), 
  but they do n't have the right to vote at all , and it does n't matter where they move . 
  and yet there 's small uninhabited islands where people theoretically born on them would get full citizenship . 
  it 's a clusterfuck that should get straightened out , there 's no excuse to ignoring it . 
  on the other hand , someone from ohio could move to puerto rico and would n't ve able to vote for president . 
  it 's the same citizenship , it just depends on where you reside . 
  czech republic has been around longer , and as a result sounds more `` normal '' to my ears . 
  however , czechia sounds better as a word . 
  either is just as good . 
  94 % 1:47 only got kosovo and montenegro `` wrong '' , but i 'm on my phone and my fingers are fat . 
  the only part of the country with easily accessible lutefisk, 
  sounds like a big change, 
  music and books . 
  you guys have managed to create a bunch of highly regarded bands ( beatles , led zeppelin , rolling stones , queen , pink floyd , iron maiden ) . 
  music would n't be as good as it is today if it was n't for the uk . 
  you 've also made some great authors ( shakespeare , tolkien , kipling , orwell , rowling ) . 
  they 've influenced alot , and many still read them today . 
  i do n't watch much tv on tv , so take these with a big grain of salt . 
  here 's my anecdotal observations .
