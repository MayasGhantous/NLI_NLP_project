at +400 k now , pretty sure this is going viral edit - two days later and it 's 600k . 
  ty , trying to bring in some academic submissions, 
  the tl ; dr is no , not really . 
  is that why it keeps getting downvoted ? 
  considering this sub 's previous posts on the topic , i 'm surprised this is getting so little attention . 
  so no labour votes against , and no dup votes for . 
  non-binding as others have pointed out , but pretty interesting . 
  alternatively , look at the prospects of buying-out : [ `` between the sword and the wall : spain 's limited options for catalan secessionism '' ] ( http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/9383 ), 
  do you have any references or journal access ? 
  i 'd be interested in reading those . 
  in other news - [ respublika party announces agreement on new kyrgyz coalition ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/kyrgyzstan_coalition/2249244.html ) edit - the [ aj piece ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/10/thousands-attend-armenia-opposition-rally-20141010172956457218.html ) on protesters in yerevan seems appropriate too . 
  are there any reliable polls of public opinion there about moving closer to russia ? 
  gazeta.ru was claiming like 26k . 
  do we have a recording of the president of the echr cringing ? 
  eh the president of azerbaijan just caused some furore over incendiary comments on his official account ( edit - that were copied over from a previous speech ) . 
  and a lot of people have followed bildt & mcfaul around on there since euromaidan began . 
  seeing people with that much sway doing that still seems somewhat alien to me . 
  i 'm seeing it on vox , wsj , business insider , and ibtimes . 
  and a lot of people have been sharing it on twitter ( [ e.g. ] ( https://twitter.com/anneapplebaum/status/507903439121436672 ) ) . 
  edit - ilves is apparently on twitter and giving his own updates . 
  we live in a strange time . 
  here 's the wiki article for [ rossiya segodnya ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rossiya_segodnya ) , which i did n't realize was the owner of voice of russia . 
  so yeah to say this poll is spurious is probably an understatement . 
  [ ft had a good article as well ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3fb73612-26eb-11e4-a46a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3awsdt800 ), 
  checker was one of the first widely-sold cabs ( at least in the us ) . 
  there 's a myth that the pattern was adopted because they integrated their workforce and discouraged discriminatory service . 
  honest question , do you think this will tip your govt more in favor of freezing russian assets ? 
  the netherlands is somewhat ( in ) famous abroad as a russian tax haven .

  thanks !, 
  editorialized headline , and some parts of the article are n't reported accurately going by the sources . 
  for example , the intimidation bill link is two years old for legislation that passed its first reading at the time it was published . 
  the ` high heels ' bill link is almost a month old , and does n't mention it having been signed into law . 
  for the headline , it looks like only proposed a few of the mentioned laws were passed in the 40-hour period recently according to the dozhd/rain link . 
  / r/betternews is essentially run by a bot , and is surprisingly better than most similar subreddits . 
  yeah , i wo n't say it is n't a shit article . 
  the intimidation thing links to an article from ... two years ago ? 
  and the headline the op picked itself does n't represent what the article claims . 
  you wo n't hear me saying positive things about the russian government any time soon ... but this is distilled circlejerk . 
  i would n't dispute the pro-russian sentiment in / r/worldnews though , or the fact that its mods subscribe to questionable views of how ir works . 
  the linked dozhd article appears to include the advertising and data laws as among those passed in the four hour session . 
  yiddish slang for that is schlimazel , but in american english it 's more just `` funny yiddish word '' . 
  closest approximation would be something like `` jinx . '', 
  there 's a book by a former us diplomat that called * the united nations , iran , and iraq * that makes the case that the unsc helped end the iran-iraq war . 
  also check [ the text discussed here ] ( http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/studio/multimedia/20091102b/index.html ) for an overview of success and failure . 
  the author did an [ ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1vdykr/i_am_david_bosco_expert_on_the_international/ ) actually .

  the * pkk * is on the state dept tos list , not the parties you mentioned . 
  note : putnam concludes with saying most of the concerns are very valid but restricted to short-term , and in the long-term pros outweigh the cons . 
  he even had to take out a [ brief ] ( http://www.utexas.edu/vp/irla/documents/acr%20robert%20d.%20putnam.pdf ) in scotus to criticize the way aei ( centre-right think tank ) represented his claims . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  i think you are reading a bit into my statements though as if i 'm clemens or the other user , e.g. 
  the `` cherrypicking '' was just referring to the years reported in the report itselft . 
  now i wish there was n't such a delay in translation of ifn papers . 
  his language is a bit much . 
  and while i do n't exactly think your country 's current asylum policy is sustainable , but i do n't think that 's a controversial position to take either . 
  but i 'm also not seeing where in the report you 're getting those numbers . 
  maybe you 're thinking of sanandaji 's papers ? 
  i 'm seeing from the report : * a conservative fiscal impact estimate of +.2 % gdp for sweden when pensions are included , +.62 % when excluded . 
  * over half of non-oecd immigrants to sweden were reporting having a job prior to immigrating in 2008 . 
  * the neet rates are 30 % for foreign-born population in sweden . 
  * the risk of long-term ( over one year ) unemployment for foreign-born in sweden is four percent . 
  * the average employment rate is about 65 % for foreign-born versus ~ 75 % for native-born in 2012 . 
  * foreign-born workers account for ~ 17 % of new hires in 2012 , the largest plurality of which is in services . 
  * most foreign-born hires in 2008 and 2011 for sweden were high or medium-skilled workers . 
  * literature surveys point to sweden not being the exception to broad trends - immigration results in small net fiscal impacts , while immigrants are overrepresented in social security . 
  * average net direct fiscal contributions from foreign-born households is small and positive , while those from foreign households in higher , close to 5k euro ppp . 
  the 2008 crisis saw an added-worker effect for sweden with net contributions * increasing * to compensate . 
  * social benefits paid out are mostly at parity with those for native-born with the exception of social assistance which is a 10:1 difference . 
  * net contribution for migrant households , though significantly lower than for native-born , is 896 euro ppp per household averaged over 2007-09 . 
  * differences in employment levels between native and foreign-born for 2009-10 are wider than for the oecd average . 
  * accounting for age/education/labor market status , the net contribution difference between natives and foreign-born is just below -4000 euro ppp per household . 
  * although immigrants on average draw less benefits than natives for oecd countries , sweden is one of the few oecd countries where the opposite is true and pronounced for 2007-09 . 
  * there are high ethnic penalties ( inc. estimates of discriminatory effects ) in unemployment rates for foreign-born peoples , highest for african men at +9 % , low compared to say turkish men in belgium , high cf. 
  to fmr-yugoslavian men in austria * both immigration and net migration were down in 2011 cf. 
  to 2010 , main foreign born groups being polish ( 5 % ) , iraqi ( 5 % ) , and afghani ( 4 % ) . 
  foreign-born constituted 63 % of pop increase . 
  * first-instance approval rate for asylum seekers was 34 % in 2011 . 
  application rates for citizenship had an 87 % success rate for 2011 . 
  * in january 2012 , the migration board imposed stricter requirements for workers seeking to hire non-eu workers to prevent abuse . 
  * the fy 2013 budget reform included provisions targeting employment , schooling and integration esp . 
  with regards to family ( as opposed to unaccompanied minor ) arrivals so conclude from that what you will . 
  there 's a lot more there . 
  i mean it 's a 400 + page document . 
   but i never expect much from us immigration reports as they 're almost always anti-nativist and pro-immigration partisan . 
  well i think you 're a little confused there . 
  for example , borjas is one of the most famous immigration-labor economists , and he 's not exactly partisan in that way . 
  he advised the ( admittedly really reaching ) pro-nativist richwine paper that clemens mentioned . 
  however for consensus you 'll find macro professors american or otherwise to generally agree that the net gains in productivity from * skilled * immigration outweigh the costs . 
  it 's one of the classic examples of something economists agree on from a policy perspective , along with carbon taxes ( revenue-neutral or otherwise ) , the nonsense of going back to gold standards , etc. 
  now the us admittedly does n't have * that * distorted a housing market , so from a us perspective it is true that economists here are used to assuming supply will meet demand in that area . 
  as for you guys , i know bevelander has n't been drawing broad conclusions , and has sometimes stuck to data prior to liberalization . 
  so maybe sanandaji i 'm assuming ? 
  he 's definitely become the go-to guy for moratorium advocacy . 
  someone on here called him a ` top gear politician ' a while ago . 
  seems more accurate the more i hear him interviewed . 
  i was n't assuming that , no . 
  i do n't have your govt 's budget tables in front of me .
