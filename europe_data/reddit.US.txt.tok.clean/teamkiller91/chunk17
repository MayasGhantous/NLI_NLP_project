  planes fly over iraq and syria and are n't shot down . 
  the airliner had no way of knowing they separatists had weapons capable of shooting down a commercial airliner at that height . 
  who 's their father ? 
  i 'm thinking their parents died and they were adopted by different families . 
  you do know that there are several ethnic groups within judaism , right ? 
  and in what twisted reality is india a neighborhood ? 
  and again , there are tons of ethnicities in india . 
  you seriously have no grasp whatsoever of what the hell an ethnicity is . 
  you 're really grasping at straws here . 
  by that definition , religion , nationality , and neighborhood = ethnic group . 
  what about worst korea ? 
  his dad also has nukes . 
  i had a long and more accurate explanation written out until i accidentally refreshed the page . 
  are you purposefully ignoring the fact that i said `` ethnic russian '' multiple times ? 
  because of the fact that they think the same way . 
  if you asked a mongolian in russia if they 're russian , they would say yes . 
  when will swedish imperialism be stopped !, 
  russia thinks everyone who speaks russian is an `` ethnic russian . '', 
  that 's why mongolians who speak russian are `` ethnic russians '', 
  indo-european languages originated from the steppe around the black sea in modern ukraine . 
  the groups thwn got too big and spread out . 
  so in a way , ukraine is the `` homeland '' of all indo-european people . 
  probably sweden again . 
  we all know how dastardly the swedes are . 
  it 's a joke . . a lot of russia used to be populated by finno-ugrics . 
  and i know they 're not all the same . . 
  do n't feel bad , i had a similar experience with that picture . 
  russia should really give that land back to finland , since it was populated by ethnic finno-ugrics . 
  congratulations on turning 15 . 
  ** brussels plans to build army to stamp out all opposition !, 
  uk analysts predict they will use deadly force to stop member states from leaving the european union and will force them to adopt the euro !, 
  why would you do that to yourself ? 
  novogorod is only true russia . 
  remove muscovite scum . 
  it 's the exact same for me , with the bonus of my ( ukrainian ) mother also believing this . 
  she was actually surprised when my aunt ( who lives in ukraine ) told her to stop posting pro-russian/anti-ukrainian/anti-american propaganda on vk . 
  and then russia decided to fuck with georgia . 
  that would imply a hatred of women . 
  some people ca n't speak/read english while some , like the nice folks over at / r/russia , refuse to believe anything else . 
  `` your country . '', 
  because obviously someone without a flag in a subreddit about europe is american . 
  which part of your ass did you pull that little factoid out of ? 
  america did better than expected . 
  here 's a fixed link . 
  this is good news because ukraine is at least making gains , but it 's sad that anyone has to die . 
  because some people refuse the believe that nato is n't satan . 
  and why would you presume that polish does n't make sense to me ? 
  it 's very similar in sound and structure to ukrainian , so it does make sense to me . 
  norwegian is also similar to english . 
  the un inaction is the reason why nato was forced to bomb serbia independently from the un . 
  finnish is a strange language to us indo-european language speakers . 
  get rich and abandon the ship when it sinks . 
  that 's a nice name you have there . 
  very russian . 
  too bad it makes it obvious you 're not a finn . 
  that 's not what the austrians say . 
  ` i am firmly convinced that spain is the strongest country of the world . 
  century after century trying to destroy herself and still no success ' - otto von bismarck, 
  the map maker made a typo . 
  it 's `` why is kosovo not in the un . '', 
  i never said christianity popped into existence out of nowhere . 
  no , it 's not . 
  god , that 's such a gross oversimplification . 
  even if you ignore literally every aspect of a country 's history and take into account nothing but the fact that it exists , it 's still wrong . 
  england , for example , did n't pop into existence after someone thought `` hey , i should make a country and call it england . '', 
  then explain to me how you would interpret the statement `` greeks and assyrians got caught up in the middle of it '' ? 
  you do n't understand . 
  it was n't genocide , it was all a prank . 
  you should have seen the look on their faces . 
  sure , the murder of 750,000 greeks was all a big misunderstanding . 
  not genocide at all . 
   better than getting mixed up in an ethnic violence and dying you mean like what happened in the greek , assyrian , and armenian genocides ? 
  the fact that people were forced from their homeland ( if they were n't killed , of course ) somehow makes it better ? 
  there were also some celts in the middle of it in a region called galatia . 
  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e = modern russian name for the state . 
  \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 = old east slavic name for the state . 
  notice how it 's a different word from \u0420\u0479\u0301\u0441\u044c . 
  the page itself says : `` russian tsardom or the byzantine variant russian tsardom - the official name of the russian government between 1547 and 1721 . 
  the official name during this period was \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 . '', 
  you do n't see the wikipedia page for england using the old english variant of the word `` england '' , now do you ? 
  no , it uses the modern version . 
  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e was not the official name at the time of the russian tsardom . 
  it 's from a different time period , uses a different alphabet , and is in a different language ( in the same sense that old high german is a different language from modern german ) . 
  why do you refuse to actually read the source i gave you ? 
  hell , even use google translate to read it if you do n't know russian . 
  but since you clearly refuse to actually learn anything , this conversation is over and this is my last reply to you . 
  are you serious right now ? 
  you said it was called the russian tsardom , not rus . 
  mark where it says '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e '' like you said it was called . 
  because you did not say it was called rus . 
  you claimed multiple times that it was '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e . '', 
   how about you provide some proof , have n't seen any yet . 
  [ right here . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hzlyhq9.png ) the wikipedia page i linked to you several comments ago . 
  this just confirms my statement that you do n't read sources others give to you . 
  ivan 's title was tsar of all rus , the state he ruled over was called \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 . 
  his seal mentions his title , not the name of the state which he rules over . 
  ivan was not the first to claim to be the ruler of rus . 
  the kings of galicia-volhynia claimed that title long before him . 
  and you 've still not provided me with any evidence that kievan rus was called the russian tsardom .
