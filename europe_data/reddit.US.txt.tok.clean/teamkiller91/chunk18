  i 'm eagerly awaiting it . 
  and no , '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 '' and '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c '' are not the same word at all . 
  even in modern russian , '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438 '' and '' \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 '' are two words . 
  again , come back when you 've learned something . 
  if your next reply contains more of the same uninformed pseudo-knowledge , this conversation will be over . 
   the same article you 're referring to says otherwise . 
  what the hell are you spewing bile about ? 
  nowhere does it say `` otherwise . '', 
  you obviously ca n't read russian , or else you would n't be this ignorant about the subject . 
  did you even look at the seal you posted ? 
  because i do n't think you did , since it 's obvious that it does n't use the same alphabet as the name \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e . '', 
  nowhere in his seal does it say '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e . '', 
   i '' ll just quote myself again :  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 / \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c is the same word . 
   or do i really need to highlight the part of the seal ? 
  you can quote yourself as many times as you wish , it does n't make you correct . 
  i 'm seriously finding it hard to believe that there 's actually someone in this world that 's so uninformed as to use modern russian as proof of the old east slavic name being `` russia tsardom . '', 
  it does n't matter that the modern russian word for rus is `` russia '' . 
  what matters it the old east slavic word for it , which was rus . 
  if you can honestly claim multiple times that the modern russian translation of `` russian tsardom '' was the name of kievan rus , then you 're more uninformed than i though . 
  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e is the modern russian name for the state that the tsardom of muscovy became , not of kievan rus . 
  and the last sentence in first paragraph of the russian wikipedia page literally says that the official name of the russian tsardom during the time of the russian tsardom was '' \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 . '', 
  why do n't you actually click the damn link and read what it says ? 
  or did you just get all of your knowledge of east slavic history from youtube videos ? 
  do n't bother replying to me until you 've actually learned something . 
  not only do you not read sources others give to you , you do n't even read your own . 
  where are you getting this `` information '' ? 
  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e is the modern russian name for the russian tsardom . 
  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e is in russian words and uses the modern russian alphabet , which was n't even used during the time of the russian tsardom . 
  during its time , the russian tsardom was officially called \u0420\ua64b\u0301\u0441\u0457\u0467 ( this uses non-standard script , so you may have trouble seeing it on reddit ) . 
  you really need to better research what you 're talking about . 
   \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e wait , did you just honestly post the modern russian translation of [ russian tsardom ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5_%d1%86%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be ) as proof of the state being called russia ? 
  because not only does '' \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e '' mean tsardom , but the old east slavic name for the state was \u0420\u0479\u0301\u0441\u044c and it was not ruled by a tsar . 
  it was ruled by a grand prince . 
  did you even bother googling the meaning of '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e '' before replying ? 
   kievan rus was n't a singular entity it was a single entity for a time , until the death of grand prince sviatoslav . 
  it shattered after his death and kept fracturing until it became a group of princes instead of one state . 
   later duchy of moscow organised all these duchies under one banner . 
  the way you worded it makes it seem as if you 're trying to imply that this `` organization '' was n't conquest . 
   occupation by mongols/lithuania/poland the mongol conquest is the only reason muscovy became the most powerful principality in the first place . 
   while modern russia kept the name , kievan rus was russia . 
  modern russia did not keep the name , it adopted a foreign name . 
  the old east slavic word for it was rus , it was not russia . 
  and the fact that a member of the rurikid dynasty founded muscovy does n't matter . 
  it was founded from the remains of the principality of vladimir-suzdal , which was also ruled by the rurikids . 
  every principality that muscovy invaded and annexed , save for the republic of novogorod , was ruled by the rurikids . 
  not only did it invade principalities ruled by its family members , it aided the mongols in several campaigns against them and collected tribute for the khan . 
  so having the same family name rule the country makes it the legal successor ? 
  ruling dynasties are n't what make a state . 
  spain does not have a legal right to all of france just because their current king 's dynastic house sat on the french throne at some point . 
  muscovy was a state formed out of the border territories of kievan rus which only later in history conquered parts that were historically siginifanct to kievan rus . 
  again , will turkey become the true and legal successor of rome if they decided to change their name rome ? 
  edit : also , you said russia was the latin name , not the `` dominant name in romance countries . '', 
  do n't try to move the goalpost . 
   russia was the latin name no it was n't . 
  ruthenia was the latin name , rossiya was the medieval greek name . 
  the tsardom of muscovy adopted the name tsardom of russia , but that does n't make it rus . 
  if france or turkey adopted the name `` roman republic '' , it does n't mean that italy is now rome . 
  a successor state adopting the name of an older state does n't mean it 's now that older state . 
  i 'm playing as byzantium and they 're my vassal . 
  the ottomans ended up getting beat up pretty hard at the beginning of the game and never recovered . 
  also one of the best rulers . 
  sadly , his line died out in my game and now albania has my dynasty on their throne :(, 
  slovenia is in the 60,000 + group . 
  many leftists think that if you vote for the right , then you 're `` voting wrong . '', 
  i 'm certain sure that / u/samppaaz is referencing this and not saying that not voting for the left is `` voting wrong . '', 
  poor belarus , always left out . 
  his actions did n't lead to the dissolution of the senate or rome becoming a dictatorship , not even in the long run . 
  rome was a dictatorship when the senate decided it needed to be and the senate was dissolved because of external pressure and threads that had nothing to do with caesar . 
  a monarchy is n't the same thing as a dictatorship . 
  as far as i know , every slavic language has the word knyaz , but with varying definitions . 
  also , we 're talking about the definition/meaning in russian , not polish , since / u/dmplot thought it would be tsar . 
  no , that 's not right . 
  knyaz does n't duke or voivode . 
  it means prince . 
  rus , for most of its history , was ruled by princes of varying power . 
  we 're simply talking about the east slavic equivalent to the traditional king , not the direct translation . 
  edit : there is an exception to this , though . 
  the kingdom of galicia-volhynia ( sometimes called kingdom of rus/ruthenia ) was ruled by a king . 
  julius caesar did n't pave the way for dictatorship , he was already the dictator ( which did n't have such a negative connotation during the times of the republic ) of the roman republic . 
  julius caesar also did n't dissolve the senate . 
  the senate was still part of the roman empire for centuries after the end of the republic , although it was much less powerful . 
  no , that would be knyaz . 
  tsar is emperor . 
  edit : the polish definition has nothing to do with this . 
  why even bring it up ? 
  the other guy was me . 
  the comment was just way too long , so i just deleted it and changed it to this one . 
  but yeah , it was rome . 
  or all the countries that were part of the roman empire . 
  the commonwealth will rise again . 
  russian jews have historically been leaving russia because they were being persecuted . 
  i do n't think having a large population of people who were forced out of a country means they 'd have a good opinion of said country . 
  that egg you posted is allowed because the inedible part is n't completely sealed within the food thanks to that ridge . 
  have a fun life , friend . 
  i find it interesting that you said that i want `` attention '' when you 've clearly got a negative attention seeking disorder . 
  i ca n't imagine being you and waking up every day , looking forward to getting offended and starting arguments on the internet . 
  have a fun life , friend . 
  ah , i love seeing people who go out looking for an argument get angry when others are told to ignore them . 
  people like you thrive off of negative attention . 
  i hope you enjoy scouring reddit for internet arguments to join in on .
