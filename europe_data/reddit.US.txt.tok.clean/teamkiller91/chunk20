  as far as i know , they actually help each other fight isis . 
  iirc , the pkk ( northern kurdistan/turkish kurdistan ) and ypg ( rojava/syrian kurdistan ) are allies . 
  unlike the pkk and ypg , the peshmerga of iraqi kurdistan ( also known as southern kurdistan ) is an official military force and they mostly protect their own territory and claims within iraq itself . 
  the syrian , turkish , and iraqi kurds are allies as far as i know . 
  they 're all part of kurdistan , so there 's really no reason for them to fight . 
   turkey views the pkk as terrorists '' the pkk is classified as a terrorist organization by nato and the eu . 
   yes , they use terror tactics , '' you 're basically saying `` yes , they 're terrorists . 
  but that does n't make them terrorists . '', 
   that country has a truly ghastly record with its minorities . '', 
  the kurds of northern kurdistan do n't have a very good record either , considering they were one of the main perpetrators of the armenian and assyrian genocides . 
  the pkk , a terrorist organization responsible for many terrorist attacks in turkey , is an enemy of turkey . 
  turkey and iraqi kurdistan are allies . 
  of course the us is supporting the tatars , they 're muslims just like that muslim leader of theirs !, 
  really nice source you 've got there . 
  the russians would just block any attempts to hold the vote and destroy voting booths in territory they control so they can then complain that ukraine did n't let them vote like they did with the presidential elections . 
  how long did it take for you to come up with that pile of stupid you call a comment ? 
  did you even read what it says ? 
  that 's the maximum you can earn if you want to live in one of those houses . 
  i think he just got some false information and is defending it for some reason . 
  i was also about to point this out . 
  i do n't know where the maker of the video got his information . 
  i know what semitic people are . 
  anti-semitic * specifically * means anti-jewish . 
  it was created to specifically mean anti-jewish . 
  you can read more about it on encyclopaedia britannica . 
  anti-semitic just means anti-jewish . 
  i know , it makes no sense that it does n't refer to the other semitic people as well . 
  this is reddit , where 99 % of the people do n't understand sarcasm unless you state that you 're being sarcastic . 
  islamophobic lies and slander !, 
  except the kind of people who need to be taught that will never accept it . 
  the only way would be to not let them in in the first place . 
  one point was docked for using `` vlad '' instead of `` vova . '', 
  how is anything i said `` hate speech '' towards any group ? 
  are you trying to be offended for the sake of being offended ? 
  lithuanians score lower than americans , who according to you are morons . 
  this must mean that lithuanians are even bigger morons . 
  but you , of course , are n't included because you 're somehow better than your countrymen and are thus able to insult an education system that consistently shows that it 's superior to that of your own . 
  this obviously means that , compared to you , lithuanians are bumbling oafs . 
  they score lower than americans , who are morons . 
  what else could it mean ? 
  you also keep singling out one thing that 's been said and pretending like that 's the only thing that 's been said . 
  nowhere did he say that albanian and baltic languages share some kind of bond that they do n't share in any language . 
  and you somehow still kept denying that albanian and baltic languages are n't closely related , which they are . 
  they are both indo-european , share a lot of similar grammar , and have many similar words . 
  if you honestly believe that albanian and baltic languages are n't closely related , then you seriously need to do some research . 
  you 're doing a great job purposefully misunderstanding everything that 's been said . 
   it 's ironic that you 're the one actually butthurt . 
  to quote you : remind me , how am i exactly butthurt ? 
   `` the balto-slavic language group traditionally comprises the baltic and slavic languages , belonging to the indo-european family of languages . '', 
  i meant language group as in `` germanic '' or `` romance '' language groups . 
  balto-slavic is the grouping of the baltic and slavic language families . 
   read the person 's message i replied to . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3p3ylu/destruction_of_serbian_heritage_in_kosovo/cw3ijrd so out of everything , you chose to single out his mentioning of albanians ? 
  again , remind me where is implies that there 's a special relationship between balto-slavic languages and the albanian language that 's not shared between others ? 
  or where he says that albanian is closer to a baltic language than it is to a slavic language ? 
  he groups the two together by saying balto-slavic , but actually reading is beneath you . 
  and the fact that you honestly believe that albanian and , for example , lithuanian are n't closer than albanian and some random altaic language really does show that you 're a bit of a moron . 
  look at albanian word usage and grammatical structure . 
  but then again , reading is too good for you , eh ? 
   your american education is showing , friend . 
  very dank meme . 
  do you honestly believe i went through your comments and read all of them carefully ? 
  you must feel extremely self important , thinking that i carefully examined all your comments and their context . 
  and if my `` american education '' is showing , that must be hard for you , being lithuanian and all . 
  even though the american education system is apparently so horrible , lithuania manages to consistently have lower scores than the us in all categories . 
  but maybe you 're just a diamond in the rough and a super-genius unlike your countrymen , who are lowly imbeciles ? 
  whatever the case may be , i 'm sure your superior intellect can guide you in life while the rest of the lithuanian nation grovels at your feet , begging for a sample of your infinite knowledge and wisdom . 
  you asked a question , and i answered it . 
  why the denial of the fact that balts and slavs are linguistically closer to each other than any other language group ? 
  balts and slavs have many similarities in their languages not found in other languages . 
  baltic and slavic languages are the same branch of indo-european , get over it and stopped being so butthurt . 
  and many languages in the same groups are `` mutually unintelligible '' . 
  it does n't even say they 're in the same `` language group '' , but you did n't read any of it because reading is hard and you 're too good and important to do it . 
  right ? 
  by the way , what do the albanians have anything to do with this ? 
  do you actually think they 're slavic ? 
  because if the answer is yes , you 're a moron . 
  and the fact that you actually think albanians are slavic paired with your apparent inability to read makes you someone who is n't worth talking or listening to . 
  looking through your comment historically also shows that you have no idea what haplogroups are and think that they prove that balts had `` finnic ancestors . '', 
  open a book , do some research , or actually read something at some point and maybe you 'll learn something for the first time in your life .

  not really an opinion as much as it is a fact . 
  he was genoese , not spanish .
