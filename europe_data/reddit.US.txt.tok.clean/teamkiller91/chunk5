  he committed vandalism . . 
  why ? 
  eating more calories than you burn is the cause of obesity , not the caloric density of your food . 
  you 've got it all wrong . 
  everyone except for the person reading this is a bot . 
  the person reading this is a person . 
  we have the same joke here , but with an american , a canadian , and a mexican . 
  what happened here ? 
  i 've been found out !, 
  and i would have gotten away with it , too , if it was n't for you meddling infidel !, 
  `` i do n't think he 's a neo-nazi because he has 88 in his username , i just think he 's a neo-nazi because he has 88 in his username . '', 
  if you automatically assume someone is a neo-nazi because of the fact that they have 88 in their username , you should probably go back to whatever hugbox you crawled out of . 
  you can blame the french for that one . 
  they 're the ones who initiated the intervention that led the gaddafi 's defeat . 
  i hope that the us stops supporting the `` moderates '' and assad comes out on top in the conflict . 
  the majority of turkish dna comes from the anatolian natives, 
  no , not arabs . 
  assyrians are n't arabs . 
  the arabs were sitting in the arabian peninsula at that time . 
  okay , and ? 
  the jews were there thousands of years before the palestinians . 
  they 're invaders . 
  even your fellow idiot / u/zyllber is saying they 're descendants of the arab invaders . 
  you need to open a history book and learn something . 
  from the arabian peninsula . 
  do the arab invasion and expulsion of the jews ring any bells ? 
   lived there for thousands of years before you came , are you serious ... ? 
  i did n't know that americans struggled so much with rolling r 's until i took spanish in highschool . 
  the teacher was trying to teach people how to roll their r 's half the time . 
  oh , it 's you again . 
  i doubt many of them want to come here in the first place . 
  i do n't know about you , but to me it seems like all this conflict was caused by the europeans in the first place when they decided to draw borders than looked nice instead of kept the nations peaceful . 
  hungarian has `` hun '' in it , so hungarians are obviously huns !, 
  we ca n't let anybody else be a special snowflake . 
  ca n't instill communism within the masses if you 're stuck in traffic !, 
  that 's a lie and you know it . 
  meanwhile you go tens of thousands of dollars in debt here to go to a university . 
  the sooner syria is stable , the better . 
  in hell , the cops are french , the engineers are french , and the chefs are french because it 's france ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joke , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ downboats !, 
  eastern europe = / = asia . 
  because everything is somehow capitalism 's fault and the world would be literally perfect if it was communist . 
  it 's not an issue with the hardware , mostly issues with my phone typing things i do n't want it to type . 
  if i delete a word , sometimes it just writes it again . 
  i 'm getting a new phone in a couple of days , so it does n't matter at this point . 
  no , not daredevil . 
  he 's originally from spiderman . 
  so on top of having tons of illegals from latin american , we should also take in middle eastern refugees because you feel our government is responsible ? 
  wow , now they 're just ripping off kingpin from spiderman !, 
  it 's not that simple . 
  he 's represented as an old man , but that 's not necessarily what he is . 
  think of the daedric gods from the elderscrolls universe . 
  they do n't have physical forms and can choose to be whatever they want to be , but they still have forms they 're represented by . 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's one of the three branches of its [ own religious group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yazd%c3%a2nism ) , but it 's influenced by zoroastrianism and abrahamic religions . 
  it 's its own separate religion with influence from others . 
  what do you mean ? 
  could it be considered a sect of another religion ? 
  i ca n't chill because i 'm on my phone right now and it 's making me angry because it keeps doing things i do n't want it to do . 
  it was n't `` the other day '' , it happened 2013 . 
  the article was written about the us asking for him to be arrested in 2013 . 
  it was extremely old news . 
  maybe try reading the article and not just the title . 
  read about the beliefs of the noi . 
  it 's scientology . 
  they believe that all races except for the white devils ( they literally think that whites are a race of devils created by an evil scientist ) are descendants of the tribe of shabazz , who came to earth on a flying saucer . 
   they 're not muslim , christian , or ** monotheist ** . 
  yes they are . 
  the yazidi religion is monotheistic . 
  i do n't know if they did or did n't , but / u/hmunkey is talking about the nation of islam . 
  we have nutella here as well . 
  nutella available around the world . 
  nation of islam has some `` strange '' beliefs ( like that whites are devils created by a scientist named yakub ) . 
  it 's like the scientology of islam , iirc . 
   i really dislike inconsistent banter , and that 's the only reason i called you on it . 
  sure that is , mate . 
  sure it is . 
  bring back colonialism everywhere except for mexico and central america . 
  there , we 'll restore the old empires . 
  new mexico is named after the city of mexico , which was founded by the aztecs . 
  i suggest that we just go back to colonialism and the us is just annexed by great britain , and spain annexes all of its former colonies . 
  in 2010 , georgia spent nearly 4 % of its gdp on its military . 
  hardly freeloading . 
  lies !, 
  putin is a bulwark against zionism and will save the white race !, 
  / pol / said so !, 
  hmmm ... how much cheese ? 
  but lemberg is n't polish . 
  i admit , warsaw does seem nice . 
  but what does it have to do with lemberg ? 
  there you go bringing up cities that are n't polish again . 
  what 's polish about an austrian city ? 
  you must be confused . 
  we 're talking about lviv/lemberg here , not warsaw . 
  why do you keep bringing up a formerly austrian and currently ukranian city ? 
  what does poland have to do with it ? 
  what does poland have to do with an austrian city ? 
  sorry , i 've never heard of a lwow . 
  perhaps you mean leopolis ? 
  you seem mighty angered , my friend . 
  maybe you guys should give germany back half of your ( oops , i mean their ) country .
