  you mean like when danzig was majority german ? 
  maybe you should give that back . 
  lemberg is austrian . 
  the mighty habsburg chin demands its return . 
  edit : i just love all the angry overly patriotic poles with no sense of humor or sarcasm downvoting me . 
  comedy gold . 
  and i thought it was the germans who do n't understand humor . 
  why would you being ignorant hurt me ? 
  and this somehow made you an expert on what opinions latinos hold on if the southwest should be annexed by mexico ? 
  i guess you obviously have more knowledge on this subject than me , since i only spent a vast majority on my life in the southwest while you were in california for a short time and `` worked '' with people from the southwest . 
  i 'm sorry for doubting you , professor . 
  you know , for an `` american '' , you mostly post about how you live in finland . 
  i do n't know if this has changed recently , but i do n't think that finland is part of the usa . 
  i do n't know if you 're trolling or just genuinely ignorant . 
  no they did n't . 
  russians are a splinter group from the rus slavs . 
  the rus split into ruthenians and russians . 
  and no , ruthenians and russians were n't the same people and did n't even speak the same language . 
  the man who lviv is named after was the ruler of the kingdom of galicia -- volhynia ( also called the kingdom of ruthenia ) and spoke ruthenian . 
   it was theurs for a very long time no it was n't . 
  it was spain 's for a long time . 
  the spanish did n't settle in most of it , they just claimed it as their own . 
  the mexicans revotled against the spanish , and still did n't settle most of it . 
  you 're back peddling from your original point that mexicans do n't believe it and are now trying to justify it . 
  and i did n't say a majority want it , and did i ? 
  i said that we have some mexicans who want it . 
  does `` some '' mean `` a majority of '' in your delusional little world ? 
  you 're either a ) not from the southwest b ) delusional c ) a liar many mexicans think that the southwest is `` rightfully mexican '' and should be part of mexico . 
  go lie to yourself somewhere else . 
   do you see latinos having mexican flags ? 
  yes . 
  we also have mexicans who want mexico to annex the south west , think we `` stole '' the land of their ancestors despite them never settling the vast majority of it , refuse to learn the english language , and think that sneaking across the border is perfectly fine because it 's `` their land '' . 
  we have our own problems with immigrant , both legal and illegal . 
  sure it is . 
  is wilno also an old , polish city as well ? 
  kijow too , right ? 
  i know . 
  i was thinking about editing my comment to say `` i agree , lemberg should be given back to austria . '', 
  but lviv is already in its rightful country . 
   novaya ukraina i think you mean nova ukraina . 
  novaya ukraina would be in russian . 
  senseless violence and people exploding into bits is a-okay , but a nipple is just too much . 
  well , we did outlaw all alcohol at one point . 
  being prudes is part of our culture . 
  this country was founded because some prudes wanted to be prudes without being told to stop . 
  why did you choose to post this low quality bait on this subreddit and not / r/sports or / r/soccer ? 
  really ? 
  you 're honestly posting tribes with similar names as evidence ? 
  by this logic , albanians obviously came from the kingdom of albania in the caucasus . 
  it 's there to make the castle feel authentic , i guess . 
  i do n't think it 's actually been used to torture people . 
  [ castello di amorosa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castello_di_amorosa#/media/file:castello-di-amorosa-front-2015.jpg ) is actually relatively close to me . 
  it was founded by an italian-american not long ago . 
  he named it after his great grandfather , who came to california from italy . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ bully, 
  the a-10 is n't sent out unless they 've established air superiority . 
  you ca n't be a government agency here if your logo does n't look like it was made in powerpoint 1987 . 
   non european worried that other non europeans are getting european citizenship faster than him . 
  i doubt it would be very different if he was a european from outside of the eu or schengen area . 
  as someone who also laughs during unfortunate moments , it was probably due to shock . 
  israel and lebanon come to mind as less `` creepy '' . 
  [ that 's not even close to being true . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/recognition_of_israel.svg/853px-recognition_of_israel.svg.png ), 
  i noticed that as well . 
  he deserves as much credit as the other two . 
  i 've had it for like a year , so i 'll probably just keep it . 
  a signed photo of queen elizabeth was my first choice , but you actually need to live in the commonwealth :(, 
  their names were made public . 
  anthony sadler and aleck sharlatos are the two marines and chris norman is the british man ( he helped fight the attacker ) .

  [ chris norman ] ( http://i.imgur.com/doejb2a.jpg ) ( the man on the far right ) , the british man who was shot , helped fight the attacker after he was discovered . 
  indo-europeans did n't come from india , they came from the area around the black sea and later invaded india . 
  i heard canadians could get a signed photo of stephan harper if they asked in an email , so i asked for one in an email . 
  i got it about a month later in the mail . 
  would it still be satire if he walked around and made people tell him if something is from australia or not , then complained about it if it was n't ? 
  the beer can biting part would have been okay satire , but the rest is just him complaining . 
  and your post history makes you seem like an anti-western and anti-nato shill . 
  if i called mandela a terrorist , i would be correct . 
  edit : looking at your comments made me realize talking to you is a waste of time . 
  `` terrorism is okay as long as i do n't like the country being terrorized . '', 
  how else can they make turkey seem like they love the isis ? 
  look at how much damage the pkk has caused to turkey . 
  [ looks like it wo n't be getting it any time soon . 
  that 's a strange looking lamp . 
  [ desk is against a wall , so i was n't able to get far back enough for a better shot . 
  it 's either extremely good satire or they are dead serious . 
  nothing they say is supposed to be amusing . 
  i do n't understand how complaining about imports is satirical . 
  people go into a supermarket and complain about it having products made outside of russia . 
  yep , they were complaining about the store having non-russian products . 
  they spent some time complaining about having spanish oil . 
  nobody lives there and it 's as much of a country as the `` kingdom '' that one father `` founded '' for his daughter . 
   i did n't include kosovo since more than half of un members recognize its sovereignty . 
  the russians would have probably done it themselves . 
  they love burning down moscow , you know . 
  that 's [ generalplan ost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) . 
  if i read the article correctly , most of the `` elimination '' for non-jews and non-russians was going to be deportation to western siberia . 
  i understand what you 're saying , but leon `` forming '' castile would mean that leon became castile , not that parts of leon left it and became castile . 
  i know , but leon did n't `` form '' castile .
