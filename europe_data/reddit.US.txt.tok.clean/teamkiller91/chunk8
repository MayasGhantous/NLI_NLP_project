  the russians got it from a mongolian khan ( possibly [ altan khan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/altan_khan_of_the_khalkha ) ) and later passed it on to other slavs . 
  they did n't get it from the turks . 
  they all took it from persians . 
  your posts seem like a parody but you 're also 100 % serious . 
  [ i switched two states around . 
  find which ones . 
  this is going to be really hard . 
  wales was part of england when the flag was made . 
  well , look at who turkey borders . 
  no , not really . 
  but if you knew anything about the history of north america at the time past the polandball version you learned on reddit , we would n't be having this conversation in the first place . 
  unless you 're talking about the war of 1812 , canada was a colony you had taken from the french at that point . 
  it was mostly full of dirty frogs . 
  they 're invading it with rap and r&b music . 
  because if it was high quality , it would take up a lot more space . 
  no , [ this is siberia ] ( http://www.sbras.ru/img/asia-map.jpg ) . 
  that 's the siberian federal district . 
  what ... 
   like america is sending weapons to ** the ukraine ** oh boy . 
  also , it should be noted that almost all ( or all ) of the `` proof '' of the us sending weapons to ukraine is never in full color or daylight . 
  it 's always recorded in the darkest time of night possible . 
  i guess the weapons explode in the light and must be recorded then . 
  pork lion is okay , but i prefer beef tender lion . 
  you 'd rather help a terrorist organization ? 
  you mean light pollution ? 
  what ? 
  if you come to a country legally on a temporary visa and do n't leave , you 're as illegal as someone who snuck across the border . 
  you 're not a victim . 
  it 's not `` incredibly easy to become illegal '' at all . 
  no , it means doing something in an attempt to be noticed . 
  who needs logic when making things up is so much more fun ? 
  [ here , use this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzskyv6.png?1?7607 ) edit : i see you deleted [ your block of text ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fkyv6tq.png ) to appear less butthurt . 
  you still need that cream , though . 
  edit 2 : hey , it 's back again !, 
  look at how people react when the someone says that illegal immigration needs to be stopped or illegals need to be deported . 
  it 's mostly people screaming `` racist !! '', 
  pretty sure it 's saying that it ca n't keep up with the north . 
  we need another plague or two . 
  maybe a meteor . 
  it 's a crime against nature . 
  america to europe : try living in the southwest and then say that our `` love of air-conditioning '' is stupid . 
  being comfortable is a horrible thing !, 
  how is that criminal activity ? 
  how is that even jealousy ? 
  and why did you seriously use `` jelly '' ? 
  i know about the chechen wars and the hostage situations . 
  the second chechen was 13 years before the bombing and nobody really thought about them enough for it to give chechens a bad reputation . 
  well , they were n't really thought about until the boston bombing . 
  but yes , they have a bad reputation here now . 
  you do n't have a friend who said that because you made it up . 
  i know , but they 're still not frankish . 
  they interbred with the locals . 
  they did n't assimilate into the frankish culture , they mixed it with their own . 
  that 's why i 'm calling them normans instead of norsemen . 
  calling the normans `` frankish normans '' would be like calling all turks `` greek turks '' because they interbred with the indigenous greeks . 
  and ? 
  they were still not frankish.they are a separate entity from the franks . 
  and even if they were frankish , what the do they have to do with the bretons ? 
  did you seriously edit your comment to seem more aggressive ? 
  really ? 
  franks were a german tribe . 
  the normans were not part of a german tribe . 
  interbreeding with said german tribe does n't make them part of it . 
  normans were not franks in any way shape or form . 
  they were romance language speaking descendants of norsemen who invaded france , not franks . 
  hell , the word `` norman '' comes from the old french word for norseman . 
  what made you think they were frankish ? 
  well , brittany does get its name from the fact that the bretons came from southwestern britain to escape the germanic migration . 
  fucking anglos ( getting / ** not getting ** ) involved in ( everything / ** anything ** ) !, 
  those damn ( imperialist / ** isolationist ** ) bastards !, 
  they ( always / ** never ** ) ( harm / ** help ** ) the poor population of ( the middle east / ** europe ** ) !, 
  the return of danelaw is coming . 
  you heard it here first . 
  i see your point . 
  it 's mostly problems with who borders them , not with iran itself . 
   look , even with that your government is unanimous in handling shit not really . 
  thanks to our horrible two party system , things can rarely get done because the two parties rarely agree on anything because they want to stay in power instead of fixing the country . 
  most of our illegals are n't mexican , they 're central americans . 
  teenage girls would cry on television . 
  not really , they were just fucked over by the fptp system . 
  he does n't look anorexic at all . 
  pizza , hamburgers , and fries are the best american food . 
  i doubt there are very many slavic russians who are muslims . 
  most russian muslims are tatars . 
  smolensk was a vassal just like ruthenia . 
  if you want to include ruthenia under `` polish-lithuanian '' , smolensk should also be included in it . 
  what he said is in no way edgy . 
  fixed your link for you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fire_of_moscow_ ( 1812 ), 
  water does n't stop illegals . 
  just look at all the cubans floating on doors to florida . 
  i 'd have no problem if she just criticized videogames , but she does n't criticize videogames . 
  she 's akin to jack thompson . 
  being rude to people on the internet is n't something i like to do unless they 're rude first . 
  reddit could use more people who can appreciate a good meme or two without downvoting people because they disagree . 
  i 'm not sure if you live in a cave or something , but mannerisms can 100 % be annoying . 
  and she has very annoying mannerisms . 
  but hey , you seem like an active poster on / r/gamerghazi , which tells me enough about you to not continue this conversation . 
  also , nice memewords and memefaces , my memetastic friend , 
  in what shape or form am i `` salty '' , my memespamming friend ? 
  not only are her opinions annoying and obnoxious , but she even * looks * annoying and obnoxious .
