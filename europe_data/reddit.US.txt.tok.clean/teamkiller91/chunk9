  the jews , iran , and the us are to blame for everything bad to ever happen . 
  remember that meteor that killed the dinosaurs ? 
  that was the americans . 
  the volcanic eruption at pompey ? 
  that was iran . 
  polio ? 
  that was the jews . 
  talk as much shit about compton as you want , but at least it 's not detroit . 
  `` lost kids '' who go join a terrorist organization and murder people . 
  poor kids . 
  the sadness caused by them dying might put me into a deep depression . 
  we 've been found out, 
  apples are a lie created by the illuminati and knight 's templar . 
  have you seen an apple since then ? 
  did n't think so . 
  it 's not `` re-re-discovery '' because discovering something does n't mean you were the first to find it . 
  it just means you found it . 
  the article says that erdogan claims that muslims discovered the americas before columbus , not that they discovered it first . 
  importing tropical trees to places they do n't belong is a western us tradition . 
  slactivism always gets so much done . 
  spanish netherlands was the habsburg netherlands without the dutch republic . 
  it 's not hard to see if you look at the map . 
  that 's belgium , not the netherlands . 
  now i see . 
   65 % upvoted why the hell are people downvoting this ?

  is sweden next to ukraine just in case ukraine wants another rurik ? 
  would n't her son being gay be part of `` god 's plan '' ? 
  oh , thanks . 
  i changed it . 
  an orthodox priest is singing some prayer in serbian , camera pans over to some soldiers holding candles , then pans to other soldiers just standing . 
  it then pans over some civilians and back to the priest who is now reading something about `` the enemy '' ( one of the few words i could understand ) . 
  the priest then begins to bless soldiers . 
  the footage changes to trucks carrying the civilians to a field . 
  the civilians are then show lying on the ground as a soldier is saying something to them . 
  then footage switches to the civilians lying on the ground , face down . 
  after a while of talking among the soldiers , the civilians are moved to another area . 
  they are then killed and moved somewhere else . 
  the video ends there . 
   85-90 % of the population of a country i doubt 10 % of russia is n't heterosexual considering that 4 % of britain is lgbt . 
  ** both sides are claiming it ** . 
  the issue is n't that nobody is claiming it , the issue is that two countries are claiming it . 
  ah , alright . 
  i 'm just a little confused because most countries either teach that north and south america are one thing or that they 're divided at panama and everything north of colombia is north american . 
  and i do n't think that central europe does n't exist , i was just saying some think that . 
  the reason is because they split east and west europe based on the eastern bloc without east germany . 
  the wikipedia article says that it 's part of north america . 
   central america is the southernmost , isthmian ** portion of the north american continent ** , which connects with south america on the southeast . 
  like i said before , central america is part of north america . 
  is mexico in north or central america ? 
  this map is religious and linguistic families . 
  it even says that in the title and multiple times in the legend . 
  it says `` arabic '' as in arabic language . 
  the legend says that the red text is language , not ethnicity . 
  [ they speak arabic and it 's their sole official language . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabic_language#/media/file:arabic_speaking_world.svg ), 
  weird . 
  most countries that use the 7 continent model teach that north and south america split at panama or the panama canal . 
  what about the caribbean ? 
  central america is considered part of north america . 
  it 's considered a region within north america , like the caribbean . 
  north america starts at the southern border of panama . 
  same way some people think that north and south america are one continent , or that europe and asia are one continent . 
  they think that central europe is a made up concept and that europe is divided into northern , southern , western , and eastern europe . 
  depends on if the person believes in central europe or not . 
  if not , you guys are 100 % in eastern europe . 
  nice edgy and memetastic post , friend . 
  it 's a typo . 
  are we all supposed to shitpost about it like they do in the default subs ? 
  `` why are you living in a foreign country ? 
  i could n't live in the netherlands for five days . '',

  it 's pronounced the same way in english as it is in polish , but written differently because it would be pronounced `` ch-meal-nick-ee '' if the english spelling was similar to the polish spelling . 
  really worked out for the zaporozhian cossacks ( the guys who lead the khmelnytsky uprising ) considering that catherine the great forced them to disband . 
   since ancient rus with the first capital in novgorod . 
  rus was n't founded until oleg moved to kiev . 
  read what ? 
  about your imaginary revolution against the us ? 
  the philippines never had a revolution against the us . 
  the us and the filipinos had one war , and the us was the aggressor in it . 
  the moro rebellion is the closest thing to your imaginary revolution . 
  it was the only major rebellion and was only supported by muslim filipinos in the south . 
  the baltics are n't religious , yet look at their opposition . 
  estonia , one of the most atheist countries in the world , is on the same level as poland , croatia , bulgaria , and ukraine . 
  you forgot to remove the ` u 's . 
  * yo forgot to remove the '' z. 
  no they did n't . 
  the philippine revolution was against the spanish . 
  we made the spanish give them independence after the spanish-american war , then we [ invaded the philippines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippine%e2%80%93american_war ) and made them into a territory . 
  there were spread out resistances , but there was no philippine revolution against the us . 
  there was one war between the philippines and the us , and the us was the aggressor . 
  calling a southerner a yank is a great way to get into a fight . 
  they were a colony of ours until we let them go after ww2 . 
  there were plans to annex them and make them a state , but they were never followed through . 
  it did , though .
