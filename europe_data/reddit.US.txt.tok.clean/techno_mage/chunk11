  this is why they are notoriously nasty , due to the lengths at which both sides try to do this . 
  thank you mexico for being more civil . 
  the island just needs to be reinvented . 
  turn it into the east coast bahamas version of hawaii . 
  if they cant make it up through population , do it by tourism . 
  \u2669 \u266a \u266b \u266c our main export is crippling depression !, 
  independence of being a state or territory tho ? 
  things would be incredibly different if pr becomes a state , taxes would probs be the most upsetting . 
   what about if a u.s. state agrees to pay its share of the u.s. national debt before seceding , though ? 
  the problem is its a balancing act . 
  some states make more then others , which the money is thrown around to help cover the less successful states . 
  if we add or lose a state this would be a chain reaction . 
  this is probs the biggest reason puerto rico is n't a state ( they would be another state to prop up ) . 
  the states that would be wanting to secede aka most likely a southern state ; would never be able to pay the debt . 
  the only reason they stay afloat is because of states like new york . 
  texas is probs the only exception as it could ( as long as they do everything right ) pay its debt but it would still throw everyone else off until the budget was balanced . 
  he 's on a thin line . 
  considering he keeps telling the amount of money he has , then it 's proven wrong . 
  i hope he rly runs so he loses it all on campaigning . 
   i can think of no other ban that is executed in a similar fashion . 
  confederate flag ban , are these now similar ? 
  why would n't pr just secede after becoming a state tho ? 
  i 've heard the opinion to remain independent is very strong . 
  would n't it spark conflict ? 
  wars that we would win , then take the oil and somehow put it into a can like cheese , just to spite u. 
  600,000-800 ,000 dead still hasnt been topped ... : l, 
  because u already did ... german and french banks threw money at greece to keep its payments coming . 
  basically u gave loans to pay other existing loans . 
  `` u want me to pay for their military and their country wtf !, 
  europe ! '',

  the brain drain continues in russia it seems . 
  oh my bad wrong time period , carry on . 
  i believe some of the gold was used for the marshal plan and the art/history army core did return most of what they found . 
  tho we still have [ hitlers watercolors .

  i 've heard bout comecom briefly , their version of the marshal plan was n't it ? 
  how successful was it ? 
  queue american mercenary clapping along off stage . 
  ca n't kill all the terrorists . 
  u.s. is n't planning on stopping anytime soon . 
  kinda the plus to drones little rest and no i.e.d. 
  damage . 
  also the us r&d kinda have a hard on for robotics atm . 
  : l  oh i kind of get that you wanted to kill saddam , but war seems a bit over the top . 
  and it 's definitely not article 5-worthy , that 's not for terrorists . 
  article 5 worthy no , you 're correct . 
  however if the roles were switched , i 'd find it hard to believe any country would have just let it go . 
  you know the 2-3kish deaths ...  yes , you like pointless patriotism . 
  murica . 
  the word you 're looking for is jingoistic btw . 
  patriotism would be me like going `` usa usa usa usa !, 
  gr8ist country evr blahblahblah , we could win a war against the whole world !, 
  dribble dribble dribble '' . 
  information is a commodity , its addiction ( knowledge is power ) is overwhelming ; and the us is the dealer . 
  u realize this `` bad day '' had the casualties of pearl harbor right ? 
  if we went to war over that , why does this seem odd to you ? 
  the us are like a bee hive , you attack it on it 's shore and the whole hive wakes up . 
  you know we would be the invaders right . 
  that means [ shit like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punji_stick#/media/file:vietnam....marines_of_company_h,_2nd_battalion,_4th_regiment,_walk_through_a_punji-staked_gully._-_nara_-_532439.tif )  _ , 
  u want kite drone u.s. help . 
  set it up as a war game . 
  also we 've had war games dealing with invading the uk , so it be fair . 
  drones beat guns , the whole idea that a heavily armed population stops bad government is ridiculous . 
  the national guard in every state have tanks , assault rifles wont do shit . 
  it 's more of a nra/redneck wet dream, 
  it may take u.s. awhile but we generally try to do the right thing . 
  ill make u a trade , your real chocolate for our real ... ish peanut butter . 
  does n't every states national guard have tanks or at least light armored vehicles ? 
  fuck it , send the chocolate to us ... flowers meh i 'd keep them to help with europeans bee population . 
  set up some protected bee hatcheries . 
  dont know how op [ but i beat you ] ( http://imgur.com/a/nxzlb ) abe lincoln would be proud . 
  well military service also grants citizenship , so my question is how many of our armed forces are from other countries ? 
  auxiliaries if u will . 
  rly i mean look at the first two world wars ? 
  its a european war until we are attacked . 
  you should rly read about the `` american first '' movement . 
  they had a rally like a couple of days after pearl harbor and all their members evaporated in thin air . 
  hmmm when did we attack saudi arabia ? 
  must have been asleep during our conquest ... . . 
  it depends on the parent , i live in ohio a blue state . 
  we had a willow tree in our backyard , where my parents would joke about using it as a switch . 
  its basically a whip like object like a belt for the most part . 
  trying to be friends with everyone on the other hand , will make you the most popular dead person in town . 
  ar n't we the new spanish ... ... our native record is n't that clean either . 
  idk they sure as hell fought for poland . 
  well lets count shall we . 
  you have the marines , air force , navy , coast guard , each states national guard ( which have tanks ) , and police w/swat . 
  finally after you get through all that ; you have to go door to door looking for weapons which could be potentially waiting for you to knock ... . good luck . 
  kidding kidding he looks more like dobby the house elf . 
  yes but you are forgetting the biggest threat to china is its army .
