  there is the potential due to corruption the ability to bribe commanders . 
  along with that 30-40 % of the chinese soldiers training is reported to be communist indoctrination training . 
  aka they spend a good amount not even training with weapons . 
  [ source : not sure how true/reliable it is , but here 's where i got that info .

   it fits their more passive role in the last years wat ... . . o_o, 
  interpol, 
  germany , to not have a military . 
  or at least a smaller one . 
  should let em , no point in being in a defense alliance if they are not going to do anything . 
  so turn germany into the logistical center of nato military ? 
  well how about we give chickens better fucking conditions to help stop the breeding ground for disease , in the clusterfuckery that is our chicken farms ? 
  agreed i think tanks are outdated anyway , tho what would u possibly do to stabilize these countries ? 
  specifically the ones wanting the tanks ? 
  the ones on russia 's boarder want to have our troops there from what im told . 
  talk to ur fellow euros bout that one . 
  tho it 's mostly was a polandball reference . 
  smh , i 'm one of the most isolationist americans here . 
  im am not `` tom clancy '' im not hysteric over russia . 
  average citizens with the exception of those who grew up during the cold war ; do n't quite frankly give two complete shits over russia . 
  all i stated was basic military technology advantage principle . 
  the point is to be ahead of potential enemies not at the same lvl or behind . 
  while russia is n't the s.u. 
  anymore , it 's almost certainty wearing the mask of it . 
  so wheres yuri 's mind control device ? 
  fine but u must use ... ikea and legos with an open can of surstromming !, 
  mwhahahahaha, 
  during the wwii era finland fought s.u. 
  at least ( that i can remember 3 wars ) the finish winter war ( stalin was scared finland would let the germans attack leningrad ) annexing the land would solve that problem . 
  lapland war which was from finland having german soldiers aka wat stalin feared in the first war . 
  then wwii where germans and finish troops attacked s.u. , finland wanted revenge from losing land in the first winter war . 
  false they acquired the nickle rich areas ( which helped them rebuild due to its importance in metallurgy ) in terms of wwii moscow armistice tho i think he means areas , not the whole of country of finland . 
  `` the moscow armistice was signed by finland and the soviet union on 19 september 1944 ending the continuation war , though the final peace treaty was not to be signed until 1947 in paris . 
  the conditions for peace were similar to those previously agreed in the 1940 moscow peace treaty , ** with finland being forced to cede parts of finnish karelia , a part of salla and islands in the gulf of finland . 
  the new armistice also handed the whole of petsamo over to the soviet union . 
  ** finland also agreed to legalize communist parties and ban fascist organizations . 
  finally , the armistice also demanded that finland must expel german troops from its territory , which was the cause of the lapland war . '', 
  cuba 's on our side now , they got nothing on us . ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  a russian who understands our grading scale ... madness, 
  hmmm i see a potential for profit ... 
  lockheed martin is boasting to have a working prototype in 10-20 yrs . 
  do n't know how true it is , but the potential for the company to have it may have influenced their decision . 
  when it comes to projects , the u.s. may be just showing u want it wants to . 
  remember the stealth attack helicopters which attacked osama 's compound , the chopper 's r&d was canceled on paper yet there they were ; just something to think about ... [ link for lockheed ] ( http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/compact-fusion.html ), 
  makes me wonder about the cuban one we 'll open soon . 
  i am 1/234th of < insert your country here , 
  why not just let each country keep a small army for personal use ? 
  ( usa 's national guard for example ) hell just use your ceremonial troops as the n.g. 
  you clearly dont understand american jingoistic bloodlust ... . take it from this [ englishman ( bottom pic . 
  ) ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ntqsi ) tl : dr [ in short ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/we-will-kill-you-in-your-sleep-on-christmas.jpg ), 
  the secret to how our government has lasted so long , people cant tell what it rly is / s, 
  i was thinking the discussion was related to genocides in general ? 
  naive americans : if we go by ratio , we were more successful then the nazi 's . 
  not sure about s.u. 
  's gulags tho ... in terms of russians we also go into the civil war after wwi , we joined the whites & fought against reds . 
  after the american civil war the us has rly never been friends with russia . 
  u.s. as well rly ... 
  not if you own a whiskey distillery and offer it to ur voters . 
  thanks washington  _ , 
   us were ranked higher than most european countries in that statistic wait how with all the political gridlock ? ... ... if i remember the republicans were even trying to sue the prez . 
  let me look up some more info brb . 
  edit : [ found some ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/south-koreas-armed-forces-to-remain-fully-under-us-military-command/5410849 ) `` south korean officials say the u.s. must have control of both american and s.k. 
  military operations to most effectively deter north korea and maintain coordinated military activities . '', 
  they might not need un intervention , in the event of the conflict reigniting sk wants the us to control their military ( its actually a law o_o ) . 
  so even without the un the us is fighting regardless . 
  to die of malaria or some shit nty . 
  the last place i wan na be is the mosquito breeding jurassic park bite you to death africa , with little to no medication . 
  ill take the instant death of the bomb anyday .

  http://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2012/01/23/can-china-sink-a-u-s-aircraft-carrier/ this might be along the lines of what you are talking about , tho it seems very ... jingoistic i guess is the word im looking for . 
  are these super carriers or just helicopter ones tho ? 
   _  spoiler : when an american talks about aircraft carriers , 90 % of the time they mean super carriers like our new ford class . 
   the nato countries have n't done that , because they are n't in an all-out war . 
  yes but the point of war is having ur shit ready before one starts . 
  unless ur an island ur going to be playing catchup in equipment , manufacturing , and training . 
  tl : dr ur going to get steamrolled unless ur an island, 
  if you dont have a flag , someone will come plant their own . 
  - if eddie izzard has taught me anything . 
  stupid amounts of money would be pointless if i keep losing it in protectionist lawsuits , forcing me to give up the source ; basically the dna building blocks of a program im making money off of . 
  muh tax monies d :, 
  no company in software would turn over its source that easily . 
  i 'd rather leave the country then give it up . 
  queue hells march, 
  [ ur ironman suit sir ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=project+talos ), 
  we should just form with china already like in firefly . 
  i would recommend not pulling a u.s. after 9/11 , a lot of wasted money just saying . 
  no eu needs to handle this one . 
  plz write a book i 'd love to read more . 
  the military and economic theories were expertly composed and i enjoyed it . 
  if you wrote a book on the cold war i 'd buy it . 
  thats why we have guns and why canada only has 30-40ish million population , the dragons come out during the winter . 
   you guys made plans for another war with the uk . 
  we have military plans for everything and everyone no joke . 
  russia [ \u2713 ] zombies [ \u2713 ] aliens [ \u2713 \u2713 ], 
  thats like putting an empire inside of an empire , or a flea inside of a box and hitting it with a hammer . 
  people would just think ur here for the revolutionary war reenactment . 
  then the tea party would get pissed probs . 
  would be hilarious . 
  10/10 would dress up like redcoat to piss of tea party members . 
  would be the best revenge to get a gay member as their translator .
