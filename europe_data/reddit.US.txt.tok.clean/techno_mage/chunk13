  f-35 's the new iphone , everyone 's doin it :p, 
  lol while the enemy is behind you lock on and drop a missile that stalls until it ( enemies plane ) passes then starts ignition behind him . 
  the helmet itself is revolutionary . 
  it allows you to see through the plane and lock-on to the target behind you !, 
  its like aim bot in short .

  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gadsden_flag#/media/file:1885_history_of_us_flags_med.jpg ) is basically some of the flags we had , keep in mind the dont tread on me or other flags pre federalization were different for each colony to rep each militia . 
  also dont complain about looks when you were looking for the story . 
  tho u might find modern state flags better . 
  [ here 's my state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_ohio ) :p, 
   e pluribus unum [ source ] ( http://greatseal.com/mottoes/unumflowers.html ) ** the latin motto ** `` e pluribus unum '' appeared on the title page of the annual volume of the gentleman 's magazine or monthly intelligencer -- next to a drawing of a hand holding a bouquet of different flowers . 
  `` america was originally likened to a bouquet of different flowers , where unity and individuality coexisted -- not a `` melting pot '' that blended everyone together . '', 
  [ another source ] ( http://coins.about.com/od/uscoins/f/e_pluribus_unum.htm ) < - at the bottom fun facts about e pluribus unum just as the u.s. has thirteen original colonies , e pluribus unum has thirteen letters in it . 
  ** the term ex pluribus unum ( a minor variation ) dates to ancient times , where [ saint augustine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustine_of_hippo ) uses it in his c. 397-398 confessions ( book iv . 
  ) ** e pluribus unum still appears on u.s. coins even though it is no longer the official national motto !, 
  that honor was given to in god we trust in 1956 by an act of congress ( 36 u.s.c. 
  or quick med evac depending on the situation . 
  depends if they have the [ firepower ] ( http://accurateshooter.net/blog/gau1904.jpg ) to defend with them . 
  not our first flag tho ... [ this is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gadsden_flag ), 
   e pluribus unum out of many one , is a roman motto . 
  the u.s. govt is equally roman , greek , and a bit of carthage ( which i guess is roman sense they defeated them ) . 
  meh just me being optimistic , hoping the fed reserve gets the big picture one day . 
  when all the bills they are bout to recycle have x 's on the back . 
  there 's been several attempts to get `` in god we trust '' removed but try getting support from people in what they believe ( or rather want to believe ) to be a christan founding country . 
  agreed in god we trust is appalling , i cross it out on all our bills whenever i can . 
  e pluribus unum is a much better idea for the u.s. as to what it should be . 
  im going to give you intelligence you cant refuse ... 
  [ we got this ] ( http://robobees.seas.harvard.edu/ ), 
  where are the weresharks !, 
  if only we did this for our cities , new york or san fransisco would be a power station . 
  we should turn all our military into a national pmc and sell it to the highest bidder : o, 
  you seem to be a bit frantic and skeptical of the anglo alliance . 
  the uk has always had more in common with its past colonies then it ever will with europe . 
  im not saying the uk should n't be part of the eu , most americans say go for it . 
  our countries will always have a bond that others simply cant match by adapting to its language alone . 
  the uk has always been free to make its own destiny why would it stop now ? 
  the way ur making this sound is that the uk can only have one best friend ... 
  here you go [ abrams explosion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sibsgel314 ) keep in mind abrams is one of the heaviest of modern tanks . 
  all i could find was something about some of the crew being killed but nothing on the condition of the tank afterwords . 
  [ drone boats close enough ? 
  ] ( http://nypost.com/2014/10/05/navy-unveils-self-guided-drone-boats/ ), 
  add another to that list, 
  can i as an american join u as a merc for hire ? 
  the helmet for the plane itself is revolutionary on its own ... 
  froggies or frogs is an american term from ww1 because they liked to eat frog legs . 
  in return they called our soldiers sammie 's for uncle sam . 
  comedy gold that is all . 
  his own son was the officer , after almost killing himself stalin said `` he can even shoot straight '' fucking dick of a father if i ever saw one . 
  bias maybe ? 
  the article seems to be on nato coverage bout ukraine so it would make sense . 
  but the willingness to use nukes on the common battlefield ... so russia ... . . ? 
  hence the lol at the beginning ? 
  i understood and am not downvoting u. 
  i imagine hitler doing the nazi salute when pulling the train whistle lol, 
  lol in all reality tho , very few countries can even make their own stealth planes . 
  let alone cover entire buildings with the material ...
