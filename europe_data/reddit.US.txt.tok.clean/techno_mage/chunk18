  documentary on [ darpa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ifap0tlf_i ) for those interested . 
   that list is literally b **** . 
  there is nothing that is not b **** about it . 
  i think you have a different list or something , its `` literally '' a list or wars/conflicts we 've been in . 
  you take from it what you will ; but its all well recorded wars the us has partaken in . 
   that 's basically how useful that list is and how it relates conflict to the existence of the united states . 
  that is a false argument , the question was `` which country has been in more armed conflict ? '', 
  the answer is undoubtedly the us . 
  you are implying that us invents conflict by saying  how it relates conflict to the existence of the united states . 
  which is not what im answering , if you look at the list some wars were necessary . 
  specifically the civil war due to the fact the south is such a fuck up . 
  mexico lost land [ mexican-american war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican%e2%80%93american_war ) , canada defended theirs in 1812 . 
  remember its only recent that trading became a better alternative to war economic wise . 
  if russia however did start planting bases in canada im sure us would respond . 
  would like to point out that he is n't wrong . 
  us has been at conflict for [ 93 % of its total existence . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_the_united_states ) : l, 
   that is not a very comfortable position to be in indefinitely , as convenient as it may be today . 
  yes but the only thing stopping that is yourselves . 
  eu is the next superpower , not russia not china . 
  you guys `` across the pond '' . 
  everything to advance yourselves is within your hands not ours . 
  which is why for the life of me , i cant understand why you rely on us so much . 
  [ teh feels ] ( http://cdn.meme.am/instances/62359537.jpg ), 
   us never really left the cold war . 
  the us has been at war for [ 93 % of its total existence . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_the_united_states ) tldr : we fucking breathe war, 
  after seeing the film idiocracy , i almost wish we had eugenics . 
  please , the eu is more likely to be the next superpower . 
  not russia or even china . 
  famous last words before you see this out your [ window .

   or extermination during the robot uprising . 
  some would at least keep us [ alive ] ( http://glitch.news/2015-08-27-ai-robot-that-learns-new-words-in-real-time-tells-human-creators-it-will-keep-them-in-a-people-zoo.html ), 
   personnel having personal contact with customers requires a much higher skill level than just picking up packages from a shelf and sending them somewhere at order of a computer system . 
  they dont even have to go find the item [ robots ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_r8feycu-m ) bring it to them . 
  very professional as well when i 've used them . 
   the bundeswehr is already horribly underfunded . 
  if the military isnt being as well funded ; i would personally be fine with it being allocated to space funding . 
  parliaments can actually be more unrepresentative . 
   at the brink of civil war also it seems like at every civil war millions have died . 
  would be more like a global humanitarian crisis then a civil war . 
   a good democracy watches the state and the people in its offices closely while giving individuals as much privacy as possible . 
  kinda contradictory but whatever i get what ur saying : /  the right to be forgotten is a tool to increase privacy . 
  the biggest fear in the us is that it will lead to censorship , get out of hand in stupid personal arguments . 
  or that it will put an end to being able to google if someone has a criminal record . 
  which is something we kinda would like to know about . 
  this is less an internet issue and more of a crime/criminal issue , to the everyday american . 
   right to forget which is also something most americans dont agree with anyway . 
  pffft why do people want to come here anyway . 
  nothing special . 
  `` we 're surrounded boys , they ca n't escape now . '', 
  probably `` the death of yugoslavia '' only one ik which has 6 episodes , and is bbc . 
  not only that but it has a assembly line effect , the more countries use/produce it the cheaper and faster it will be made ; due to interchangeable parts and other factors . 
  surprise its part of their dooms day prophesy actually . 
  80 flags of infidels will fight them ; then their prophet will show up to smite them or something . 
  also the differences between the two during the shift in terms of power . 
  pope  king ecumenical patriarch < king/emperor, 
  the nomads toward the right of the map in the mountains , do mostly end up either buddhist or hindu ... 
  just as planned ... 
  meh the 150 gold for the initial hiring would work , but with time of crossing the sea 's and the huge fort lvl of their providence . 
  they would desert from upkeep costs before you finished the capture . 
  united countries of commonwealth ? 
  angloalliance ? 
  eagle , lion ( griffin ) coalition special forces ? 
  quick summon liberty prime !, 
  basically none , s.u. 
  shot down a couple of american spy planes during the cold war . 
   all its neighbours and handling them like puppets . 
  and we do n't ? 
  for example im sure south america feels the same from our cold war policies . 
  this , despite all the republican rhetoric they do n't actually want to close the boarder unless they 're crazy and do n't understand economics 's ; and aging population crisis 's that are happening all over the world . 
  its all just a vote grab stunt . 
  `` once in us history an episode of islamic terrorism was very quickly stopped . 
  it happened in the philippines about 1911 , when gen. john j. pershing was in command of the garrison . 
  there had been numerous islamic terrorist attacks , so `` black jack '' told his boys to catch the perps and teach them a lesson . 
  forced to dig their own graves , the terrorists were all tied to posts , execution style . 
  the us soldiers then brought in pigs and slaughtered them , rubbing their bullets in the blood and fat . 
  thus , the terrorists were terrorized ; they saw that they would be contaminated with hogs ' blood . 
  this would mean that they could not enter heaven , even if they died as terrorist martyrs . 
  all but one was shot , their bodies dumped into the grave , and the hog guts dumped atop the bodies . 
  the lone survivor was allowed to escape back to the terrorist camp and tell his brethren what happened to the others . 
  this brought a stop to terrorism in the philippines for the next 50 years . 
  pointing a gun into the face of islamic terrorists wo n't make them flinch . 
  they welcome the chance to die for allah . 
  like gen. pershing , we must show them that they wo n't get to muslim heaven ( which they believe has an endless supply of virgins ) but instead will die with the hated pigs of the devil . '', 
  - not sure if true or not , but why not use their own religion against em ? 
  bu ... but our debt from the first time . 
  i cant imagine english being the lingua franca tho once china overtakes the us . 
  so is it worth it spending time and resources switching everything to english , when its just going to change again ? 
  speak with your money not your mouth . 
  that 's the only thing businesses listen to . 
  in the us most high schools give you the chance of spanish or french , maybe german `` if '' you 're lucky . 
  most of it has to do with location . 
  canada to the north mexico to the south , also you only take 2yrs of it . 
  most of it you forget by the time you graduate . 
  didnt see it like that at the time nm point taken ... . . : l, 
  us president or vice president are definitely one of the worst jobs on the planet ... . why would you even want to run . 
  seems like a lose/lose to me . 
   xi would make more sense .
