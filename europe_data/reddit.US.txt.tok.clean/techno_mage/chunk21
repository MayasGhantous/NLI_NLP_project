  all this money and no impulse to fix things , like basic infrastructure or put pressure on corruption . 
  congress or the rest of our government never rly get anything done . 
  just a giant endless circle jerk on a few issues that never get solved . 
  the funny thing is ... i realized that after watching the eu mep 's vote and i was amazed at how effective and efficient it was . 
  all with no filibustering ...  _ , 
  i wonder about the mayor of london , and its guilds tho ... 
  russia won wwii , we just supplied the materials ...  _ , 
   the dragoon rides side note did n't dragoon ride ii just take place ? 
  its the least we can do right . 
  still wondering whats going to happen as a result . 
  9/11 saw a huge 180 from what the country used to be . 
  maybe easier to deal with to . 
  if they truly are a mafia state , all we 'd have to do is throw money at them . 
  hell of a lot easier then dealing with mixed demands from the eu . 
  [ cough cough ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=henry+ford+supplied+nazi+germany ), 
  i do n't mind if they fly by , just not that close . 
  if their pilot fucks up , not only has he ( probably/most likely ) killed himself and members of the ship ; but also just started a conflict . 
  i just do n't understand why they take that risk ... 
  idk how i feel about this , at one point i would like to think even if the u.s. was nuked ; we would n't retaliate so the world could continue . 
  so everything built , would n't be wiped in a single day what took a millennia to build . 
  then however there is history , history which to some countries has n't been the most faithful of companionship . 
  through the waters of leadership and governance which has time and time again , been full of perils and unknowability . 
  the end result for me as a single human being to guess ; would be nought but irresponsible to all those who would be involved , and worst to those who would live if any , in the hellish world i surely would n't like to see . 
  yea but as an american i must argue that france 's is the most metal hardcore shit i 've ever read . 
  ** french nuclear policy ** the usa and uk 's nuclear deterrent policy is the `` nofun '' doctrine : no first use of nuclear weapons , e.g. 
  they will never initiate nuclear engagement , only as retaliation to prior nuclear attack . 
  france 's nuclear deterrent is a bit different . 
  it 's based on the following principles : strategic independence from the usa and nato ; france probably would not be able to hold for very long from a warsaw pact invasion because of sheer numbers ; conquering france is n't worth losing 80 millions of your citizens . 
  so , the doctrine was massive nuclear retaliation even if we 've only been attacked by conventional forces . 
  oh yeah , and not military retaliation either - the nukes were pointed straight at the cities . 
  the idea was to tell the soviets : `` a single one of your troops sets foot here , we 're sending all our nukes in . 
  is the conquest of tiny france worth losing moscow , st petersburg and basically millions of russians ? '' . 
  but wait , it gets better/worse : the real smart part of french deterrent policy is that it relies on the `` one flies they all fly '' principle , which states that there is ** no such thing as a tactical or limited nuclear engagement ** - nuclear war can only ever be total , apocalyptic war . 
  so the idea was : if russia invades , we 'll send in all the nukes . 
  obviously russia retaliates with its own nuclear weapons , by which point france probably ceases to exist . 
  aha , but that forces the usa and uk to enter into the fray , and re-retaliate . 
  russia ceases to exist . 
  so , all things considered , russia does n't invade . 
  this way , we were able to mount a very effective deterrent at a fraction of the cost . 
  for example , the soviet union 's `` seven days to the rhine '' plan stopped right there at the rhine . 
  basically , through a combination of game theory and nuclear holocaust , we 've prevented a 1940 from ever happening again, 
  after a strike in the office over lunch break rations . 
  money talks , bullshit walks , after all . 
   eu as a single country hmmm europeans tell me otherwise ... after all if europeans do n't except it , why should we ? 
  you have the ability to counteract this , federalize you fucks ( its been forever already ) . 
  for everyone 's sake . 
  when the u.s. had a rival that 's when it tried to better itself . 
  it had competition to be better it had an image to uphold , to advance itself and now it does n't and has free reign . 
  shit , would have done it once they accused us of starting the coup d'etat and surrounded the military base protesting . 
  a lot of german stuff was destroyed during / after the war . 
  tiger tanks for example , tho more common for collecting purposes are nazi currency . 
  specifically their silver coins . 
  as a rule of thumb , if a country does n't look like it 's going to stay around save its currency . 
  in u.s. history for example confederacy stuff is more valuable then union , when dealing with civil war collectors . 
  agree , the internal political shit happening right now should also lower us . 
  you know with he whole russian witch hunt , happening right now . 
  we know they influenced the elections , its just not known how much . 
  if this was the cold war ; some of these republicans would be getting a bullet to the back of the head for treason . 
  many politicians were prostituted for less . 
  obama does n't set visa 's , which is why this wont go through . 
  you want visa free for all eu members , create a single passport . 
  the u.s. and canada , look at counties on a individual basis . 
  if push comes to shove the u.s. wont change , over 60 % of american citizens do n't leave the continent . 
  eu has far more to lose by trying to force this . 
  which is why i go to the airport to buy foreign currency , only view of the outside i 'll get besides video and pictures . 
  [ `` america first '' ] ( https://theboeskool.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/dr_seuss_world_war_ii_political_cartoon_14-1.gif?w=640 ) existed before trump . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america_first_committee spoiler : it 's rooted in the idea of deep isolationism . 
  the only reason they disbanded was the pearl harbor attack , when no one would support them anymore . 
  the isolation idea tends to die once you 're attacked , go figure . 
  `` man is a wolf to man . '', 
  to those who do n't wan na translate . 
  did n't say you were from the south . 
   john lewis claimed that trump was not a legitimate president . 
  i 'm amazed with how much republicans cry about voter fraud trying to prevent people from voting . 
  odd how when it actually happens and benefits them they do nothing ...  this lying and hypocrisy is exactly why the american people made it very clear they reject the platform of the democratic party . 
  yea , tho trump 's approval is only 40 % at most and did n't win the popular vote . 
  for a guy who wants to help americans , he sure seem to be a safe bet to be the one to fuck it up . 
  especially due to his whole business not being put into a real blind trust , meaning every decision he makes will be about his business first . 
  people are protesting because this government does n't represent them , and truly has n't in quite some time at least domestically congress and senate wise . 
  the republicans are smart the president does n't really matter he 's more for foreign issues . 
  republicans in the house have been gerrymandering for years upon years , which now we see the full results ; control of all parts of government . 
  that combined with young millennial 's which do n't see the need to vote , gave them this victory . 
  once the baby boomers die , this country will go more progressive as it slowly has been for awhile . 
  this is of course without talking about all the issues of the electoral college . 
  pfft but the south can worship the first kkk leader nathan bedford and sabotage reconstruction which lead to jim crow laws . 
  there were dozens of rallies about the aca with anywhere from hundreds to thousands of people attending . 
  literally some having to be outside due to buildings not being able to house them all . 
  not to mention the women 's march on or near his first day of office . 
  the entire democrat resistance is starting from small groups getting active with local officials . 
  most are using the [ indivisible guide ] ( https://www.indivisibleguide.com/ ) and bernie is one of the head figures . 
  hate or love him , bernie is continuing to fight unlike clinton and that 's a politician i can respect . 
  there 's a lot of anger about the republicans trying to get rid of the office of ethics ; and trump causing backlash against john lewis ( who was a civil rights hero ) to which now a lot of democrats are protesting trumps inauguration . 
  which they have n't done in mass since the 70 's i think . 
  tl : dr - people are pissed and its not even his first day yet . 
  personally i hate v.p. 
  pence more . 
  well in u.s. terms it took a [ civil war ] ( https://youtu.be/gztrkccmj_i?t=7m ) which cost between anywhere from 600k to 800k deaths . 
   what i really do n't like is how the inventor is acting like it 's definitely proven and will solve this and that problem . 
  half the part of getting funding is confidence sadly . 
  not sure if we will get data once its in the open vacuum of space .
