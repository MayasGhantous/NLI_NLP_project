  thus stop being retarded and sinking our ships . 
  u mean like how your governments gave the nas the info ... its not even spying `` hey you got that info i requested ? '', 
  you want to blame someone blame you own governments . 
  the future is coming and i am loving all the innovation no more drunk driver deaths with a car that drives itself . 
  you would think by now there would be a safer way to land planes sense thats one of the most dangerous parts of the flights . 
  a , the article says china has the same claims against us as well meaning we have hit them and b , they are using foreign websites . 
  this means they are coming out from behind the great firewall so in theory we could still hit them . 
  if anything using there own internet would in my opinion make them a more tempting target for example someone could create a virus that only effects china 's internet and not the rest of the worlds internet . 
  walling yourselves oof makes the system difficult to enter but once its done that wall contains it as well . 
  is this current date ? 
  fuck it hit china with stuxnet . 
  how big is the communist party there ? 
  usually when fascists are on the rise communists are as well thus starting a civil war . 
  its only a matter of time before we create a super north american union with canada , mexico with having a free boarder like eu . 
  europe gets all it oil from the middle east , what are you going to do when america goes isolationist ? 
  throw shoes ? 
  those trade lanes are open from our navy aka force projection . 
  if anyone went to war in the middle east for oil its europe . 
  you made me chuckle have a like xd, 
  because we protect your sea trade lines ( aka all that oil u buy from the middle east ), 
  germany is one of the worlds largest arms exporter as well as manufacturer , to think they were n't on some type of list is a little naive . 
  thats fine we conquered your countries minecraft server we won in the end even the children know it . 
  lol not going to happen , most americans believe 50 is the max . 
  anymore will unbalance our government strain our internal systems we do n't want anymore states . 
  please get canada to protect you tell them we will pay them to do it , hell id even completely open the north boarder . 
  more money for u.s. ... sold u get ur military back no questions asked !, 
  that paper we signed at the end of wwii burn it shred it whatever , we will get rid of the recorded evidence . 
  sir im not saying `` your military 's suck '' if anything i have just as much of a right to speak about this matter as much as you do . 
  you are wrong and here why . 
  * america wants out of europe and the pubic is starting to gain momentum to leave nato altogether . 
  * we have no fear of russia ( even after crimea ) thus nato has no reason to exist in europe let alone at all . 
  * we need some alone time to adjust ourselves , ( policies , infrastructure , etc ) . 
  * let us focus on asia for which we have been trying to do for years . 
  it 's there your just not looking hard enough [ here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/04/23/has-nato-outlived-its-usefulness/time-for-the-united-states-to-leave-nato ) just one example . 
  at this point im just going to list a [ few ] ( http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=3343 ) , [ not sure about this source ] ( http://nypost.com/2010/06/14/the-new-threat-to-america-nato/ ) , [ another ] ( http://adamholland.blogspot.com/2010/03/michael-scheuer-wants-us-out-of-nato.html ) , [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/apr/03/us-nato-pullout-obama ) im sure u get the idea . 
  now that is a beautiful work of art . 
  i disagree the voice of isolationism is growing again ( we go through that pattern you see ) our population is just all around getting tired , its putting a strain on resources . 
  sometimes you have to do whats best for the future instead of now . 
  imagine a world where the u.s. did n't have the obligations that it does now , money to fix everything currently wrong is a start ( infrastructure needs it the most atm ) . 
  it is by a huge margin , saying anything is bigger than google expt for whatever the chinese use is just a flat out lie . 
   our politicians ' and their friends ' pockets . 
  our politicians ` and their friends ' pockets . 
  ftfy, 
  bad news sells , bad things happen in spikes and out of nowhere . 
  almost correct the whole part about representation was false . 
  when we sent delegates to the crown they were told ** not ** to accept representation because the states would be out-voted in every issue pertaining to them . 
  - tmyk -, 
   but i disagree with this point of view and it seems many europeans disagree , too . 
  hence we do n't spend nearly as much on power projecting capabilities . 
  it seems unlikely we will change our spending habits . 
  then as an american can i ask you to be reasonable and think logically as to why we may leave/disband nato due to your budget preferences ? 
  if we were to leave tomorrow it would not be fast enough  : l, 
  but thats a ** you ** problem not a ** eu ** problem their your politicians hold them accountable not the eu as a whole . 
   they 're already abandoning the middle east now that they do n't need arab oil  wait , what ? 
  america doesnt need oil from the middle east europe/asia imports most of it  they would suffer a tremendous loss of influence in international politics . 
  it would be the official announcement of the decline of the usa as a great power , and other pretendents will try to fill the power vacuum . 
  we dont rly care , north america is an island canada has our back and no one in south america is a serious threat . 
  very few countries even have the capability to reach us in a war , and our experimental weapon programs are among one of the top in the world we can be isolationist and still be a great power due to economy , computer/internet technology and military defense . 
  europe is fine and we would still help in asia a little , if any conflict were to happen we would fight then once its over retreat back onto our island and wait inevitably for the next one . 
  for this reason nato is useless and should be disbanded , our foreign policy in terms of war should be if you want our help buy our mercenaries ( we 're going to have a lot once we cut our military at that point ) . 
  its not about the space station its about the u.s. paying russia to send its astronauts there , to that i say good riddance we can use that 60million per person for our own space projects or something else . 
  if the u.s. left nato would be useless , no force projection . 
  not sure if troll by the amount of negative comments or if serious ? 
  i will answer this one tho  not only does blackwater not exist  because they changed their name they do n't exist anymore ? 
  officially yes , while people involved with blackwater might have moved on to other groups effectively killing civ 's in iraq means your not going to get any business as a pmc the fact they have changed their name a couple of times proves that . 
  with that kind of reputation im sure the soldiers themselves that were involved will not find themselves in pmc work any time soon maybe illegal work but that 's not pmc . 
  our country was wanting to move toward asia not europe ( wanting out of europe in fact ) . 
  the u.s.a. had trade deals with russia before ukraine everything you saying seems to be the complete opposite of what was happening irl ? 
  blackwater has the worst reputation of any merc group for shooting civ 's in iraq . 
  i think hiring untrained soldiers would be safer then the media backlash hurricane superstorm that would happen if word got out . 
  lol we demand 300 euros in unmarked bills or each of your representatives will each get a slice !, 
   japan ? 
  it instantly became a democracy after being firebombed and nuked to death . 
  it 's now the third largest economy in the world despite having nothing more than its people and a tiny island . 
  i believe this is a rare change of events which happened at the right time , the population wanted democracy thanks to mcauther sparing the emperor from execution . 
  while there was a large part of the population that wanted democracy ( women for the most part due to their standing before wwii ) i do n't think it would have worked without the emperors support . 
   and then there 's the most obvious and longest-running example : the us . 
  it became a democracy literally overnight once the peace treaty with britain arrived in the colonies . 
  it turned out pretty well all things considered . 
  people in the u.s. before the revolutionary war always felt a sense of being disconnected from brittan ( being 3k miles away does that ) it also does n't help that it was a place for people to escape and begin something anew . 
  tl : dr people while considering themselves part of brittan , did n't feel british after awhile . 
  they grew a system of autonomy and began to separate culturally and ideologically . 
  it did n't happen overnight when the rebellion was won thus the war would n't have started , it had for a time always been there . 
  there 's no reason for american merc 's to be there . 
  not only does blackwater not exist but the kiev govt does n't have money . 
  with how much people are kidnapped there lately and held in a basement , why would we give them that opportunity to say `` see we found one ! '', 
  even if it 's true nothing we can do about it : l, 
  rly i found it quite funny as it 's never going to happen . 
  canada 's the new superpower go yell at them now . 
  we 're taking a vacation . 
  leave nato , isolationistamerica is best murica  : l, 
  first they ban our apples and cheese , next it will be teh jets d :, 
  problem with that is last i looked [ russia drives them around ] ( http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2010/11/%d0%a2%d1%8f%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%87_%d0%9c%d0%97%d0%9a%d0%a2-79221_%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%81_%d0%a2%d0%be%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%8c-%d0%9c.jpg ) , then of course you have [ slbm 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/submarine-launched_ballistic_missile ) if it got that serious .
