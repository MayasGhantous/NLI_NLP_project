  it 's pretty common actually for constitutional referendums to either require a super majority or go through a very stringent process , like requiring the house and senate to also vet the referendum results . 
  yes . 
   that would probably eventually come to a good conclusion , but then you 're running the risk of so-called ` neverendums ' . 
  well in this case , you 'd absolutely have to set a cap on re-do 's if it fell within the error way too many times . 
  at that point , three results of the same status within an error provide more certainty than one result . 
  but people i think have no place to complain about ` neverendums ' in my opinion . 
  the price you pay for democracy , especially very hard democracy , is that you 're expected to participate . 
  or at the very least put up with the fact that people are participating . 
  that being said , yeah i 'm far from privy to the political culture of the uk . 
  but i do feel as if a lot of people who had a `` protest vote '' would immediately change their mind . 
  that is also a big problem . 
  but it is analogous to the question i asked you before . 
  that would be the established rule . 
  in which case , with situations that involve seriously close elections that do n't cover the error , i would call a re-do . 
  right , but i was arguing that the method is insufficient in delivering a result that does n't yield a lot of error and unhappiness . 
  you could have this vote several different times and realistically have different decisions each time . 
  the reason you want a super majority , is that statistically it adds more certainty to the decision . 
  if everyone eligible to vote in britain voted , and the disparity was only by 1 do you think that would be enough to leave britain ? 
  i think there 's a lot of overlap between the two but i can see why that assumption is annoying . 
  culturally probably , but a vast majority of their agricultural exports go to china , so much so to the point that china routinely threatens to pull their business from brazil unless they let their monopolies in . 
  a great portion of the mnc 's there are from china . 
  they 're becoming a chinese economy and might as well be a vassal . 
  60 is n't arbitrary it 's 3/5ths majority aka a super majority . 
  do you understand the idea of a super majority ? 
  certainly impossible to apply that retrospectively . 
  i feel as if this referendum was n't thought out at all . 
  the cons of having an implied constitution that does n't outline or plan for anything . 
  i uh well uh assumed you voted trump . 
  and most trump supporters support brexit . 
  that would make more sense , but i thought he was saying it as if brazil is not literally a vessel for anyone 's interests . 
  right , imo it was too close to warrant a change in procedure . 
  that 's why all referendums in the us either require 60 % or require several stages to pass into law ( e.g. 
  passing through a state house and senate and being approved up by the supreme court ) . 
  you 're going to be confused when trump does n't ignore big business interests . 
   would of been nice it 's would have dude . 
  have is the verb expressing the * perfect * aspect . 
  as in the perfect past or perfect progressive . 
  or `` i could have done that . '', 
  of does n't express this in any dialect of english , because as far as i can tell there is no analogous component for `` has . '', 
  no , but brazil is a vassal * of china . 
  referendum 's in the us generally require a 60 % thresh hold , or require several stages to pass into law ( i.e. 
  being passed by state house and senate ) if it only requires simple majority . 
  this is hardly the strongest mandate . 
  you guys achieved a very simple majority in the referendum . 
  it was hardly a strong democratic decision . 
  you 're not british . 
  one quick look at your history shows that you 're american . 
  i never suggested otherwise . 
  the person who deleted his comment said it was only for * illegal * immigrants where instead the following order  to better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions , the secretary shall utilize the declined detainer outcome report or its equivalent and , on a weekly basis , make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens . '' does n't make any indication whether they are undocumented or not . 
  oo fair enough . 
   few square metres of australia in europe to make them qualify as eu members . 
  well , would n't their embassy in literally any european state count ? 
   20 to 22 percent of jail inmates and arrestees are illegal aliens ; ever wonder that this is because ** they 're illegal immigrants ? 
  **  the foreign-born are 15.4 percent of the nation 's adult population . 
  ** however , dhs has not provided a detailed explanation of how the estimates were generated . 
  ** important blurb right here . 
   the poor quality of data used in the ppic and ipc another important blurb right here . 
   the survey of inmates in state and federal correctional facilities shows that 8.1 percent of prisoners in state prisons are immigrants ( legal and illegal ) . 
   the u.s. immigrant population stood at more than 42.4 million , or 13.3 percent , of the total u.s. population of 318.9 million in 2014 , according to acs data . 
  between 2013 and 2014 , the foreign-born population increased by 1 million , or 2.5 percent . 
  so , are you saying that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than citizens ? 
   in 2009 , 57 percent of the ** 76 ** fugitive murderers most wanted by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) were foreign-born . 
  that 's a pretty small sample size right there that is prone to fluctuation due to lack of certainty . 
  i bet that this was a record year . 
   most studies comparing crime rates and immigration levels across cities show no clear correlation between the immigrant share of a city 's population and its level of crime lol !, 
  ** do you even read what you copy and paste ? 
  **  however , such studies generally measure only overall crime , not crimes specifically committed by immigrants , so their value is limited . 
  this right here means nothing . 
  overall crime would be affected if immigrants were committing more crime . 
   from 1998 to 2007 , 816,000 criminal aliens were removed from the united states because of a criminal charge or conviction . 
  again , a lot of these people are in on drug charges and are there illegally . 
  not hard to see why the numbers are high . 
   illegal immigrants accounted for 27,505 ( or 36.7 percent ) again , why do you think they 're getting convicted ? 
   legal immigrants made up 3,017 ( or 4.0 percent ) again below the ** 13 % national percentage of the population ** . 
  you suuuuuure showed me . 
  and despite the gish gallop you attempted on me ** none of this justifies singling out a whole group of people for discrimination ** . 
  your account is also a month old and only posts in / r/europe . 
  you sure that you 're not astroturfing for / r/the _ donald ? 
  you do n't have a flair , and you have an uncanny knowledge of * american * crime . 
  i was born in america bruh . 
   some legal immigrants do in fact commit some and/or several kinds of crime at disproportionate rates to the rest of the population . 
  source ? 
   if you do n't or did n't commit crime it 's none of your business . 
  of course it 's my business . 
  my dad is an immigrant , so when people start characterizing ** all immigrants ** as criminals , or all muslims as terrorists , it directly affects me . 
  so please stop . 
  i like my civil liberties . 
  also , the person who deleted their comment was from iran . 
  not you . 
  which is why i wrote a separate comment that was for you in the second half . 
  sorry , but it 's frustrating to talk to someone who is not only ignorant but who is also being purposely inflammatory . 
  if you do n't like being called a nitwit you need to tone it back , because you look like a nitwit doubling down on wrong information . 
   however , go ahead and correct me if i 'm wrong but , within us jurisdiction , is not at an airfield in , say , libya for example . 
  however , if you hold a us visa or green card you 're considered a legal resident and fall under equal protection . 
  trump 's executive order also banned legal residents from returning , which is the issue at hand . 
  another issue is that he ordered the deportation of migrants on u.s. soil without due process . 
  when he was ordered by a federal court to stop , he outright refused to obey the law and continued with the deportations without due process . 
  this is authoritarian and is reminiscent of fascist policy . 
  he is trying to publicly intimidate those in the legislature who do n't agree with him and is also being inflammatory to the judge who ordered the stay . 
   and if he really has broken the law , why has he not been impeached yet ?
