camp david 2000 - * a summit meeting at camp david between united states president bill clinton , israeli prime minister ehud barak and palestinian authority chairman yasser arafat . 
  * :   * accusations of palestinian responsibility *  [ bill ] clinton blamed arafat after the failure of the talks , stating , `` i regret that in 2000 arafat missed the opportunity to bring that nation into being and pray for the day when the dreams of the palestinian people for a state and a better life will be realized in a just and lasting peace . '', 
  the failure to come to an agreement was widely attributed to yasser arafat , as he walked away from the table without making a concrete counter-offer and because arafat did little to quell the series of palestinian riots that began shortly after the summit . 
  arafat was also accused of scuttling the talks by nabil amr , a former minister in the palestinian authority . 
   in * my life * , clinton wrote that arafat once complimented clinton by telling him , `` you are a great man . '', 
  clinton responded , `` i am not a great man . 
  i am a failure , and you made me one . '', 
  israel also gave the sinai desert back to egypt in 1978 in return for ... recognizing israel 's right to exist . 
   in 2013 , and partly in response to the bombing , the eu unanimously voted to list the military branch of hezbollah as a terrorist organization . 
   the 2012 burgas bus bombing was a terrorist attack carried out by a suicide bomber on a passenger bus transporting israeli tourists at the burgas airport in burgas , bulgaria on 18 july 2012 . 
  the bus was carrying forty-two israelis , mainly youths , from the airport to their hotels , after arriving on a flight from tel aviv . 
  the explosion killed the bulgarian bus driver and five israelis and injured thirty-two israelis , resulting in international condemnation of the bombing . 
   [ ... ]  on 25 july 2013 , the bulgarian interior ministry released photographs of two hezbollah operatives suspected in the bombing : australian citizen malid farah ( also known as `` hussein hussein '' ) , and canadian citizen hassan al-haj .

   israel possesses a nuclear arsenal that it ** may ** have `` activated or pretended to activate '' during the yom kippur war , concludes a study published this weekend about american intelligence gathering in october 1973 . 
   according to editors of the study , conducted by the cia 's historical collections division and the richard nixon presidential library and museum , the documents underpinning it do `` not settle the issue '' conclusively . 
   moreover , the study 's detailed timeline of the war ** skips october 9 , the date previous publications have cited as the day israel signaled its readiness to take desperate measures . 
  ** not very convincing . 
   but with massive military might deployed on the israeli side with disregard for civilian life , i do n't see it . 
  no government that answers to its people is going to allow randomly shot missiles to be fired at its civilian population . 
  unfortunately that seems to result in war in urban areas . 
  your view seems to be that the past is ` dead and buried ' and that its not relevant , but i am sure the rohingya uighurs kurds druze etc. 
  would kill for even one offer of a state - let alone two or three . 
  asking israel to wait for 50 years , accept attacks on its civilian population , may be a great solution from your pov - but not mine . 
  that is just an op-ed ... 
   it was n't until the 70s when israel threatened to nuke citation would be appreciated, 
  the difference is that the idf is trying to do a complex calculus of how to wage war against an enemy who wears no uniforms , hides in cities , and uses civilians as human shields . 
  amnesty claims the idf 's calculations are `` over the line '' - not that the idf should n't respond , but that the means and degree to which it was taken was too extreme . 
  that is splitting a very fine hair , and of course the calculations will come out different depending on which side of the gun you are on . 
  torturing political rivals or intentionally bombing civilians is not a matter of degree - there is no debate to be had - it is simply wrong . 
  you ca n't `` torture lightly '' to stay within international law , while there are legal ways to wage war . 
   the israelis claim that they would intervene less in gaza if there were n't rocket attacks . 
  does that mean that they lack agency ? 
  both sides are human beings who are responsible for their choices and actions . 
  palestinians have rejected numerous peace-deals and in the meantime intentionally murder civilians - no one is forcing them to do that . 
   the further tragedy is that obscenities like the above only strengthen hamas recruitment . 
  also , this is just inane . 
  after the israeli withdrawl from gaza in 2005 hamas was chosen by the plurality of palestinians - though of course they then went and threw their ` democratic ' rivals fatah off of roofs  [ fatah -- hamas conflict ] a conflict between the two main palestinian political parties , fatah and hamas , resulting in the split of the palestinian authority in 2007 . 
  the reconciliation process and unification of hamas and fatah administrations has not finalized as of september 2015 . 
   the palestinian independent commission for citizens ' rights has found that more than 600 palestinians were killed in the fighting from january 2006 to may 2007 . 
  [ 7 ] dozens more were killed or executed in the following years as part of the conflict . 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatah%e2%80%93hamas_conflict_ ( 2006 % e2 % 80 % 9307 ) ** the belief that palestinians have no agency and it is solely or even mostly israeli actions driving them to terrorist groups or terrorist policies is silly and defies history **, 
  while there are many problems with amnesty 's report , my favorite is this :  in rafah , the southernmost city in the gaza strip , a group of israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area west of the border encountered a group of hamas fighters posted there . 
  a fire fight ensued , resulting in the death of two israeli soldiers and one palestinian fighter . 
  the hamas fighters captured an israeli officer , lieutenant hadar goldin , and took him into a tunnel . 
  right - `` encountered . '', 
  considering they dragged this person in a tunnel explicitly made to kidnap soldiers i would take the israeli contention that this was an intentional ambush and violation of the ceasefire seriously . 
  but anyways , i have serious questions about what constitutes ` massive ' and ` indiscriminate . ', 
  amnesty wants the idf to use as light touch as possible when waging war - but mostly i think their standards are * impossibly * high and unrealistic . 
  ___________________________  during the 2014 israel -- gaza conflict , when the idf believed that hadar goldin had been captured , it was reported the hannibal directive was initiated . 
  [ 16 ] the idf carried out a large-scale military operation that included bombing all possible escape routes from rafah tunnels , an act reported by ha'aretz to have killed scores of palestinians and be the `` most devastating '' execution of the hannibal directive . 
  [ 17 ] [ 18 ] only partial remains were found . 
  [ 19 ] an idf inquiry concluded goldin probably was killed during the initial battle . 
  [ 20 ] in july 2015 , the full transcript of the idf communication system was published , revealing the initiation of the directive . 
  [ 21 ] according to an idf investigation of the incident while the phrase `` hannibal procedure '' was mentioned on the idf field radios , the procedure was not implemented nor was there indiscriminate fire towards rafah homes . 
  hamas claimed 130 palestinian civilians were killed . 
  the idf investigation concluded that 41 people were killed , 12 of them hamas combatants . 
  [ 22 ] asa kasher revealed that a soldier was killed by his comrades due to a mistaken understanding of the directive . 
  [ 23 ]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hannibal_directive call me when there is palestinian ethics review of their conduct during the war . 
   you chose to highlight the civilian death toll no , i highlighted palestinian terrorism which specifically targets civilians with no military , strategic , or rationale value . 
  i highlighted the fact that one side has clear logical goals for its military actions ( destroy launch sites , locate and destroy hamas command and control structure , etc. 
  etc ) whereas the other seeks ** explicitly ** to kill civilians . 
  and again - this script is entirely hamas ' . 
  no one can claim their attacks will win the palestinians any kind of ( rationale ) victory - the strategy is completely to invite israeli retaliation on military targets which hamas embeds in the civilian population . 
  * [ ndtv exclusive : how hamas assembles and fires rockets ] ( http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-exclusive-how-hamas-assembles-and-fires-rockets-641680 ) firing rockets at israel from dense urban blocks is a deliberate choice made by hamas . 
   the preponderance of civilian deaths have been among palestinians . 
  which proves what ? 
  the us army has killed ( far , far ) more german civilians than german army has killed american civilians . 
  therefore the germany military aims and methods ( either ww ) were correct ? 
  you know , because more of their civilians died ... 
   you could look it up , if you had a genuine interest in the subject < eyeroll  if you have a point do n't expect me to make it for you . 
  i am not a fan of the use of wp , but it is not a wholly illegal munition . 
  hrw even acknowledges israel 's premise that it is hamas who is choosing to have an urban war endangering the lives of civilians . 
  this is hamas ' official military strategy - attack an opponent with vastly superior armed forces , hide amongst civilians , and then wait for the inevitable innocent deaths and international condemnation . 
  no one thinks hamas could beat israel , they are not fighting to ` win ' in any conventional sense - hamas works to create intense and complex urban battlezones specifically to generate civilian casualties . 
   funnily enough , the idf make the same claim . 
  the idf does a better job than most , but they do n't have the resources and expertise of the us military . 
  be grateful the us does n't copy russian tactics like in syria , or that israel seems to actually give a damn as opposed to say saudi arabia 's war in yemen . 
   guess which results in the greater civilian death toll ? 
  your link did n't actually tell me so idk . 
   `` ev the us military '' ??? 
  do you have any idea of the civilian death toll during the iraq war ? 
  do you know how many german civilians the british starved to death in wwi ? 
  i always have been and still am a critic of the war in iraq , the choice was inane and the war itself was managed poorly - but ** overall ** the us wages the most humane war of all time . 
  ever . 
  their nearest rival is much , much more ... [ under fire for syria bombings , russia denies hitting civilians ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-powers-iduskcn0vm0cv ) [ syrians are paying a high price for russia 's cheap bombs ] ( http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/syrians-are-paying-a-high-price-for-russia-s-cheap-bomb-1744082828 ) much more something . 
   no , bethlehem was bundled with the principal holy site of jerusalem ... but you know what happened to that . 
  ah you are right . 
  jerusalem and bethlehem were ` independent ' but surrounded by the palestinian nation - which was the most historic , densely populated , and strategic part the levant . 
   do you really want to get into a debate about the civilian body count ( both israeli and palestinian ) ? 
  does the effectiveness of one 's armed forces change the merits of one 's argument ? 
  there is a difference between blowing up a pizza parlor and destroying an apt building that armed terrorists are using as a hideout . 
  even the us military is looking at how israel works to wage war yet minimize casualties - [ tue apr 26 , 2016 , u.s. military used ` roof knock ' tactic in iraq to try to warn civilians before bombing ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-usa-airstrike-iduskcn0xn2nk )   there was the famous peace deal in 2000 we just discussed , and the less known offer in 2008 . 
   i thought your point was that there was no deal in 2000 ? 
  peace deal * offer *  i can understand their frustration . 
  the partition plan assigned less that half of the territory of the mandate to the palestinians , despite the fact that they had the larger population . 
  the israeli size was tipped by the negev dessert , the least ( by far ) populated and agriculturally least useful part of the area . 
  the holy sites like hebron and bethlehem all went to the palestinians , as did the water sources ( before desalination this was even more critical ) . 
  and every year that passes the israeli state strengthens its stranglehold on the occupied territories .
