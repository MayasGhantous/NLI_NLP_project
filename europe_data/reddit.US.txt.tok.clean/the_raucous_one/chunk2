  and every year israeli civilians run to their mandated-in-every-home bomb-shelters and certify their government issued gas-masks because the palestinians would rather wage war than make a difficult but necessary choice . 
   arafat is dead and gone . 
  as are the israeli civilians intentionally blown up in the second intafadah . 
  there was the famous peace deal offer * in 2000 we just discussed , and the less known offer in 2008 . 
  none of these deals were great for the palestinians - but they were n't great for israelis either . 
  the same could be said for the original 1947 partition plan ( also rejected by the palestinians and arab states ) . 
  the 1967 lines ( israel 's former border with jordan and egypt ) lose relevance with each year - this being the 49th i believe . 
  nearly a half century . 
    i agree with you . 
  but the israeli government does n't . 
  it wo n't even accept the 1967 de-facto border as a starting point . 
  that was the basis for [ camp david 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_camp_david_summit ) - the deal that arafat walked away from . 
  per bill clinton :  [ bill ] clinton blamed arafat after the failure of the talks , stating , `` i regret that in 2000 arafat missed the opportunity to bring that nation into being and pray for the day when the dreams of the palestinian people for a state and a better life will be realized in a just and lasting peace . '', 
  the failure to come to an agreement was widely attributed to yasser arafat , as he walked away from the table without making a concrete counter-offer and because arafat did little to quell the series of palestinian riots that began shortly after the summit . 
  [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] arafat was also accused of scuttling the talks by nabil amr , a former minister in the palestinian authority . 
  [ 33 ]  in my life , clinton wrote that arafat once complimented clinton by telling him , `` you are a great man . '', 
  clinton responded , `` i am not a great man . 
  i am a failure , and you made me one .

  not really surprised the bbc elected not to tackle this one, 
  just wait until they find out about chef boyardee, 
   the founder of the ahmadi movement -- mirza ghulam ahmad -- was born in punjab in 1835 . 
  considering himself the reviver of the original teachings of islam , he was regarded by his followers as the messiah and the follower prophet of muhammad . 
  and while ahmadis insist that he was not a `` law-giving '' prophet like muhammad , few among the muslim mainstream accept this argument . 
  ahmadis believe they practise true islam , as practised by muhammad . 
  part of why i posted this is that it reminds me somewhat of the tensions between mormons and the more standard christian faiths in the us ( minus the killings of course ) . 
  pretty sure it is al-nusra , not isis , in the golan, 
  ya - like marx , freud , tesla , einstein , etc. 
   turkey , for its part , accuses russia of supporting kurdish rebel groups carrying out attacks on turkish targets from syrian territory . 
  erdogan went as far as to say on wednesday that the russian bombing raids in syria were aimed at civilians and could amount to war crimes . 
   turkish prime minister ahmet davutoglu accused russia of assisting the assad regime in the ethnic cleansing of civilians in aleppo . 
   an israeli source knowledgeable about the russian position regarding the israel-turkey contacts said that moscow is not interested in having turkey gain a substantial foothold in the gaza strip . 
   as part of the negotiations with israel , turkey has demanded free access to gaza and special status with regard to the import of humanitarian equipment into the strip and the construction of infrastructure , such as a power generator for electricity . 
   turkey is not demanding the lifting of israel 's blockade on the strip , believing that by gaining free access to gaza it will be able to claim a significant achievement in softening the blockade . 
   another russian reservatrion regards the possibility of cooperation between israel and turkey on natural gas . 
  russia is currently turkey 's main supplier of natural gas . 
   russia 's negative attitude to the agreement with turkey is shared by egypt , which is also opposed to giving turkey special status in gaza -- a move which it thinks will damage egyptian interests in gaza . 
  on the evening before the meeting with the israeli delegation , lavrov spoke on the phone with egyptian foreign minister sameh shoukry , though it is not known whether they discussed the contacts between israel and turkey . 
   the combined opposition of russia and egypt is likely to have significant impact on prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's decision on whether to sign an agreement with turkey . 
  a senior israeli official said a powerful group of defense officials , who were previously in favor of normalization with turkey , are now of the opinion that israel does n't need to be in a hurry to sign the reconciliation agreement . 
   those senior defense officials , the most prominent of whom is defense minister moshe ya'alon , believe that continued hamas terror activity from turkish territory , combined with concern about israel 's ties with russia and egypt , call into question the degree to which signing the agreement with turkey at the present time will contribute to israel 's interests . 
   ya'alon himself gave voice to that mood during a press conference in switzerland last week , when he said that turkey has greater interest than israel in reaching true reconciliation . 
  israel 's concerns over damage to its ties with russia are based primarily on the russian military involvement in syria and the fear that tension with russia at this time would do harm to israeli interests , such as the air force 's freedom of action in syria and russian arms transfers to iran and the syrian army , from where they reach hezbollah . 
   the current round of talks between israel and turkey in geneva last week ended with tangible progress . 
  senior turkish officials have made media statements recently to the effect that all the items on which there was disagreement have now been resolved and the sides are ready to sign an agreement . 
  those statements were denied in jerusalem , where officials said that several disagreements still need to be resolved , despite the progress . 
  senior officials said in response that russia `` never reached out to israel to reject the deal with turkey . '', 
    ** russia to israel : reservations about rapprochement deal with turkey . 
  since the downing of a russian jet over syria , moscow 's ties with turkey have deteriorated , and the kremlin is concerned by turkish influence in gaza and possible gas ties with israel . 
  **   * barak ravid feb 18 , 2016 7:32 pm * ___________________  russia is dissatisfied with israel 's pending rapprochement agreement with turkey , haaretz has learned . 
   russian foreign minister sergey lavrov submitted the reservations of president vladimir putin 's government during a meeting in moscow on thursday afternoon with foreign ministry director general dore gold . 
   ministry spokesman emanuel nachshon refused to answer questions on the subject . 
  also in gold 's delegation were his bureau chief , shimon shapira , political bureau head alon ushpiz and the ministry 's deputy director general of liaison gilad cohen . 
   the main items on the israeli agenda were the situation in syria and media reports about the arrival in iran of the first shipment of s-300 missiles from russia . 
   however , one of the central issues raised by the russian side regarded the contacts between israel and turkey on a reconciliation agreement that would end a five-year crisis provoked by the mavi marmara incident in 2010 . 
   the russians , who have been locked in a severe dispute with turkey since the downing of a russian jet over syria in november last year , are concerned about some of the benefits that the government of president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan will receive in the context of an agreement with israel . 
   even before turkey 's downing of the russian aircraft , turkey-russia relations were in deep crisis over russia 's increased involvement in the syrian civil war on the side of the assad regime . 
   the government in ankara supports many of the rebel groups and is accused by russia of supporting the islamic state ( isis ) in order to bring down assad . 
  collective punishment, 
   and you can quit quoting wikipedia lol . 
  i am sorry my cites bother you so much . 
   the idf is more powerful than all of them combined . 
  for someone who claims to be so well informed you a pretty directly committing a form of [ hindsight bias ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/hindsight_bias ) israel 's military is much better than their neighbors ** now , ** but was heavily out-manned and outgunned in the 1948 war , and in 1967 israel 's military was barely on par with the combined arab forces ( where israel was using a combination of wwii surplus and limited equipment supplied by the french , while the arab forces were receiving direct military aide and advisory support from the superpower ussr ) . 
   wtf . 
  why would anybody do that ? 
  not that uncommon sadly . 
  happened even in europe : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_affair_of_the_gang_of_barbarians, 
   so isra\u00ebl did n't only defend itself ? 
  they used the opportunity to expend their territory illegaly and violently ? 
  defending itself involved , in part , taking the territory their enemies used to surround them from strategically key areas . 
  israel even gave the sinai back to egypt in exchange for ... recognizing israel 's right to exist ( just getting egypt to * meet * with an israeli took another war ) . 
   the khartoum resolution of september 1 , 1967 was issued at the conclusion of 1967 arab league summit convened in the wake of the six-day war , in khartoum , the capital of sudan . 
  the summit lasted from august 29 to september 1 and was attended by eight arab heads of state : egypt , syria , jordan , lebanon , iraq , algeria , kuwait , and sudan . 
  [ 1 ] the resolution called for : a continued state of belligerency with israel , ending the arab oil boycott declared during the six-day war , an end to the north yemen civil war , and economic assistance for egypt and jordan . 
  ** it is famous for containing ( in the third paragraph ) what became known as the `` three no 's '' : `` no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with it ... '' [ 2 ] ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khartoum_resolution, 
   you seem to conveniently forget that isra\u00ebl was given a specific territory and that israelis kept on expending it illegaly and violently at the expense of other populations . 
  it was given specific territory - and the palestinians rejected that deal and launched a war to claim the whole territory . 
  thousands died in that war , and at it 's height the egyptian army was within 20 miles of tel aviv . 
  again in 1967 syria and egypt colluded to surround israel militarily ( nasser kicked out the un peackeepers separating egypt and israel and massed his army on the border while syria did the same ) . 
  egypt also blockaded israel 's route to the sea via the straits of tiran ( blocking access to an international waterway - a classic '' * casus belli * '' ) it was during this war that israel captured gaza ... from egypt - and captured the west bank ... from jordan . 
  pretty sure its fine, 
  [ social media campaign to show solidarity with french jews wants ` everyone with a kippa ' ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/french-social-media-campaign-show-solidarity-jews-wants-everyone-kippa-415807 ), 
   i do n't see you coming up with one time events for the other side , when four members of ldj ( jewish defense league ) were responsible for the murder of sa\u00efd bourarach what `` other side '' - the murder of sa\u00efd bourarach eliminates rising anti-semitism and violent attacks on * jews ? 
  what is your point here ? 
   also this guy had killed three or four paratroopers leading up this ( i believe two of them were french muslims ) . 
   or are you referring to your article where the military was targeted by mohamed merah ? 
  the op of this whole thread is talking about the experience of french jews . 
  in addition to targeting state security services , muhamed merah brutally murdered children in an anti-semitic attack . 
  you see the same pattern in the charlie hebdo-hypercacher murders . 
  and unfortunately there are others who support this same ideology :   [ 19 november 2015 -- jewish teacher stabbed in marseille street by trio praising islamic state .

  you seem to be working very hard to discount the experience of french jews and/or attribute any issues to bigotry on the part of those people being attacked . 
  not sure why you are so zealous in trying to make this disgusting point , but i do n't really care . 
  i am out . 
   the answer is not to stigmatize millions of french muslims because of the actions of a handful of extremists scum anti-semitic attacks are increasing . 
  that is a fact . 
  statistics shows that the crimes are perpetrated both by right-wing extremists and islamic extremists . 
  noting that fact , and that the population being targeted is scared is not bigotry - its a reaction to what is actually happening . 
  yup , totally no reason to be afraid . 
  none at all .
