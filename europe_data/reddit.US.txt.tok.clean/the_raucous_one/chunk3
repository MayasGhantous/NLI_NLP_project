   [ * toulouse and montauban shootings in 2012 * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toulouse_and_montauban_shootings )  at about 8:00 am on 19 march , a man drove up to the ozar hatorah school on a yamaha tmax motorcycle . 
  he dismounted , and immediately opened fire toward the schoolyard . 
  the first victim was a rabbi and teacher at the school who was shot outside the school gates as he tried to shield his two young sons from the gunman . 
  the gunman shot one of the boys as he crawled away , as his father and brother lay dying on the pavement . 
  he then walked into the schoolyard , chasing people into the building . 
   inside , he shot at staff , parents , and students . 
  he chased an 8-year-old girl into the courtyard , caught her by her hair and raised a gun to shoot her . 
  the gun jammed at this point and he changed weapons from what the police identified as a 9mm pistol to a .45 calibre gun , and shot the girl in her temple at point-blank range . 
  the gunman then retrieved his moped and drove off .

   * world war i *  a higher percentage of german jews fought in world war i than that of any other ethnic , religious or political group in germany ; some 12,000 died for their country . 
   prominent jewish industrialists and bankers , such as walter rathenau and max warburg played major roles and supervising the german war economy . 
  in october 1916 , the german military high command administered the judenz\u00e4hlung ( census of jews ) . 
  designed to confirm accusations of the lack of patriotism among german jews , the census disproved the charges , but its results were not made public . 
  denounced as a `` statistical monstrosity '' , the census was a catalyst to intensified antisemitism and social myths such as the `` stab-in-the-back legend '' ( dolchstosslegende ) .

   almost half a century later , with many countries experiencing terror attacks , it seems outrageous to some swiss that their own government might have done deals with groups classed as terrorists . 
   what is more , the relatives of those who died in the bombing of the swissair flight may be justified in feeling angry that no one has ever been brought to justice , especially as swiss investigators had identified a jordanian national as the mastermind behind the attack . 
  one of my favorite episodes of all time !, 
  quite the ` moral ' stance, 
   switzerland and the militant palestine liberation organization ( plo ) concluded a secret deal in 1970 to avert further terrorist attacks against the country . 
   the neue z\u00fcrcher zeitung ( nzz ) newspaper says a delegation led by foreign minister pierre graber met senior plo officials in geneva to negotiate a pact offering diplomatic support for the palestinian cause in return for assurances to be spared from attacks . 
   we must also keep in mind that israel is encouraging and sponsoring jews who want to move there . 
  but that has been israel 's policy since 1948 ( and before really ) . 
  pretty clearly something is changing to cause the large increases we are seeing in the past 5-10 years of jews leaving europe . 
  israel is still at war with syria and has been for decades - your attempt to simplify the issue and make into some israeli repudiation of the values learned of the holocaust because a small country ca n't accept hundreds of thousands of refugees from a country that hates israel and has gone to war with it several times is uninformed , simplistic , and ignorant, 
   * hold on , are there statistics to back this up ? 
  because it 's worth keeping in mind that `` anti-semitism is growing '' has been a really common story for basically the last decade , but there has n't been stats to show it . 
  * that is some ignorant tripe . 
  it has been a common story for several years now because it is really happening . 
  _____________________________  anti-semitic crimes have risen to a five-year high in germany , according to a new report which finds it is recording more incidents than any country in europe . 
  there were 1,596 recorded hate crimes against jewish people last year in the country , the highest level since 2009 and a greater level than recorded in any other eu state . 
  it was an increase from 1,275 the previous year , and it reverses a long-term trend of declining incidents . 
  jewish leaders yesterday warned of hundreds of thousands of jews are preparing to emigrate from europe in the face of resurgent anti-semitism . 
   eu officials warned against `` singling out '' germany , with the official report by the bloc 's agency for fundamental rights cautioning that data collection is patchy with some countries refusing to count anti-semitic attacks at all , while others are more scrupulous . 
  most european jews ( french especially ) are migrating to a city ** on the mediterranean coast ** called netanya :  this israeli city on the mediterranean coast has long been a magnet for french-jewish immigrants ; its municipal website has branded it `` the israeli riviera . '' after this month 's wave of terrorist attacks in paris , including one that claimed the lives of four jews at a kosher supermarket , and with france 's jews increasingly feeling threatened by anti-semitism , netanya is gearing up for a much larger influx .

   jerusalem ( ap ) -- jewish immigration to israel from western europe has reached an all-time high as a result of a rise in anti-semitic attacks , a leading nonprofit group said thursday , as france 's beleaguered jewish community grapples with whether to refrain from donning jewish skull caps for their own safety . 
   the jewish agency , which works closely with the israeli government and acts as a link to jews around the world , told the associated press that 9,880 western european jews immigrated to israel in 2015 -- the highest annual number ever . 
  the figure is more than 10 percent over the previous year and over double the 2013 level . 
   the vast majority , close to 8,000 , came from france , where a rise in anti-semitic attacks has shattered the sense of security of the world 's third-largest jewish population .

   the turkish authorities briefly detained 27 scholars on friday , accusing them of spreading `` terrorism propaganda '' and of insulting the state after they signed a petition denouncing the military 's campaign against kurdish militants in southeastern turkey . 
   most of the scholars were from kocaeli university in northwestern turkey and were detained in early-morning raids on their homes , the semiofficial news agency anadolu reported . 
  by friday evening , all had been released , according to turkish news media reports . 
   all 27 scholars were among more than 1,000 academics from 90 turkish universities who signed a public statement , `` we wo n't be a party to this crime , '' that urged the government in ankara , the capital , to end the `` deliberate massacre '' of kurds caught in clashes between turkish security forces and militants of the kurdistan workers ' party , or p.k.k. 
   the petition angered president recep tayyip erdogan , who denounced the group -- and foreign scholars who signed the document , including the linguist and philosopher noam chomsky -- in a televised speech on tuesday . 
  mr. erdogan accused them of `` treason '' and of forming a `` fifth column '' of foreign powers trying to undermine turkey 's national security . 
   turkish teenager who stabbed a jewish teacher with a machete on monday in the southern french city of marseille told police he had acted in the name of the islamic state group , a prosecutor said .

  to help you on your education https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism, 
   why else do you think the term `` anti-semitic '' only refers to some semites ? 
  i know how to use wikipedia and google , a set of skills apparently beyond you . 
  later, 
   exceptionalism that is not why the word ` anti-semitism ' means hatred of jews - you could read on the subject and educate yourself , but clearly you are a hateful person dearly attached to your pre-conceived ( and wrong ) notions so there is no point, 
   antisemitism ( also spelled anti-semitism or anti-semitism ) is prejudice against , hatred of , or discrimination against jews as an ethnic , religious , or racial group . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] a person who holds such positions is called an antisemite . 
  antisemitism is widely considered to be a form of racism .

  scary, 
   the nazi demonification machine started way earlier and the most villified were the internal german critics , often secular liberals and socialists . 
   but that part of the story gets phased out . 
  do n't forget that the early fights that the nazis had were against communists and socialists , the vast majority of whom were ethnic germans . 
  do you think hitler did n't single them out during the years before and after power ? 
  kristallnacht was in 1938 , and did n't just happen in a vacuum , but was the result of years of anti-jewish propaganda and ostracization . 
  yes - the fascists and communists would engage in brutal streetfights , yes the bhputsch , but anti-semitism and anti-jewish policies were a core component of the nazis and has to be considered since it formed the basis for hitler and the nazi high command 's actions . 
  [ wikipedia - kristallnacht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kristallnacht ) [ wikipedia - racial policies regarding the jews , 1933 -- 1940 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racial_policy_of_nazi_germany#racial_policies_regarding_the_jews.2c_1933.e2.80.931940 ), 
   the distinguishing factor of 3rd reich was n't antisemitism , but the fact that they went along with all their xenophobies . 
  * in mein kampf , hitler used the main thesis of `` the jewish peril '' , which posits a jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership . 
  [ 7 ] the narrative describes the process by which he became increasingly antisemitic and militaristic , especially during his years in vienna . 
  he speaks of not having met a jew until he arrived in vienna , and that at first his attitude was liberal and tolerant . 
  when he first encountered the anti-semitic press , he says , he dismissed it as unworthy of serious consideration . 
  later he accepted the same anti-semitic views , which became crucial in his program of national reconstruction of germany . 
  * *** mein kampf has also been studied as a work on political theory . 
  for example , hitler announces his hatred of what he believed to be the world 's two evils : communism and judaism . 
  *** * during his work , hitler blamed germany 's chief woes on the parliament of the weimar republic , the jews , and social democrats , as well as marxists , though he believed that marxists , social democrats , and the parliament were all working for jewish interests . 
  [ 8 ] he announced that he wanted to completely destroy the parliamentary system , believing it to be corrupt in principle , as those who reach power are inherent opportunists .

   but the nazi demonification machine started way earlier and the most villified were the internal german critics , often secular liberals and socialists . 
  they were also people in very good standing , often even better , so you 're wrong on that one . 
   it 's just that when we 're being taught the wwii version in schools it almost always tends to ignore the huge amount of suffering of victims who were not jewish this is bullshit , hitler very specifically brings ups jewish people as being especially insidious and responsible for the defeat in wwi and the financial crisis in mein kampf ( written 1926 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mein_kampf#analysis the nazis hated lots of people , but targeting jewish people was one of the core ideologies of nazisim ( and of course , nazi ideology held that bolshevism was a jewish concept ), 
   turkey is concerned that once isil fighters are pushed out of mosul , the government in baghdad will make it difficult for sunni residents of the city to live there .
