  erdogan previously said that mosul , which was seized by isil two years ago , belongs to `` its sunni residents '' . 
   after mosul is recaptured , erdogan added , `` only sunni arabs , turkmen and sunni kurds should remain there '' . 
  his comments prompted the government-backed shia militias , known as the hashd al-shaabi ( popular mobilisation forces ) , to issue a statement condemning erdogan 's `` racist proposal to change mosul 's demographics '' . 
   but analysts believe that turkey 's concerns about the future of mosul should not be interpreted as an attempt to reshape a sovereign country 's demographic make-up . 
  `` we have to remember iraq 's current borders were drawn in the sykes-picot agreement , '' demir said . 
   `` those borders are nothing more than arbitrary lines drawn in the sand by the british . 
  so the situation can only be analysed realistically from a city-centric perspective . 
  mosul is a historically sunni city and any attempt to change its demographic composition would be a direct threat to turkey 's security , '' he said . 
   according to iraqi analysts , turkish military presence in bashiqa represents `` a clear violation of national sovereignty . 
  baghdad views the turkish forces as an occupation force because the troops were sent to bashiqa with no prior coordination - or agreement - with the iraqi government , '' said wathiq al-hashimi , head of the baghdad-based iraqi group for strategic studies , an iraqi think-tank . 
  al-hashimi added that turkey wanted to `` control mosul in order to create a buffer zone that will allow it to target pkk fighters '' . 
   as for sunni-shia split , not to be an a-hole but where have you been past 2 years ? 
  it already happened and sunnis are about to loose . 
  badly , if i might add . 
  sure - and what is now pakistan was muslim dominated and what is now india was hindu dominated . 
  but the '47 partition was still a bloody , bloody , affair . 
  drawing final lines on a map and assigning water , homes , strategic points , oil , is bound to end with winners and losers . 
  i think you are overstating the certainty of there becoming a iraqi kurdistan , and understating the possibility of a greater sunni-shia war over key strategic areas should any sort of partitioning of iraq be realized . 
  iraq is very nervous itself about iraqi-kurdish independence since the kurds are sitting on a fair amount of oil-wealth and it could also begin the spiral toward a wider sunni-shia split in iraq ( likely via a civil-war ) . 
  but i would n't be surprised if federalization of the iraqi-kurdish area or even just greater autonomy for them is looking more appealing to iraqi leadership, 
   speaking to muslim religious leaders from the balkans and central asia , erdogan said objections from iraq would n't stop turkey from participating in any operation to free mosul and proceeded to make vitriolic remarks against iraq 's prime minister . 
   '' * you are not my interlocutor , you are not at my level , you are not my equivalent , you are not of the same quality as me , * '' erdogan said , addressing iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi . 
  '' * your screaming and shouting in iraq is of no importance to us . 
  you should know that we will go our own way * . '', 
   erdogan also said turkey would n't withdraw its troops from the base in bashiqa , adding that it was al-abadi himself who had asked ankara to train fighters there back in 2014 . 
   '' * turkey 's army has n't lost enough of its quality to take orders from you , '' erdogan said in response to iraqi calls for the troop 's withdrawal . 
  `` we would do whatever is necessary as we have done until today . 
   the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , canceled talks with german economy minister sigmar gabriel on tuesday during his high-profile trip to tehran , snubbing the german who had earlier stressed the need for reform in the islamic republic . 
   larijani , seen as a moderate conservative in iran , was the highest-ranking figure gabriel was due to meet on his two-day visit aimed at boosting business ties . 
  no reason was given for the cancellation , a spokeswoman for gabriel said . 
   gabriel had on monday backed reforms pursued by president hassan rouhani . 
  `` the alternative to the current government is a return to the times of great confrontation , '' gabriel said . 
   he said germany wanted to help improve the economic lot of people in iran so that the government did not lose support . 
   mr erdogan said the 1923 treaty of lausanne was a defeat for turkey as it `` gave away '' islands to greece . 
   greek defence minister panos kammenos warned turkey not to pursue `` dangerous paths '' . 
   tensions over a disputed aegean islet in 1996 brought greece and turkey to the brink of war . 
   since then , relations between the neighbours have eased . 
  speaking in ankara on thursday , mr erdogan said the treaty of lausanne , which forged the modern borders between greece and turkey , was essentially a defeat for turkey . 
   `` we gave away islands to greece that we could reach with a shout . 
  is this victory ? 
  some tried to trick us into believing that lausanne was a victory , '' he said, 
   `` we ask great britain , as we approach 100 years since this infamous declaration , to draw the necessary lessons and to bear its historic , legal , political , material and moral responsibility for the consequences of this declaration , including an apology to the palestinian people for the catastrophes , misery and injustice this declaration created and to act to rectify these disasters and remedy its consequences , including by the recognition of the state of palestine , '' abbas said . 
  `` this is the least great britain can do . '', 
   the british mission to the united nations had no immediate comment . 
   [ ... ]  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , speaking a short time later at the annual gathering of world leaders , derided abbas for focusing on the declaration and alluded to the possibility of the palestinians suing britain for it . 
   `` president abbas just attacked from this podium the balfour declaration . 
  he is preparing a lawsuit against britain for that declaration from 1917 . 
  that 's almost 100 years ago . 
  talk about being stuck in the past , '' netanyahu said . 
  delicious, 
   there is more to the story a jewish man was stabbed by a muslim simply for being a ` visible ' jew . 
  what `` more to the story '' do you want to discuss ? 
   the issue is separate impressive mental gymnastics . 
  muslims attack non-israel jewish sites in india , thailand , france , belgium , germany , etc. 
  and the `` issue '' is very much related to the extreme antisemitic beliefs rampant in the worldwide muslim community .

   on 29 november 1947 , the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition the british mandate of palestine into two states , one arab and one jewish , and the city of jerusalem . 
  [ 22 ]  the general assembly resolution on partition was greeted with overwhelming joy in jewish communities and widespread outrage in the arab world . 
  in palestine , violence erupted almost immediately , feeding into a spiral of reprisals and counter-reprisals . 
  the british refrained from intervening as tensions boiled over into a low-level conflict that quickly escalated into a full-scale civil war .
