  as you allude to later in that very same comment , the palestinians and arab states rejected the un plan and it was ** never ** implemented . 
  after the expiration of the british mandate there was no consensus on how to move forward ( again , the un plan was rejected and not implemented ) . 
  in the vacuum the jews declared the state of israel , leading the palestinians and arab states to declare war . 
   which was finally implemented in 1947 by the u.n.  [ ... ]  and finally , the palestinians rejected the state proposed by the u.n. 
  your comment is full * of incorrect information - including parts where you directly contradict yourself, 
  i though the cage part was funny . 
  step in, 
  al jazeera 's comment section is super amusing to me because everyone there is always saying super hateful stuff about `` zionists '' - but the shias and sunnis also then turn on each other over who is in bed with the zionists and which sect is the true form of islam, 
  ah - i was wondering how they managed to perfectly capture that eurovision ` sound , ' so that makes sense, 
  lol, 
  i have to laugh at your capitalization choices , 
  i shared this article because i thought it was interesting , especially :  to `` de-demonize '' the party and give it wider appeal , his daughter publicly shunned him . 
  in a stark irony of history , marine le pen 's national front has more top aides who are publicly known to be gay than any other french political party . 
  clearly a strategy , but she did n't make up those aides out of cardboard and glue ...

   this is literally kids in a german school that are not being taught that racism is not ok you do n't know that . 
  you just keep making assumptions and then hyperventilating over your aforementioned assumptions . 
  ** you accused dw of `` copy-pasting '' ** ( it is n't a copy-paste ) and said the article is `` lazy journalism '' because it does n't include a factoid you wanted, 
   this is just lazy journalism . 
  do n't pretend like you know what additional fact-checking dw or der spiegel did , and that you are n't objecting for other reasons ___________ edit - the linked dw article cites the school itself on the issue :  in a written statement on the school 's website , the school directorship said it was distressed by the incident . 
   `` firstly we 'd like to express our regret and horror that a student was forced to experience anti-semitism in his everyday school life , '' the statement read . 
  `` we are losing an especially active and high-achieving student who chose our school with joy and saw it as an opportunity to further his development . '', 
  there is a russia today story which implies that this was an attempt to stop kurds from casting their expat votes in the turkish referendum .

  came here for the gondola joke , was n't disappointed . 
   france is home to europe 's largest population of ethnic chinese , a community that routinely accuses police of not doing enough to protect it from racism . 
   in september , 15,000 people rallied in the french capital to urge an end to violence against the asian community after the beating death of chinese tailor chaolin zhangh called attention to ethnic tensions in paris immigrant suburbs . 
  the victim 's lawyer said the august 2016 attack was ethnically motivated . 
   `` chinese are victims of racist attitudes in france , especially from other ethnic groups , '' pierre picquart , an expert on china at the university of paris viii , said . 
  `` they are targets for crime because they often carry cash and many do n't have residence permits , so can be threatened easily . 
  they 're angry with police for not protecting them enough . '', 
   `` chinese people do not like to protest or express themselves publicly , so when we see them like this , it means they are very , very angry . 
  they 've had enough of discrimination , '' picquart added .

   this is more common in attacks against israel , right ? 
  yes, 
  got it , thanks . 
  just wanted to make sure i ( we ) was n't discussing bunk data, 
   the chatham house study , conducted before us president donald trump signed an executive order banning immigration to the us from seven predominantly muslim countries , found majorities in all but two of the ten states opposed immigration from mainly muslim countries . 
  i do n't know much about chatham house , hopefully they are respected pollsters ... 
  i am also curious what would happen if they polled now after trumps eo . 
  i would imagine the number of european supporters * would go down because of all of the negative press ( especially in europe ) , but i suppose it could also have the opposite effect .

   there were casualties from at least 40 nationalities in the brussels attacks , but investigators and sources believe the zaventem bombers had specific targets . 
   `` even early on ( in the investigation ) there were indications that they targeted us , russian and israeli check-in counters , '' a us law enforcement source told afp on condition of anonymity . 
   [ ... ]  four americans were killed at the airport and several injured , while two israelis aged 23 and 28 were treated in jerusalem after the attacks . 
   [ ... ]  sources close to the investigation added that camera footage never released to the public showed that laachraoui had been standing among some 60 high school students before deciding to pursue two orthodox jews . 
  ... and ukraine is n't ? 
   that sounds incredibly similar to mongolian 's wiping out cities , or the many organized events of genocide in the hindu kush . 
  what the mongolians did was invade and conquer - afaik they did n't exterminate ethnicities or groups ( though of course they were very brutal to people they considered enemies ) . 
  as for the hindu kush , everything i have read online about a genocide is very mixed . 
  apparently it is n't even widely taught in india itself . 
  if you have a good citation i would be interested , but everything i saw was crap, 
   the main difference between the holocaust and other genocides is the public awareness of it . 
  i do n't think this is accurate . 
  as i said above , the main unique element of the holocaust was how it was approached with modern technology and bureaucracy . 
  mass murder of people is an ancient , ancient crime . 
  what the nazis did that was new was apply modern management and accounting techniques coupled with industrial scale mechanisms for moving and transporting victims , as well as killing them . 
  the nazis did n't just use soldiers , but also accountants , clerks , engineers , scientists , janitors , and stasticians to craft the holocaust into what it ultimately became - a robust * system * of * mass murder . 
  that , as far as i know , is unique . 
   knowing it wo n't dry the tears from the face of sudanese widow or make the parents of an orphan child from nigeria of course the cruelest genocide is the one that affects the people you care for - but that is n't even what we ( or at least i ) am arguing about, 
  when people talk about the uniqueness of the holocaust , they are generally referring to the marriage of state sponsored industry , infrastructure , and resources with the act of mass murder . 
  that does n't make the holocaust ` special ' or ` better/worse ' than other genocides , just different . 
   they hate anyone who is n't their sect and have ethnically cleansed minority groups from the whole region . 
  to be clear , this happened to virtually all me jewish communities outside israel as well * http://www.cameraoncampus.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/graphic-refugees.png.jpg * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_exodus_from_arab_and_muslim_countries, 
  i generally do n't think of the ` right ' in europe as being tied to religious christians in the way it is in the us, 
  brunner definitely spread his love of torturing people to the various syrian governments , including the assads, 
   * the affair of the gang of barbarians ( in french : l'affaire du gang des barbares ) , was a kidnapping and torture case that gripped and shocked france both because of the fear of resurgence of antisemitism ( because the crime was motivated by antisemitism and money [ 1 ] ) and also because of the vicious nature of the crime committed . 
  *  [ ilan ] halimi was found naked , handcuffed , and bound with nylon rope to a tree about 40 yards ( 37 metres ) inside a woodlot near a railway station , just outside paris , on february 13 , 2006 . 
  it was reported that more than 80 % of his body had been burned with acid , as well as gasoline ( possibly to destroy evidence of his captors ' dna ) , to the point that he was difficult to recognize . 
   he had severe contusions , blood blisters , and hematomas covering most of his body ( to the point that he was more blue than flesh-colored ) , multiple broken bones , one ear and one big toe missing . 
  most of his penis appeared to have been burned off , and his testicles were described as '' like blackened oranges . '', 
  halimi died en route to a hospital .

  it is n't easy trying to prevent kurds from forming a contiguous territory . 
  nothing stops a terrorist attack more than getting pulled over for a random traffic infraction but then having no id etc. 
  having an id may be part of their strategy of hiding in plain sight until right before the attack, 
  that jumped out at me too , until i remembered star wars was filmed in tunisia ...
