he just had his dreams crushed , i would step down too . 
  it possible . 
  there was a second one in quebec , and i think the latter one was much closer . 
  there was a long gap between them though . 
  do n't give up hope , sooner or later you too can free yourself from the oppression of the english . 
  `` are we the baddies ? '', 
  sweden , why did n't we listen to you ?!, 
  you tried to warn us !, 
  that is a shame . 
  i thought der spiegel and der stern were the two best german newspapers . 
  i suppose my german teacher was mistaken . 
   before 1975 , if you were caught with a red hot pair of scissors in the vicinity of a gay somali 's testes , legally-speaking , there was nothing the police could do . 
  why so specific , sweden ? 
  that was an acid trip of a sentence, 
  and what does it scream ? 
  * `` freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee '' *, 
  ah , that is cute . 
  the mama bird is letting the baby bird play on its chest ^ and ^ now ^ to ^ reap ^ the ^ downvotes, 
  ah , makes much more sense, 
  [ o rly ] ( http://www.cracked.com/article_18464_the-17-most-unintentionally-hilarious-propaganda-posters.html ), 
  i understand that he is bathing in the blood of the innocent , but why is there a strip of bacon hanging out of the tub . 
  did he want a snack and , if so , why not a piece of chocolate ? 
  why is this bothering me so much ? 
  as much as i hate to say it , the famous join or die cartoon was about the french and indian war ( what we call the seven years war ) . 
  it was calling for colonial unity in the face of french and indian aggression ^ while ^ conveniently ^ forgetting ^ that ^ we ^ started ^ that ^ war, 
  it depends on whether or not he is referring to `` national patriotism '' in the european sense with ethnicity as the base of nationality or the american sense with culture being the base of nationality . 
  the last time the former was seen here was the 1800s . 
  from our experience in the 30s , if you are paying people to do public works on big projects , you can get amazing feats done . 
  a substantial portion of our infrastructure was built during the depression and is of such high quality that it is as good today as it was when made . 
  and all of that infrastructure is beautiful too , the out of work artists being hired to decorate it with masonry and murals . 
  effectively , hungary is wasting a valuable opportunity to make permanent improvements . 
  it is your tone that is the problem . 
  allow me to present your argument in better language : `` if war was to come , europe would be the one supporting american actions , due to our greater ability to act as one nation and our greater willingness to do so . 
  after all , have we not put heavier sanctions on it than the eu , even though our interests are threatened less by the russian advance ? 
  i believe that you are correct but , please , stop being a douche . 
  we have to fight against the stereotypes , not confirm them . 
  sanctions and modernizing the shit out of the militaries of his neighbors . 
  the latter is already underway , we just need eu consensus on the former . 
  that is to say that if the former does n't happen now , in the wake of this war crime , then it wo n't happen . 
  thank you , the map is very helpful . 
  he was born a century too late . 
  these paintings , their style and their subjects remind me of the pre-raphealites . 
  not my cup of tea but i can still respect them . 
  the fucker gave me sufficient zinc and bowel regularity !, 
  how dare he !, 
   recently they stated that ukrainian military crucified a boy after they liberated separatist city . 
  [ history does not repeat itself , but it does rhyme . ], 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_crucified_soldier ), 
  and you apparently forgot sarcasm . 
  not only that , but the literal meaning of the message is a piece of helpful advice . 
  thank you russia , i am glad that you are concerned about our health . 
  fear sells newspapers . 
  less a western thing and more a media thing . 
  smart people can tell what is news and what is there to scare you out of $ 1.50, 
  misleading . 
  the poles had heavier tanks . 
  the main problem was in number and use . 
  tanks were distributed evenly across divisions rather than in specific tank units , something that the french also did . 
  as you know , it did n't work too well for either of them . 
  ah good . 
  i was cold but now i can warm up next the fires of this flame war . 
  does that mean that donetsk and montreal are sister cities ? 
  you tea drinking , loyalist son-of-a-bitch !, 
  that makes no sense , every culture is derived from other cultures . 
  even the chinese , the only one of the `` original '' cultures left , has been influenced by other cultures . 
  one can say that x basically has a culture of cultures . 
   well , first off they spelled civilization wrong [ replaces `` z '' with `` s '' ] ** kill ** but in all seriousness , `` z '' much better represents that sound than `` s '' . 
  also , turn on a radio or tv and you will find all the american culture that you need . 
  i do n't understand how europeans can say this one moment before opening up a coke and watching * orange is the new black * the next . 
  american culture is the most influential in the world . 
  you might even say that we are a few turns away from a culture victory ... 
  man , fuck texas . 
  they have all of the arrogance of new york with none of the justification . 
  i think the palestinians win that contest . 
  the israelis have a saying about that , `` the palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity . '', 
  belorussian is a thing ? 
  ( i kid , i kid ), 
  ** muh freedoms !!!, 
  ** it is a trope but america is an intensely individualistic country . 
  our revolution was fought purely over ideals of individual liberty , life in the colonies being pretty good in 1775 . 
  this libertarian streak goes through american politics and has been dominant for almost all of politics except for 1929-1980 . 
  in many peoples heads , government is a problem , not a solution . 
  this has left us open to less regulation and thus more exploitation by corporations , although i believe discontent about this will reach a critical mass in the next few years . 
  expect more protests a la occupy . 
  ** peoples of the world , your liberation is at hand ** internationally , we see ourselves as a special people whose mission is to spread peace , freedom , the american way , yadayada you know how this song goes . 
  we are the oldest democratic republic ( in before dutch and swiss objections ) , we never had an aristocracy , we stood strong as 1848 and 1918 failed to bring lasting democracies . 
  it is our mission to bring freedom to all while conveniently forgetting about all of the dictatorships we propped about during the cold war . 
  that is why we love world war ii so much . 
  we came in , liberated everything , killed people who were obviously horrible pieces of totalitarian shit , set up lots of stable democracies , * and then we went home * . 
  it is how we want every one of our wars to go . 
  also , we are a relatively militaristic country , and as long as there are dictatorships , we can fight wars on other people 's land ad infinitum . 
  when people complain about this , we can point out the very real fact that american hegemony has kept the peace of the world for 70-80 years . 
  ** jesus christ , american hero ** yeah , so secularism never really happened over here . 
  my hypothesis about this is that america has never been into forced or state religion , thus religion has never been seen as more than an individual private matter . 
  thus it is tolerated , just look at how the amish are accepted without a second thought . 
  only in recent times have religious laws been a thing ( starting in the 80s ) and , low and behold , secularism is gaining a foothold . 
  ** feel the rainbow , taste the rainbow ** american is not a nationality , it is a culture . 
  there is no strong tension between ethnic groups ( only in america ^ tm can a lithuanian jew and a scot can have a baby , me ) , instead tension is focused between racial groups . 
  you guys are roughly familiar with the situation but i feel as if the europeans exaggerate it a lot . 
  then again , we still have a long way to go down the path of becoming a true `` rainbow nation '' , particularly with the black population .
