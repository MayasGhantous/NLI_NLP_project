  it can be compared to similar experiences in canada , new zealand , argentina , uruguay , and australia . 
  the roma however are different . 
  they are a migrant people who arrived from india . 
  they are not aboriginals who have had their land taken from them , they just are a persecuted traveler people who do n't settle down , half because of their culture and half because of native persecution ( europeans being the natives for once ) . 
  they can be compared to the hakka of china for instance . 
  also , a lot of native americans have assimilated . 
  one of their reasons for their low numbers has been interbreeding with white settlers . 
  it seems that the majority of the people who claim to be `` native americans '' today are visibly no different then anyone else and are , at best , a quarter native american . 
  that being said , there are many native americans on the reservations who buck this trend , particularly the lakota . 
  this is n't the middle ages , the roma do n't need land to settle , they need jobs . 
  ah , but remember that ** america big ** . 
  0.3 % of romania is small . 
  0.3 % of america is a lot of people . 
  trees do n't have autism . 
  but they do n't have brains either . 
   we know this through hard experience and now do our best to the lesson into action i was not claiming complete success . 
  yes , we have our problems , but look at where were were 200 years ago , with slavery , where we were 100 years ago , with jim crow , and where we are today , with a black president . 
  our ancestors dug us a deep hole and we are crawling out of it . 
  someday , a person will be judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin . 
  until then , we continue the struggle and know that we are winning . 
  look at all of the peoples of the earth who have come to our shores and become american . 
  one of my friends in high school was romanian , like you . 
  now he is an american . 
  my girlfriend 's family was taiwanese . 
  now they are american . 
  my grandfather was lithuanian , then he was american . 
  why ? 
  we respect people . 
  if it is their custom to do something , and it does n't hurt anyone , [ we say `` who cares ? '' ], 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amish ) . 
  there is always some friction for the first 10-20 years of contact but that always dies away . 
  and what have you done to crawl out of the hole that your ancestors dug you ? 
  not enough it seems . 
  from my perspective of an outsider looking in , not much has changed . 
  government policy is not enough . 
  the culture of europe must change . 
  and then , the roma will assimilate enough to become as financially productive as anyone else . 
  commies are bad . 
  that obvious statement out of the way , communists can be good people . 
  the ideology is what i hate , not the people who follow it . 
  when communists gain power , that is generally the first step down a dark road , but the few communists who existed in america where amongst the first to support the civil rights movement . 
  their hearts can be in the right place . 
  as for spear of the nation , compare what they did with other african movements of the same time . 
  and then compare with the type of oppression that the afrikaners [ dished ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharpeville_massacre ) out on the native peoples of south africa , from the xhosa to the sotho . 
  then you would realize that you got off light . 
  if i were oppressed like they were , i would take up arms too . 
   to whom ? 
  the world in general , in my humble opinion . 
   that 's great , i bet that people living below the poverty line appreciate this . 
  blame the legacy of the soviets for that . 
  consider this , the general welfare of the polish people has been up and up . 
  compare that with the stagnation seen in some former communist nations and the grinding poverty seen in russia . 
  poland was thrown into an abyss by the commies , but they are climbing hard and are close enough to the mouth of that hole of poverty that their victory over it is a forgone conclusion . 
   the results of the last sunday 's election show something else . 
  they show , first of all , that 75 % of poles do n't give a fuck about democracy , and that they 're okay with a hitler apologist representing them . 
  you do realise that that statement can apply to most of europe , right ? 
  all one would have to do is to change the percentage and the nationality to suit each nation . 
  if these were elections for the * actual * government , rather than the eu silly elections , then your point would be a lot more valid . 
  but they are not . 
   membership fee : your souls absurd !, 
  i do n't know where you get these silly ideas ... ^ he 's ^ on ^ to ^ us . 
  the pockets of rich men . 
  when will france stop disgracing herself by humoring these bigots . 
  the only difference between marine le pen and her father is that she can keep her mouth shut . 
  of course . 
  vaclav havel was hilarious , but did the slovaks like his jokes ? 
  nooooooooooooo ... 
  fuck petain . 
  also , only apartheid supports would consider mandela a villain . 
  `` do you have wet dreams about putin ? 
  fascist pig dog ! '', 
  i do n't understand europe 's attitude toward the roma . 
  * we ostracize them , persecute them , deport them , hate them , and discriminate against them . 
  and then they wo n't conform to society ? 
  how dare they !, 
  * we americans and canadians have experience in stuff like this . 
  you have to be nice to people before they assimilate . 
  we know this through hard experience and now do our best to the lesson into action . 
  you guys do n't have to make your mistakes , you can learn from ours . 
  i consider poland to be western . 
  they have proved themselves worthy . 
  i am so proud of them . 
  yes poland has always wanted to be western . 
  but it has always been held back . 
  and now , in 20 years , it has made amazing progress . 
  it is a pillar of democracy and will be a beacon of liberty for all slavs who want more than to be putin 's slave . 
  welcome to the club , poland . 
  that was a very optimistic video . 
  i heard that the maker got torn apart by hungry hobos . 
  lucky him , his suffering is over .
