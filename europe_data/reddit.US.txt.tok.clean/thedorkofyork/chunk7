  infinitely superior to damn yankee subs . 
  this one is fried shrimp , spicy aoili , all sorts of cajun stuff , secret stuff , onions , etc ) . 
  or perhaps that place that blends korean and mexican food into a delicious two-some of kimchi and chili . 
  or , if you hate yourself , have vegan , see what i care ^ commie [ past dead man 's curve ] ( http://media.cleveland.com/plain_dealer_metro/photo/11538398-large.jpg ) and next to the lake erie fish-man-beast is the best burger in america . 
  anyone who says otherwise is a damn commie . 
  while this place is technically a sit-down restaurant , i 'm including this on the list because ** all must know ** and the spirit of the hamburger is fast food . 
  also because one has to sit down in order to withstand the pure murica of these burgers . 
  they are so awesome that a single bite would be able to blast the chest hair off of [ teddy roosevelt ] ( http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/053/1/7/teddy_roosevelt_vs__bigfoot_by_sharpwriter-d3a72w4.jpg ) ( here is a picture of how teddy roosevelt relaxed , if you are not familiar with our most badass president ) . 
  what is this mystical place you ask ?

  does that wall look interesting ? 
  it should , because it is made out of [ beer ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yzot49yptje/tpzdohevgwi/aaaaaaaaab8/ibmi82ghfpo/s560/b-spot.jpg ) .

  but we would n't be this fat if we did n't have such damn good food . 
  maine is child of incest between america and canada . 
  remove lobster into sea . 
  beignets are soooooo good . 
  i am glad we bought louisiana . 
  every glorious culture deserves at least a dash of french cuisine . 
  how did you guys become so good at cooking ? 
  it reminds me of the custard used in chinese pastries . 
  do you guys have any chinese restaurants by way of macau ? 
  damn . 
  i respect that . 
  [ or you could stop eating so much dick . ], 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spotted_dick ), 
  [ maybe you should stop eating so many faggots . ], 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faggot_%28food%29 ), 
  of course you spell it differently , of course ... ^ limey, 
  the cake was a lie and then the donut is a lie , is nothing in this world true ?!?!? 
  we should just start injecting nutella straight into our bloodstreams . 
  that 's the way we seem to be going now-a-days . 
  do you guys have beignets or is that only a cajun thing ? 
  hey !, 
  mexico is fatter than us now . 
  we 're number two !, 
  we 're number two !, 
  donuts are serious business . 
  never joke about them to a north american . 
  you 're lucky you said that to an american , i just gave you a stern talking to . 
  if you said that to a canadian , he would hunt you down , shoot you , skin you and tan your hide into a warm hat or a coat . 
  canada is that quiet kid that sits in the back of the class . 
  he is nice and shy , but , when provoked , flies into a homicidal rage . 
  and tim horton 's is the killswitch . 
  the same way that there are cultural differences between cornwall and northumbria . 
  imagine a spectrum , with stereotypically american traits on one end and stereotypically european traits on the other . 
  on this spectrum , texas would be on the american end and the northwestern states ( washington , oregon and the northern half of california , known as norcal ) would be on the european end . 
  it is important to point out that the northwest is still very american , it is just has a vaguely european feel . 
  and this developed independently from any european influence . 
  analogous evolution , if you would . 
  once again , these are my personal observations . 
  from my perspective , i have to disagree . 
  i have been to london before . 
  yes , there are thing separating us ( such as clotted cream . 
  delicious , delicious clotted cream ) . 
  but there are many more things that bring us together . 
  going to london was less about finding out how different we are than finding out about how close we are . 
  also , you sort of jumped in the deep end by going to the south first . 
  i 'm surprised that you did n't like san francisco though . 
  california is the most european state in its outlook . 
  in our defense , asking someone how much they make is very rude in america as well . 
  there are douschbags in every country . 
  we wo n't settle until we have reached beer parity with the english . 
  i also wish to see an end to the rumor that all american beer is water . 
  yes , we love our lagers but there is so much more to our brewing culture, 
  that was only one time and * grumblegrumblegrumble *, 
  to tell the truth , i 'm kinda pissed off that we did n't think of it . 
  in america , pissing off the russians is a national sport . 
  we have hard visas ? 
  you forgot the best food in your list , by the way . 
  guys , guys , lets calm down . 
  we do n't want to have to cross the ocean to settle your conflicts * again *, 
  it does , and so do we , but in my opinion french cheeses are still the best . 
  followed by the spanish , followed by the italians . 
  thank you . 
  it means a lot . 
  we have been working hard the past few years on beer and wine production and i 'm glad to see that our wine is up to continental standards . 
  and now for the beer ... 
  i take offense . 
  any american who posts without his or her flag is a damn dirty , unpatriotic , limey-loving , commie terrorist who should be shot on site . 
  murica . 
  not everyone wants to look at england 's cock . 
  he knows !, 
  fellow murican , you have to understand , that is the entire history of the relationship between france and england . 
  the very reason that france supported us during the revolution was just to spite the english . 
  leave them to it , they have been very civil about it for the last century . 
  as an american , i would rather go to paris than london . 
  our culture is so similar to our english cousins that i would rather spend the bajillion dollars it takes to cross the pond in order to go to delightfully foreign paris rather than vaguely familiar london . 
  besides that i do n't really think there is a general preference for either nation . 
  americans generally are muricans , francophiles , anglophiles or japanophiles . 
  i do n't think there is a disparity between the anglophiles and francophiles . 
  all of this is based off of my personal observations , i reserve the right to be wrong . 
  the last time somebody said no to that question world war one happened .
