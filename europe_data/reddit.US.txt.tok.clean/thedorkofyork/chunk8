  let us not go through that again . 
  someone in the center of russia does n't know the difference between a platypus and a sturgeon . 
  it must be hard to teach biology to high school students in your country . 
  `` viktor , what do dolphins , cats , and humans have in common ? '', 
  '' ** they all have tits !!!, 
   scary fuckers , you ca n't see them in creeks , and they can and will kill you . 
  does n't that describe about 80 % of your wildlife ? 
  greece ? 
  oh , you mean s\u00fcd deutchland . 
  it is the continuation of a trend, 
  i 'm just proving that immigration started before we started our wars in the middle east . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastarbeiter#west_germany http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_france#1945-1974 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_the_united_kingdom_since_irish_independence#post-war_immigration_.281945.e2.80.931983.29, 
  * violently twitches *, 
   let us take the immigrants wat . 
  you invited those immigrants over in order to fulfill your labor needs . 
  this started after the second world war , and we did n't start that war , we ended it ( with the help of britain and the soviets of course ) . 
  its not our fault that you ca n't assimilate them . 
  you could always follow either our example or the canadian model there . 
   americans are loud but we are lovable rascals about it . 
   lack of respect for historically significant buildings/monuments in europe . 
  do n't climb up our monuments and take stupid ass pictures . 
  it 's most likely been there for close to a thousand years or at least 400 years . 
  just because you do n't have to pay entrance and it is n't gated does n't mean you can do what the hell you want i agree with this whole-heartedly . 
  if it helps you understand , everything in america is at most 400 years old . 
  up until one goes to the old world , one can expect to see something that is at most 300 years old . 
  thus to some people , the likes of whom unfortunately exist in every nation ( see `` idiots '' ) , age does n't garner the proper amount of respect . 
  well , we did n't elect him . 
  well that is n't very fair . 
  we have one of the world 's most vibrant cultures . 
  it is not where cultures go to die , it is where they go to build something new . 
  i do n't think that conjuring the spirit of the scholls fits their purpose very well . 
  republicans are n't nazis . 
  that is why i started this thread . 
  as per our tendency to live in a bubble , we do n't have the ability to visit foreign countries like you guys do . 
  we have canada , which is culturally american ( except for quebec ) , and mexico . 
  so we only experience one foreign culture often . 
  it is prohibitively expensive for your average joe to visit europe . 
  i do n't understand how people can listen to the tea party too , but i 'm a progressive democrat so ... 
  nuclear bombs do not care about age . 
  not `` what '' but `` wat '' . 
  i find it ironic that argentina is trying to colonize british territory of all places . 
  fate has a mean sense of humor , eh ? 
  go to those nations and ask them what they think of the japanese . 
  also , of course they would hate china more at the moment . 
  imagine that you are being chased by a tiger . 
  someone comes up and asks you which you fear more , that tiger or a lion that bit your grandfather seventy years ago . 
  o rly ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yasukuni_shrine http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comfort_women#controversies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_history_textbook_controversies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nhk#2014_nhk_crisis_over_comfort_women_in_world_war_two ( forgive my use of wikipedia ) japan did horrible things . 
  they used babies as shot puts and made a sport of catching them with bayonets . 
  they decapitated people out of boredom . 
  they raped women from 12 to 69 before disembowling them . 
  and we know all of this because they took pictures of these actions for their photo albums . 
  while it has apologized for them on paper , their actions since , detailed in the above links , have said otherwise . 
  in my eyes as a jew , germany has redeemed itself for the crimes of her grandfathers . 
  in my eyes as the partner of a taiwanese person , japan has not . 
  japan could do much to follow germany 's example . 
  you know what he meant . 
  make it 175 years ago then . 
  as an american , i agree with this but would also like to add a major detail . 
  take out a map . 
  look at america . 
  now look at europe . 
  america is already bigger than europe . 
  now keep in mind that europe is divided amongst many nations . 
  america is not . 
  by sheer size , and all of the benefits that brings , our power will last for a long time indeed . 
  add another at least another 50 million dead to the war . 
  in 1945 , the soviets had a bigger and better army than the western allies . 
  we would have had to pave the way to moscow with atomic bombs . 
  furthermore , we would be launching a war of aggression rather than a war of defense , or survival in britain 's case . 
  that means that it would have been a lot harder to get the public to back an extension to the bloodiest war in human history . 
  we could have won , but it would n't have been worth it . 
  your grandfather was a good man . 
  when countries define your borders with signs displaying your national food . 
  #culturalvictory edit : / s. 
  no sense of humor on this board . 
  someone deep in the heart of russia needs to be told that a platypus is not a sturgeon . 
  i know . 
  i just read it in the wikipedia article . 
  its nice that bosnia has at least some access to the sea . 
  is n't that in serbia ? '', 
  - last words of an italian tourist, 
  now just wait for the oppressed russian minorities to appear ... 
   they 've never heard of neum . 
  * googles neum * seems like a nice place . 
  * twiddles thumbs *, 
  hey guys , i found the secret swede !, 
  so you are this islam person i 've been hearing so much about ... 
  * slowly slides down in my seat *, 
  britain is dead . 
  she would be the woman who defended scotland against english tyranny . 
  of course the english will `` take care of '' the welsh, 
  fuck , now i want some kerrygold . 
  that butter is magical . 
  they are singing that in edinburgh right now , are n't they ? 
  after tearing down the union jack and hoisting the saltire , that is ... 
  it seems that europe has always been relatively demeaning towards america . 
  why ? 
  i would like some constructive criticism on what you guys think that we have done wrong and how to fix it . 
  i would like you to explain the european perspective to me .
