  most americans do n't actually go to college either - i think only 40 % of millenials have a college degree . 
  i 'm surprised how unsympathetic they come off as . 
   basically in the end in many countries the unemploymet benefits and various other supports already account nearly to that amount . 
  so same money is already paid for . 
  yes , but these benefits only go to a small subset of the population ( 10-20 % ) . 
  this proposal would be to give it to everyone - multiplying the cost by 5 or 10 times . 
  plus , bi wo n't be enough for some needs , particularly medical needs ( and maybe also rent support as well ) , so you wo n't be able to eliminate those programs either . 
  it may also not be enough to support a single parent with several kids .

  yep . 
  the north atlantic is not much like the south pacific . 
   i have never felt more ashamed of how my country handled foreign and even domestic affairs than now . 
  maybe you would feel less `` ashamed '' if you actually understood the issue . 
  or even read the article . 
  instead , you come across as someone who does n't understand the issue and are assuming that the us is doing something wrong because other countries are complaining . 
  because it 's clear if you read this article ( notwithstanding the one quote ) - and other articles on the same subject that these people are putting their money in the us not to avoid taxes , but because they want secrecy . 
   i 'm not sure where you 're getting this idea form that deomcracy and censorship are incompatible . 
  hitler was democratically elected too . 
  you 've left out the second part of the story - after hitler was democratically elected he gained dictatorial power under the enabling act and ended civil liberties as well as the ability to remove him democratically . 
  it 's surprisingly easy to change the german constitution , though . 
  2/3 majority in each house is all you need . 
   but how many people will actually experience this directly ? 
  a lot . 
  it hits a lot closer to home than the largely-theoretical-in-practical-experience greek crisis . 
  people in cologne probably see themselves as directly affected , as do people in m\u00f6nchengladbach and many other areas . 
   i mean , let 's take an example : as statistics show , irish christians are the most likely demographic in europe to be terrorists . 
  over what time period ? 
  the past year ? 
  the past five years ? 
   `` no one wants to offer fodder to right-wing groups ''  it 's kind of problematic when police withhold certain information to support one political party over another . 
  [ ny times article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/opinion/can-germany-be-honest-about-its-refugee-problems.html?pagewanted=all&amp;rref=collection%2ftimestopic%2fbittner%2c%20jochen&amp;action=click&amp;contentcollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentplacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0 ) everyone knows that this was an issue . 
  underreporting of this kind of news has been happening for months . 
  it 's not a `` conspiracy '' in the sense that the media got together and all agreed to do this to further their agenda . 
  but they all did this . 
  instead of making weaker and weaker arguments that everything is fine , you should be pissed off that your media has been deliberately withholding news from you . 
  you are in denial . 
  this has been widely reported and no one is actually denying this anymore . 
  [ ny times link ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/opinion/can-germany-be-honest-about-its-refugee-problems.html?pagewanted=all&amp;rref=collection%2ftimestopic%2fbittner%2c%20jochen&amp;action=click&amp;contentcollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentplacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0 ) l\u00fcgenpresse , of course , is not really the best term for what the news media is doing , since its nazi connotations do n't really help much . 
  and it 's not clear that the media are suppressing these kinds of stories because they feel like they have to follow the government 's line ; it 's likely a combination of the inclinations of the publishers themselves as well as a desire not to publish news that would give credibility to right-wing movements . 
  ( even if this means suppressing actual news ) . 
  the issue is not so much bias on the level of individual articles , but the fact that hundreds of articles all took a similar approach to downplaying criminal activity . 
  they are not trying to charge him at all . 
   he was n't even charged with any crime he was n't charged with a crime because he fled from police . 
  you ca n't be charged with a crime in sweden until you submit to questioning . 
   on the other hand , usa pretty much directly said they will seek to capture him and put on trial for treason , which is funny since he 's not an american citizen . 
  no , the us never said this . 
  the us has not indicted assange for a crime , nor have they sought an extradition . 
  why not apply occam 's razor : assange does n't want to go to sweden because he does n't want to be tried for rape . 
  yes , he broke the law . 
  yes , it was rape . 
  your third hand description of what internet apologists say happened does not correspond to what the witnesses say happened . 
  there could be a sealed indictment , but there 's no such thing as a sealed extradition . 
  and , again , they could have just extradited him from the uk . 
  they would n't . 
  it 's really annoying the great lengths that assange supporters ( and rape apologists ) like you will go to , well , make stuff up to support assange . 
  there is no evidence that the us even wants to extradite assange . 
  there 's certainly no evidence that they want to extradite him for treason . 
  you , and other assange supporters are just making this up . 
  it 's not difficult to extradite people from the uk . 
  it happens * all the time * . 
  it 's much more difficult - and rare - to extradite someone from sweden . 
  the ** only reason ** why this us-extradition bullshit exists is because assange needs some excuse to avoid going to sweden other than the obvious - he does n't want to be charged with rape . 
  so this whole double secret extradition from sweden to the us crap was invented * solely * to have a convenient argument for why assange should n't go to sweden to face rape charges . 
  because the claim that he needs to avoid sweden , specifically , because of us extradition is ridiculous on its face . 
   to not talk about the borders they were left with , in africa , yes ... but not in the middle east . 
   as well as the ethnic hatreds from colonialism 's ` divide and conquer ' policies . 
  true , although this can be overstated . 
  it 's not like europe itself was free of ethnic hatreds , and it is also the case that many of the african ethnic hatreds predated colonization by hundreds of years . 
  in america it 's also a common meme to say h1b visas undercut salaries of skilled workers . 
  so be doubly wary . 
   but measures must also be taken to reduce the incidence of crime in the first place . 
   giving more money to the police does not do that . 
   giving more money to the police does not solve the problem . 
  this is actually not true . 
  new york city 's crime rate plunged dramatically from the 90 's to today due in large part to better policing ( i.e. , broken windows policing , comp stat , patrols focusing on where the crime actually is , etc. ) . 
  the murder rate in nyc is now as low as it was in 1963 . 
  i mean , there 's more to it than just giving money to the police ; you have to use it intelligently . 
  but it 's certainly not the case that policing ca n't reduce crimes , or that the only thing you can do to reduce crime is to focus on the `` causes '' of crime . 
  whatever they are . 
  the issue is not computing power . 
  it 's storing and indexing . 
  moore 's actual law was a doubling `` approximately every two years '' . 
  it did n't almost surpass the us , but it reached 60 % at one point in the 90 's . 
  it 's now at about 25 % ( although that 's still very high ) . 
  china has very close to 60 % of the us gdp , although it 's not quite there . 
  gdp per capita has nothing to do with how much people actually earn , so ppp is n't really relevant . 
  you need to know median income , and apply ppp to that . 
  look at it this way : let 's say you work for apple . 
  apple has a market cap of x , and its number of employees are y. 
  dividing x by y will give you per capita market capitalization - but it will have little or no relationship to how much money you actually take home . 
  ppp matters for income , not for gdp . 
  again , income inequality has nothing to do with poverty . 
  it has to do with income inequality . 
  and the us measures poverty in a specific way , which includes both the amount of money that people earn and the number of people in the family . 
  other countries measure it differently ( although generally do consider both income and family size ) . 
  i mean look at the examples - do you really believe that german poverty is twice as high as french poverty ? 
  income inequality is n't a measure of poverty . 
   gdp per capita is n't exactly the best way to compare how rich a country is this is true . 
  if you want to compare how rich a country is , you should look at the country 's gdp . 
  if you want to see how rich people * in * the country are , you should look at median income , possibly adjusted by ppp .
