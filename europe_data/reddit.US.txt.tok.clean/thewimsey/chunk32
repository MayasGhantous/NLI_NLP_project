  are you aware that pows also do n't get trials ? 
  guantanamo detainees do have the right to habeas corpus . 
  the patriot act does n't send anyone to prison without trial . 
  you do n't even know what it does , do you ? 
  the war on drugs is not about profit . 
  there 's really no profit in holding people in prison . 
   it costed american more than $ 1 trillion , according to several analysts , iraq and afghanistan combined will cost usa more than $ 4 trillion . 
  you can find people claiming numbers like that , although the best estimates put the cost at a total of $ 1.4 trillion ( for iraq and afghanistan ) through 2012 . 
  still a shit ton of money .

  until you see that it wo n't keep out the rain . 
  just because he wants to deny people with opposing viewpoints a platform does n't make him a nazi . 
  invading without a un sanction is not a war crime . 
  no matter how many germans believe this to be the case . 
  iraqis are not citizens . 
  except that they almost always * are * . 
  and $ 1.14 three years ago . 
  it was that low for most of 2013 . 
  as well as 2008 , 2009 , half of 2010 , and most of 2011 . 
  `` i like pig butts and i can not lie ! '', 
  no one is claiming it does n't matter . 
  but russia has the 12th largest economy . 
  it 's 12 % the size of china 's . 
  7 % the size of the us . 
  and only 85 % the size of canada 's economy . 
  it 's not a `` big daddy . '', 
  i 'm pretty sure they are using median income , not average income . 
  median us income in 2013 was $ 53000 / year , which is the number cited in the article . 
  the us still has a high corporate tax rate ( 35 % ) for larger corporations ( although the effective rate tends to be lower ) . 
  what does the us supreme court have to do with anything ? 
  you do know that corporations are also persons in europe ? 
  and that one consequence of that is that they have to pay taxes ? 
   what matters is that the baby boomers are set to retire in around ten to twenty years which will cause a massive change in the ratio of people paying and recieving pensions . 
  the first baby boomers were born in 1946 . 
  they are 70 and have already retired . 
  if you look at the data for france specifically , and then youth smoking , the data shows 15 % of french boys smoke , compared with 4.5 % in germany and 2 % in the us . 
  of adults , though , it 's 27 % for the french , 28 % for germans , and 17 % for the us . 
  but austria is off the charts . 
  18 % of boys and 36 % of adults !, 
  yeah ... part of the issue is n't that they simply violated emissions standards , but that they violated them by releasing ** 40 times ** the allowable amount of particulates . 
  this is not even true . 
  bmw also sells diesel in the us , was also tested , and was found not to have cheated . 
  it 's exactly the same in europe . 
  corporations are persons in europe as well . 
  sure . 
  especially by the companies that have to pay them . 
  but there are no punitive damages in this settlement . 
  a lot of this is not quite right , although there are some important variations among states . 
   you ca n't just walk into bank branch and drop off your keys , annulling contract immediately , but foreiting all payments made to date , in most states you ca n't do this - you will still owe the balance of the mortgage . 
  but in 8 or 10 states ( including california ) , mortgages are non-recourse mortgages , meaning that the most the mortgage lender can get from you is the house . 
  this is a very borrower-friendly provision ( which my state does not have , however ) . 
   ( in europe , house belongs to buyer from day 1 , with mortgages and stuff being listed in separate fields in public ledger - bank ca n't simply foreclose loan and kick people out to street - deliquent loans have to be submitted to court , with bailiff later organizing auction , proceeds from which are being transfered to bank ) . 
  this is the way it works in the us , too . 
  a foreclosure is a judicial process that can take from several months to a couple of years ; after you get a judgment of foreclosure , the house will be sold at sheriff 's sale and the proceeds distributed to creditors . 
  some people will buy an apartment to use exclusively for airbnb . 
   as a poor person that scores 99 % on standardized testing , i ca n't afford college . 
  you are lying . 
  this was an explicit goal of adenauer ( and as a rhinelander , he was already `` west '' ) and other atlanticists during the immediate postwar era . 
  and they were very successful . 
  apparently some people are obsessed about * not * winning , though . 
  i think the eu 's population is just over 500 million . 
  europe itself ( including russia ) has a population of around 700 million . 
  that would be closer - to be more accurate , you would need to count only the results of the team that was favored before the olympics began , not the team that actually won ( as the non-favored team would never have made it to the olympics in the first place ) . 
  but i 'm not sure how you account for team sports , where one pan-european team ought to perform better than any single country 's team . 
  because both china and the us were allowed to enter 28 athletes in each event ? 
   imagine 2 vietnamese refugees in usa , who does n't speak english and have no education , what do you think the likelihood is of them ever being able to afford sending 3 or their 5 kids to university ? 
   in us you might get lucky and receive a scholarship or other financial aid . 
  or you might not get lucky and your parents or yourself will have to pay for the education . 
  no matter how you twist and turn it , this will exclude some people from an education why people in the us does not have the same ` equal ' opportunity . 
  bull . 
  shit . 
  i do n't know why so many europeans with no idea how things actually function in the us feel qualified to comment on these things . 
  everyone in the us who is qualified to go to college will be able to go . 
  the difference is that they would need to take out student loans . 
  this is a substantial difference , but it means that they graduate from college with debt , not that they do n't go in the first place . 
  korea was not particularly unpopular ... but , yeah , they were there are part of the us army . 
   housing benefit benefits landlords just as much as tenants , by allowing them to earn a higher income from their property . 
  it may benefit landlords , but i do n't think it 's correct to say that it benefits them as much as tenants . 
   that 's as close to an admission that they plan on allowing his extradition as soon as he gets to sweden . 
  this is a stupid argument . 
  people who make this argument are either stupid or dishonest . 
  it is easier to extradite assange from the uk than from sweden . 
  people are extradited from the uk to the us all the time . 
  the us would n't need to concoct some elaborate ruse involving two swedish witnesses and the swedish justice system to lure assange to sweden for extradition to the us . 
  the us could just ask the uk for extradition . 
  plus , because assange is being extradited from the uk to sweden , sweden would need the permission of the uk to extradite him to the us * anyway * . 
  the only reason the whole `` swedish extradition '' story exists is to give assange an excuse to not return to sweden and face rape charges . 
  again , extradition from the uk is common and routine . 
  like i said , the only people who believe the swedish extradition story are dishonest or stupid . 
  or both , i suppose . 
  guilty until proven innocent is a legal standard . 
  it does n't mean that people are n't permitted to draw their own conclusions based on the fact that assange is , well , a fugitive from justice . 
   propping up certain groups through money or propaganda is completely , completely unacceptable and should result in severe consequences . 
  so the eu should withdraw its support for the palestinian authority ? 
  it 's extremely regulated in the us . 
  the fact that it 's less normalized in the common psyche in europe is a bad thing . 
  if systembolaget sold cannabis , no one could afford it . 
  you might as well just use the brecht poem :  ** the solution **  after the uprising of the 17th of june  the secretary of the writers ' union  had leaflets distributed in the stalinallee  stating that the people  had forfeited the confidence of the government  and could win it back only  by redoubled efforts . 
  would it not be easier  in that case for the government  to dissolve the people  and elect another ? 
  these oecd sites are a pain to navigate , and do n't really allow direct linking , for some reason .
