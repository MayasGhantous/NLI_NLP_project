  you may see that occasionally , but it 's much more common to see * am\u00e9ricain . 
  * look at figaro or le monde and they are both talking about the * elections am\u00e9ricaines * . 
  it 's a britishism , i think . 
   because of the american hypocrisy germans are * great * at complaining about other people , but for some reason become super-sensitive if anyone criticizes anything german . 
  vw could n't comply with us emissions standards and so blatantly cheated . 
  they admit it . 
  everyone else knows this . 
  * why * ca n't you admit it ? 
  is it so painful to admit that vw is dishonest . 
  and it 's not against german companies - bmw underwent the same tests and passed them . 
  they did n't have to cheat ... why did vw ? 
   googles engine is as good as it is because it has so many users . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  it 's not a social media website . 
  people use * facebook * because everyone else does , and an abandoned social media website is useless . 
  * google * does n't benefit from those sort of network externalities . 
  google 's search results are n't better because more people are using google ; it 's search results will be the same if 1 person uses it or 1 billion people use it . 
  again , search engines * are n't social media * . 
  google 's engine is as good as it is because it has more math and science behind it . 
   its completely ridiculous to argue that europe should accept absurd monopolies just because we dont invest as much into tech . 
  it 's not absurd when it appears that the eu is targeting us companies because it ca n't compete with them . 
   they do n't . 
  are you claiming that there are better search engines that have been suppressed by google ? 
  if so , you are delusional . 
  conspiracy theories are a staple of the middle east ; this is just another example . 
  all you do is look at any situation to see who benefits from it ... and , magically , they are the one who caused it . 
  there 's a lot of academic ( and non-academic ) discussion of this topic . 
  for example : [ matthew gray ] ( https://www.amazon.com/conspiracy-theories-arab-world-politics/dp/0415575192 ) also [ this ] ( http://www.arabnews.com/node/215565 ) .

  finally , [ this shark attack ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2010/12/13/shark-attack-in-egypt-must-be-the-work-of-israeli-agents/#.v4o8ozmrisq ) !, 
  bmw met the standards , though . 
  exactly . 
  it 's worth pointing out that bmw was also tested by the us and they passed the tests . 
   yeah , it 's not absurd to suspect this could be staged . 
  yes , it is . 
   i find everything about tonight to be extremely convenient for mr. erdogan . 
  it 's incredibly difficult to have a conspiracy with thousands of members , lots of moving parts , and not have people find out about it . 
  not to mention given the fact that a number of people have actually been killed . 
   every dead civilian in iraq , creased at least 1-2 radicals . 
  there was islamic terrorism before the iraq war . 
  this terrorist was from north africa and was born in france . 
  but it 's totally the fault of the us . 
  the last time it happened jimmy carter was president , the ussr existed , and the berlin wall was in place . 
   it takes money from everywhere depending on tax base 70 % of funding comes from a levy to individual countries based on their gdp . 
   but go back 100 years , look at what western nations did to the middle east . 
  this is pure historical ignorance . 
  you should actually learn something about the history of the middle east before you try to lecture people about it . 
  seriously - why the fuck do people know so little about the history of the me ? 
  it 's not like it 's unimportant . 
  100 years ago , most of the me was part of the ottoman empire . 
  as it had been for the previous 400 years . 
  iraq ? 
  ruled by the ottomans . 
  ruled by the ottomans . 
  ruled by the ottomans . 
  ruled by the ottomans . 
  ruled by the ottomans . 
  saudi arabia ? 
  ruled by the ottomans . 
  jordan ? 
  ruled by the ottomans . 
  the ottomans had a friggin ' huge empire , which no one seems to remember . 
  in the early 20 's , after the ottomans were defeated in wwi , the ottoman empire was split up , much the way that the austro-hungarian empire was . 
  the new countries were based on ottoman provinces . 
  ( and not on random lines drawn on a map as people like to claim . 
  that happened in africa , but not in the me ) . 
  some of the new countries were protectorates of european powers . 
  iraq was a protectorate of britain for about 10 years . 
  syria of france for almost 20 years . 
  is * that * what you are talking about ? 
  britain gave iraq independence from turkey , ruled it as a protectorate for 10 years , and * that 's * why there are so many problems there ? 
  does n't matter . 
  70 years of independent rule ? 
  does n't matter . 
  10 years of british rule - caused all the problems . 
   besides how the united states actively sponsored the taliban having bits of misinformation does n't really help us understand anything . 
  the us did n't sponsor the taliban , which arose in the 90 's from various fundamentalist religious schools . 
  the us sponsored various mujahideen groups . 
  yes , overall ... but this is also the least peaceful time to live in france since the end of wwii . 
   lot of fake homeless this is a problem everywhere . 
  it 's also a problem for the actual homeless because the fake homeless are more effective at getting money . 
   i visited san francisco and there was literally one homeless person on every street corner . 
  have you visited anywhere else ? 
  people actually travel to s.f. 
  to be homeless . 
  us uses the following definitions : family of 4 : $ 24,447 family of 3 : $ 18,540 family of 2 : $ 15,871 1 person : $ 12,331, 
   so we should let you have the same deal you have now but without the freedom of movement , then the uk would end up with a better deal . 
  the premise of this statement is that freedom of movement is a negative . 
  is that what you intended ? 
  because there 's certainly an argument to be made that removing mutual freedom of movement is a negative for the uk . 
  kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  under `` k '' . 
  ca n't they just laugh ? 
  you want licorice ? 
  most estimates suggest 20 % of london s financial services are at risk . 
  and they wo n't all be moving to frankfurt . 
  india , pakistan , japan , australia , thailand ... 
  the us became the largest market in 2015 , with a gdp of $ 17.95 trillion to the eu 's $ 16.24 trillion . 
  ( or $ 16.16 to $ 14.63 ) .
