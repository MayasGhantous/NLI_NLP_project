  these two rates are n't really comparable . 
  60 % of the us median income is $ 32,000 / year . 
  you should take this point up with your own government first .

  30/33 i missed the population question ( chose 78 mln vs. 80 mln ) , that the landtag in schleswig-holstein has a five year term , and that ministers are appointed by the bundespraesident . 
  it was kind of a weird test - you do n't need to have any particular knowledge of germany to know what a `` rechtsstaat '' is . 
  but i studied law in germany and half of the questions seemed to be specifically legal questions - what the jugendamt does , what an arbeitsgericht is for , what art . 
  i of the gg guarantees , ( and what the name of the german constitution is ... ), 
  92 % , having never been to the uk . 
  missed the daffodil question and the flag question , got lucky with the football question ( in that i knew the answer and do n't know a lot about football ) , and guessed on a couple of the t/f questions . 
   say i have stock in money that is in theory dedicated to old age , but it legally just is your asset that can be used to pay for debt . 
  it 's described in the article as being `` retirement insurance '' , which suggests that it 's more than a pot of money in his account that he 's planning on using for retirement one day . 
  ( although of course the story 's characterization may not be 100 % accurate ) . 
  but ideally it should n't be hard to set up a retirement fund , and money in retirement funds should be exempt from seizure for debts . 
  there should probably also be some cost-of-living component built in - if there is n't already . 
   it does not take into account the inequality of income distribution the actual metric you need is median ppp income , not per capita gdp . 
  paris match ca n't decide whether the festival is `` rock en seine '' ( headline ) or `` rock en sc\u00e8ne '' ( body ) . 
  indianapolis ; same deal . 
  yes - the term is measuring * something * ; it 's just not poverty . 
  and you believe the poor do n't have that in the us ? 
  while it 's denied by people on the left in europe , and on the right in the us , the us is actually a huge welfare state , with - in the overall scheme of things - only relatively minor differences from european welfare states . 
  the us unemployment rate is lower than the rate in czechia . 
  it may be worse to be poor in the us , but if so , it 's going to be because the poor in urban areas are much more likely to be the victim of a violent crime . 
   lots of technical words have more than meaning or meanings that are debated . 
  poverty as relative deprivation is well within common usage ( e.g. 
  this article ) and the academic discourse . 
  `` relative poverty '' is n't a technical term in the way that `` serotonin uptake channel '' or even `` recession '' is . 
  it 's a term that was invented , relatively recently , by social scientists . 
  they could have called it anything , but instead deliberately chose to call it `` poverty '' because , well , we all know that poverty is bad and something we should try to end . 
  it was dishonest to call living at 60 % of the median poverty in the first place , but it 's doubling down on the dishonesty to defend the practice by pretending that it 's a `` technical term '' - suggesting that it is merely a neutral term . 
   he only thing the leaders `` did '' , is actually what they `` did n't do '' which is the fact that they did n't just turn away every asylum seeker on the suspicion that some are n't real refugees . 
  there are a lot of ways to deal with refugees other than letting them all into your country and then deciding . 
  the rest of the world evaluates refugees * before * they come into the country . 
  europe could have easily done this , too . 
  property prices are ridiculously high only in a handful of american cities . 
  relative poverty is not real poverty . 
  there 's real poverty in the us ; i do n't think anyone is denying that . 
  but it does n't start at $ 32,000 unless you live in a very high cost of living area . 
  here 's a house you can buy on that salary in my city ; there are many more .

   however , somebody with limited means will generally have a much better time if the majority of the population is in a similar position than if their suffering is extreme and unusual . 
  `` have a much better time '' is n't much of a poverty standard . 
  if that 's the standard , we should rename the `` poverty index '' the `` fun index '' . 
  relative poverty will , sometimes , point to something meaningful . 
  other times it wo n't . 
  that 's why it 's not useful as a metric - it needs to work all the time . 
  if the median income is $ 800/year , * everyone * will be in poverty and the 60 % measure is n't very useful . 
  if the median income is $ 60,000 / year , it 's * also * not very useful . 
  relative poverty is a pretty stupid measure , frankly . 
  people earning below $ 32,400 in the us are not in `` relative poverty '' , nor are they facing `` social exclusion '' . 
  in other countries , making 60 % of the median income * may * reflect some sort of social exclusion . 
  but that 's because the 60 % number is really pretty random . 
  if a country has a median income of $ 40,000 / year , a household making below $ 24,000 * may * face some sort of social exclusion - but if that 's the case , it 's more likely because of the fact that $ 24,000 is a marginal income * in an absolute sense * than because it is below 60 % of the median . 
  there is still a lot of unused housing in berlin , though : berlin used to have a much larger population . 
   the primary thing that 's good about the swedish rental market is that it 's very advantageous for renters who 're already insiders on the market , since the rent-control means low prices . 
  the problem with this is that if you are actually looking for a place to rent in stockholm , you almost always end up subletting from the actual tenant , who ends up charging you some amount above the rent-controlled price that that he is paying . 
  it is . 
  it 's just that the rents are insane . 
  even with ubi there would be a need for subsidized housing . 
  berlin was pretty much a provincial sideshow from 1945-90 , with almost all of the postwar economic growth in the west taking place in actual west germany . 
  when germany reunified , the companies in the west generally stayed where they were . 
  berlin is like a college town for adults . 
  it would be easier if there were more than six fawlty towers episodes . 
   the language is a bastardized mix of about 30 different things . 
  english is n't really as different from other languages as high school english teachers pretend it is . 
  it 's a pure germanic language with a lot of french vocabulary and a minor french influence on grammar . 
  it does n't have any latin grammar rules , and most european languages have greek ( and latin ) prefixes and suffixes . 
  i 'm surprised that germany is only 50-75 % coffee . 
   gdp per capita is `` basically '' the income per capita . 
  it 's is n't at all . 
  if a country consists of bill gates and me , the gdp per capita is going to be * way * above my actual income . 
  people like gdp per capita because it 's easy to calculate , but you need actual income figures for a real comparison . 
  right . 
  you need median income , or the [ oecd 's net-adjusted disposable household income . 
  ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/income/ ) that is basically household income minus taxes and transfers - i.e. , the part of your income you can actually spend . 
  the oecd puts ireland - in the income category - slightly below average - a few spots above spain and portugal , but well under the uk or france . 
   while europe in theirs are well past it . 
  the 20th century was not a century of european maturity . 
  maybe the 21st will be different . 
  i 'm one of the small-but-growing number of americans with a japanese toilet . 
  i do n't understand how i lived without it for so long . 
  actually , no . 
  there have been breathless news stories `` reporting '' this , but the number of americans studying in germany ( \u02dc4 ,000 ) has n't really changed much . 
   the eu should start making it more difficult for americans to travel in order to leverage our position the result would be that people from every country in the eu would need a visa to travel to the us . 
  i doubt that citizens of germany , france , or the uk would actually give up their right to visa free travel to the us and canada to support romania and bulgaria . 
  [ i suggest you not underestimate the staggering drawing power of the garden state . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/w6t7hg3r6rq?t=88 ), 
  that depends on your skillset and if you can actually find a job . 
  because of the tipping culture in the us , it 's pretty common for waiters to make $ 20/hr , and in a lot of cases this can be under the table . 
  but , yeah , if you can get a regular job in western europe , it 's going to be better than working at a polish-owned restaurant in chicago . 
  no , it is n't . 
  americans know that paris is in france . 
  even if they ca n't find it on a map . 
  probably they were saying the first thing that popped into their head about europe , since that 's where you 're from and `` i 've heard the banking is good in london '' does n't really roll from the lips . 
   says the american . 
  maybe do something about your fucked up voting situation ? 
  no , that 's not what you 're doing . 
  you are suggesting that there is some particular problem with voting security in the us that renders his pov invalid .
