  particularly since the uk would have had to consent in the first place . 
  not really . 
  why ? 
  they could capture him on the basis of an extradition request . 
  why not extradite him from the uk ? 
  that 's the question assange apologists never seem to be able to answer . 
   whether what he fears is true or not , it is justified . 
  in fact it makes no sense . 
  at all . 
  if the us wanted to extradite assange , they would have asked the uk to extradite him . 
  it 's easier to extradite people from the uk . 
  and if assange were sent to sweden on an arrest warrant , the uk would have to consent to his extradition * anyway * . 
  the whole extradition theory is just a smokescreen for assange to avoid facing rape charges in sweden . 
   there was no evidence against him , only the woman 's word against his . 
  that 's pretty good evidence . 
  no , that 's just how they hide the homicides . 
  \u00d6tzi was pushed . 
  it 's not the low murder rate that causes the anomaly ; it 's the low population . 
  even if denmark had ten times as many murders , two additional murders would still affect the rate . 
   every single mention of a separation bill for the uk was about costs directly caused by the uk . 
  this is completely wrong . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  the 50/60/100b bill is based on the theory that the uk is liable because it approved eu budgets and then left the eu . 
  french soldiers dying * in france * fighting germany . 
  i 'm pretty sure they did n't consider themselves `` dying for britain '' . 
  that is true ... although the media attention does kind of make them look like idiots . 
  and winning the oscar for `` least effective protest '' is ... the identitarian movement !, 
  edit : and they are a strong contender for the `` worst name '' award as well . 
  the headline is blatantly wrong . 
  the us has more millionaires per capita than norway , sweden , or denmark . 
  the linked article is talking about people with $ 30 million ( thirtymillionaires ? ) . 
  which is an interesting , if somewhat random , metric . 
  but none of this really has anything to do with the `` nordic model '' . 
  if you look at billionaires , hong kong , cyprus , monaco , singapore , and israel all rank above norway in the per-capita billionaire list . 
  us presidential election turnout is usually around 60 % . 
  but that 's considered a high turnout rate . 
  this is idiotic . 
  why involve sweden at all ? 
  why not just extradite him from the uk ? 
  that 's much easier - and if he were sent to sweden on an arrest warrant , that would still require the permission of the uk . 
   i 'm not convinced it 's not a political move to indite him with a crime to get him on us soil and then trial him for treason . 
  you have to be an idiot to believe this . 
  it is easier to extradite assange from the uk than from sweden . 
  also , if assange went to sweden from the uk on an eu arrest warrant , it would require the permission of * both * sweden and the uk to extradite him . 
  again , there 's no reason to bring * sweden * into this . 
  if the us wanted him , they would ... again ... just ask the uk to extradite him . 
  but the simplest explanation is simply that he did n't want to be tried for rape in sweden . 
   that 's what the secret courts are for . 
  no , the `` secret '' courts are for certain types of search warrants . 
  iirc , you can get a search warrant in nl without even going to a court at all - the prosecutor can issue one , and police officers can issue search warrants for other police officers . 
  happily , it looks like there 's some motion on this : http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/17/state-dept-is-working-to-id-erdogan-bodyguards-who-beat-up-protesters/, 
  the linked article says nothing about m\u00fcller 's wealth . 
  and its headline is simply `` matthias m\u00fcller , vw chief , is suspected of market manipulation '', 
  luckily , the uk had churchill : we shall eat d\u00f6ner on the beaches , we shall eat them on the landing grounds , we shall eat d\u00f6ner in the fields and in the streets , we shall eat them in the hills ; we shall never surrender our d\u00f6ner or our tzaziki . 
  no , it really is n't . 
  i do n't know ... i 've seen plenty of `` pressfleisch '' being sold as d\u00f6ner and advertised as such . 
  that 's * way * better than the english `` cutting off your nose to spite your face '' . 
  the damaged plane was able to land ( more more less ) safely on the water , 100 meters from land . 
  except for the co-pilot , who was killed by shrapnel , the entire crew escaped the landing and were back in italy by the following day . 
  the plane floated on the sea for about 10 minutes before sinking . 
  `` dive '' bomber . 
  the appropriate way to deal with pokemon : [ link ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/288882-state-department-spokesman-catches-reporter-playing-pokemon-go ) . 
  yeah , but 90 % of the languages on the map are dialects . 
  phone books used to do this , too , with false entries . 
   lobbying the government to enforce an artificially high barrier to entry if it 's `` artificially '' high , sure . 
  but that 's begging the question . 
  * every * requirement - from insurance to background checks to annual car inspections - raises the barrier to entry . 
  requiring some * reasonable * licensing may be quite appropriate . 
  while other types of licensure may be unreasonable ... you have to look at the specific requirements because a reflexive `` license bad '' or `` license good '' is useless . 
  in my midwestern city , uber is regulated like the private car service they are . 
  i do n't think anyone in the us ( except * maybe * uber ) buys the argument that they are actually a `` technology company '' . 
   show them the power of free open source software . 
  people have been pushing this line for 20 years . 
  people * do n't want it * . 
  does n't cover mobile internet , which may be the most important piece . 
  this mindset pretty much sums up part of the eu 's problem with tech . 
  it pay in most of europe is also pretty dismal , which ca n't help . 
   we take it for granted you do n't have net neutrality . 
   also was n't the usa strongly in favor of working out treaties behind closed doors , which was also seen as a negative by the eu citizens . 
  that 's how * all * trade agreements are worked out . 
  it 's not some us thing . 
  lenin disappeared from public life around 1922 . 
  hitler entered public consciousness with the beer hall putsch in 1923 . 
  hmmm . 
  you have to expect that on an american site , though . 
  the death penalty does n't violate art . 
  1 of the gg . 
  it violates art . 
  102 of the gg :  article 102  capital punishment is abolished . 
  it does n't , though . 
  ppp is based on common consumer expenses in a given country , like rent or food or clothing . 
  it has no effect on the ability of businesses in the country to purchase oil or steel or airplanes or any other goods or raw materials from outside the country , or non-consumer goods from inside the country . 
   it 's about the soviet union 's share of winning the war does n't get recognized ( enough ) by the west . 
  to be fair , the soviet union 's share of starting the war does n't get recognized enough by the west either . 
  except for , you know , germany declaring war on the us . 
   operation torch was only possible because of gibraltar in 1942 . 
  things were much different by 1945 . 
  it 's true that barbarossa was originally scheduled for may , although most historians doubt that germany could have met this deadline regardless of greece . 
  germany declared war on the us in december 41 . 
  i 'm not sure what definition you are using for `` allied '' , but the us and the soviet union considered themselves allies .
