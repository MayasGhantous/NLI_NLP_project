  tough talk about brexit ? 
  the exact same reaction . 
  it would be * easier * to ignore the turkish referendum . 
  but it 's more admirable to stand up and oppose it . 
  this is embarrassingly dumb . 
  ~ ~ it 's almost like ~ ~ you do n't actually know anything about the falklands war and are vilifying thatcher because you do n't like her and it was a `` war '' . 
  you do n't really solve the problem of strong leaders causing wars by surrendering to them . 
  the criticism * is * absurd . 
  some of the `` corrections '' are pointless or even stylistically worse than the original . 
  `` in connection with '' is just as good as if not better than `` regarding recent statements by '' . 
  `` following with interest '' is standard diplomatic-speak . 
  `` following carefully '' is not an improvement . 
  `` doing an '' in depth analysis is just as good as if not better than `` performing '' one . 
  whether you say `` wrong and inappropriate '' or `` inappropriate and wrong '' is a stylistic choice based on what you want to emphasize ; words that receive the most emphasis go first or last ; less important words go in the middle . 
  if you want to emphasize that the behavior was inappropriate ; it goes last ; if you want to emphasize that it was wrong , `` wrong '' goes last . 
  but which you choose depends on the writer 's intent . 
  `` and/or '' is definitely not better than `` or '' . 
  there are a * couple * of real improvements , most notably in the sentence beginning with `` indicating '' and ending with `` manipulation '' . 
  the closest equivalent is probably `` hatchet job '' ( `` a forceful or malicious verbal attack '' ) . 
  although the meaning is n't precisely identical . 
   french was the linga franca not really , although it was the language of diplomacy . 
  with german being used for science and english for business . 
  in si , the base unit is the hedon . 
  it 's equivalent to one standard orgasm . 
  yes , at least in the us : [ vacation days ] ( http://www.projecttimeoff.com/news/press-releases/americans-waste-record-setting-658-million-vacation-days ) . 
  note that the average american receives 21.9 vacation days and uses 16.2 of them . 
   on what basis exactly on the basis that they are wrong . 
  see my post above . 
  see above . 
  this is wrong . 
  i do n't know why you went to the trouble to write a big moralizing post like that and get so much wrong . 
  median personal income in the us is $ 45,000 year . 
  [ you can read about it here . ] ( https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.nr0.htm ) . 
  it 's $ 49,400 for men and $ 41,300 for women . 
  i 'm not sure how your numbers can be so off , unless you are looking at data that includes part time hs workers . 
  there is a federal law mandating maternity leave , but not mandating that it be paid . 
  i 'll see your br\u00fcckentag and raise you ** krankfeiern **, 
   but they have no maternity leave . 
  what the fuck . 
  they have no legally mandated paid maternity leave . 
  there is legally mandated unpaid maternity leave , and paid maternity leave is not uncommon . 
  just not legally required . 
   the smiles are fake it 's called politeness . 
  charred meat on a stick . 
   most of the wealth in america is concentrated in a pretty small population no . 
  median household income in the us is $ 58,000 . 
  median family income is something like $ 72,000 . 
  median , not average . 
  medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy , but the number of people filing bankruptcy is not a significant portion of the population . 
  3m is based in minnesota , which was largely settled by germans . 
  the cjc was n't a constitution . 
  it was a code of laws . 
  constitution = !, 
  codified laws . 
   it also ignores the fact that we have centuries of historical data that shows after major financial recessions , such as the 2008 collapse , countries generally do go right because people are apparently stupid and think `` hey you know what collapsed our economy ? 
  yea i want more of that . '', 
  i do n't believe this at all . 
  `` centuries '' of data ? 
  seriously ? 
  and of course the unstated premise of your post is that financial recessions are always caused by right-wing parties . 
  ( although they maybe be * mostly * caused by them ... ) . 
  what you * actually * after economic recessions are people voting for the * other * party . 
  us great depression - voted out r 's , voted in d 's ( fdr , specifically ) . 
  stagflation of the 70 's - voted out carter , voted in reagan . 
  1991 recession - voted out ghwb , voted in clinton ( `` it 's the economy , stupid '' ) . 
  2008 recession - voted out r 's , voted in obama . 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  you must be new here . 
  they do n't , though . 
  germany has a stronger economy than the uk , but that 's pretty much it . 
  consumption patterns are very different . 
  only 15 % of americans smoke , but they tend to be heavy smokers . 
  there are n't many americans who just smoke , say , 5 cigarettes per day . 
   the usa keeps claiming to be the best at everything in the world no , this is the eu . 
   in british common law , this sort of uncodified agreement which is subsequently breached by one party is called `` promissory estoppel '' . 
  you keep posting this . 
  it 's cool that you understand promissory estoppel , but it does n't apply in this case . 
  promissory estoppel applies to contracts . 
  not to acts taken by sovereign governments voting on laws . 
  a private citizen who purchases a business believing that law x wo n't change ca n't bring a suit against parliament based on promissory estoppel because parliament changed the law . 
  second , promissory estoppel requires a * promise * . 
  it would require the uk to say `` we are not leaving the eu '' ; it 's that promise that - theoretically - would estop the uk from claiming it owed nothing . 
  but there was no promise . 
  `` millions for defense , not one farthing for tribute ! '', 
  what is ( 2.2 * 10 ) -3 ? 
  people who think this are idiots . 
  and the portions were too small . . 
  and britain responds by tariffing eu goods . 
  result is both sides are hurt . 
   they have every right to be . 
  their handling of the 2008 crisis was borderline incompetent , and their unilateral decision to permit millions of migrants into europe was also not handled very well . 
   i think america criticizing germany for being arrogant is pure hypocrisy . 
  this article was not written by `` america '' . 
  while these things always seem overblown , and you are still statistically very safe , an american tourist * was * one of the four people killed in the london terrorist attack five weeks ago . 
  three americans were killed in the nice attacks 2016 , and an american tourist was also killed in the 2015 bataclan massacre in paris , ( and more were in the venue when it was attacked , including the band ) . 
  and there were some americans on the train during the thalys attack as well , of course . 
  it 's not even that . 
  in my city - and this is going to be generally true for most larger cities - 85 % of murder victims ( not perpetrators ; victims ) have a felony record , with the median number of felonies being * five * . 
  the majority of the remaining murders are domestic violence . 
  which still leaves some murders being `` stranger murders '' , mostly robberies ... but it 's less than you might suspect from the numbers .
