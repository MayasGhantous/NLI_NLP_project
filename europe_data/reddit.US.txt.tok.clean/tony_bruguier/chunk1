that 's a different rate , i think . 
  the deposit rate , not the main refinancing rate . 
  the three rates are posted there : https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html i think / u/anarquistos was talking about the main rate being negative , which is indeed , from what i understand , getting paid to borrow money . 
  you still need to build the fab , with have the mask printing , wafer exposure , development , and inspection machines in it . 
  really , printing money as debasing the currency ? 
  or `` just '' shuffling funds around ? 
  i think it 's already corrected for because the data is ppp : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity, 
  russia : ~ 6,600,000 square miles ussr : ~ 8,600,000 square miles so russia is about 77 % of what the ussr territory was . 
  also , i 'm not sure area is what matters , as some locations are more attractive than others . 
  better idea : canada expels quebec and sent them to the british isles , to be part of the eu . 
  england moved to where french canadians were and becomes part of the 51st state . 
  well , not using the internet may not work either : http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/monitoring-of-snail-mail.html?pagewanted=all, 
  some states are `` non-recourse '' , meaning that the bank can not go after your assets and income even if you can pay but just chose not to do so : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonrecourse_debt#united_states however , i 'm not sure that helps . 
  here in california , a non-recourse state , many communities have been devastated by the housing bust . 
  houses were underwater , not by a small fraction as you describe , but by 20 , 30 , or 50 % . 
  typically , `` under water '' means that the value of the real estate asset is less than the mortgage . 
  the article seems to use that interpretation . 
  well , one the physical money is introduced , it makes breaking up the euro more difficult . 
  so it 's more than symbolic , i think . 
  but how do you do that ? 
  i guess you can give the free money to the government , which in turns gives it to the unemployed ... 
  but that 's printing money to give and giving it to the government , right ? 
  from my limited understanding , it is 100 % : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_security_trust_fund `` fund is required by law to be invested in non-marketable securities issued and guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the federal government '', 
  well , is n't that the normal way to do it ? 
  it is done the same way in the united states ; the social security administration buys treasury bonds . 
  most people think that the money taken out of our paycheck is invested but it is not true . 
  it 's just an extra tax that pays for the current retirees . 
  when our generation retires , we will need the future workers to pay for us . 
  a country can not ` invest ' in its own bond . 
  since it 's not really investing , but paying as you go , the real way to invest in your retirement , even at a country level , is to make babies . 
  social security is just the same social contract as having babies that will feed you and wipe your but back when we were all farmers . 
  the only difference is the scale . 
  now , it could have bought other countries ' bonds , but until recently it would have been a whole other matter altogether because of exchange rate risk . 
  even today , there 's a risk of eurozone breakup . 
  the euro is not as irrevocable as the ecb says it is . 
  in fact , it has already broken up . 
  a euro in a bank in cyprus is n't the same as one in germany because of capital controls . 
  business in the periphery pay significantly interest rates despite using the same currency ( so much for being work shy by the way , because good luck competing with german companies if you have to pay a much higher interest rate ) . 
  long term , the prospects of germany are not as rosy as they seem . 
  they are not having babies . 
  also , if spain goes bankrupt today , their babies will not be made and the young people will leave . 
  also , there 's no social contract at the federal level in europe . 
  tldr : what else could they do ? 
  actually , the obama administration has deported more people than the previous administration : http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/27/obama-is-deporting-more-immigrants-than-bush-republicans-dont-think-thats-enough/, 
  that is incorrect . 
  the net effect of vat versus sales tax is the same , it ifs just a different way of paying the same amount . 
  well there are two . 
  one form the buba and one nominated . 
  but would n't you say bernanke or draghi have some influence too ? 
  err , i think you got it backward . 
  that 's $ 277 per capita for the uk versus $ 138 for austria, 
  to be a reserve currency , money has to leave the country , and thus you have to run a deficit , right ? 
  some states ( e.g. 
  oregon ) have no sales tax at all . 
  i knew about the swap lines opened with the ecb at the time of the crisis , but not during the launch . 
  thanks for the lesson . 
  well , the us taxpayers are on the hook through the imf , so might be seen as reasonable for the us to voice an opinion . 
  is n't there a concept of state citizenship ? 
  https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv `` all persons born or naturalized in the united states , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside . 
  no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states '' also , states are not just administrative districts : https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment `` the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . '', 
  does nato want you though ? 
  one more country to defend that joins only when times get rough ? 
  no mention of janet yellen ... 
  i believe you need to have a green card ( thus not be illegal ) to join the armed forces . 
  that map is somewhat misleading . 
  a high density area ( e.g. 
  paris ) can have a large population decrease but since it 's geographically small , the area painted in blue is small . 
  in essence , the eye will weight by area instead of weighting by current population count . 
  nevertheless , there is indeed a difference : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00002&amp;plugin=1, 
  * northern californian, 
  it could also be that people are protecting themselves from negative interest rates . 
  cash has 0 % yield , which is better than negative . 
  is there a source from a us official ? 
  i ca n't find a confirmation anywhere else . 
  how do you divide the debt ? 
  do netherlands , france , and germany inherit the burden ? 
  the us has exit control . 
  and yet , it 's the very us military that makes possible for this country to exist . 
  well , the interest rates set by the ecb were too low for ireland and spain . 
  oca etc. . . 
  anywhere in the world . 
  for example , french citizens living in the united states ( regardless of whether they are also us citizens or not ) are allowed to vote in some elections ( presidential , parliament ) but not others ( mayor , local ) . 
  that depends on the country . 
  i think at least some elections are open to us citizens living abroad . 
  france also allows overseas citizens to vote . 
  it 's been illegal for 7 years in california . 
  why are there flags upside down ? 
  nice to retire or go on vacation , not many job opportunities . 
  whether or not banks can charge a prepayment penalty depends on the state . 
  it 's not allowed in california , for example . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._john%27s_regional_medical_center_ ( missouri ) one of the hospital 's towers took a direct hit by the storm and was rotated four inches on its foundation, 
  it 's cheaper to insure and rebuild . 
  you ca n't really build tornado proof ... unless you have everything underground . 
  actually , the uk was at about the same gdp/capita as alabama or mississippi before brexit . 
  what are they going to do , kick the uk out ? 
  i think he was making fun of what is typically said at a new job orientation for a service-oriented position :  the customer is the one receiving service . 
  he is the reason for our existence and his needs come first . 
  not everywhere in california ... 
  the san fernando valley gets hot, 
  there was never a mad cow disease outbreak in europe .
