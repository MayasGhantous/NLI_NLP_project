  the traffickers take advantage of europe 's sympathy to profit from trafficking operations . 
  the profits go to fund other areas of crime like sex slavery , arms trafficking , etc. 
  the entire process is as cynical as one could imagine . 
   great , please tell that to about 2/3 of the populist right voter base on both sides of the pond as they lament over the loss of muh cozy jobs they 've last held 15 years ago because of them giddamn immigrants and outsourcing . 
  soon it will be irrelevant . 
  those menial jobs will vanish to automation , and you 'll have benefits payments to the ones ferried in . 
  as the poverty will be multigenerational , so will the benefits . 
   though saving lives at peril is still a bit different story from that one . 
  more along the lines of resuscitating the whitetrash after his meth lab explosion . 
   yeah , i see the few dots inside and the lot more outside of the greyed area . 
  everyone in this thread can see the solid mass of pink dots in the gray zone . 
  i 'll let them decide ( judging by the votes , they have )  also according to you people who were saved from unsafe situations can be put back into them because it would n't be their first time experiencing it ? 
  they left safe countries as economic migrants and entered a warzone , where they proceeded to somehow survive and trek through despite your claim they 'd die if put back on shore . 
  by that standard everyone in libya is unsafe and should be ferried to western countries . 
  hell , if you intend to allow entry to economic migrants who make themselves unsafe by entering warzones , cut out the unsafe trek and just take them directly from eritrea to europe . 
  putin murdered over 200 europeans on an airplane , illegally annexed crimea , hacks western elections to destabilize our governments , and you want to go to economic war with ** us ** to do business with ** him ** ? 
  tell me more about european solidarity . 
  if this is the path germany wishes to take , they 'll have only themselves to blame when it ends in tears . 
  if you want to keep funding a man who is attacking western democracies , who is invading his neighbors , murdering innocent dutch people by shooting down airplanes , and putting gays in gulags , then i 'm prepared to suffer a small economic hit . 
  you sell much more to us than we do to you . 
  i really do n't care whether i buy a japanese or german car . 
   they are not in libya 's waters they clearly are . 
  the grayed in area is within 24 miles from the coast , ie territorial waters . 
  use the measuring tool on google earth if you do n't believe me . 
  `` we ca n't violate territorial waters to return them ! '', 
  `` let 's sail into territorial waters to pick them up . '', 
  which is it ? 
   which part of the country would you actually consider safe to relocate people to ? 
  lmao most of these people are n't libyans . 
  how did they manage to trek all the way from , for example , eritrea and get to the coast if the country is impassibly unsafe ? 
  you 're not making sense with these arguments . 
  hey guys , they traveled through hundreds of miles of libya and lived , yet will die the moment their feet touch the shore again . 
  which is strange , since the supporters of this policy will be first to point out that you ca n't return them to libya because it violates territorial waters . 
  yet they 'll linger in territorial waters to pick them up right off the coast and ferry them to italy . 
   where did anyone of us tell you what to do or not to do ? 
  the only reason you ca n't is because these servers are in america and most of the members are n't in germany . 
  god only knows how many redditors would be charged if german law cast its shadow over this site and its members . 
   did you guys know this interesting thing called souvereignity . 
  is that why your government trying to force foreign tech companies to comply with german `` hate speech '' law ? 
  bill gates , steve ballmer , mark zuckerberg , bezos , musk all dropped out or only finished with a bachelor 's degree . 
  limiting this to graduate degrees makes no sense . 
  nuance can be disastrous when facing an implacable enemy . 
  ask neville chamberlain . 
  if you could make a plausible positive case for putin , i 'd listen . 
  but we 're well past that with ukraine . 
  it 's quite obvious he means us harm . 
  to attract real talent , the salaries need to go way up and the taxes way down . 
  also a top notch university focusing in it near venture capital firms focusing in tech . 
  10bn is n't enough imho . 
  stanford 's endowment alone is 22bn . 
  you need a lot of cash to try 100 crazy ideas before 1 succeeds . 
  what exactly is the end-game here ? 
  8.5 bn in loans on top of 315bn in debt . 
  hard to see any end to this seemingly endless debt game . 
  do they imagine that if this goes on long enough , the greeks will eventually shit gold ? 
   the washington-based fund , which co-financed greece 's first two rescue programs , held off giving the country more loans until it becomes assured that greece 's 315 billion-euro debt will become sustainable . 
  this debt will never ever be sustainable . 
  greece 's economy is smaller than kentucky 's . 
   if that new sanctions bill passes the house and ends up on trump 's desk and he does n't veto it , he ca n't . 
  a 2/3 majority overrides the veto . 
  this passed 97-2, 
  we built bases near russia to prevent invasion , like russia did in georgia and ukraine . 
  should we just pull out and allow russia to do as they please ? 
   or will they ? 
  trump 's approval ratings might be low , but a third of the country still supports him . 
  he could have a 100 % approval rating and he 'd still be limited to 8 years by the constitution . 
  the only reason he won was because his opponent was the only politician in america as unpopular as him . 
   russia is a mortal threat to most of eastern and northern europe but apparently german big businesses are willing to sell us all out for some sweet russian rubles . 
  ca n't believe this is being downvoted . 
  does / r/europe realize that putin is blatantly trying to destabilize nato/eu so that he can run his ukrainian playbook in ee ? 
  he attempted a coup in montenegro months before it joined nato . 
  he invaded ukraine before it could enter western alliances . 
  putin tipped the scales for trump after he questioned nato . 
  it could n't be more obvious what he 's doing . 
  are people not seeing this because they ca n't or because they do n't want to ? 
   usa is trying to weaken both russia and europe at the same time . 
  putin is actively trying to destabilize europe . 
  appeasement policies wo n't work . 
  the macron euphoria will end in tears . 
  it was obvious from the day he was anointed as the man to save europe despite his strange budget proposals . 
  in his mind , france is going to save 15bn here , 15bn there , 15bn way over there . 
  budgets cuts require meticulous examination , you ca n't just carve up areas of the budget using a cookie cutter in the shape of a sexy big number . 
  but if the deficit is n't cut , they 'll slide further into debt . 
  i predict protests and riots if he tries his economic or fiscal reforms . 
  this thread would have 10x the comments if it were may or erdogan doing this . 
  you missed the point . 
  since when has it become accepted to libel someone without evidence ? 
  that 's why i asked for a link , and you 've done nothing but give sarcastic or off-topic replies . 
  asking for a link to an allegation that i 've never seen before is perfectly acceptable . 
  thank you , france . 
  we did n't initiate operations in libya . 
  france and britain did , then asked for our help to complete the operation . 
  you return them with navy ships . 
  if you 're fired upon , it 's an act of war . 
  respond by firing back until they stop . 
  european lives  making libyans mad . 
  send them tissues , they have 100x more pressing matters . 
   we 're currently working on a solution lies . 
  you 're not working on any solution . 
  what is the solution to stop migrants from libya ?
