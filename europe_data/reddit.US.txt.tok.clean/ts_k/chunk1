iran might have been good . 
  you know westernisation & all that . 
  if your regime there did n't end up shooting at a square full of opposition among other mishaps . 
  thus it ended up as a failure . 
  it was n't just our regime . 
  and we did pressure it to [ democratize ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution ) and to [ stop ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=-qjgbeeolfec&amp;pg=pa119&amp;lpg=pa119&amp;dq=jimmykrasy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_o6nzeauta&amp;sig=gbpbio03ryxbu36b6e8jvplalpo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjj3fiemqjmahuouymkhrw2bxmq6aeiltac#v=onepage&amp;q=jimmykrasy&amp;f=false ) its human rights abuses . 
   you say europeans hate you & probably always will . 
  i think we do n't hate you but of the few that do dislike you they do it because of the american attitude towards war & involvement . 
  i was exaggerating . 
  what i meant in my original comment was that they think that way because they do n't understand it . 
  i 'm not saying that supporting free government is our sole objective ; i 'm saying that it 's actually a real objective , not just propaganda , and has been ever since thomas jefferson came up with the idea of an [ empire of liberty . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ) it 's an [ integral part ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifest_destiny#20th_century ) of our [ national identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ) and [ always has been ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novus_ordo_seclorum ) . 
  foreigners ( particularly europeans ) tend not to understand that . 
  supporting a dictatorship and promoting democracy are often the same thing . 
  if we support a dictatorship , that means we have influence with them , and can influence them to democratize . 
  taiwan and south korea are free countries today , because we supported dictatorships . 
  if we had n't , they would still be oppressed . 
  there are basically two ways we can bring democracy to a country : 1 . 
  hard power : toppling a dictatorship with military force ( iraq ) . 
  soft power : * supporting * a dictatorship and influencing them to democratize over time ( saudi arabia , iran , taiwan ) . 
  1 will be called imperialism , and 2 will also be called imperialism . 
  there 's no way we can support democracy without being seen as imperialists . 
  yeah , that 's typical . 
  has anyone in the comments pointed out that the ` democratically elected ' allende was actually arrested by military and national police after the supreme court of chile unanimously denounced his regime , and after the ` democratically elected ' chamber of deputies voted to call on the military to remove him and impose order ? 
   well , those empires grew mostly by conquest . 
  america was mostly built from scratch , and by poor people , `` the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . '', 
  also , those empires grew mostly by conquest . 
  america was mostly built from scratch . 
  and by poor people , `` the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . '', 
  but that was good for us . 
  i mean , the british empire . 
  there was a proper nemesis . 
  no one else ever looked [ this classy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burning_of_washington#/media/file:rear-admiral_george_cockburn_%281772-1853%29,_by_john_james_halls.jpg ) while burning down washington . 
  all we 've got these days are a bunch of ak-47-wielding , ski-mask-wearing nobodies . 
  we 've also been in south korea for 26 % of the time our country has existed . 
  it 's amazing when you think about it . 
  the past seems so long ago , but it was really only yesterday . 
  fair enough , i accept that criticism . 
  i was letting other discussions bleed into this one . 
  leaving all cultural ties aside , just the fact that you 're population-wise 20 % of the us but < 10 % of europe would seem to suggest that you 'd be more influential with one than with the other . 
  influential within and also without , since the us can actually do things , and while cameron as pm is only one voice on a committee , president cameron would control half the world 's armed forces . 
  and with the us , there 's the possibility of expansion . 
  europe will never expand . 
  but it 's not a real possibility , and i acknowledged that in my first comment . 
  the sad truth is that both countries ' populations are probably too bigoted for it to work without years of persuasion . 
  i 'd follow that man into hell . 
  saying what i would vote for is saying what i would be willing to part with for the sake of that . 
  and fine , as i said , whatever suits you . 
  but i do think you would be stronger and more british with us . 
  before condemning , does it occur to you to ask why ? 
  and could you possibly make an effort to understand why we are different in the ways that we are ? 
  25 % of canadian households own guns , and 45 % of american . 
  neither country will ever ban guns like you have , because they 're both large countries with rural areas and when you live 30 minutes from the police , you fucking ** need ** a gun . 
  now before even thinking , you 'll probably start listing gun crime statistics , etc. 
  again , do n't try to understand anything . 
  just find reasons to hate . 
  rossier is secretary of state for the foreign ministry ... edit : i see . 
  why do n't you ask me what i meant by that ? 
  no , i 'll save you the trouble . 
  if i had the choice , i 'd vote to change our constitution , our flag , our name and basically everything about us to be in the same federal union with the uk . 
  i think you 'd be stronger with us , would have greater sovereignty and would retain more of your culture than you will with the eu . 
  but , i understand . 
  you do n't want to associate yourselves with us . 
  whatever suits you . 
   your mistake what mistake would that be ? 
  um , your swiss foreign minister is in kurdistan [ right now ... ] ( http://aranews.net/2016/04/barzani-will-not-allow-extremism-terrorism-grow-kurdistan/ ), 
   `` the memory of bosnia was still fresh , and at least some progressives believed that western military force could be a force for good . 
   very few on the left believe that anymore . '', 
  [ this is everything i hate ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/11/25/rojava_is_a_radical_experiment_in_democracy_in_northern_syria_american_leftists.html ) about the american left . 
  and i 'm saying that as an american leftist . 
  not just saying that our own military is n't a force for good ... saying that it ** ca n't be ** a force for good . 
  well , yes , it 's terrible - people are dying . 
  i do n't want to suggest that 's a good thing . 
  at the same time , we probably would n't be what we are today if the british had given us our independence without a fight . 
  eh ... we 've had 30,000 troops in south korea for the past 63 years . 
  that 's 1/4 of our national life . 
  i think it 's a little self-critical to say we do n't do staying power . 
  meanwhile , your assessment of hillary provides strong evidence for my shit leader theory , so i 'm sticking with that for now . 
  well , we fought for 20 years in vietnam . 
  if bush could have just told us the real reason we needed to be there , even midway through , we would have stuck around to defend them . 
  our leaders suck . 
  those with vision are incompetent , and those who are competent have no vision . 
  do you think there 's a chance with clinton ? 
  they have a long way to go , though . 
  iraqi kurdistan will be free , but the rest of kurdistan is still in syria , turkey and iran . 
  they 're going to need a strong military tradition to survive surrounded by those neighbors . 
  and the current refugee/humanitarian crisis caused by daesh is threatening to ruin their startup economy . 
  i just hope our government ( s ) do n't abandon them . 
  there 's no doubt . 
  they 're unstoppable . 
  and even though it 's terrible , it 's almost good that they 're getting their independence this way , fighting for it . 
  future generations will look back on it with pride . 
  honestly , i love brits , and i do care about your country , but talking to those of you on reddit , i sometimes forget why . 
  hm , you might be right about that . 
  i guess context matters . 
  we never say `` part american , '' and that seemed to be what he was implying , but maybe that 's reading too much into it . 
   last time you tried , we [ burned down the white house !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burning_of_washington#white_house ) ... and then [ posed for a picture , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burning_of_washington#/media/file:rear-admiral_george_cockburn_%281772-1853%29,_by_john_james_halls.jpg ) apparently . 
  god , that 's so badass . 
  i miss the old british/canadians .
