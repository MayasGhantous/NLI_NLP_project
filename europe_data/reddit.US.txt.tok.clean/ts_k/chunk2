  you were our best nemesis . 
  off topic , but * resolute desk * sounds like a great name for a military operation . 
   the us and the uk ( or , rather , the british empire ) were hostile in 1776 and 1812 . 
  the uk could have aided the csa , but did n't . 
  no , it 's really unlikely for any more united anglosphere to develop . 
  i wish that were n't true . 
  but the sad fact is that no country in the anglosphere actually wants a united anglosphere . 
  even britain - most of you guys hate the idea of joining us americans . 
  and i 'm ashamed to say it but i think most americans would react the same . 
  it 's an idea shared by thoughtful people in both countries who see the benefits , but the great majority would be against the compromises necessary to make it happen . 
  it would take years of persuasion to convince them . 
  it 's something trump says . 
  just means energetic , dynamic , etc. 
  oh god , that 's terrifying . 
  to think she 's going to be under fbi investigation during the general campaign . . 
  let 's dispel this notion that boris johnson does n't know what he 's doing . 
  =p ehh , i 'll take your word for it . 
  if you think you could do a better job of policing the world , then get out and start doing it . 
  countries like iraq , saudi arabia and pakistan only exist because of the european nations who created them and then abandoned all responsibility for making them work . 
  forget it . 
  counterfeit pride from the spectators of history . 
  if someone from mississippi had said it , my reaction would have been ten times as harsh . 
  but johnson is british , and brits do n't have exactly the same ideas about national identity that americans ( or other inhabitants of the new world ) have . 
  there 's no `` american '' ethnicity , unlike english or scottish , so the idea of being `` part american '' is a lot more offensive to us , because it implies a kind of ethnic nationalism that 's outside our political experience . 
  but to someone from an actual nation-state , it can be much more innocent . 
  because they do n't have millions of undocumented immigrants in their country . 
  and only 0.6 % of canadians are hispanic and 2 % are black . 
  edit : eh , but really , you 're right , they can teach us things . 
  i think all us anglo countries are good examples to each other . 
   meanwhile , some of the most pro-american countries in the world now-a-days are vietnam , japan & the philippines ... all of whom we have either invaded , nuked or colonized brutally ... and all of which are oriental & could n't be father from us culturally ... because those countries understand us . 
  sadly , they understand us better than canadians do . 
  and actually , they 're a lot like us in some ways . 
  vietnamese and their amazing love of country and dedication , for example . 
  it 's ridiculous to even talk about warnings or threats from the united states . 
  we would n't tolerate a government that was n't friendly to britain . 
  no kidding . 
  i feel insulted myself . 
  if only that could happen . 
  it was the word `` part '' that seemed racist . 
  implying you ca n't be entirely american if your father was kenyan , or if you yourself are kenyan . 
  but it 's a very minor example of the kind of prejudice everyone has and not worth being upset over . 
   let 's rename this thing as `` another union of states '' ( aus ) and we 'll be fine . 
  it 's super important to have the three-letter abbreviation , so you can chant it really loud and obnoxiously . 
  how could they not ? 
  it was even in that mel gibson movie . 
   in europe we are mostly facing the world with enlightenment ... and considering yourselves the most enlightened people in the world [ is different ] ( http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/does-europes-arrogance-blind-it-to-asia/?_r=0 ) from the way europeans have , historically , behaved . 
  what country are you from ? 
  looks like norway ? 
  so yeah , it was america , was n't it ? 
  200 years later , are you ready to join us in the wider effort ? 
   putting citizens with japanese ancestors into concentration camps ? 
  right , because no european country has ever done anything like that , have they ? 
   by fucking blacks and chinese for at least 200 years or that ? 
   lots of dictatorships which were supported by the us ? 
  you know , i 'm really amazed sometimes at how simplistically europeans view the world outside your continent . 
  taiwan is a free country now when the rest of china is n't , ** because ** we supported a dictatorship . 
  we supported them , and while supporting them , we pressured them to democratize . 
  that 's how it works . 
  you might realize this if you had any history of spreading democracy to other countries . 
  look back through history at how modern democracy actually spread to your country and tell me if you do n't find the united states at the heart of it . 
  temporarily ? 
  not going to lie , i feel a bit jealous after reading that . 
  he does ? 
  wow , that 's nice . 
   isis controlled it for a long time , so we could n't really do anything . 
  we could launch precision airstrikes on the outlying positions , and then go in with peshmerga and iraqi army special forces to kill the remaining isis fighters and secure the dam . 
  ... which is what we did . 
  btw , peshmerga means `` ones who face death . '', 
  that 's what the kurds have been calling their soldiers , while they 've been fighting all these years for freedom . 
  thank god the engineers have arrived . 
  i hope they can prevent a catastrophe . 
  i do n't think it 's acceptable , but the question was , `` would that drive you insane ? '', 
  i think not , under these conditions . 
  yeah , you 're missing something : the republican states are the old slave-owning states in the south , and also the closest to mexico , and for those reasons are ( ironically ) the most diverse states , with some being 30-40 % black and others having very high hispanic populations . 
  the unfortunate fact that those groups tend to be less advantaged is what brings down the statistics of those states . 
  this is also part of what makes it difficult to address problems associated with inequality nationally , because our federal system does n't allow those of us in other states to meddle in their affairs . 
  however , this discussion . . xd ** facepalm **, 
  because there 's no such thing as international law , and they know that , just like we do . 
  the only law is force . 
  i feel such sympathy for russians . 
  they just want to regain what they 've lost . 
  i know how we 'd feel . 
  damn it , though , what can we do ? 
  your government wants us to let it steal part of another country . 
  if he 's never getting out , he honestly might as well die , since you 've taken his life away and deprived him of any real hope for another . 
  i say that as someone opposed to the death penalty . 
  he does deserve it . 
  and plenty of people deserve far worse . 
  but the law ca n't give people what they actually deserve . 
  there 's also the well-meaning but foolish `` zero tolerance '' and `` three-strike '' policies some states have adopted , and the growing privatized prison sector . 
  but sure , attribute it to a backward mentality if it suits you . 
  i do n't think so , if i was reading , watching tv , playing games , etc. 
  those things all distract from the solitude and even simulate human contact to some extent . 
  that 's a good point . 
  i would n't even call it solitary confinement if he 's having conversations with someone . 
  the torture of solitary confinement results from the actual solitude . 
   this is america in a nutshell . 
  the society there is a mess because they let moralist manipulate people into supporting drastic changes . 
  i guess this will suffice if you prefer simplistic views of other countries . 
  ... but the truth is that america has been a constitutional republic with a very strong emphasis on civil liberties for 240 years , and as a federation of 50 sovereign republics is actually very stable and * averse * to drastic changes .
