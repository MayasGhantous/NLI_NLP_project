this paranoia that the baltic states have over this supposed russian aggression is both hilarious and sad . 
  yes , nothing at all to worry [ about from history on this matter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) , except the hundreds of thousands murdered through ethnic cleansing and following revolts . 
  nato also was talking about russia joining one day . 
  also , the baltics and ex-eastern bloc countries are n't bargaining chips to be dealt - they have their own agency and choices to make . 
  i do n't think its because they consider russia to fit their ideals , but that russia stands opposed to the west in their minds . 
  orwell wrote about this . 
   [ there is a minority of intellectual pacifists , whose real though unacknowledged motive appears to be hatred of western democracy and admiration for totalitarianism . 
  pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that one side is as bad as the other , but if one looks closely at the writing of the younger intellectual pacifists , one finds that they do not by any means express impartial disapproval but are directed almost entirely against britain and the united states ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20280-the-majority-of-pacifists-either-belong-to-obscure-religious-sects ) the anti west contrarians will often seem to support regimes like russia , iran , syria , and china and lap up the propaganda that are pumped out by these places . 
  this propaganda usually has little half-truths too , the west has an inequality problem , the west has racial problems , the west is too reliant on technology . 
   he still thinks that we should respect russia 's sphere of influence rather than deny them it in order make russia feel better that it 's not a superpower anymore . 
  this never works , it only emboldens the hawks . 
  more whataboutism . 
  most big powers do n't go in and commit mass murder against doctors , engineers , officers , lawyers , and anyone else that can stand up to them . 
   for example , regarding the range of russia 's aa missile batteries stealth capabilities would be a plus over here but not as much over sweden . 
  this is a * huge * point , finland is under the umbrella of russian s-400s and the f-35 is designed to kill them . 
  fly away costs for f-35s are also predicted to be [ lower than the gripen ng by 2020 ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/2013/12/lockheed-boasts-f-35-will-cost-less-than-any-4th-gen-fighter/ ) , but it might make more sense to for finland to integrate more tightly with sweden , and save on costs that way . 
   finland needs a capable but cost-effective airplane such as the gripen jas 39 e/f or further developed versions , not some insanely costly airplane that only the us and countries with much higher budgets can afford to buy and maintain . 
  f-35as will have a [ lower fly away cost than gripen ng ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/2013/12/lockheed-boasts-f-35-will-cost-less-than-any-4th-gen-fighter/ ) . 
   by 2019 , the f-35a ( the air force version ) will cost $ 75 million a copy in current dollars ( $ 85 million in good ole then-year dollars , i.e. 
  counting future inflation ) , which will be `` less than any fourth generation fighter in the world . '' that means no other fighter already flying ( one sold in us dollars or euros ) will cost less -- not the famously inexpensive gripen , not the french rafale , the russian mig-35 , the boeing f-15 eagle , or the european typhoon . 
  of course china does , they are worried about their own provinces . 
  china does n't really have too many allies ( except the dprk ) , only business partners . 
  another key part , sow confusion and whataboutism in the media and online ( ahem ) so that your useful idiots delay things just long enough to water down any response . 
  this has been the playbook for 90 years . 
  the polish soviet war was one of the worst defeats ever for the red army , up there with the loss to japan earlier in the century . 
  a lot of people remember . 
  while you have a point , it is also priced into the cost of doing business in a place where rule of law is n't as strong . 
  having the ability to establish contracts in countries like germany or the uk makes everyone better off . 
   this situation is ideal for china because it will force the us to commit its military capital outside of the pacific theater . 
  you 're probably right , but us allies in the pacific are heavily beefing up their own defenses . 
  japan is launching new carriers and submarines , south korea , japan , and australia are modernizing their air forces with f-35s , india is developing the pak-fa with russia , and even vietnam is purchasing kilo attack subs . 
   and it 's not like usa is much better - you wo n't get away with attacking someone , but there is much higher probability of getting shot by random mad people . 
  and do you think us standards of living are much better for illegal immigrants from mexico ? 
  nice whataboutism . 
  i was n't talking about anywhere else in the world , but what this story says . 
  if there is no proof that it is propaganda , then the claim that it is propaganda is bullshit . 
  nothing about the eu , iraq , mexican immigrants changes any of that . 
  as to your claims about illegals in the us and murder rates , i 'm pretty sure you 've never been to the us if you are making these claims . 
  the homicide rate [ is half that of russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) and there are n't widespread , racially motivated crimes against illegal immigrants . 
  in fact the us has more tolerant views than the majority of europe , according to two [ swedish economists ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/ ) . 
  you need to get out more and stop getting your information from reddit . 
  this attitude sickens me , because you base this off of nothing but your apparently enlightened cynicism . 
  do you have any proof that this is propaganda ? 
  maybe you have proof that stories are fake or that the aid organizations are lying , because its not like racism in the world is really that hard of stretch . 
  its like people calling reports of isis mutilation propaganda , because its so fucking hard to believe that fanatics would do something like that . 
  they use a reflexive cynicism to shortcut having to actually think about the world . 
  our media would jump at it , there would be stories that the president has lost it and had a mini meltdown . 
  the opposition would jump on this a chance to show that he has lost his cool and that the pressure of the job is getting to him . 
  people would talk about the lack of respect for the office and lack of professionalism , it would be a media circus . 
  what job losses ? 
  the unemployment rate dropped [ a further 2 percentage points ] ( http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/unrate ) after nafta was signed , and [ full time employment rose by 20 million ] ( http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/lns12500000 ) people after nafta until the recession . 
  this is correlative , and not necessarily causative , but there sure as hell were n't massive job losses . 
  no decalogue ? 
  this is extremely unlikely unless the country collapses . 
  the russian 's are as wary as anyone about the risks in some extremist group getting its hands on weapons that could threaten them . 
  poland , czech republic , and slovakia also saw massive gains in gdp/capita . 
   where do you see failed politics ? 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  [ the gdp per capita of the gdr was less than half that of the west ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/west-east-germany-split ) around the time of reunification . 
  [ i 've taken the former warsaw pact countries and graphed them by gdp per capita since 1990 ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:ukr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:ukr:svk:blr:cze&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  its pretty clear to see that the ones integrating more with the west did better ( poland , czech republic , slovakia ) did better than those that did n't , even if they start from a similar baseline . 
   i would say that currently , capitalism is failing eastern germany . 
  gdp [ per capita has doubled since 1990 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/west-east-germany-split ) , the west has had it increase by 50 % . 
  if twice as much money is failure then sign me up . 
  the question is how much growth does china need to keep that newly empowered middle class happy . 
  its amazing what lingering effects failed policies can have , even after so long . 
  also the us has n't tried to ethnically cleanse or starve out canadians or australians . 
  that helps . 
  there are a ton of things great about russia . 
  * russian artists , including some of the best writers in the world . 
  dostoevsky translated into english is much , much better and clearer english than i could ever hope to write . 
  i can only imagine what the original must be like . 
  * great inventors , scientists , engineers . 
  from the periodic table , inventing the theory of modern rocketry ( and phenomenal successes later in applying it ) , to some of the best math minds in the world * russian food is awesome , pierogi are awesome ( though i understand there is some difference between cultures on what these actually are ) * very lively culture its a shame that relations are so bad , it would be at the top of my list to visit ( especially st. petersburg ) . 
  i think a great and inventive people are being ill-served by their leadership and it is holding the country back . 
  one thing that has surprised me about this whole thing is how belarussian politicians have offered some of the harshest criticism to putin . 
  in my mind they were in lockstep with the kremlin , but at least a couple of people are n't . 
   i would argue that if not the fact communist poland was basically robbed and stopped from developing by soviet union , the communism itself would n't be so crippling , as you can see today its not like the former [ ussr itself was doing so well ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:ukr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  the entire east was stagnant . 
  the same exact thing happened with china when they reformed their market and stopped ( most ) central planning . 
  i 'm pretty pro free trade , especially between equally developed regions like the us-eu . 
  to me , this seems little different from trade between us states or between schengen zone countries . 
  i understand the worries over internet controls or ip , but i suspect these are currently much closer than people think already . 
   ukraine never left russian sphere of influence right , and poland did and started following the west . 
   i suggest you to watch this . 
  you can always say `` oh but their salaries grew so it 's ok '' but they grew compared to what ? 
  what do you mean , `` compared to what '' ? 
  compared to what they were . 
   because somehow wealth gap is getting wider and wider . 
  you were n't arguing this . 
  you said '' rising prices with no rising salaries '' . 
  that is complete bullshit and my link showing every income percentile from 1980-2010 showed that . 
  this same exact inequality effect btw is happening in sweden , canada , norway , the netherlands , france , and the uk . 
   the wise thing would be to leave that energy in the ground as a hedge against possible future needs i 'm not convinced that this will work even in theory , but in practice would seem impossible as a realistic goal . 
  the quickest way to a renewable future will be when they are truly cheaper than the price of fossil fuels at some point . 
  a carbon tax is an excellent way to get there , but getting past peak oil will also naturally push the world in this direction . 
  collapsing growth ( which is what your plan would do ) will , i think , delay the moment when a true shift can happen . 
  some [ $ 2.1 million poles live abroad ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/11/poland-and-eu ) , which is about 5 % of the population . 
  i do n't know if it makes that much of a difference , but i have trouble seeing how this negates the huge leaps in gdp that poland has made . 
   lol dude , like ... until 1990 poland was effectively under soviet occupation , everything after that did n't include that would give growth just like ukraine right ?
