  no , ukrainian gdp doubled and [ polish gdp jumped more than 6 times ] ( http://i0.wp.com/armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gdp-poland-ukraine.jpg ) . 
   look at your country and look what reagan 's reforms brought , rising prices with no rising salaries , this is flat out bs , and i did n't really like reagan . 
  us take home income after tax dramatically rose [ for almost every income decile ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html ) , is still one of the highest in the world at the median , and is doing * really * well for the half of the country over the median . 
  as far as prices , inflation has been [ astonishingly low ] ( http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/ ) for the last 30 years . 
  there is actually some question whether machiavelli believed everything he wrote in the prince or if it was more to placate the medicis . 
  he probably actually believed in more of a republic , like what he writes about in discourses on livy . 
  the prince was meant more for principalities , but was an important work for helping define the concept of the state and state sovereignty . 
  the trouble with germany and sweden 's armed forces aside , there are some very capable militaries in the eu . 
  france is probably the strongest , and the uk , italy , and the netherlands are up there as well . 
  the one issue would be coordination , but it is one that can be resolved . 
  i think people overstate the capability of russia 's forces as well . 
  they are massively modernizing now , but have no where near the ability to project power that the ussr once did . 
   neoliberal bullshit that actually have put those countries in bad spot in the first place like it did in poland , [ oh wait ] ( http://www.efic.gov.au/country/countryprofiles/publishingimages/country-profile-poland-may-2012-chart07.png ) . 
  this is good news for us , but i hope that it is still coupled with a continued push towards renewables and energy conservation . 
  its amazing really . 
  its like a list of talking points that are endless parroted against the west , each with a tiny sliver of truth but blown out of all proportion . 
  - the west has poor people , it should n't criticize russia 's 3 times lower median income - the west has surveillance , it should n't criticize russia 's information block - the west has had some bone-headed wars , it should n't criticize russia annexing neighbors - modern finance/capitalism are soulless and destroy sense of community - the west is decadent and corrupt , never mind that russia has massive drug problems, 
  i do n't think it will come to that , the trustworthiness of nato rests on article 5 being upheld . 
  its somewhat different than defense treaties in the past , and the public in many of the larger nato countries would be incensed by any overt cross-border attack . 
  a far more likely scenario is a little green men attack , similar to ukraine , where you have 1 ) manufacturing of some sort of casus belli 2 ) partner with local separatists and 3 ) flood the place with troops on `` vacation '' . 
  this is all followed with massive propaganda and whataboutism , to sow just enough discontent/confusion to delay any response from allied nations . 
  if it becomes latvian vs. latvian , who do you attack then ? 
  the best solution is a quick response force and also more of a permanent allied presence with a more integrated command and information structure to identify possible attacks . 
  wwii did not get the us out of the depression , that is a myth . 
  [ us gdp started growing again in 1932 and unemployment started falling again in ~ 1934 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_depression ) , and aside from one recession inside of a depression from ill-timed austerity , would continue that way . 
  floating the dollar off of gold and the new deal got the us out of the depression . 
   the removal of old elites has not started yet , but that 's the next logical step this part is extremely chilling and reflects power consolidation in many previous regimes throughout history . 
  he was a pretty big critic of the west and liberalism as well as communism , so it makes sense . 
  to add to this , two good books to read are : [ gulag archipeligo - aleksandr solzhenitsyn ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-gulag-archipelago-abridged-investigation/dp/0061253804 ) [ bloodlands : europe between hitler and stalin - timothy snyder ] ( http://www.amazon.com/bloodlands-europe-between-hitler-stalin/dp/0465031471 ), 
  i have n't seen very much outright hostility to americans at least . 
  i think what is in common with us far outweighs our differences in most european nations ( except uber , wow does this sub hate it . ), 
  what is the soldier doing in the picture ? 
  it looks like he is trying to do the splits . 
  gmos . 
  this always gets difficult because of definitions , but many european systems to me with aspects of socialist systems would be better called social democracies and not socialist . 
  socialism implies the state or workers own the means of production . 
  the us is really similar in many aspects , though a bit to the right on the political spectrum . 
   why dont write communist regime this would be more of a classless , stateless society which i would argue the gdr probably was n't . 
  stalinist becomes problematic too because even the soviet system was vastly different from the 1950s to the 1980s , to say nothing of the gdr . 
  done . 
  i do n't watch any . 
  anyway , its hard to grapple with something from an academic study , so i 've quoted the important text . 
   the authors found that , on average , those who had east german roots cheated twice as much as those who had grown up in west germany under capitalism . 
  they also looked at how much time people had spent in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall . 
  the longer the participants had been exposed to socialism , the greater the likelihood that they would claim improbable numbers of high rolls . 
  what 's the other version ? 
  where there were n't mass arrests , tortures , murders , and ethnic cleansings ? 
  there was a study done by a german and american team looking at economic dishonesty by people raised in east and west germany that [ found lower trust and honesty in personal dealings by people raised in the east ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21607830-more-people-are-exposed-socialism-worse-they-behave-lying-commies ) . 
  it seems that socialism had a lasting effect even between similar groups of people . 
   china is no different from any other investor . 
  although it is being said that chinese investors are being given priority , they also understand that they can not risk deals with a partner that could confiscate their property when things go wrong . 
  this is a no brainer and should be required reading for a lot of putinbots who claim that russian-chinese gas deals herald a new order . 
  no they do n't . 
  the chinese have n't built up an economy that rivals anything in the west in scale or increasingly sophistication by being soft or stupid . 
  they know who their largest markets are and they also know when they are in a position of power . 
  its a shame , because istanbul is such a beautiful city . 
  hopefully turkey can change course away from the extremist trend its been on lately . 
  in the past the military would get involved , i wonder if it will come to that ? 
  i 'm also baffled that you can bring weapons into an open environment and not get the ever loving piss beat out of you by cops . 
  huh . 
  poland is considering both and has held off future f16 purchases . 
   entering civil war unprepared with an archaic army of misfits , being moments away from being gadafi 'd by murica/france/uk this was n't really similar . 
  [ its a proxy shiite-sunni war between iran and saudi arabia ( also turkey ) ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/2014/10/how-to-defeat-isil-the-governance-problem/ ) . 
  that then spread in the power vacuum post gulf war . 
  there were 4 recessions [ during the 1890s . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_recessions_in_the_united_states ) there were as many years in recession as not . 
  except deflation leads to a spiral where output slows as people and businesses hold off purchases because prices are falling . 
  its a disaster wherever it has historically happened . 
  poland is still choosing between a french system or us patriot missiles . 
  you should n't take imaginary points on a website so seriously . 
   for one , after neville chamberlain 's `` peace in our time '' deal with hitler collapsed in 1939 , britain and france pledged to protect the integrity of the polish state but the promise evaporated when germany invaded on september 1 of that year . 
  not exactly fair , britain started fighting because of the invasion and i think wwii germany is very different from putin 's russia . 
  also , there is very little appetite for appeasement by any nation with a military capable of coming to poland 's aid . 
  before only churchill was the only big name vocal about it , now there are a chorus of ex cold warriors ( some of them slightly off ) that are very loud about what is happening in eastern europe . 
  it makes you wonder what could have been if russia had decided to integrate more fully and to rely on all of the brilliant people that country has produced in engineering , science , math , and the arts . 
  google is another prime example . 
  instead they have turned inward again and their best and brightest leave . 
  the [ sm-3 blockiia has a range ~ 2500km ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rim-161_standard_missile_3 ) . 
  this will put a lot of russian territory under a missile/aircraft umbrella . 
  being a khmer rouge apologist and cambodian genocide denialist will do that . 
  there should be a reformulation of poe 's law for russia . 
  kurds are n't arabs [ but a different ethnic group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurds ) . 
  this lasted a few years , on a much smaller scale , until the army and eisenhower administration [ pushed back in the army-mcarthy hearings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_n._welch ) . 
  the army 's attorney , joseph welch said in 1954 at a hearing . 
   senator , may we not drop this ? 
  we know he belonged to the lawyers guild . 
  let us not assassinate this lad further , senator . 
  you 've done enough . 
  have you no sense of decency , sir ? 
  at long last , have you left no sense of decency ? ... 
  mr. mccarthy , i will not discuss this further with you . 
  you have sat within six feet of me and could have asked me about fred fisher . 
  you have seen fit to bring it out . 
  and if there is a god in heaven it will do neither you nor your cause any good . 
  i will not discuss it further . 
  i will not ask mr. cohn any more questions . 
   in fact , for 50 years , the poles did n't surrender . 
  this is a pretty astonishing fact , even when its allies ( including sadly the us ) abandoned it . 
  i really wish that this article had a little more substance though , because there are a lot of areas that could have led to good discussion . 
  * the highest economic growth among all former eastern blocs , and one of the few european countries that grew throughout the recession .
