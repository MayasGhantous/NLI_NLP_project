  * military importance in the east of europe , a strong poland is a lynchpin to any plans made by nato * diplomatic importance between europe 's largest economy and europe 's largest source of energy . 
   i had tears in my eyes , and i have n't even read norman davies and edward gibbons yet . 
  if this is all it takes , she should absolutely stay away from timothy snyder 's bloodlands . 
  that 's a good point , i do n't know if a full ballistic missile launch would be the response . 
  but i do know the world community would make russia an absolute pariah and it would launch one of the largest wars in history . 
  the ultimate result would have to be regime change . 
  there is n't that much of a choice to be made . 
  game theorists worked out the response in the 60s . 
  any detection of a large number of rockets on a ballistic trajectory wo n't need a debate or committees . 
  the president , stratcom , secretary of defense and a few other higher ups will have minutes to determine what is happening and what the response is . 
  it will seem almost automatic . 
  this same playbook is used by a lot of commenters on reddit it seems . 
  these could be straight lifted from a lot of posts on / r/worldnews . 
  the whole system in spain is set up to keep older , entrenched insiders protected and the younger , less well connected on the outside . 
  the iraq invasion was n't a response to 911 . 
  it was in response to claims that iraq had wmds and refused to show that they did n't . 
  that is true , but there are two points to remember . 
  1 ) russia is n't as coordinated as poland is likely to be ( look at chechnya ) and 2 ) a full scale invasion is very unlikely and threatens nuclear war . 
  more likely are subversive ukraine style invasions relying on politics and propaganda on gullible westerners . 
  poland only needs enough credible capability to punch an invader in the nose and dissuade them . 
  south korea , japan , tiawan , and vietnam share a similar calculus . 
   also , for every nation on your list there 's another on the pew listing with an opposite opinion . 
  there is n't , there are maybe a handful on the list with negative overall opinions . 
   when global economic conditions turn towards se asia , latin america , and africa , they 're going to remember who has been robbing them of resources and interfering in their internal affairs . 
  or will they remember how they [ massively benefitted from the current world order , lifting hundreds of millions out of back breaking poverty ? ] ( http://ourworldindata.org/roser/presentation/online/decreasingworldhungerandimprovingfoodprovision/decreasingworldhungerandimprovingfoodprovision.html#/kcalcapitaday-by-world-regions-mg-png ) . 
   they 're already assembling a competitor to your world bank and imf to break your power over their financial future . 
  the imf is n't a major part of the financial system , its is a development bank . 
  [ out of the 5 brics , only china has n't experienced a major slowdown in growth ] ( http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2014/02/10/emerging-market-economies-are-headed-for-a-slowdown ) , i am not sure that this new brics bank will do that much if these economies ca n't grow ( which i think is a shame , it would be good for the world to have more growth ) . 
  its because we 're war obsessed . 
  ( not really , i like planes and really have only casual knowledge ) . 
  you might check out / r/credibledefense for the thoughts of some of these systems from people with real world defense experience and much more knowledge than i have , including things like strategy . 
  poland has been massively modernizing their military recently . 
  48 f-16 block 52 , jassm long range low observable cruise missiles , 128 or so mark 4a leopards from germany , plans for 128 mark 5s , plans for a french or us sam system , plans for either tranche 3b eurofighter typhoons or f-35s , two extremely capable aircraft . 
  i 'm not saying poland would win , it would n't , but they have massively increased the cost , effort , and time required for a successful invasion . 
  you mean the [ overwhelmingly positive view of the us in these places ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/ ) ? 
  favorability ratings are pretty high : uganda , venezuela - 62 % favorable , mexico -63 % , colombia-64 % , brazil , peru-65 % , south africa - 68 % , nigeria - 69 % , nicaragua - 71 % , chile - 72 % , tanzania - 75 % , ghana - 77 % , el salvador , kenya - 80 % . 
  its amazingly prescient how george orwell wrote about this over 60 years ago . 
   [ pacifist activities are not permitted in those countries ( in both of them the penalty is , or can be , beheading ) while both the germans and the japanese do all they can to encourage the spread of pacifism in british and american territories . 
  the germans even run a spurious ` freedom ' station which serves out pacifist propaganda indistinguishable from that of the p.p.u. 
  they would stimulate pacifism in russia as well if they could , but in that case they have tougher babies to deal with . 
  in so far as it takes effect at all , pacifist propaganda can only be effective against those countries where a certain amount of freedom of speech is still permitted ; in other words it is helpful to totalitarianism ] ( http://bennorton.com/george-orwell-on-pacifism/ ) . 
  case in point - many subreddits on this site . 
  also the key is to do this to countries you invade so they ca n't organize a resistance . 
  see the soviet co-invasion of poland with the nazis during wwii . 
  was n't one of the issues brought up during the estates general prior to the revolution about the rights of common people to have guns ? 
  it seems to me the french have long considered it important . 
  when was it tried , do you mean before the recession ? 
  that is the time to pare down debts and save . 
  it was ethnic cleansing by the ussr after and at the end of wwii that resulted in these people being in the baltics , it also was when over 100,000 of latvians , lithuanians , and estonians died . 
  but two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  i may have misunderstood the french system , i thought that grandes \u00e9coles are essentially universities ? 
  but what i do know is that getting into them is incredibly difficult for people of more modest means . 
  as far as research , france has world leading centers at the marie curie , pasteur institute , and also at grenoble . 
  so i agree that looking just at universities sells france short . 
  there have been protests in moscow , but not quite on the same scale . 
  ethnic cleansing is also forced relocation , and morally unjust where and when ever it takes place . 
  i have the link above somewhere , on average a public us 4-year will cost $ 6400 in tuition after financial aid . 
  that 's entirely manageable , and even less if your family makes less money . 
  2-year universities wind up being no cost . 
  their based on knowledge creation , which is one of the core missions of a university . 
  us college completion rates are still [ higher than most european countries ] ( http://www.oecd.org/edu/united%20states%20_eag2013%20country%20note.pdf ) . 
  and 52 of the top 100 on the arwu rankings are in the us , which means the quality is pretty spread out . 
  more taxes will , but more taxes is another form of austerity . 
  i 'm in favor of massive debt fueled spending . 
   the charts are heavily biased towards the anglo-saxon university/research model . 
  as compared to what ? 
  it counts scientific output as published in international journals . 
   what about the fact a large part of german research happens at fraunhofer institutes ? 
  in my field these are n't as productive as the max planck institutes , which are scientific powerhouses . 
  but you are right , i would anticipate that one or more of these would make the top 10 or 20 list on arwu and the german system relies on these heavily . 
  that is around the $ 1600 per year that us public 4-year universities cost on [ average after financial aid ] ( http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/q-a-the-real-cost-of-college/ ) . 
  even the 26th highest ranked us school is higher than any non-swiss in continental europe . 
  good , you do n't cut your way out of a fiscal hole but grow out of it . 
  i know it will be an unpopular opinion , but there are downsides to this approach . 
  one is that universities can become stagnant , especially in terms of their other missions ( knowledge generation , innovation , training ) . 
  there is a reason why research heavy rankings such as arwu are dominated by countries ( uk , us , switzerland ) that allow universities to charge what they are worth . 
  [ 19 of the top 20 are from the uk or us ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/arwu2014.html ) , the other is swiss . 
  the highest another european country comes is 35 . 
  another point is that this is a wealth transfer from the less well educated ( and likely poorer ) to those with better education . 
  why should farmers subsidize bankers and doctors ? 
  i think because germany wants wants to join the security council , which i think it eventually should . 
  you ca n't credibly be one if you have trouble launching a few typhoons to protect your airspace . 
   they would simply go on producing with it , ignoring your attempts to own it in the private property sense right , and if they do n't ? 
  what if they decide its in their best interest to keep working for someone else ? 
  what if this leads to a power asymmetry between this factory and all the others , where it does become coercive ? 
  i 'm classically liberal , but some might call my views ( pro-trade , pro-immigration , limited government , social freedom ) neoliberal . 
  i do n't call myself that , because technically neoliberalism was a [ separate system that came later ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_liberalism ) and is much more hostile to government than i am . 
  corporations agree to become publicly traded to raise capital and grow their business . 
  i 'm not seeing how euro-renminbi exchange would have anything at all to do with this . 
  i get the distinction , my point was how do you prevent `` private '' property and allow `` personal '' property ? 
  do you have a property police that go around making sure no one makes money off of their property ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i think both systems are bad , but it seems that their anarchy has fewer restrictions that you must enforce than yours . 
  he/she 's actually got a point . 
  it seems their anarchy is more anarchical than yours , how do you enforce the absence of private property for commercial gain in an anarchy ? 
  finance and insurance make up about [ 10 % of the us economy ] ( http://selectusa.commerce.gov/industry-snapshots/financial-services-industry-united-states ) . 
  about 7 % of that is foreign finance exports , meaning that 0.7 % could conceivably be affected by this , which it wo n't be . 
  new york is n't as important as london or hong kong internationally , but still does get a lot of active international work , like the alibaba ipo . 
  china has already had one quarter of its [ foreign exchange reserves in euro 's ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4768bd3c-c461-11e3-8dd4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3epastckt ) . 
  so being communicative , gaining experience , and flexible are bad attributes ? 
  violence and bigotry have never been lower , precisely because trade and working with people have become so important .
