  its curious why finland has n't joined already , but makes sense why they are cautious . 
  the entire country is in range of and covered by the russian s-400 surface to air missile envelope , and they are vulnerable to the likely fleet of russian kilo 's that circle them . 
  it would be difficult for finland in any conceivable military encounter . 
  i do n't blame finland for the cautious approach , but still think it should be a finnish decision and not decided by outside forces or threats . 
  the european union is n't a defense union , i am not sure that it would be considered an act of war against it ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.ploughshares.org/world-nuclear-stockpile-report ) , just named different . 
  do you think that both sides pointed these missiles in another direction after the collapse of the ussr ? 
  you were implying an equivalence when you responded to  why should russia get to set theirs in reality , countries in military and economic alliances with the us are extremely prosperous and safe . 
  what is one recent policy decision the us has forced on a nato member ? 
  after financial aid , the average price of [ 4-year us public universities is $ 1600 per year and private $ 11,900 ] ( http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/q-a-the-real-cost-of-college/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 ) . 
  2-year universities average out to be free . 
  [ average tuition at american 4-year private universities is $ 1600 per year ] ( http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/q-a-the-real-cost-of-college/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 ) , at private it is $ 11,900 , after financial aid . 
  i know this will be an unpopular opinion , but the tuition money does contribute to these universities quality , at least in terms of innovation , research , and gaining student experience that can come from them . 
  its no mystery that based on a research heavy metric , [ 19 of the top 20 universities ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/arwu2014.html ) in the world are from the uk or usa . 
  how is this even a question ? 
  you 're unfamiliar with the cold war and what an attack would entail ? 
  [ that is simply not true . ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-amiddle-class-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?referrer=&amp;_r=0 ) . 
  canada has had median incomes skyrocket and surpass nearly every country in the world . 
  if it is so bad , how has canada overtaken the us in highest median take home income ? 
  canada has never been doing better . 
  canada has an entire joint defense network facing north that it spends billions on . 
  you consider these losses ? 
  the leadership in al-qaeda is mostly dead , there are two allied governments in the region now . 
  nice to see the rise of some former iron curtain states to match some of southern and western europe . 
  people give it the concept shit , but i think there is something to say for reforms and cleaning things up ( and massive eu subsidies i guess . ), 
  you make a good point , energy might offset any losses from a stronger currency . 
  but manufacturing still has n't completely rebounded from the recession , i 'm worried that a too quick rise in the dollar will hurt that rebound , energy boom or not . 
  you can add somalia to that list , since the famine happened after a socialist takeover . 
  there was a badhistory post about bangladesh where they argued no , bangladesh happened 1 ) during a world war where the british had little access 2 ) during a japanese blockade , and 3 ) at the behest of local officials . 
  here 's a citation from bloodlands , a book about central europe around wwii . 
   if the struggles of lithuanian , latvian , and estonian nationalists against the reimposition of soviet power are regarded as resistance to deportations , which in some measure they were , another hundred thousand or so people would have to be added to the total dead associated with ethnic cleansing . 
  bloodlands : europe between hitler and stalin ( p. 332 ) . 
  kindle edition . 
  not a good thing , exports will get hurt . 
  true , even in east and west germany , [ there are still differences more than 20 years after reunification ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/west-east-germany-split ) . 
  in 2011 there was still a 30 % difference in production per capita . 
  ppp is n't an adjustment for cost of living per se , its an adjustment for the differences in currency from exchange rate . 
  nothing about how people live or do n't live or purchase , or how much it costs is taken into account . 
  is n't it a big part of the job in their national industry ? 
   the decalogue the decalogue i 've heard is a modern day classic , really have been meaning to see it . 
  i do think that manchuria had an effect on the japanese surrender , hirohito even mentions it when speaking about the cause of surrender . 
  his military was dead set against any sort of unconditional surrender , even going to the point of planning his assassination . 
  but you are right , it was late in the game and minor contributor to a nation that was almost already beaten and just hanging on . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 've gotten over the [ 3 weeks of fighting in manchuria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93japanese_war_\\ ( 1945 \\ ) ) over half a century ago , which was preceded by 40 years of peace ( though it was an impressive operation ) . 
  europe 's status as one of the us 's largest trading partners does n't mean anything ? 
  europeans are n't the only ones that benefit from pax americana . 
  how about west germany for one ? 
   but here come the true weakness of our democratic societies - values we live by limit our options when dealing with such tactics . 
  putin can crush any sign of protest or opposition , we ca n't . 
  putin does n't care for freedom of speech or free press , we must . 
  this ultimately becomes a weakness of these kinds of regimes though . 
  things change - technology , society , politics , and they ca n't keep up . 
  then you get things like the various colored revolutions or like solidarity . 
  say what you want about the failures and hypocrisy of modern democratic states , but widespread protests are allowed to happen and they serve as an outlet . 
  the crackdowns in autocracies are a source of fragility , not strength . 
  how is nato useless , when is the last time a nato country was overrun ? 
  it seems like the most successful defense alliance in history to me , despite the kidnapping of one estonian . 
   poland choosing to pad the coffers of american corporations over european ones this is n't fair because poland has purchased a lot of weapons from european firms . 
  they purchased [ 128 mark 2a4s from germany , will buy 128 more mark 2a5s ] ( http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/buy-from-the-pros-poland-adds-more-german-tanks-019466/ ) and is looking into buying french air defense systems , european meteor air-to-air missiles , and eurofighter typhoons ( which would replace planned purchases of f-16s - also looking at f-35s ) . 
  poland purchased f-16s with the sole purpose of later obtaining jassm , because this kind of capability does n't exist in europe right now and they want it for deterrence purposes . 
  us debt to gdp is not completely [ out of line with europe ] ( http://qvmgroup.com/invest/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/oecd-country-sovereigndebt-to-gdp.png ) . 
  and a surer way to indebt yourself further is to cut off growth and tax revenue . 
  that , and it allowed the massive encirclement that the better equipped red army could perform . 
  it was a huge logistical undertaking to cover so many miles so quickly ( some organization genius by the soviets as well ) that was successful because the soviets had trucks and nazis had horses . 
  wow eu , how about giving your number # 1 trading partner some more love from time to time ? 
  right , except for : * italy * north africa * france * belgium * the netherlands * japan * china * the philippines * the air war * russian supplies the trope that the ussr did everything singlehandedly is just as bad as the us did . 
  in reality it was an allied effort . 
  in reality the ussr started the war on the side of germany , with a co-invasion of poland ( and committed mass murder as a result ) . 
  in reality , ukrainians were the ethnicity that suffered the most , not russians . 
   moscow is worried primarily that ukraine will bar imports from russia that fail to meet eu quality standards . 
  ffs , you ca n't make this stuff up . 
  hopefully they 're not trying to sell [ exploding tv sets ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/tv.htm ) and effing [ ladas ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/11703067 ) . 
   soviet television sets tended to explode , because of faulty manufacturing . 
  the surprising and alarming propensity of russian receivers to blow up , and by extension the apprehension it causes in soviet viewers , was one of the stranger features of soviet life . 
  by one estimate , sixty percent of all apartment fires in moscow are caused by mass-produced soviet television sets , which hada tendency to explode . 
  if he does that , the us reaches moscow in under half an hour . 
  that along with a few hundred targets throughout russia . 
  it would be very difficult to distinguish a tactical irbm strike on poland vs us bases in that time and us strategic command would probably conclude that its better to be safe than sorry . 
  also , there was talk of russia * joining * nato at some point . 
  seeing as how no two nato members have had any real conflict ( turkey and greece ? 
  ) , its unlikely that nato really wants to pursue a hostile policy . 
  in english its `` bedlam '' \\ ( [ a 15th century london insane asylum apparently ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bedlam ) ) , `` pandemonium '' ( capital city of hell ) , or `` shit creek '' . 
  very cool , its interesting in the paper how their principle component analysis shows such a large difference between ukrainians and russians , and how close russians and fins are . 
  iirc , something similar happened in poland a few years ago and the results were n't all that great . 
  people were digging up other 's past to only help themselves . 
  you ca n't make this stuff up . 
   `` russia can not be a vassal . 
  because russia is not only a country , it is a whole civilization , it is a thousand-year story , a cultural melting-pot , of enormous power , '' ria news agency quoted him as saying . 
  this explains a lot about russia 's recent actions and motives . 
  they refuse to except the decline of russia into a regional power . 
   yeah because we all know that those ~ ~ russain billionaires ~ ~ former kgb aparatchiks would never violate the law . 
  french , i really like butter . 
  how do we know these are n't skydiving vacationers ? 
  the plantagenet dynasty was pretty french as well and heavily influenced english rule . 
  socky like sockpuppet account would be my guess . 
  its a common refrain , along with shill , when someone does n't like something but ca n't refute it . 
   canada get 's fucked in the nafta trade deal canada 's exports have grown 4.5 times [ since nafta started ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/canada-exports.png?s=catbtote&amp;d1=19900101&amp;d2=20141231 ) , to the point where canada has the [ highest median income in the world ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?_r=0 ) . 
  i 'm not quite sure how this is bad . 
   a lot of these news stories that are popping up about the russian threat to ~ ~ moldova ~ ~ ukraine seem to be sensationalistic reporting trying to ride the coattails of the ~ ~ ukrainian ~ ~ georgian crisis than well-informed analyses of the actual situation in ~ ~ moldova ~ ~ ukraine . 
  the biggest flaw in these arguments is what exactly could russia still do in ~ ~ moldova ~ ~ ukraine ?
