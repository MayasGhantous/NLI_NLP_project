  the one region of ~ ~ moldova ~ ~ ukraine with strong pro-russian sympathies , ~ ~ transnistria ~ ~ crimea , is already under the de facto control of pro-russian separatists . 
  the rest of the russian/russian speaking minorities in ~ ~ moldova ~ ~ ukraine are largely scattered in a few cities and a handful of villages , but the overwhelming majority of the country consists of rural areas populated by ethnic ~ ~ moldovans/romanians ~ ~ ukrainians . 
   so realistically , it 's hard to see how russia could significantly escalate the situation in ~ ~ moldova ~ ~ short of outright invading the country , but that seems utterly implausible . 
  this would have been you one year ago . 
   everyone should care about debt . 
  no , debt is almost meaningless unless creditors are n't willing to lend you money . 
   one of the reasons china keeps getting more and more power . 
  this makes no sense . 
  in what way has china exercised its debt power ? 
  are they able in any way to say to a debtor nation , do what we want or else ? 
   likewise crime rate is inextricable part of economy , and the societal changes are a symptom of something even more dangerous than debt and corruption . 
  dehumanisation . 
  [ crime has been falling in poland , like it has in most of the west . 
  from a polish crime report . 
   overall , crime continues to drop in poland , with continuing significant decreases since 2000 . 
  you need to put away that radio maryja or fox news and quit putting a moral spin on things like debt or drug crimes . 
  the truth is that more income , more trade , more openness leads to a reduction in the negative things that you are so worried about . 
  contrast this to russia , which is undergoing an [ alcohol epidemic ] ( http://www.narconon.com/blog/russia-dealing-with-alcohol-epidemic-losing-1-in-5-men/ ) with a one in five death rate for men , a [ heroin and aids epidemic ] ( http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/russia-epidemic-drug-abuse-heroin-addict-intravenous-aids-hiv ) , and [ double the murders as the us ] ( http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/09/19/224043848/the-u-s-has-more-guns-but-russia-has-more-murders ) . 
  this is what you want to leave the west for ? 
   so is the rapid increase of national debt that has recently gone over 1 billion zloties who gives a shit about debt ? 
  people matter about what their living standards are and if they can afford to feed their families . 
  [ debt to gdp in poland is tiny ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=debt%20to%20gdp%20poland ) , less than the netherlands and well below what people consider bad . 
   100 % rise of the crime rate , 500 % raise in drug-related crimes , increase in divorces ... oh not , our morals !, 
  wo n't anyone think of the children ? 
  do n't give me this sentimental moral garbage when we 're talking about economics . 
  its meaningless . 
  if you ask russia , russia has been the worlds greatest victim for the last 200 years at the evil decedent west . 
  its like an entire country is a perpetual tumblr social justice warrior for itself . 
  right , because a [ four fold increase in per capita gdp is a bad thing ] ( http://www.efic.gov.au/country/countryprofiles/publishingimages/country-profile-poland-may-2012-chart07.png ) . 
  poland is one of the strongest growing countries in europe right now , mostly because it has tied itself so firmly to the west and away from the weak and frail russia . 
   most of the time there was no such problem right , except the massive famines in the 30s and 40s where millions died . 
   mcarthy style witch hunts i 'm just curious , what do you mean by mcarthy style witch hunts . 
  do you have any examples of people being persecuted and losing their jobs for being secret muslims ? 
   loss of basic freedoms and what examples would you have of this ? 
  very true . 
  but i do think that the polish are a little wary of relying just on alliances , their history makes them second guess that . 
  a strong defense force and even a credible deterrent force are what they need , and a strong place at the crossroads of the east and europe politically , economically , and militarily will go that much further in ensuring their security . 
  i do n't know , poland 's economy is one of the few in europe growing and they are undergoing a massive military modernization program with real deterrent capability . 
  they 've purchased 150 mark 2a4s leopard tanks from germany and will purchase 150 more mark 2a5s , 42 block 52 f-16s from the us with planned jassm cruise missile purchases (  300km range ) , and plan to buy a french or us missile defense system and either tranche 3b eurofighter typhoons or f-35s , which are designed as russian s-400 killers . 
  both very capable aircraft that match anything russia has . 
  also , these little adventures and threats of tactical nuclear weapons use will probably convince poland to go ahead with installation of us standard missile 3 installations , the best mid-course medium range ballistic missile killers in the world . 
  russia would no doubt overwhelm poland , but it will be costly and long , and chechnya proved that their military still has a long way to go . 
  you misunderstood , i do n't think its a bad thing to defend your allies and am not condemning us foreign policy here . 
  i 'm more against the hand wringing and placating and apologizing that other countries do for protecting themselves . 
  yeah , because the us does n't like going to war . 
  the ban on cooperation with high tech oil drilling technologies will hurt the most . 
  russia badly needs foreign help to pump its own oil . 
   we are simply stating that they should n't get away with operating a commericial transport service which places all the liability on the drivers and does n't employ appropriate insurance . 
  where are you getting this ? 
  the article says that uber insurs all of the rides , this is 1 ) people fearful of new things and 2 ) privileged insiders protecting their market at the expense of less connected outsiders and consumers . 
   the body described its rival as a `` form of locust share-economy '' indulging in `` anarchy capitalism '' that could leave passengers exposed in the case of an accident . 
  what a sensationalist , panicky view . 
  its really sad how much misery and pain would be inflicted by the soviets just a few decades later . 
  i think trade deals make a lot of sense between two equally highly developed areas , like the us and europe . 
  you both benefit from what you can specialize in while not being undercut on manufacturing , and the various european trade areas as well as canada-us shows how well it works . 
  these things always need some work on the details but that 's expected in most deals . 
  they are paranoid of an internal protest movement that they will claim is started by the west . 
  they ca n't wrap their heads around protests in places like missouri or paris being a normal , healthy part of democracy . 
  they would be able to commit maybe half of that to an invasion . 
  and i agree , that still leaves poland overmatched , but poland does n't have to win , just draw . 
  any military campaign large enough to overwhelm polish forces ( especially right on germany 's doorstep ) will get polish neighbors very , very concerned , even if they ignore their article 5 obligations . 
   ussr - pact with germany , 4 days old followed by an invasion and mass murder from both sides . 
  interesting how they are so eager to be seen as standing up to the fascists , when they were their greatest enablers . 
   russia 's version of the navy seals something tells me this is n't quite true , they do n't let seals post social media pictures like teenage girls . 
  poland has been undergoing a massive [ modernization program recently ] ( http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2013/09/18/beyond-air-and-missile-defense-modernization-of-the-polish-armed-forces/ ) . 
  they have purchased 128 leopard 2a4 tanks from germany with plans for 128 more 2a4s or 2a5s , [ 48 block 52 f-16s ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140301/defreg01/303010023/as-poland-pursues-stealth-jets-eurofighter-flies-into-picture ) , jassm [ long range low-observability cruise missiles ] ( http://theaviationist.com/tag/agm-158-jassm/ ) with a range of 370km , and have plans for a sams ( french or us probably ) and may [ purchase f-35s or tranche 3b eurofighters ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140301/defreg01/303010023/as-poland-pursues-stealth-jets-eurofighter-flies-into-picture ) . 
  these systems will significantly raise the cost ( and time ) for any adversary trying to invade , including any conceivable non-nuclear attack by russia . 
  the jassm missile , which they can fit to the f-16 , also could strike long distance targets in heavily contested air space ( s-300 and s-400 filled ) as a reliable deterrent . 
  [ `` the economy is close to recession , '' oleg zasov , head of forecasting at russia 's economic ministry , told russian news agencies . 
  ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/russias-economy-close-recession-sanctions-food-import-ban-1670980 ), 
  this is n't true anymore . 
  india has now become the us 's biggest buyer of arms , and the us has overtaken [ russia as their biggest supplier ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ded3be9a-9c81-11e3-b535-00144feab7de.html#axzz3bro85hgk ) . 
  it seems that india is buying a lot of high-tech equipment to address their shortcomings against china . 
  he became well known only his book , bloodlands : europe between hitler and stalin . 
  he did a ton of work detailing what happened after getting access to old soviet archives . 
  its excellent but very hard to read because of the material . 
  its a really fascinating talk , especially about the impact of conspiracy theories that confuse the situation . 
  its amazing how much more informed and in depth this talk is and answers are than the chomsky interview elsewhere on / r/europe . 
  its night and day . 
  snyder really , really knows what he talks about . 
  his book , bloodlands , is extremely well researched and very heartbreaking . 
   their fate should be determined by an agreement between the us and russia . 
   the analogy between nato expansion and the cuban missile crisis is interesting . 
  that 's what * everything * is with these people . 
  struggle between great powers while the little people on the ground have no say . 
  small baltic countries ask for voluntary access to a military alliance because of decades of brutal repression ? 
  must be nato expanding again . 
  ukrainian people protesting their corrupt government ? 
  must be a western putsch . 
  its all so cynical and condescending . 
  he brings up one anecdotes from the 1950s about swaddling clothes and some guy calling him rat-faced to suggest its just demonization . 
  it 's all about the this sin of nato or the west , and when this person said x , but absolutely no attempt to provide any balance . 
  he babbles about everything and anything not related to the present crisis - star wars , nato exercises , estonian parades , germany joining nato . 
  wow . 
   funny how political murders in the us -- the kennedy brothers , martin luther king -- are invariably the work of a `` lone nut , '' but in russia it 's always the putin government . 
  opposition politicians and journalists in the us are n't mysteriously disappearing at the same rate . 
  interesting that you have to bring up evidence from the 1960s , why not go back further and use aaron burr shooting alexander hamilton from the 18th century ? 
  how so ? 
  anti westism has poisoned his mind to the point that he is supporting a strongly anti-gay regime when he himself is gay . 
  its absurd .
