  troikas were set up to punish people who did n't meet their tarhets and stalin himself knew what was happening . 
  swap out romas/gypsies with any other ethnic minority and see if it still does n't sound like intolerance . 
   you can have negative impressions of a group but still tolerate them . 
  if you have a negative view of an entire group and not individuals , that is the definition of intolerance . 
  at the median , after tax incomes in norway , sweden , the uk , the us , canada , the nederlands , ireland , spain , and france have seen inflation adjusted [ increases of 30-50 % over the last 30 years . ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?referrer= ) . 
  in the us , workers from above the 20th percentile have seen increases , the top half have seen very large changes , this is mirrored all over the world implying that upper middle class jobs are growing . 
  in germany wages have slowed , i think this has been intentional to keep employment high , not sure though . 
  it is a really beautiful city , very walkable and lots of interesting history . 
  i agree , i covered that in the other response to my comment . 
  you make a good point , i 'd delta if this were cmv . 
  it seems this reporter is a buffoon and [ does n't know the basics to his own story . 
  ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/06/15/sunday-times-reporter-on-snowden-story-we-dont-have-a-clue/ ) i do n't dismiss it out of hand , but hard hitting journalism this is not . 
  he asked a government official for their take and printed it ? 
  wow , amazing story . 
  next toyll tell me that business reporters interview ceos . 
  you can fake signals , they tried to reaffirm it . 
  they should have been tried for their actions , but i do n't think they intentionally downed an airliner . 
   after receiving no response to multiple radio challenges , uss vincennes fired two surface-to-air missiles at the airliner . 
  your source said this . 
  the world does n't work like some cartoon , there is no way to interpret this but as an accident . 
  what do you have to gain ? 
  do what we want or we shoot down your airliners ? 
  this is ridiculous and not how the real world works . 
  do you think a superior officer gave a written order to shoot down an airliner , because of `` intimidation '' ? 
  did it come from the pentagon ? 
  if it did , there should be something of a paper trail . 
   they still do n't have any reason to shoot down an airplane on fucking iranian territory . 
  over water , coming at them with an untested missile system that can shoot hundreds of miles away . 
  who refused to identify themselves . 
   so it ca n't possibly be an act of intimidation towards a rival country ? 
  nothing in us military doctrine would even hint that this would be remotely useful . 
  the real world does n't work this way , in some kind of cartoony supervillian way . 
   how exactly did the army fuck that up so bad they actually thought it was a good idea to shoot it down ? 
  navy , not army . 
  and i 'm sure it 's entirely possible to mistake one blinking spot on a new and unfamiliar system as something else . 
  you 're changing your argument . 
  you said that  how exactly was it an accident ? 
  which it clearly was . 
  the ship had no reason to shoot down an airliner and attempted to affirm its identity . 
  it was an accident and your initial point was wrong , who got what medal is irrelevant . 
  kathy had a similar focus in poland . 
  it says right in your source that it was misidentified and the plane twice failed to respond to requests identifying itself . 
  it was also during a time when many shops were being destroyed during a war . 
   in 1984 the war between iraq and iran had expanded to include air attacks against oil tankers and merchant shipping of neighboring countries , some of whom were providing aid to iraq by shipping iraqi oil . 
  the flight 655 incident occurred a year after the iraqi air force attack on the u.s. navy guided-missile frigate uss stark on 17 may 1987 , which killed 37 american sailors . 
  u.s. naval forces had also exchanged gunfire with iranian gunboats in late 1987 , and the u.s. navy guided-missile frigate uss samuel b. roberts had struck an iranian sea mine in april 1988 . 
  before it is voted on , just like all trade deals . 
  poland defeated the red army in 1920 or 21 as well . 
  that is still a lot of casualties for the us allies , for a war they did n't have to be involved in . 
  the literature . 
  there is a section from wikipedia on it . 
   [ the soviets made it a policy to loot and rape civilians in manchuria . 
  the same soviet troops from germany had been sent to manchuria and looted , killed and raped . 
  in harbin , the chinese posted slogans such as `` down with red imperialism ! '', 
  soviet forces ignored protests from chinese communist party leaders on their mass rape and loot policy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_crimes ), 
  soviet atrocities happened in poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia , and japan . 
  all are places that did n't do what germany did to the ussr . 
   facebook ( $ 120 billion for an even more unprofitable social network with the same issue ) facebook makes billions in profit . 
  it made [ $ 2.940 billion in profit in 2014 on $ 4.994 billion in revenue . 
  london has silicon alley with quite a few successful internet firms , also cambridge has a tech cluster that is doing pretty well . 
   there was a notable absence from the letter of big , international tech companies like apple , google and facebook ...  several other companies and industry trade groups sent statements to congress in support of the legislation , among them cisco and the consumer electronics association . 
  the seminconductor industry association ( sia ) said : `` sia strongly supports trade promotion authority ( tpa ) so who are the hundreds of tech companies ? 
  from this , it sounds like the tech industry is one of this deals strongest supporters . 
  extrapolating from the last several decades i think that : economy - incomes will generally be [ 30-40 % higher across the board ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0 ) except at the lowest 20-30 % of income which have struggled . 
  for a median worker , they will probably earn [ $ 7500-12 ,000 more per year in current dollars ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/soc_glance-2011-en/04/01/g4_ge1-01.html?itemid=/content/chapter/soc_glance-2011-6-en&amp;_csp_=048bf5a4e0cb098ff846908f382f63e1 ) . 
  gdp will probably [ close to double ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_imf_ranked_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_%28nominal%29 ) . 
  labor force - the workforce will see a huge shift as some routine skill work becomes automated . 
  low end legal , accounting , data entry will all start being supplemented with software that can do the work for less . 
  huge worries as the lower skilled become left behind , reforming education will be absolutely key for underserved communities . 
  health - still expensive , hopefully slowdowns in cost will continue . 
  huge breakthroughs in alzhiemers , some cancers , genetic diseases ( e.g. 
  cystic fibrosis - crispr technology or something like it will revolutionize gene editing and bring it into the clinic soon ) . 
  augmented prosthetics with really sophisticated neural integration will start helping the disabled , inducible pluripotent stem cell technology will also help here . 
  education - huge problems will persist in the k-12 levels and for undergraduate education , especially of the poor . 
  some solutions will help , distance learning helps bridge the gap but it still will be a huge challenge . 
  tuition at top-tier universities continues to skyrocket , probably by 50 % . 
  energy - shift renewables will be highly on the way , much higher percentage of power will be made this way ( 25-50 % ? ), 
  electric cars become widely driven , shale oil will continue to expand . 
   it 's propaganda because who has posted it and when has been posted . 
  and who exactly was that ? 
  a historian ? 
  we 've gotten to such an anti-intellectual point that one of the world 's leading experts on a country gets his opinions called propaganda ? 
  yes , people that know more than me must be propagandists . 
   do i think two countries that were on the same side in a war for four years were not allies ? 
  no i do not . 
  so it 's a matter of 4 years versus 2 years . 
  got it . 
   it was a diplomatic feint . 
  yeah , that resulted in millions of polish deaths . 
  that they changed their minds later does n't matter , and snyder makes a few points of how ideologically they were also somewhat aligned . 
  it 's in the linked article . 
  so they were allies and then stopped being allies . 
  france and britain joined forces and fought numerous times throughout their history . 
  do you think the ussr and us similarly were n't allies because of the cold war ? 
  every opinion that differs from you is n't automatically propaganda . 
  the author is a noted historian who has forgotten more about russian history than anyone on this thread has ever learned . 
  its not from a government , and to call it propaganda is very orwellian and an attempt to stifle criticism . 
  what part is not true ? 
  was there a treaty to start war with a soviet invasion ? 
  because there was one with soviet invasion .
