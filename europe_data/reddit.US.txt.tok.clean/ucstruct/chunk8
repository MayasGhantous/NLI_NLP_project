  stalin attacked poland , deported a half million poles , supplied the nazis , and granted every single request but one by the nazis . 
  nazis symbols were being openly displayed in russia and people talked about the struggle of international fascism for comrade hitler . 
  stalin did n't think hitler was going to attack . 
  they were not only allies but close allies . 
   another important aspect is of the ` cultural hegemony ' poison which is prevalent at the moment , this in part seems to have been imported from american sociology departments : i do n't know how you attribute this solely to americans and not marxist analysis throughout the world . 
  cantillon and boon gueze from belgium . 
  i 'm not sure about the exact cantillon i had but it was amazing . 
  not occurring to saab , which [ places it 's capability as pretty high . ] ( http://forum.keypublishing.com/attachment.php?s=7a27fc2612e0b33f9353925e06670a8d&amp;attachmentid=228911&amp;d=1401868937 ) . 
  it will also cost slightly more than grippens and almost 30 million less than the latest eurofighter . 
  dream of a ridiculous man by dostoevsky is one i really like . 
  its the closest he came to writing a sci-fi short story , a man with a miserable life dreams of going to another world where there is no war or hatred and sees what his own influence is . 
  its really interesting . 
  ( i love crime and punishment too , probably more . ), 
  the west did n't line up mass graves with officers and doctors when they made these decisions . 
   read the definition of whataboutism my point was that you brought it up , not me . 
  you do something then blame others for it . 
  whataboutism is what you did . 
  my point is that the two are n't remotely comparable because the ussr was responsible for tens of millions of deaths . 
  to disprove my point , you seem to have linked to a list of native american attacks on americans , a couple tinpot south american dictatorships , and compared a mind control program to live vivesection . 
  anyway , i do n't deny the dark parts of american history . 
  my concern was with wwii , where the ussr was undoubtably an aggressor , lose millions through incompetence , and somehow still gets people to whine because they do n't get enough credit . 
  with what navy ? 
  the us did n't massacre thousands of polish officers or kill over a million ethnically cleansing eastern europe . 
  the third punic war led to less carthaginian attacks , so there is a precedent . 
  per capita [ gdp and self reported happiness are extremely strongly correlated ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/daily_chart_1 ) , even at high gdp . 
  the book that these bullet points come from is called bloodlands : europe between hitler and stalin , and is [ extremely in depth and readable ] ( http://www.amazon.com/bloodlands-europe-between-hitler-stalin/dp/0465031471 ) . 
  killing yes , killed and captured it was about 50 % . 
   but without the british , the whole western front would have collapsed altogether long before the americans really got involved in a serious capacity . 
  this gets overlooked a lot . 
  there was no eastern front for a while because the ussr started the war * with * the nazis by invading poland together . 
  the main point seems to be that the ussr was very effective at getting more of its own troops killed , so they did the majority of the work . 
  did he try to propose that germany pay for mods ? 
  thanks for clarifying that . 
  also to consider is that qatar and egypt are n't being sold fifth generation , it 's only sold to high level partners who contribute to development or production . 
  but yeah , rafale is extremely deadly and capable . 
  it makes sense to get it , the pakfa is having huge problems . 
  also french infrared technology is some of the best in the world , rafales could be very dangerous to fifth gen aircraft in wvr . 
  [ saab has a different take on the relative advantages . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gr62a3r.jpg ) also i would take this analysis with a grain of salt , that website has an ax to grind against 5th generation fighters it seems . 
  it gets many facts simply wrong ( like the f-35 not being able to supercruise or see behind it , the f-35 can lock on and fire at targets directly behind it ) and emphasizes useless characteristics like engine vapor and size . 
  it places the cost of f-35a at 188 million per plane , this is ridiculous , they are below 100 million right now and will fall to about 83 million when full production is up . 
  [ israel just paid 110 million per ] ( http://www.jpost.com/israel-news/israel-signs-contract-to-purchase-additional-14-f-35-fighter-jets-391789 ) , and that is including training , logistics , and service . 
   as a result , rafale and typhoon are the only fighters on the list capable of consistently surprising the enemy this is patently absurd . 
  the website focuses on several areas that are more relevant to dogfighting and not modern aerial combat , including high maneuverability . 
  in exercises called red flag , german eurofighters flew against f-22s and were blown out of the sky . 
   [ two other german officers , col. andreas pfeiffer and maj. marco gumbrecht , noted in the same report that the f-22 's capabilities are `` overwhelming '' when it comes to modern , long-range combat as the stealth fighter is designed to engage multiple enemies well-beyond the pilot 's natural field of vision - mostly while the f-22 is still out of the other plane 's range . 
  grumbrecht said that even if his planes did everything right , they were n't able to get within 20 miles of the next-generation jets before being targeted ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/07/f-22-fighter-loses-79-billion-advantage-in-dogfights-report/ ) the rafale is a very dangerous and capable aircraft , but do n't go by the analysis in that faulty website . 
  also football was originally [ meant to denote many different games played on foot ] ( http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/06/the-origin-of-the-word-soccer/ ) , as opposed to on a horse . 
  so there was association football , like you said , and rugby football as well as others . 
  it looked like a really nice park too . 
  umbrellas too . 
  watch out , its a trap . 
  as compared to what , your military ? 
  just like they are n't speaking for their countries , i do n't know why you presume to speak for the us . 
  very informative , thanks . 
   is it illegal to make people aware of publicly available information ? 
  of a politician , to incite violence against themselves or their property ( or as you suggest vandalizing ) ? 
  yeah , i would be that it is . 
  here is a graph correlating [ ngdp growth to oil prices in russia ] ( http://marketmonetarist.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ngdp-oil-rub-russia.jpg ) . 
  there is also evidence that petrostates become more aggressive to neighbors when oil prices rise . 
  ah ok , thanks . 
  just out of curiosity , since you seem pretty informed , what are the comparisons of something like sm-3 / 6 to russia 's s-400 / 500 ? 
  its hard to make a direct comparison , but they are designed with similar goals in mind . 
  by some measure you mean illegally releasing her personal information to incite who knows what ? 
  does n't poland also want standard missiles ? 
  russia threw a fit last time there was a plan to install them . 
  is there some thing in ttip that restricts this ? 
  isds allows for a challenge in court , but that will be true in this case as well . 
  1 ) they are forcing a sale not nationalization , 2 ) the thousands of isds deals in place have n't stop this kind of thing 3 ) russia is n't in ttip . 
  it 's great to have these , but i do n't see a solid plan to do it . 
  throughout the world these things grow with lots of effort over time , and you need the right conditions . 
  a stanford , mit , cambridge , or tsinghua type institution usually seeds an innovation cluster , and you need both risk tolerant investors and laws tolerant of failure . 
  all of these things count as [ tertiary education according to the world bank . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tertiary_education ), 
  yes , i absolutely think so , at least for poland which i 've visited . 
  there is strong western culture , rule of law , personal freedoms , an economy built on self determination , and real representative democratic government . 
  under my definition , south korea and japan also probably count as western , but i think it makes sense . 
  that photo is haunting . 
  its almost certain that yellowstone park would n't be targeted . 
  first , nuclear weapons are detonated at thousands of feet to maximize the blast damage . 
  second , the top priorities are 2nd strike capabilities and logistically important sites . 
  killing yogi is n't nearly as important . 
  indianapolis is big too . 
  that does n't mean people do n't fly over it to get to where they really want to live . 
  and so on , and so on . 
  wait , let me check . 
  [ yep . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?msa=0&amp;mid=zdx2yoawhsco.koumguzj9vvk ), 
  what does this imbecile think will happen once the us sees objects careening towards one of our favorite national parks on a ballistic trajectory ? 
  what 's wrong with the bay area ? 
  it may seem intimidating from whatever flyover state you live in , but you should at least visit before you suggest getting rid of it . 
  that 's got to be one of the most ridiculous things i 've ever seen . 
  i did n't know the wwe had a russian foil now . 
  most of [ south america has a very favorable opinion of the us . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/ ) brazil-65 % peru-65 % venezuala-62 % columbia-64 % chile-72 %, 
  yeah , full production for the a should be lower than tranche 3b eurofighter , gripen ng , f-16 e/f , and rafales and be comparable to f/a 18 . 
   i mean , you guys were invading ukraine a century ago when it was russian territory , should they be butthurt about you ? 
  there are people still alive who remember the iron curtain falling ? 
  maybe that has something to do with it ? 
  that 's amazing .
