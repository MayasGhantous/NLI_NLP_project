  how expensive is it to live downtown in an area like this ? 
  perhaps it is an open debate , but i 'm not quite sure how the adjustments were made to control for different reporting in your second chart . 
  anyway , newer research makes it seem that this correlation is extremely linear ( log-linear anyway ) [ in the same country ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/05/daily-chart-0 ) . 
  this goes against the idea that this effect at the top is a country specific reporting quirk . 
  it does n't , because i think that growth , technology , and correctly aligned incentives best serve ecology . 
  for this article to be remotely true , canada must be suffering an ecological catastrophe after nafta . 
  it is n't . 
  [ co2 emissions were flat in the 2000s ( after nafta ) and were flat after falling from the 2008 recession . 
  ] ( http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/english/parl_cesd_201410_01_e_39848.html#ex8 ) air quality has also improved [ after nafta was implemented , ] ( http://www.ec.gc.ca/rnspa-naps/ ) in * every single possible measure * including sulfur , particulate matter , and volitile carbon molecules and [ canada has the 3rd best air quality in the world . 
  ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-s-air-quality-3rd-best-in-world-1.980695 ) but no , your right , lets keep scare mongering with panicky articles about how nafta is leading to an ecological catastrophe in canada when the exact opposite has been happening . 
  care to explain ? 
  its showing life satisfaction for different age groups and it looks almost log-linear to me . 
  from the paper that is lifted from , [ the r ^ 2 value for a log linear fit is 0.694 for a slope with a coefficient of 0.838 . 
  ] ( http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.22.2.53 ) that is extremely linear from a graph plotting so many countries . 
  yeah , its been a complete nightmare for canada , to the point where [ canada has overtaken the us as the highest median take home income in the world . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0 ) before you say income is n't everything , it buys a lot of things that are and [ gdp per capita is strongly correlated with self reported happiness ] ( http://ourworldindata.org/visualhistoryof/poverty.html#/gdp-and-happiness ) . 
  an important distinction is that turkey 's military is in alliance with europe , not really its economy . 
  this benefits the military and gives it a powerful sense of legitimacy , and turkey has had several military coups . 
  erdogan has been fought really hard to limit their power . 
  it looked like a move toward a more liberal , democratic society at first , but the clincher is that he seems not to want that . 
  my bet is that the generals rise up and depose him in the next 5 years or so . 
  someone will overstep their authority , a constitutional crisis will emerge , and another self-styled ataturk will rise up . 
  you 've apparently never seen cranks arguing on reddit . 
  youtube videos are the highest standard of evidence to some of them . 
  spain has an [ extremely low favorability rating of russia at 18 % ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/27/ ) , which is lower than the united states has . 
  my guess is more that this is related to number 3 , where spain , italy , and greece may be more disgruntled about the current leadership in the west after the financial crisis . 
  poland is also developing a very capable strategic deterrent , including low observability jassm standoff cruise missiles and are looking into the purchase of tomahawks and a submarine fleet to match . 
  these would make any invasion of poland hurt for the country doing it . 
  the uk was pretty [ aggressive with qe ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21613259-european-central-bank-should-learn-success-unconventional-policies-america-and ) . 
  not true , though gripen ng will be cheaper , it 's not by much . 
  [ average ng prices will be 80-85 million dollars and about 109 million dollars for an f35b or c. less for a. 
  ] ( https://comprehensiveinformation.wordpress.com ), 
  not [ according to saab . 
  he did n't design any planes , but was an advisor who came up with a theory that inspired the f16 . 
  he hates what it became because he wanted a fighter with relient on guns and luckily the air force ignored him . 
  he thinks the f15 is a disaster , when it has a better than 105 to 0 air to air record . 
  the f-35 has an at least projected 6-1 kill ratio against su-35s , and [ will probably be comparable to t-50s in air to air ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gr62a3r.jpg ) . 
  also , f-35s were designed with the [ requirement to neutralize double digit sams , like the s-400 ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/2014/06/gen-mike-hostage-on-the-f-35-no-growlers-needed-when-war-starts/3/ ) , because so many countries will have them soon . 
  from a us air force general :  [ `` the f-35 was fundamentally designed to go do that sort of thing \\ [ take out advanced iads \\ ] ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/2014/06/gen-mike-hostage-on-the-f-35-no-growlers-needed-when-war-starts/3/ ) . 
  not with the same capabilities for cost , [ according to saab . 
  according to a saab presentation trying to sell gripen ngs , [ the f-35 compares pretty favorably . 
  he hates the current f-16 , and he even more so despises the f-15 , a jet that 's never been shot down in air-to-air combat with a 106-0 kill ratio . 
   gimped by the commonality requirements with the marine corps ' stovl variant what were these and how did they gimp the f-35 ? 
  its face looks almost exactly like an f/a -18 . 
  its [ 110 million and has been skyrocketing in the last few decades ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbender/2012/01/30/record-number-of-americans-now-hold-passports/ ) . 
  what are you talking about , americans love to travel ? 
  which part are you contending and why , the 6.7 % increase or the 58 million tourists to europe ? 
  because your hunch is n't better to go off of than data , this is maybe people you know but do n't speak for the rest of us . 
   most americans are tied down with family , mortgage and have the highest [ disposable income in the oecd ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/income/ ) . 
  they also spend the 2nd most amount of [ money in international tourism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings ) . 
  people can invent pretexts , it happened to poland in 1939 with the faked attack on a radio tower . 
  trotsky once said an interesting take on * para pacum para bellum * . '', 
  you may not be interested in war but war is interested in you '', 
  its mainly to improve interoperability of nato forces . 
  they argue that it is more about migrations than cultural spread , because migrations are necessary to produce these large changes . 
   the best argument for the ` anatolian hypothesis ' that indo-european languages arrived in europe from anatolia ~ 8,500 years ago is that major language replacements are thought to require major migrations , and that after the early neolithic when farmers established themselves in europe , the population base was likely to have been so large that later migrations would not have made much of an impact . 
  note that they argue against a strictly anatolian hypothesis and instead provide evidence for a later steppe migration hypothesis like teamkiller91 says , but they do n't speculate on the homeland suffice to say that it was north of the black sea . 
  i said citizens who lived through ethnic cleansing , because there is no one alive from that time . 
  if you go back to 1658 , there was a clear cut example of it . 
  none in living memory though . 
   by simply being peaceful and neutral there is no way putin or anyone else could ever spin any sort of irish aggression to their public this is naive . 
  when was the last ethnic cleansing , i was n't aware there were people still alive from it who witnessed it first hand ? 
  thats what i meant with `` lived through it '' . 
   if we wanted to troll the uk after ww2 maybe we would have invited some soviet or argentinian soldiers over to dance on the border with northern ireland but we did n't because it 's just provocative this seems insulting to the baltics . 
  your country does n't have citizens who lived * and are still alive * through forced deportations , ethnic cleansing , and decades of political repression . 
  it would be like someone telling 17th century you that you were wrong to worry about cromwell . 
   as a peaceful people i think we have an aversion to loud mouthed yanks taking over the place and we deal with enough of them a couple of soldiers for an exercise showing support for an alliance is hardly taking over . 
  autocrats do n't care how sensitive and nice you are , you should feel lucky that you are safely far away from them . 
  edit : clarified a point . 
  obviously ireland has suffered in its past , but it is not as recent as the baltics . 
  yeah , i think you have a point there . 
  i think a lot of people misread russia . 
  i agree , its deeper than the one number capable of explaining an entire state . 
  but it is a compelling idea . 
  i think another part of it is that not only does high dependence on oil prices make petrostates more aggressive , they also hold back their economic and civil development in other areas . 
  you get an onset of cronyism and corruption , high exchange rates , and lower r and d in other areas . 
  its a bad mix . 
   the level of hubris of the west and nato was so high that would n't have cared how russia felt as until recently they saw russia as incapable of doing anything meaningful to stop them . 
  this is ludicrous , of course they care what a nuclear armed country thinks about its black sea fleet . 
  these countries still spend billions every year maintaining nuclear arsenals , deploying ssbns , and tracking each others movements . 
  the mistake was not assuming that russia saw economic integration as bad or worse than nato integration . 
  i do n't believe this to be true . 
  i do n't think that the us would beginning fueling transport ships and making preparations for a land invasion of the european continent for a non-nato member . 
  maybe after some time , but not as an automatic response like they would for a nato member . 
   i think the russians would have been allowed to remain their fleets already stationed there for some amount of time under the pretence of following the agreements already made , heck maybe even have given them some autonomy over crimea for a while . 
  in a nato signatory country ? 
  why would russia agree to have its entire black sea fleet encircled by a nato signatory country ? 
  i think both sides would have seen the difficulty in this and left it off the table for a few decades . 
  its extremely doubtful that even a majority of ukrainians at the time would have wanted to join nato , why would the kremlin cronies ? 
  yes , [ thales too . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arms_industry ), 
   while i do n't see much chance of ukraine joining nato now , i think it could have easily been a matter of course for it to integrate further into the ` western ' fold i really sincerely doubt this , russia had a base on ukrainian territory . 
  would sevastopol been in nato as well ? 
  i do n't think nato membership would have been on the table at all . 
  yes , but sweden , finland , austria , and ireland are n't [ nato members . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2013/partnerships-nato-2013/natos-neutral-european-partners/en/index.htm ) the requirements for entry would be extremely high , it would be extremely provacative , and western populations would have difficulty in accepting a pact to defend ukraine . 
  this makes a lot more sense , at least in explaining russia 's train of thought . 
  my theory is that russia is extremely distrustful of the entire western order , and the eu is actually russia 's biggest threat . 
  nato is secondary , and though its a big threat i think they worry about what happens internally much more . 
  bae , eads , saab , dassault , and finmeccanica are all european and by far the largest suppliers of european arms .
