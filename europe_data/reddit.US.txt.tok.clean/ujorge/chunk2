  i was responding to a comment about the nra . 
  are you aware that during the old days when blacks did n't have civil rights and the ku klux klan was killing them with impunity it was the nra who helped them get weapons and instruct them in how to use them ? 
  the local authorities ( some of them working in concert with the kkk ) did everything they could to prevent blacks from obtaining and carrying weapons . 
  the nra was the only organization willing to help minorities exercise their rights to own weapons for self defense . 
  today , even though the constitutions says that i have a right to `` keep and bear arms '' the state where i live makes it very difficult for me to exercise that right . 
  i could challenge them in court , but i do n't have money for lawyers ; the nra does that for me . 
  finally , a large number of americans live in isolated or sparsely populated communities . 
  sometimes calling for the police and waiting for them to arrive when a criminal ( or a large bear ) is inside your home is not an option . 
  i can only tell you to do your own research and find out what the nra actually does . 
  ** edit ** : grammar, 
  politicians, 
  buy american , damn it ... !, 
  please ... 
  that was on purpose by the way . 
  i have actually seen people arguing in favor of socialism that say that having a public police force is socialist . 
  what i think they are trying to do is to hide what socialism really is by presenting things that we are in favor of as being `` socialists '' . 
   just about the only things they have in common with socialist states is universal healthcare and welfare spending . 
  but having these things in common with socialists countries does n't make them socialists . 
  socialism is `` collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods '' ( [ source ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism ) ) . 
  now , even in a free-market economy the people can decide that it would be a good thing if the government provide this or that service . 
  just because the government does it on behalf of the people and with their consent does n't mean that is socialist . 
  the police force is not a socialists institution and neither are public parks , water treatment plants and so on . 
  in fact , you could contract private companies to provide those services and bill the tax payers . 
   this is because whenever capital is given power and the possibility to amass , the `` gravity '' of the system is towards concentration of wealth do you have an example of that ? 
  you have a real super-capitalist economy in switzerland . 
  explain to me how your theory works . 
  what 's going to happen or is happening to that country that proves your theory . 
  and you would be old enough to understand why thatcher was elected . 
  i ** know ** that you either were not even born or where in diapers when she was in power . 
  [ about half of turkey 's export go to europe ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/tur/ ) ... so it 's not like you do n't have a way of putting pressure on him . 
  man up , europe ... 
  you 're right that firmly blue or red states are usually ignored , but not for long . 
  in the 2000 election everyone remembers what happened in florida , but in fact george w. bush won by flipping west virginia to the gop . 
  the same thing with the last election in which hillary clinton ignored wisconsin and ended up losing it . 
  trump even came close in minnesota , the only state that never voted for ronald reagan . 
  how much do you know about american politics ? 
  i live in maryland and last november 8th this is what we had to vote for : * president of the usa * one u.s. senator * eight u.s. representatives ( two candidates in my district ) * five state judges * 14 local judges * 33 seats in the school board besides all these , depending on the year there might be elections for county seats , for sheriffs , ballot initiatives ( like the one that approved gay marriage a few years ago ) , county clerk , even the child court judge . 
  ** edit ** : i forgot i had [ these pictures ] ( http://imgur.com/a/eygjk ) i took in 2010 shortly after arriving to the state of maryland . 
  there were dozens of signs like these at this place and i was surprised by the large amount of positions that are elected here in baltimore county . 
  by the way , there are twenty four counties in the state of maryland and over 3,100 in the entire u.s. and in each of them there are a large number of elected positions . 
  my point here is that just concentrating on the federal elections for president and congress leaves out the fact that most of the government that affects people 's lives in this country happens at the local level . 
  i do n't think that will catch on ; that state will be diluting it 's power in the electoral college , although it makes sense for a small state like maine . 
  but do n't expect a state like california to do that ; they have millions of republican voters who in the last election did n't have anyone to vote for so they stayed home . 
  if california ever goes for proportional representation , then a lot of things will change . 
  suddenly those millions of republicans are in play and ca n't be ignored anymore as it happens today . 
  suddenly all these policies to protect the planet , ban oil extraction , etc. 
  go out the window to keep conservatives voters happy . 
  why would the democrat-controlled assembly in california shoot themselves in the foot by going for proportional representation ? 
  like i say , not going to happen . 
  besides agreeing with all the commenters below that ask `` why do you always have to get the u.s. into / r/europe '' thread , what 's that even supposed to mean ? 
  do you know that the u.s. is by design not a representative democracy ? 
  when i say by design it means that the framers of the constitution intentionally wrote it that way , it was no accident . 
  if you want to know why there are multiple sources online that i can suggest for you [ ( you can watch this five minutes video for a quick explanation ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6s7jb6-gou ) . 
  but i can also tell you this : if federalist in europe get their way and something like the united states of europe comes along it will not have a direct vote for president/prime minister/tsar/whatever . 
  right now you have 12 of the 27 eu countries ( i 'm not counting the uk ) have five millions people or less ; there 's no way that they will agree to a constitution in which the five biggest countries carry most of the attention during an election . 
  says who ... ? 
  so what 's with the mexican flag in the middle ? 
  that would explain a lot ... i found weird that only 20-29 % were comfortable with asians when czechia has over 60,000 vietnamese living there . 
  given their geographic proximity in southern europe maybe they should be better integrated ... maybe be just one country ... kind of like a federation of southern slavs or something like that ... i 'm sure someone would come up with a better name ... 
  that 's b.s. 
  i do n't know if you ever saw one of those videos in which they secretly recorded someone walking around and the reaction of other people ... i remember there was one about a woman walking for 10 hours in new york or a jewish man in paris ... anyway , you should do something like that and post it in youtube ... if you can of course . 
  i 'm a black immigrant living in the u.s. and i have a sister living in germany and neither of us have experienced anything close to what you just described . 
  i 'm truly sorry that you have to go through that . 
  i was surprised about the answer to the asian question in czechia ... do n't they have a large and very assimilated vietnamese population ... ? 
  or honest in answering surveys ... 
  well , if the eu is not ready for political union accept that fact and try to works things out from there . 
  fiscal unit without political unit will make things worse , not better . 
  you 're talking about making decisions about taxation and spending without a democratic mandate ; i do n't think the people would like that . 
  and what 's the hurry ? 
  the eu is by far the most successful economic integration project on the planet . 
  why put that at risk because you want to arrive to the promise land * right now * ? 
  you 've ever heard the phrase `` desperation is not an aphrodisiac '' ... ? 
  are n't you putting the cart before the horse ? 
  political union has to come before fiscal union . 
  you 're talking about getting countries who may not be willing to buy into things like wealth transfer and `` reforms '' . 
  but if they 'll go for political union , then you 'll be dealing with your fellow citizens about how to make these other issues work out . 
  [ `` jacket '' ? 
  what 's that ... ? ], 
  saw all these positive comments about rajoy and thought for a moment i was in the wrong sub ... do n't you guys usually think he 's awful ... ? 
  i do n't use android ; in fact , all my life i either used windows , mac os or linux . 
  my first smartphone was a blackberry and from that i switched to ios . 
  still , i 've always use google for search . 
  in fact , android came after google became dominant in search . 
  why not simply propose an eu wide tax ? 
  and there is no eu equivalent of the irs ( according to other posters of this sub to which i consulted in a previous debate ) . 
  my understanding is that the eu is funded by contributions from member states , and without a central tax authority then every country is able to set its tax rate according to what they understand they need . 
   google has , by some definitions , a monopoly on search and on mobile phone oses i do n't think they do ; i have a build-in search feature in my iphone and spotlight search in my mac which i can use to search on the web . 
  however , i prefer to use google search even if it requires me to go to the extra step of opening my browser ( which is google chrome and not safari in the mac ) to do so . 
  google is not making me do this , i choose to do it . 
  so why is that a monopoly ? 
  she 's the one on the left , right . . ? 
  the guy in the picture looks a lot like tony parker . . :, 
  you know , this country has 324 million people and police officers carrie out literally millions of interactions with citizens , some of them under difficult conditions similar to the one you see in this video . 
  statistically the number of people killed by incompetent or simply corrupt police officers is insignificant . 
  every death is a tragedy , more so those that could have been avoided . 
  but every time a situation like this happens it is amplified by news coverage that makes you think that the police is literally a bunch of trigger happy loons killing people just because . 
  european and american media only care about european and/or american issues . 
  nothing wrong with that ... 
  i pay a lot of attention to news media in latin america and things like the protests in poland barely register over there ... 
   maybe it 's because the media is controlled by one and the same people which control merkel wait , wait ... i thought it was the polish government who was controlling the media ...
