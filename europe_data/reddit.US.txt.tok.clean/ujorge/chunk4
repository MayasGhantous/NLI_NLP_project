   young people in poland seem to have their heads up their asses meaning , they do n't agree with you ? 
  by the way , if you look at the results of poland 's [ last parliamentary elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliamentary_election,_2015 ) barely half of the electorate showed up to vote . 
  i think those that had the opportunity to vote and did n't are partly to `` blame '' for poland having a government that you apparently do n't like . 
  [ this never gets old ] ( http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/ben-rhodes-iran-nuclear-deal ) :  in the profile , ** rhodes derided the press corps as largely comprised of inexperienced youngsters who could be easily manipulated ** . 
  `` all these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus , '' he told the times . 
  `` now they do n't . 
  they call us to explain to them what 's happening in moscow and cairo . 
  most of the outlets are reporting on world events from washington . 
  the average reporter we talk to is 27 years old , and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns . 
  that 's a sea change . 
  ** they literally know nothing ** . '', 
  if the critics are like the sample tweets quoted in the article macron should ignore them ; i hope he does n't apologize because honestly this is so dumb , he just expressed a fact and it 's not even clear the context due to some problem with the audio during his speech . 
  what the heck , people in poor countries having a bunch of kids points to a deeper problem-usually a high child mortality rate-that need to be addressed . 
  so where do we start when we want to solve a problem ? 
  you state what the problem is !, 
  what do macron critics do when they have a flat tire ? 
  `` oh well , there 's an unspecified situation that is preventing me from moving my car ... '', 
   . . if eu decides every country have the same level of taxes , there 's no point in paying all your taxes in ireland anymore . 
   of course , ireland would n't like it ... 
  which means that they would n't go along with that ... i have n't look into it , but my guess is that there is a lot of variety among the tax rates of the eu member states and those that have lower taxes will not go along with that change . 
  also , what if the proposed tax rate is lower than what other countries have now ? 
  if country x has a 40 % corporate tax rate ( i 'm making up numbers now ... ) and the new eu tax rate is 25 % it will mean less revenues for them . 
  i 'm not saying your idea does n't have merit , but is not such an easy solution . 
  maybe a mandatory minimum eu tax on top of whatever they charge locally ? 
  btw , that 's why i asked my original question because i thought something like that was in place already ... 
  forcibly nationalized by the eu ? 
  i agree with you that something has to change in the way taxes are collected , but not that they do n't give back to the countries they operate in . 
  people use those services because there is value in them ; i use waze from google every single day to drive around and i 'm pretty sure i would be spending more in gasoline or wasting time stuck in traffic if not for them . 
  multiply that for the millions of users that use similar services for free and suddenly we 're talking about a lot of value and productivity gains . 
  i 'm using reddit for free to gain a better understanding of the eu tax policy , which has some value to me . 
  the examples are virtually endless ... 
  but for end users google 's products are `` free '' ... in fact , the users are the product and the actual paying customers are those paying to place advertisement in front of these users . 
  if what you are proposing is that google pay taxes in country x based on the number of users from that country that click on an ad placed on one of google 's sites , i do n't thin that would work . 
  in the real world if i see a physical billboard , the company that set up the billboard does n't have to pay a tax because i saw the ad and decided to buy the product , so how would you justify that something like that happen in the online world ? 
  thanks a lot ... so it seems like what the french finance minister is calling for is the closing of loopholes in current tax laws . 
  good luck with that ... it 's like playing whack-a-mole ... companies will find another way of minimizing their tax bills ... 
  thanks a lot for the explanation , i 'm just trying to understand what france 's finance minister is talking about here because he seems to be saying that foreign companies are breaking tax laws . 
  i 'm still not clear on how the tax laws work across borders , because you wrote this :  instead of removing our right to govern our economy as we wish , here in the netherlands , other countries should consider changing their laws . 
  ** instead of allowing countries to obtain profits in their country , and use a foreign adress to circumvent paying taxes in said country ** , they should do something about that . 
  again using my example of the irish company selling its products in another eu country like the netherlands : if such company has a subsidiary in your country , that subsidiary has to pay corporate taxes , right ? 
  even if they do n't have a subsidiary and another company is handling distribution of their products , that company has to pay as well , right ? 
  so even if i have an address in ireland , my goods are being taxed ... what am i missing ? 
  they 're not stupid ; that 's were you 'll find people with guns and the [ `` castle doctrine '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castle_doctrine ) give them enough legal cover to shoot anyone who attempts to get inside their home . 
  that 's why they rather trash lefties cities such as [ portland , oregon ] ( http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/30/how-liberal-portland-became-americas-most-politically-violent-city-215322 ) . 
  can anyone give a brief explanation of current tax laws in the eu ? 
  for example an irish company such as the kerry group that is in the food business i suppose pays taxes in ireland and if they have subsidiaries in france or italy they will pay taxes there too . 
  but do they also have to pay taxes to the eu ? 
  is there an eu equivalent of the internal revenue services that collect federal taxes in the u.s. ?
