  it 's just random attacks on people that you apparently ca n't predict and protect against . 
  i think that having armed police officers will change the terrorist approach and make it more difficult to carry out these type of attacks . 
  so he is famous for creating `` beautiful '' architecture that `` falls apart quickly '' and are `` costly to maintain '' and likes to sue people ... it looks to me likes he has a future in politics ... is he any good at p * ssy grabbing ... ? 
  by the way , britain is only one of five countries around the world in which police officers do n't carry guns ( the others are ireland , norway , iceland and new zealand ) . 
  should n't they consider changing this policy given what the public is facing now ? 
  there was a police officer when the attack started , but he was only armed with a baton [ according to this report ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/04/incredibly-brave-stabbed-police-officer-fought-attackers-armed/ ) . 
  if he had a gun he could have stopped the terrorist right there . 
  i do n't agree with the current policy of unarmed police officers , but i understand it given the low level of crime in the uk . 
  also , common criminals are not usually interested in killing people just because ... they want to rob a bank , they rob a bank and hopefully nobody is harmed . 
  but now you are facing people whose goal is just to kill the first person they run across using whatever means . 
  since banning cars and prohibiting the sale of kitchen knifes is out of the question , why do n't at least let police officers carry guns ? 
  that would make things more difficult for these bastards . 
  i 'm an immigrant from latin america and i think that if immigrants have it easier to integrate here one factor that you have to consider is who are the immigrants that are coming here . 
  a large share of the immigrants that come to the usa ( legally and illegally ) are from latin america and even though there are cultural differences between anglos and latinos the cultural jump is not that big . 
  latin americans are mostly christians , they celebrate the same holidays as americans to start with , but we quickly started celebrating traditional american holidays like thanksgivings and halloween and they are now being celebrated back home where i 'm from ( even the `` black friday '' shopping extravaganza ) . 
  i still speak spanish at home , our kids born here are bilinguals but they see themselves a americans . 
  they still have a lot of our culture in them , but again is not such a different culture to the one they grew up in . 
  regarding our muslim immigrants , excluding those that came in as refugees most of those that could afford to make it here are people of means and entrepreneurial . 
  one thing that people notice here is the large number of gas stations and convenience stores that are owned by immigrants from muslims countries . 
  in some of them i notice that they actually live in a room in the back of the store ; that is clearly somebody that is looking to make it , looking at the future and who has no interest in harming this country or who find the message of radicals appealing . 
  look , that is what federalism is about . 
  if california wants to ban fossil fuels and runs its economy on wind and solar power , go ahead . 
  as long as they do n't pass the bill to the federal government they can do whatever they want . 
  i would really like for then to go all the way and raise taxes so they can contribute to the $ 100 billion `` green fund '' ... which is part of the paris accord as well ... i mean , robert mugabe and a bunch of third world dictators got into the paris ~ ~ scam ~ ~ agreement because of all the $ $ $ that rich countries are going to send their way ... so ... pay up , suckers ... 
  jesus ... `` juan '' pronounced as `` han '' ? 
  wtf ? 
   and now he has the eu by the balls . 
  because the eu lets him ; turkey sends around half its exports to the eu , so it 's not like you do n't have some leverage . 
  you just need to play harder than he does ... 
  is that 's the case there are millions of people around the world who would love to relocate there if they 're given the chance . 
  these two countries could choose among them enough people every year to keep the population growing at a sustainable rate . 
  invite young people with college degrees or some demonstrable skill , language proficiency ( at least english , but swedish or german would be better ) . 
  a couple with one kid in which both parents have college degrees and who may want to have another kid ? 
  sure , step in . 
  just go to our local consulate and embassy and fill out the paper work ( that has the added benefit that if they misbehave and break the law you will know where to send them back ) . 
  the current approach adopted by angela merkel and whoever is the doofus runnings things in sweden is a recipe for disaster . 
  letting anyone who shows up in , with no vetting whatsoever is crazy . 
  you do n't know if that person is going to fit in , you do n't know if that person is likely to find gainful employment or if they will be on need of assistance for a long time . 
  [ but this approach works ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21674726-what-other-europeans-can-learn-spanish-efforts-limit-illegal-migration-forward-defence ) :  `` a dozen years ago the first ghastly scenes of drowned bodies washing up on european beaches featured pirogues from hann and elsewhere that set out for the canary islands , a spanish archipelago just 60 miles ( 100km ) off the african coast . 
  in 2007 , ** 32,000 migrants ** reached them by sea . 
  by 2010 ** the flow had slowed to a trickle , with fewer than 200 reaching the canaries by sea ** most years since then . 
  none came from senegal . 
  with hundreds of thousands of migrants now arriving elsewhere in europe , that sounds magical ... ** the secret of spain 's success was co-operation with transit countries ** such as senegal , morocco and mauritania , says gonzalo robles of aecid , the government 's aid agency . '',

  it should be nearly impossible to change the constitution ; it 's basically a contract between citizens and their government and if it going to mean something it has to be enduring . 
  also , i would like to know if in the constitution of an independent catalonia they would include a clause that would allow any of its regions to secede from the country if they choose to . 
  in fact , do you know of any country that includes such a clause in its constitution ... ? 
  any ideas about his motivations ... ? 
  [ the name of the new french president is a very nasty insult in certain latin american countries ] ( http://diccionariolibre.com/definicion/macron ), 
   conquistadors fought time and time again against immensely superior numbers errr ... no ... both the aztecs and the incas had a lot of enemies that allied with the spaniards ... it was n't hernan cortez and a couple hundreds conquistadores that took down the aztecs empire ... but thousands of natives as well ... 
  sorry , i 'm about to sleep but i did read your whole message ... just do n't have the time to address all your points , but that one was important ... 
   `` it is already shifting back to europe ... '' ha !, 
  really ? 
  somehow your allies in eastern europe are not convinced . 
  how 's that going to work ? 
  how many submarines , aircraft carriers and airplanes have europe added to its arsenal since trump was elected ? 
  oh , and do n't come with this `` soft-power '' nonsense . 
  the u.s. and china do that as well . 
  you ca n't even stand up to erdo\u011fan in turkey , even though that country sends half its exports to europe you do n't find the courage to put him in his place . 
  next ... !, 
   `` even then , spain still has the world 's 14th biggest gdp , and 4th largest of the eu once the uk leaves , which , taking into account its population and problems ... '' funny that you mention population , because the future belongs to those that show up and looking at your country fertility rate ... in 2014 was 1.27 per woman ... well below replacement rate . 
  so where are the spaniards that are going to be leading that future world power coming from ? 
  are you going to emulate the germans and bring a bunch of people from the middle east to grow that economy ? 
   '' ... the last two or three hundred years have been pretty shitty for spain ... '' bad luck ? 
  you make it sound like spain had nothing to do with it ... like ... it was just a bad stretch we went through ... what ca n't we do ? 
  you had a huge empire in the americas that you got by pure luck , because you were looking for `` el dorado '' or the fountain of youth ... you know , a shortcut to prosperity . 
  every time i travel around florida or the southern part of the u.s. 
  i 'm amazed at all the lands you were the first europeans to arrive to ... i mean as far as northern california . 
  and what happened ? 
  you became greedy , did n't want anybody who was n't spanish/catholic to settle those lands ... and there were n't many loyalist there to defend the crown when the `` criollos '' got tired of the racket the `` peninsulares '' had and decided to kick them out ... you know , like i said above `` the future belongs to those that show up '' . 
  and if you keep up this nonsense of not even having kids , it would n't surprise me if you lose your homeland in europe as well ... 
  hey , hey ... sorry , this is an argument between an american and a brit ... at least they were ( and still are ) a major world power ... you did n't even have the guts to take gibraltar from them ... so ... stay out ... 
  i 'm an immigrant myself and i know a few things about assimilation . 
  i 'm from a spanish speaking country in latin america and we all still speak spanish at home , eat the same food we ate back home , watch spanish language t.v. , celebrate most of the holidays that we celebrate back home . 
  our kids , born in the usa are more assimilated than we are , but still have a lot of our culture in them . 
  the difference is that culturally somebody from latin america is not that different from people from the usa . 
  we 're all christians and adhere to western values ; although we feel pride about where we come from , we do not hate the country that opened its door to us and the people that we have met . 
  but if we had refused to assimilate and felt contempt for our hosts , our kids would probably feel the same . 
  if someone is not willing to assimilate , his/her kids wo n't either . 
  is that so hard to understand ? 
  it 's not a matter of arguing with xenophobes or surrendering your principles . 
  it 's a matter of common sense : you do n't let in people in your country that are not willing to assimilate or that that are hostile to your values . 
  if you country needs immigrants to do the `` jobs that the locals wo n't do '' there are literally hundreds of millions of peoples in countries that do n't have a history of this crap . 
  have you ever heard of a vietnamese suicide bomber ? 
  besides carlos the jackal in the 70s , has there ever been a terrorist from latin america doing his `` business '' in europe ? 
  ever heard of a hindu bank robber ? 
  me neither . 
  so why this insistence of bringing in immigrants from countries that do n't like you very much ? 
  which one . . ? 
  you know that the immigration law in this country are exactly the same as they were when obama was president ? 
  nothing has changed really ... even trump 's `` muslim ban '' has been stopped by the court . 
  the number of people entering illegally is down by 70 % only due to the perceptions that trump is a hardliner on immigration ... 
  there 's nothing that ca n't be done about that really , so we all going to have to get used to it ... but we know that we try really , really hard we can prevent the whole planet from getting a couple of degrees warmer by 2100 ... 
   apart from some publicity for eu what use is this scheme ? 
  the publicity for the eu is the whole point of this ; just look at the title of this post : `` free wifi '' , which is not really free , they are just taking public funds to do this , funds that had to be raised by taxes , borrowed or reallocated from something else . 
  it 's a scam basically ... 
  it 's good that you admit that you 're an ignorant , and it has nothing to do with your flag ... it 's just a choice you made ... 
  i 'm pretty sure you would be okay with hillary clinton , with her coughing spasms , her passing out due to `` pneumonia '' and only being able to campaign two days a week . 
  you are all a bunch of hypocrites ... if trump was a democrat you will find his personal traits endearing ... like you excused obama inability to put a coherent speech without a teleprompter as somehow being the smartest man on the planet ... what a joke ...
