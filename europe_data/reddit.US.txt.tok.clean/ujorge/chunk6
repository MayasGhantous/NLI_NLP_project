  so macron wants to be the world `` anti-trump '' or something ? 
   trump is fairly old and does n't have the healthiest habits what do you mean ? 
  he does n't drink and does n't smoke ... 
   trump is also probably itching for a trade war no , he 's just looking for an excuse to get a divorce and a younger wife : `` sorry melania ... but i 'm ~ ~ buying ~ ~ marrying american now ... 
  well , the north koreans manage to live without american products ... so it can be done ... 
  i tried that too , but the `` japanese '' car i got was build in tennessee ... 
  i wo n't either !!,

  do you have a problem with reading comprehension ? 
  here , let me help you :  `` the bomber in the adriana grande concert was born and raised in the u.k. , ** but not in a very integrated environment ** ... '' is that better ? 
  now regarding your `` honduras with a high gdp '' remark , let me tell you something you dumb red coat : you are writing your nonsense on an ** american ** website . 
  i 'm pretty sure that all your online presence ( your social media accounts , your searches , your computer and the software that runs in it ) is handled by ** american ** companies . 
  if it was n't for ** american ** power you would be speaking german now , so shut up and go get me a beer ... loser ... 
  well ... yes ... you 're right . 
  let me reword my question : this looks like a very significant change to the way the eu finances and handled . 
  i think to do something like this should require the consent of a majority of the eu countries , not the council just saying `` we will do this '' . 
  the eu is by far the most successful integration project ; correct me if i 'm wrong , but i ca n't think of any economic union between sovereign countries that has achieved what the eu has . 
  but it has been a voluntary union between countries , not an imposition . 
  for the good of the eu and the western world it should be maintained as such , but people like eu commission president jean-claude juncker have this tendency to say `` i know better '' that needs to be kept in check . 
  the bomber in the adriana grande concert was born and raised in the u.k. , but not in a very integrated environment . 
  he grew up in libya , just with colder weather ... 
  this sounds like an political-economic union . 
  do the people or parliaments of the different countries have to ratify this ? 
  this story reads like the ones we 've been seeing on this side from the washington post and the new york times : * the source : `` sources with knowledge of the investigation ... '' . 
  that 's it . 
  here they usually say the same thing or `` an american official . . '' * admission that there 's nothing concrete : `` farage ** has not been accused of wrongdoing and is not a suspect or a target of the us investigation . 
  ** but being a person of interest means investigators believe he may have information about the acts that are under investigation and he may therefore be subject to their scrutiny . '', 
  every story on that topic apparently follows the same template . 
  oh , and this investigation by the fbi started last july ... before trump was even elected . 
  you would think that at this point there would be something more concrete than this . 
  how does ireland `` steal '' taxes ? 
  let 's say apple ireland imports iphones from china and then you buy one in belgium . 
  do you pay taxes on that purchase ? 
  not trying to be a d * ck , just wanted to understand what you call `` stealing '' . 
  i posted that yesterday ... 
  what a way to avoid show that you have no answers . 
  by the way , it was obama the `` young , intelligent ... the smartest man ever to be elected president ... how much europe miss him '' that did nothing while putin invaded the ukraine . 
  so anyone who supported trump = david duke ? 
  is that how it works ? 
   this is such a misleading statement . 
  it sounds like the majority of usu forces were part of nato when in reality the bulk of the us army is in the mena and apac region while the majority of us bases in the eu are purely logistic to support mena operations . 
  the only exception to that is eastern europe on the border to russia but compare that to the rest of the us forces it 's next to nothing . 
  were these facilities built only so the usa could get to the middle east and apac regions ? 
  it 's been 72 years since the last major war in europe ; how do you think that happened ? 
  are you going with the line of the nobel prize committee and say it was because of the eu ? 
  did the eu held back hundreds of soviet divisions at the end of wwii ? 
  those goods coming from asia that the usa navy is protecting in the middle east , where are they heading ? 
  to the economic powerhouses of northern africa ? 
  `` the only exception is eastern europe '' ? 
  you make it sound so insignificant . 
  have you asked yourself why mighty europe needs american troops to show their face in eastern europe ? 
  do n't the people of eastern europe have faith in the capacity of western europe to mobilize and respond with force against a threat from the east ? 
   `` the burden for their defense '' is an empty phrase because it implies that only us forces are holding back the russians . 
  even though french and british nuclear weapons could end life on planet earth on it 's own . 
  so what 's it gon na be ? 
  are france and britain willing to use nuclear weapons to defend the baltic states or poland ? 
  sorry , but i do n't see macr\u00f3n or theresa may doing that . 
  specially if putin would deploy his green men the way he did in crimea . 
  aside from north korea nobody is that crazy to escalate a conflict with nuclear weapons ; it 's conventional forces that will carry the load in a potential war and like i said , it 's your eastern european cousins who are not very reassured of their non-americans allies . 
   what the us really wants is for europe to participate into world policing and nation state building but our foreign policies are just not on compatible . 
  you guys want to bomb people in iraq/afghanistan/syria / yemen / +30 countries ? 
  okay i guess . 
  does n't mean we should build 5 carriers and do the same . 
  not really our jam , especially with your track record of success . 
  maybe not `` dropping bombs '' as you put it , but it 's not unreasonable to ask for europe to act like a world power in its neighborhood at least . 
  take turkey for example : half that country trade is with europe . 
  they need you more than you need them , but this tinpot sultan erdo\u011fan acts like an a ** hole , threatens to send a flood of `` refugees '' if you do n't give him some cash ... oh , and he wants to be part of the eu as well . 
  why is europe unable to put this clown in his place ? 
  i mean , he supported and armed the opposition in syria ... so why should europe take care of the refugees he helped create ? 
  because he does n't fear you . 
  he knows he can get away with it . 
  you 're the rich kid in the neighborhood and he takes your lunch and you do nothing . 
  so , what 's wrong in asking that you be more assertive ? 
  why ca n't you put a mighty fleet in front of lybia and tell whoever is running the place to stop the human trafficking networks that are sending people to their deaths by the thousands ? 
  it seems to me that your neighbors do n't respect you ... 
   `` he was born into slavery because of his mother 's status but was also born into nobility because of his father 's '' i 'm sure this made for interesting dinner conversation ... 
  a lot of those people voted for obama ... twice ... so you 're talking about people that were persuaded to vote for a black man and could be reached if you addressed their needs . 
  instead hillary went full sjw and lost them , specially when he called trump supporters `` deplorables '' . 
  oh , and here they own guns and a boatload of ammunition ... you 're right , they have n't thought this thing through . 
  just double-check the radiation readings on vw nuclear warheads and you 'll be fine ... 
   i think that the eu and the us are stronger together , but for that there must be a mutal relation of respect , which is clearly no longer the case with dt being in the white house trump is trump , he has his peculiar style of talking . . diplomatic language is obviously not his strong suit but i do n't think that asking european powers to carry more of the weight in nato is being disrespectful . 
  also , it 's not unreasonable [ given this ] ( http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/aj201705270029.html ) :  `` washington -- the u.s. navy has decided to deploy the uss nimitz as a third carrier-led strike force to the western pacific to increase pressure on north korea to rein in its arms programs . 
  nimitz , one of the world 's largest warships , will join the uss carl vinson and uss ronald reagan there , sources close to the u.s. military said may 26 . 
  ** it is rare for the u.s. navy to deploy three aircraft carriers to the same region at the same time . 
  this latest decision means that three of the u.s. navy 's 11 aircraft carriers will be deployed in the western pacific . 
  ** there is nothing like what 's happening in the korean peninsula happening in europe right now ; north korea 's kim jong-un in truly dangerous not only to our allies in the western pacific but to the usa if he succeed in developing an icbm or putting a nuclear tipped missile on a submarine . 
  oh , and we 're still in the middle east and afghanistan today . 
   half of our country is rural/suburban and does not have access to education okay ... really ? 
  i do n't know , maybe the school sucks where you live , but claiming that people do n't have access to education in rural/suburban areas ? 
  have you seen inner cities schools ? 
  merkel is just being a realist because if you take a close look at the political landscape in the usa you will notice that donald trump was just giving voice to something that a lot of people believe in . 
  quickly and without googling or following the link : [ who said the following ] ( http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-live-updates-democr-1460688145-htmlstory.html ) ? 
   `` the countries of europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense ... '' what this all means is good luck finding a mainstream u.s. politician willing to follow the policies that barack obama or george w. bush followed regarding nato . 
  look at the good side though : germans have a well-earned reputation for quality , so you can be sure that their nuclear arsenal will be top notch ... 
  okay ... * what . . ? 
  * why a mirror . . ? 
  i do n't get ... whatever ... it 's siesta time !, 
  google `` nikki haley russia un '' . 
  no , they 're not . 
  they were * refugees * in turkey .
