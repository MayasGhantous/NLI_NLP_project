  they are mostly economic migrants . 
  `` no foreigners please '' ? 
  okay , what will it take for whoever came up with this nonsense that opposing ** ilegal immigration ** is not the same as `` hating foreigners '' ? 
  what really gets me is that they know this , but deliberately lied and it 's shameful that in / r/europe this lie rises to the top . 
  bt ** f ** w , i 'm not a native born american ; i came to the usa legally and i understand and accept that i was lucky . 
  many decent people would like to have the same opportunity i had and are either unable to do what i did or have to come in illegally . 
  i get that , but neither the usa or any other other country has the responsibility to take all comers . 
  you want to debate immigration , do it . 
  but debate it based on real arguments , not on this nonsense that `` you hate foreigners just because i say so '' . 
   `` police found several gunshot wounds on the 42-year-old 's body . '', 
  obviously this was a suicide ... 
  well , i do but it 's because i lived in puerto rico for a long time and over there `` macr\u00f3n '' is an insult . 
  i wo n't tell what it means because i do n't want to be banned ... 
  precisely what i mean ... we now have the means to read from people like tim pool that earn our trust . 
  there are a few people like that and some of them are very open to inquiries by people like us . 
  i think it 's more like big media conglomerates coasting on the reputation they earned long time ago when we the public did n't have the tools we have now at our disposal . 
  they hire the proverbial `` 27 years old who knows nothing '' and we are supposed to respect them just because who they work for . 
  that does n't work anymore ; every time something big happens in europe for example i come here to get more context or additional information . 
  it 's not perfect by any means , but it 's better than simply taking at face value what the big media company are reporting . 
  oh , and one more thing : even partisan newspapers like the guardian and the daily mail from the u.k. provide more balanced coverage of events that happen in the usa than our local press . 
  [ agree ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/the-aspiring-novelist-who-became-obamas-foreign-policy-guru.html ) :  ' `` all these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus , '' he said . 
  `` now they do n't . 
  they call us to explain to them what 's happening in moscow and cairo . 
  most of the outlets are reporting on world events from washington . 
  ** the average reporter we talk to is 27 years old , and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns . 
  that 's a sea change . 
  they literally know nothing ** . '' ' journalism here is dead and they do n't even pretend to want to report the facts . 
  good thing that we can verify what is reported via other sources . 
  we can even get in touch with people on the news via social media , or read newspapers from other countries if we need to . 
  good ... you 'll now be forced to watch [ crap like this ... ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5598110/ ), 
  a message to his people ( supporters and opponents ) : `` not only did i get away with beating protesters in the usa , i 'm also asking them for an apology for not letting me kick them some more ... '', 
  so what 's your definition of what happened in libya ... ? 
  the bombing campaign to get rid of muammar gaggafi . . ? 
  that was not an intervention ... ? 
  i did n't know if i should have posted this here or in / r/nottheonion ... 
  i do n't think it 's fair to label as capitalism a system in which the government allows private property but directs them to do something specific and basically make them an arm of the government . 
  also , a regime in which the big players in an industry ( like banking ) control a few important politicians to write regulations that favor them in detriment of smaller competitors should be considered capitalism as well . 
  why is this supposed to be significant ? 
  i often see pictures of crowds like this posted here ( i believe there was a similar one posted from poland a few weeks ago ) about a big crowd in favor of something , usually the eu . 
  but even in hungary i suspect a significant percentage of the population supports the eu , so getting a couple hundred thousand of them marching on the street only tells me about them and what they care for , not what the majority of the country do . 
  some context would be useful , but the top comments right now are about soros ... 
  well montenegro is not part of the eu but they do the same thing too ... [ with just one airplane ... ! ], 
  ( http://media.kval.com/images/120328_firefighting_aircraft.jpg ), 
  why do n't they come up with a law for men as well ? 
  something that will force men to wear an attire similar to the one they force `` their '' women to wear ? 
  i ca n't stand seeing families in which the women are covering their whole body while the men go around in very comfortable western clothing ... even in the summer when it gets really hot around here ... 
  yes ; in mexico that 's how they call americans . 
  in the caribeean is how they call anyone who 's white and blond even if they 're locals . . a chilean friend told me is the same in his country as well, 
  i wonder who would come ahead in that exchange : * [ google `` typical german tourist '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=typical+german+tourist&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiipsqowv7tahwbosykhrk0b-eq_auicigb&amp;biw=1283&amp;bih=671 ) * [ google `` typical british tourist '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=typical+british+tourist&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjfvsaywv7tahvfwiykhwesclyq_auicigb&amp;biw=1283&amp;bih=671 ), 
  i thought all the puritans came here ... 
  so the reason russia is fomenting war in the ukraine is because they disagree with their extreme position on same sex marriage ... ? 
  of course he did ; he was sending a message to his people back home ... `` look what i did in the usa '', 
   the fact that the richest company in the world pays a minuscule % of tax is 1 ) totally morally reprehensible and 2 ) emblematic for the larger problem we face . 
  no , it is n't . 
  just because you feel like that does not make it so . 
  they also have non-english language movies available here , [ like this one ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5598110/ ) ... which i * do not recommend * btw . . 
  i think the dcpd behaved really well given these circumstances , which most have been very surprising to them . 
  they deal with foreign dignitaries and their security details all the time , but i do n't think they were expecting something like this to happen . 
  they could have used more force against these bodyguards and if this had happened in another city or state with more relaxed gun control , a civilian would have been justified in shooting them on self-defense grounds ( it 's almost impossible to get a permit to carry a gun in dc ) . 
  [ yes ] ( https://twitter.com/voaturkish/status/864631567972540417 ), 
  i do n't know if this is what / u/hipp _ hipp_hurra meant , but it is a cultural problem but not because latin americans are inherently violent but because of a lack of respect for the rule of law . 
  in some countries the people at the top are incredibly corrupt , and those below them across all level of government follow their example . 
  if you combine that with low pay for police officers , who do you think it 's going to join the police to protect the public ? 
  they are exceptions , but most of them use their authority to obtain material gain and the criminal cartels know that they can kill with impunity . 
  most of the population just shrug their shoulders and say `` it 's always been this way '' ... and that 's the cultural element . 
  i think most argentinians are used to the roller-coaster that is their economy ; most of those who wanted to leave did it already and a few probably even came back . 
  you are correct that people from those countries you mention are unlikely to move , because they are far away from the level of hopelessness that make people leave their homeland . 
  for example , nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in latin america but you do n't see many of them trying to get to the us illegally . 
  you do see a lot of people from el salvador , even though their economy is in way better shape than nicaragua 's . 
  but el salvador is number two worldwide in murder per capita ( 64.2 per 100k vs 11.3 per 100k for nicaragua ) . 
  crime at that level is a good reason to move . 
  assuming that the theory that europe needs more people is valid ( i 'm not saying it is or is n't ) , there are millions of well-educated people all over the world that will be happy to live in europe . 
  you are right that people from south america are a better match than the `` refugees '' that walked across europe a few months ago . 
  but you do n't have to target a particular region or people ; if germany wants to boost its fertility rate , why not invite 500,000 young couples to move there with some sensible conditions : at least a high-school education ( better with a college degree ) , valuable skills , language proficiency , no criminal record . 
  imho somebody with those qualifications is a good fit , no matter where they come from . 
  violating the rights of people to vote against racial lines is very clearly against the law and any government official who does that is guilty of civil rights violations . 
  there 's not even a question about it , so if this happened you should be presenting those facts . 
  `` such and such did this and this happened to him/her '' . 
  the fact that you have not done that tells me that you do n't have any example . 
  you 're probably referring to the multiple suits that have been filed against voter id laws or redistricting plans , which have to run their course and usually get to a higher court . 
  but that 's very far from the obvious criminal act of suppressing someones vote . 
  again , you have nothing . 
  facts ? 
  preventing people from voting is a matter for the federal government to investigate and prosecute . 
  it 's the only role that the federal government has in the electoral process ( presidential elections are handled locally , you knew that ? 
  ) ; so you 're telling me that republicans prevented people from voting ( a clear civil rights violation ) and the obama administration did nothing ? 
  yes , the brennan center and wikipedia ... very reliable sources you have there . 
  what happen , could n't find the democrats website ? 
  do you have any facts to back that up ? 
  or like always it 's just a `` feeling '' that you have ? 
  barack obama 's election in 2008 holds the record of most votes ever gotten by a presidential candidate , even though the country had less people there than it had in 2012 and 2016 . 
  you did n't answer the question ; if the republicans are `` suppressing the vote '' it does n't matter who the democrats run because his/her supporters will be unable to vote ... that 's what voter suppression is supposed to do . 
  that 's not my definition , i just did a cut and paste . 
  well , outside of the popular vote thing the comic is correct then because working class voters gave him the victory . 
  trump spoke out against globalization and trade deals ; he spoke about closed factories and his simplistic language appealed to working class voters . 
  does n't matter , those are not the rules here . 
  and i 'm willing to bet that if the eu turns into a federal union you will not have direct elections either . 
  trump has a lot of policies that are associated with the left , and his opposition to nafta is one of them . 
  he defended planned parenthood during the campaign , and he 's more in favor of socialized health care than of free-market solutions . 
  but democrats do n't care about policies , they just care about power .
