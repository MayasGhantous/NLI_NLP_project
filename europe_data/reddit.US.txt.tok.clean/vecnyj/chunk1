exactly, 
  trump is leading the republican polls almost entirely on his anti ( illegal ) immigration stance . 
  i think we 'll be okay . 
  america is i think 75 % of all nato military spending . 
  they 're still refugees , but they can be deported . 
  you do n't see that happening in america though . 
  can you seek asylum from conscription ? 
  ha , we have the same slang in america - we say `` gypped '' to mean cheated or screwed . 
  not really pc either but there are n't really any gypsies here so it is n't a big deal . 
  if shit goes downhill i think we can pinpoint just where we lost our direction as a country . 
  what rights does he care about that bush does n't ? 
  bad news , walmart is n't stocking ar-15s in america anymore either . 
  okay ? 
  i was explaining the 70k comment . 
  the us takes lots of refugees , but few syrians so far . 
  that 's odd , because the libertarian position is usually open borders . 
  they are n't leaving them in syria , they 're leaving them in turkey , lebanon , or jordan . 
  but if they illegally migrated they 're both refugees and economic migrants imo . 
   thus we could wall off the whole border with mosques . 
  this is the best compromise i 've seen yet . 
  who says no ? 
  a refugee that enters illegally from a safe country is still technically a refugee , but they can be punished for illegal entry . 
  that 's my understanding at least . 
  they should seek asylum . 
  what 's the message ? 
  that you can use an even shittier boat because the eu will save you ? 
  i 've definitely heard our media talk about that ; i think it was on an npr podcast . 
   ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ** did you miss that part ? 
  that 's bizarre to me . 
  horseshoe theory in action i guess . 
  were you explaining this to americans ? 
  because i saw almost total support for the artists . 
  american muslims are more moderate by most measures . 
  also there are n't enough of them to form subcultures . 
  i think he means less than it is now . 
  maher has always been anti-islam though , not exactly a typical american liberal . 
  well it 's the nyt , that 's their style . 
  that 's happened a few times from journalists and everyone laughs at them . 
  even african-american is a dumb term imo , because most have n't been to africa their entire lives . 
  or just a liar, 
  it means that they can be deported of they enter illegally . 
  oh , he tried real hard to shut down guantanamo bay , but those darn republicans thwarted him . 
  would any company want to be in britain if their executives could n't make as much as in another country ? 
  pro-russian leftists ? 
  hillary and sanders voted together 90 % + of the time . 
  she 's almost as leftist as he is . 
  they stopped using that currency in 2009 . 
  dylann roof looks like a psycho to me - he did n't smile in a single picture i saw . 
   god help europe . 
  do you mean allah ? 
   technically speaking the case can be made for any country with access to sea accepting asylum-seekers from any other country with said access , if you stretch it enough . 
  if the country is unsafe i guess , true . 
  so also eritreans . 
   that 's why the plan is foolproof . 
  what plan ? 
  do you mean the building a fence plan ? 
  other than that yeah that 's what i thought i was just checking . 
  so the only refugees europe really have to take are libyans . 
  it 's about setting a policy . 
  if the policy is that dublin obligations do n't matter and migrants can go welfare shopping , it will lead to far more than 800k coming . 
  if your policy was to cut off entry after 800k then the argument that 800k is n't a big deal would be fine . 
  if they do n't request asylum they are entering illegally and can be deported , correct ? 
  also nuclear, 
   ignoring the obvious problems in terms of international law, 
  do you think only 800k desire to live in europe ? 
  keeping such statistics would be racist !, 
  should n't it be mutti merkel ? 
  there 's nothing inherently wrong with that , but they are being treated as refugees when they are not . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_general_election,_2018#opinion_polls sweden democrats are over 20 % and very close to second place . 
   also it 's to be assumed that the extremists rather stay than flee . 
  as those polls show , support for sharia is n't an extreme position in the middle east . 
  link ? 
   ** good ** political philosophy . 
  are those weapons taken from abandoned iraqi army posts ? 
   russia is also in favor of assad , who the us is trying to remove from power this is just not true . 
  for instance , our government 's attempts to train syrian rebels largely failed because we were trying to get them to fight only isis and not assad . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/politics/united-states-training-syrian-rebels-ashton-carter/ ) . 
  yes , i think eventually the us [ want assad out ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/15/politics/john-kerry-negotiate-assad-syria/ ) , but they currently are n't doing anything to accomplish that and are focused on isis . 
   can someone explain me what is the alternative ? 
  if europe does n't take refugees but the refugees do n't get the memo and still continue storming in , what should europe do ? 
  deport to refugee camps in turkey . 
  send money to turkey so they will take them . 
  this is what the gulf states are doing , and they do n't have any problem with refugees swarming their borders . 
  compassion is n't a good political philosophy . 
  asians are the highest performing race in the us by income , education , etc , so i 'd say they 're doing just fine . 
  but you also have to deport non-syrians , which probably wo n't happen , correct ? 
  no , the problem was * leaving * communism , just look at the decline in 1991 . 
   stateless persons ** lawfully ** in its territory if they were n't granted asylum and refused to leave they would be there unlawfully , correct ? 
  that 's because we get somalis who can afford a flight halfway around the world . 
  they were the biggest though, 
  i seriously hope islam is not the reality of the modern world . 
  they banned coon town . 
  i am also american and usually check this sub for updates on the migrant situation . 
  i do n't comment a lot though because i do n't know as much as most users here about european politics . 
  you 'd have 18 % of the population , but england would be the most populous state by a lot , so they 'd be under represented in the house . 
   nation-state ( nationalism/where turkey is ) -  territorial state/civic nationalism/pluralism ( most of the west ) what 's the difference between these two ? 
  and that 's from last year . 
  the numbers are probably even more lopsided now . 
  nationalism is better than islamism i guess . 
  75 % live within 100 miles of the us border .
