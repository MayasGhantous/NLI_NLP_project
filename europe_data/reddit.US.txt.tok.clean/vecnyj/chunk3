  star wars , pizza , the super bowl , american exceptionalism , that sort of thing . 
  and yes , we 're more divided now than in the past , but nothing like the insular muslim communities in europe . 
   many liberals and whites actually embrace and encourage the replacement of the white citizens that historically made up this country . 
  being american has never been about being white , imo . 
  there 's no `` ethnic american '' like there are `` ethnic french '' . 
   sorry america is a facade , the dream is dead our liberties are not respected and the government works to keep us powerless in the face of ever growing regulatory and bureaucratic expansion into our lives . 
  i mean , i think the government is too powerful , sure , but i do n't think it 's irreversible or the end of the american dream . 
   violence is so endemic depends where you live . 
  we may be geographically segregated , but we have a unifying culture . 
  immigrants in the us are much closer culturally to western values than the migrants going to europe . 
  most of that is exaggerated . 
  if you do n't live in a shitty area gun crime does n't really affect your life . 
  does europe give all that to immigrants ? 
  medicaid , social security disability , pell grants ( for college ) , food stamps , public housing , that sort of thing . 
  yeah , i would n't want to leave either . 
   immigrants can get decent benefits in the us right , but i was talking about a us citizen . 
  as in , could a us citizen move somewhere and get better benefits than they would have received in the us . 
  i figured the members of that sub were already graduated . 
  it 's not like you can claim asylum from the us . 
  if you 're poor i think it would be pretty difficult to emigrate though . 
  would n't you need a lawyer in the new country or something ? 
  are there any countries that give better welfare to immigrants than you 'd get in the us ? 
   / r/iwantout is mainly american seems odd that they 'd want out . 
  that 's not hypocritical . 
  he might think that privately funded space exploration is fine , but that there are better ways to spend public funds . 
  1/32 native american of course . 
   should we decide on each war which side we support ? 
  yes . 
  tell that to our lizard overlords . 
  it 's also because clinton grew up poor . 
  trump is n't far right . 
  not long ago he supported abortion and universal health care . 
  well , no . 
  what do you think `` intersectional feminist '' means ? 
  honestly if there 's another isis inspired attack soon before the general i think the gop is guaranteed a victory . 
   i have no doubt that someone properly trained ( like a police , who should have been there ! ), 
  can take care of the situation . 
  maybe you should have some doubts , as the police failed to take care of the situation in this exact case . 
  traditionally , marriage has been between a man and a woman . 
  that 's what traditional marriage means . 
  how is he different ? 
  he still thinks it should be illegal . 
  george washington approved the system that elected obama , though . 
  did peter ever intend for there to be a role like the pope ? 
  for context , 19 % of democrats do as well . 
   on a side note , when is canada finally going to get around to superpower status , eh ? 
  when it becomes the 51st state . 
  i do n't think anyone seriously believes that . 
  kind of dumb for people serving a life sentence though . 
  is it any more arbitrary than the moment a baby is born , or deemed viable ? 
  sdf is n't fighting assad right now , so they wo n't be targeted by russia . 
  also russia has been pretty friendly to ypg . 
  there 's better evidence in [ this article ] ( https://undercoverinfo.wordpress.com/2015/11/20/isis-survives-largely-because-turkey-allows-it-to-the-evidence/ ) , but i would n't call it proof . 
  cia and saudi backing gives you international legitimacy now , apparently . 
   agree with a sentiment , opinion , or ideology . 
  you can agree with their ideology without agreeing with their methods . 
  america is n't hated , we 're polarizing . 
  probably because the incident involved a russian plane getting shot down ( russia is the victim ) and this thread involves russia being petty and opportunistic ( russia is the bad guy ) . 
  pretty sure nato would still win that . 
  of course , in a nuclear war everyone loses . 
  true . 
  that does n't mean canada has more military strength than russia . 
  it means that canada + allies has more military strength than russia + allies . 
  [ mfw my state is grouped with canada ] ( http://i.imgur.com/32kcxqx.gif ), 
   ** russia would probably rekt 1v1 france ** , but no europe , or nato . 
   pretty sure this is what matters when comparing individual nations . 
  would you say canada is a better military power than russia because usa/nato would back them up ? 
  why has n't turkey invoked it over the pkk ? 
  after the taliban had already been overthrown . 
  al qaeda was sheltered by afghanistan , not pakistan, 
  with troops on the ground , a few weeks, 
  because the us found an opportunity where the costs were minimal . 
  i 'd bet they are 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants , but i guess we 'll find out . 
  those are the costs . 
  the benefit of killing jihadi john was not worth that to the us government . 
    if we can kill isis in 2 weeks , why was jihadi john alive and killing americans for many times that amount ? 
   as i said , civilian casualties and us military casualties, 
   than why did the war last longer than a month ? 
   because we were an occupying force after that point . 
   if we were n't incapable of killing jihadi john `` in 2 weeks '' than why did we let him kill americans when he sent us video saying he would ? 
  as i said , civilian casualties and us military casualties . 
   america lost all of those times , and sadly they 'd lose again . 
  america has not lost a war in the middle east . 
  not sure where you 're getting that idea . 
   i hope you can live with yourself when thousands of young americans are dead , fucking armchair soldier . 
  i 'm not saying we ** should ** wage a ground war against isis , i 'm saying we ** could ** , and ** would ** easily win . 
  that 's just ridiculous . 
  they have ~ 80k fighters and no air force . 
   the iraq war lasted a month ? 
   the iraqi army lasted a month . 
   you 're proposing that we knowingly let americans get beheaded by jihadi john even after he gave advanced warning ... do you think the us military was incapable of killing jihadi john ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  no , but intentions dictate the scale . 
  if the us was targeting civilians there would have been far more dead . 
   or else the us is complicit in all the atrocities they 've done while we let them continue ? 
  as much as we are complicit in the atrocities in north korea . 
   i do n't see how you can logically think we just flip a switch and kill em ' . 
  with troops on the ground , we easily could . 
  we defeated the iraqi army in less than a month . 
  we just do n't want to lose the lives it would take .
