does n't kent state deserve to be mentioned too ? 
  how confident are you that selective policing is n't the root of the apparent disparity ? 
  too soon . 
   but do they have factories around sometimes , i suppose . 
  but i would n't list that as thee defining characteristic . 
  especially now that american manufacturing is much smaller . 
  in the south there were a lot of textile mills and `` mill villages '' both inside and outside of the cities . 
  so i guess that could work . 
  anymore though , those old mills are being converted into apartments . 
  in the northern `` rust belt '' there are other clever examples of repurposing industrial zones . 
  bethlehem pennsylvania , for instance , turned the local steel mill into an arts venue ( you can see in background here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jrocojifs ) . 
  that perception is a function of economic realities within racial categories . 
  you can certainly have mostly white ghettos -- they 're called trailer parks here in america . 
  * slum * might be another word to consider . 
  muhahahaha !, 
  our plan is working !, 
  nothing serious would happen ( maybe a backward glance ) in a southern city . 
  possibly something more aggressive in a small hick town , but unlikely . 
  people who actually give a shit are heading toward nursing homes and the grave . 
  ghetto or hood . 
  serious question : what would this likely be spent on ? 
  i was interpreting it more as `` get on boat and drink '' rather than `` get on boat to go buy cheap alcohol -- possibly for later use '' . 
  the incongruity is that ( at least in the states ) booze on a luxury cruise ship is outrageously expensive . 
  cruise companies will actually search your luggage for alcohol . 
  some people engineer external bladders and tape them to their body to avoid paying the exorbitant prices . 
  fuck cruises . 
   but he clearly went overboard, 
  is `` booze cruise '' common parlance outside of uk/us ? 
  when the us congress adopted an income tax over a century ago they realized that it would be bad if corporations just `` stuffed money under the mattress '' . 
  so they put rules into place that stipulated companies could only hold so much in cash . 
  this pretty much worked as intended . 
  over time thousands of companies who had put too much money away were penalized . 
  then in 1986 a few small lines were added into the tax code that said something to the effect : the cash on hand rules stay in place , * unless you move the money outside of the us * . 
  and that 's when we started seeing a lot more of these off shore tax havens . 
  today , if i buy viagra , the profits almost all go out of the us as a royalty paid from pfizer-america to pfizer-switzerland . 
  and this transaction converts the profits from taxable income into a tax-deductible expense . 
  as long as the money stays off-shore the taxes do n't need to be paid . 
  then these offshore entities turn around and use their profits buy american treasury bonds and we ( the american taxpayers ) pay them in the form of interest !, 
  [ corporate inversion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_inversion ) ( like double irish ) allows companies to move their hq ( at least on paper ) to bermuda , barbados , the caymans -- or [ as apple testified to you can become a resident of `` nowhere '' ] ( http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/05/21/2043251/how-to-close-the-loopholes-that-made-apples-tax-dodging-completely-legal/ ) -- where there 's no congress to collect from you . 
  effectively neutering the irs completely and allowing corporations to stuff as much money as they 'd like under their mattresses ( estimated at about 1.5 trillion usd [ as of 3 years ago ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-irs-idusbre96n1ib20130725 ) ) . 
  perhaps eventually this money will find its way home , but since 1986 quite an incredible amount of real wealth has been siphoned away from the country that built and maintained the institutions and infrastructure that enabled the wealth creation in the first place . 
  personally , i think it 's criminal any way you want to look at . 
  i think that axiom is slightly backward . 
  power attracts a type of person who is more likely to be corrupt ( or is more easily corruptible ) . 
  it 's at least two factors , not one . 
  i think [ something like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_dominance_orientation ) represents the other side of the equation . 
  this is a misconception . 
  few major corporations pay the stated rates on the books . 
  there are a number of loopholes and policies that can be exploited to reduce the effective rate . 
  for instance the `` double irish exploit '' is used by many ( most ? ), 
  large us corporations . 
  they create 2 subsidiary entities in ireland and the cayman islands , then `` buy '' some bullshit `` licensing '' from said foreign corporations to make their domestic income appear much lower . 
  i ca n't believe it 's allowed . 
  http://visualeconomics.creditloan.com/double-irish-deception-how-google-apple-facebook-avoid-paying-taxes/ ps : not corporate , but , apropos from front page 2 mins ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4d5ygq/til_facebook_cofounder_eduardo_saverin_renounced/, 
  there are imams that will sanction just about anything . 
  there 's , apparently , quite a lot of room for interpretation . 
  imagine if there were large numbers of christians following old testament rules and stoning people for ignoring the sabbath . 
  there was a time when that was reality , but our society , thankfully , moved past it . 
  i think , to some degree , the muslim world is going through their puritanical witch-hunt crazy period . 
  plus , this assumes countries can find sufficient evidence that an individual was involved in treasonous / terroristic acts . 
  if there are that many ne'er - do-wells in your midst , the investigative challenges seem a much bigger problem than what to do with them once uncovered . 
  i wish i knew how to properly pronounce some of these words and phrases . 
  i have a good finnish friend coming to my wedding and it would be fun to surprise her . 
  do you know of any good guides for that sort of thing ? 
  as for the ubiquity of english , i feel somewhat obliged to apologize for that . 
  i like english , sure , but i do n't know if it deserves to be the de facto standard . 
  perhaps its genderless nouns and simplified conjugation are good features though . 
  again , thanks for providing such thoughtful responses . 
  wow . 
  thanks for the detailed response !, 
  it 's interesting because even though `` allness '' is n't really a word , its meaning still comes through in the metaphysical/poetic way you describe . 
  i have no idea how you are able to pick up english so ( seemingly ) well . 
  it must be challenging . 
  that , or you 're incredibly smart people with excellent educators . 
   vergeless oooooohh . 
  that 's an excellent construction too . 
  * limitless * is a common word , but * vergeless * is harder to skip over . 
  kinda stops you in your tracks . 
  i need to borrow that . 
  thanks . 
  i like * allness * . 
  can you tell me how that might be different from universality or ubiquity or infinite ? 
  i just want to express my gratitude and astonishment , particularly toward the scandinavian contingent who often speak english better than most natives . 
  nice troll though . 
   there is some very uninformed opinions and your opinion was a classic example of it , and the other comments reinforce my point . 
  ah , so there 's the crux of it . 
  you think i 'm one * those * americans . 
  i mentioned my great-grandfather simply to note why i would have any knowledge of father barnardo ( which i think is fairly obscure information in mixed company ) . 
  that 's 1/8th of my muddled background from which you tried to infer quite a lot . 
  i 'm somewhere in between offended and amused on that . 
   my point is you come across as a badly informed pseudo hobbie nationalists of a nationality you do n't exist in and never will . 
  are you being serious ? 
  i understand there are a large number of ( i can only imagine ) insufferable americans who arrive on your shores trying to reconnect with an unremembered past . 
  however , whatever `` pseudo hobbie nationalist '' horse shit you 're talking about was invented in your head -- not mine . 
  i 'm on this sub because i have to spend a lot of time in europe and i like to keep tabs on the general goings ons . 
  furthermore , while i admittedly do n't spend a lot of time keeping up with the welsh rugby team or how the ranger 's are fairing , i 'd hardly classify myself as `` badly uniformed '' . 
  i 'm tempted to ask you to shove that comment back up your ass . 
   if you really cared you could look shit up without the kindergarten use of sources that makes every educated person think you 're a nutcase . 
  yes . 
  fuck you .
