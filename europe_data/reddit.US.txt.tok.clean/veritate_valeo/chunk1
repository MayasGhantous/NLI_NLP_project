the scariest issue is not the nuclear precedent . 
  the scariest issue is that the post-wwii world order that did n't allow any country to annex other territories by armed force has crumbled . 
  that sets the stage for further russian action , or chinese . 
  the us has n't been in the annexation business since more than a century ago . 
  i 'd be worried about china . 
  one thing i 'm fairly certain of is that everything is built around , and will collapse without , putin . 
  when he entered power he made a `` grand bargain '' with the oligarchs : they get the wealth , he gets the power . 
  there are many people who get very rich the way things are , but no alternatives for an individual who can hold it together . 
  for a long time the obama administration thought that medvedev was a `` second in command '' and attempted to work directly with him , perhaps to give him some legitimacy in the eyes of the russian people , but the putin regime just took this as a sign of how badly the us did n't `` get it '' . 
  after the death/removal of putin , whenever that is , i foresee a very protracted conflict for power , because there will be no quick and obvious choices . 
  i do n't think it 's as much a question of sharing power in the eu institutions . 
  i think it 's much more a question of the fact that western europe already has domestic tension with some muslims as it is ; allowing turkey to the eu and eventually schengen , with the free flow of capital and people , is seen as a potentially huge source of domestic instability . 
  `` but teacher , why did n't the british ever try to go around the other way ? '', 
  '' ... well ... they did ... but there was a country in the way . '',

  `` turkey , the country of turkey . '',

  they 're too tiny to affect demographics or politics . 
  enda kenny looks like david cameron 's irish half-brother . 
  excellent info , thank you !, 
  that 's what i 've begun to figure out from my own research . 
  thanks !, 
  this . 
  the convoy is a total red herring , meant to distract the world 's attention from the real smuggling operation . 
  i think this is the real reason that the europa universalis games end by 1820 . 
  l'arc de triumph has the best view in paris , hands down . 
  do n't be pedantic . 
  it 's in the paris conurbation . 
  i can understand luxembourg , but why malta ? 
  most african liberation groups were marxist or had ties to the anc ? 
  that 's news to me , can you back that up with a source ? 
  to my understanding african liberation was certainly not just a phenomenon of the left ; there were islamic revolutionaries , tribalists , etc, 
  `` 0-140 '' is a really large range . 
  surely paris and calabria do n't have the same rates of heart disease . 
  for me the most fascinating part of global warming is the expansion of sea routes . 
  in this picture , for example , there is a sea route from central asia to the mediterranean and beyond . 
  imagine how that changes global geopolitics : there would be no more power struggles over who gets whose pipeline , who can shut off whose oil - you could just have sea lanes of tankers connecting turkmenistan , for example , to the rest of the world . 
  is n't the idea that they 're * against * unions ? 
  race , or culture ? 
  no , they 've hated the west ever since the west promised not extend nato in the face of russia 's post-ussr weakness but then blatantly extended nato right up to russia 's doorstep . 
  i 'm currently a m.a. 
  student at the university of oklahoma , united states , concentrating on ttip - the transatlantic trade and investment partnership , otherwise known as the transatlantic free trade agreement . 
  could you perhaps share any thoughts about the positives or negatives of this agreement , or the major challenges in negotiating what would be the largest free trade deal in history ? 
  i sincerely appreciate it . 
  it 's cool that we actually have phonecam footage of this happening . 
  it looks like a blast from 89-91 but it 's right now . 
  turkey still gets istanbul so in terms of economics and population it 's not too bad . 
  no , but american amish speak `` pennsylvania dutch '' which is actually not dutch but a variant of deutsch . 
  oh , sorry , did n't we tell you ? 
  we took them . 
  we needed something to balance out hawaii . 
  the us phrase is * e pluribus unum * , * out of many , one * . 
  since when is `` united we stand '' a us motto ? 
  in spain it seems that everyone , even in nice restaurants , uses crappy boxes of ground coffee and yet it usually comes out tasting okay . 
  everyone seems to drink coffee at any time of the day or night , especially when you 're supposed to be at work , but if you fall into this trap and attempt to order a `` caf\u00e9 con leche '' ( by far the most popular form in madrid ) at * lunch * , you will get stared at bizarrely by everyone . 
  perhaps having such a high minimum wage is a hurdle to higher employment ? 
  yes you 're totally right . 
  but it would take a decade for that movement to be big enough for laws to change , and during that decade the non-tippers would look like dicks and the waiters would go poor . 
  but unfortunately when the latter is institutionalized in the culture and in wage laws , the employers succeed in turning compassion against customers , i.e. 
  tip or the poor waiter will starve . 
  i ran out of space on the paper, 
  it 's totally there !, 
  if the people of the balkans ca n't figure out their borders , how 's an amateur cartographer supposed to do it ? 
  do your worst !, 
  i wo n't be greedy : just the ones we have military bases in . 
  rename it `` constantinople '' and i say you 're in . 
  i think for the sake of historical nostalgia , the capital should be at aachen/aix-la-chapelle . 
  great answer , thanks !, 
  what 's up with northern portugal ? 
  it was just an example of price variance , i was n't claiming that it has especially cheap mcdonalds . 
  prices vary by huge margins throughout the us . 
  to live at the same level of comfort as $ 50k in birmingham , al , you 'd have to make $ 120k in nyc : http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/ the usda suggets that prices of something as simple as eggs can vary by 40 % between regions [ source ] ( http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/5976/2/467973.pdf ) ; now add in additional variations in cost of transport as well as minimum wages , business taxes , and operating costs that are built into the price , i do n't think a variation of $ 3.75-6 .00 for a big mac meal is that outlandish at all .

  cautious , yes . 
  changing the way you dress to match the standards of their former country , certainly not . 
  they would probably feel more comfortable if more germans learned arabic as well , but why does the burden of change fall on the host country and not the refugees ? 
  logical , sure . 
  efficient ? 
  do you know the word for `` speed limit '' ? 
  i 've thought about trying to use some postpositional adjectives , but it never sounds appropriate . 
  `` mmmm , that was a salad delicious ! '', 
  english does have a small inventory of postpositional adjectives borrowed recently from french , like `` extraordinaire '' and `` martial '' and `` general '' , so perhaps it would have to build from there . 
  neither one is more logical than the other . 
  germanic languages tend to have prepositional adjectives , romance languages tend to have postpositional adjectives . 
  the eu and us both tacitly support moroccan claims . 
  ** edit ** actually , quite a few countries * openly * support moroccan claims ( in red ) . 
  redditors love guy fawkes masks and v for vendetta but completely ignore their goals of making massive symbolic points . 
  no one 's using crete these days . 
  / # 1 rule for starting a political movement : do n't dress like hitler . 
  especially if your movement already reminds people of nazism . 
  thank you very much for the translation !, 
  thank you so much , i highly appreciate the translation . 
  i would of course never assume that pegida is representative of germans or that all germans sympathize with it , fear not . 
  i am also well aware that there is an enormous gulf between their words and actions , and that pegida seems to have become a catch-all organization for all the far-right , anti-immigrant , racist groups both in germany and around the eu . 
  * he who controls the present ... *, 
  this should be the finns ' unique building in civilization . 
  flood sparsely populated upland valleys to not flood heavily populated coastal areas , yeah . 
  it sounds dumb , but a large increase in dams and reservoirs * would * keep more water out of the oceans and mitigate rising sea levels . 
  nor do you know shit about jokes , it would seem .
