are you listening to the ww1 podcast ? 
  it 's incredibly gripping . 
  our cathedral . 
  plus , we used to be capital of england ( well , wessex ) . 
  when i was in china everyone kept saying `` niga ... niga '' . 
  such casual use of racial slurs !, 
  i was shocked ;-), 
  is anyone saying that ? 
  home : windows 8.1 on desktop xubuntu on virtualbox for development os x on laptop xubuntu on laptop ( via virtualbox ) work : mostly windows 7 , though ubuntu sometimes depending on what i need to do . 
  it 's the same in the uk . 
  i 'd imagine similar in the netherlands as well . 
  the usa certainly is n't as diverse as `` europe '' ( comparing a continent to a country is idiotic anyway ) , but you seem to have some pretty ignorant ideas about regional differences in the usa . 
  the difference between , say [ gullah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gullah ) , [ appalachia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appalachia ) , the [ louisiana creole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louisiana_creole_people ) , and others throughout the usa is far more than simply a `` different kind of pizza '' and an accent : there are very real linguistic , cultural , and religious differences between those people . 
  in addition to minority groups , / u/dzukian pointed out , there are political gulfs between people from california , vermont , and texas , for example -- to the point that ( solely anecdotally ) my friends from san francisco and philadelphia are far closer , politically , to my british ( london , hampshire and newcastle based labour or lib dem types , mostly -- i do n't know any ukippers ) than than to my south carolinian friends . 
  that 's not enough to call it a different culture , to be sure , but -- again -- far more than you seem to imply . 
  honestly , since moving to the uk , i 've noticed that most british people think they know a lot more about the united states than they actually do . 
  it 's our fault -- american cultural output , especially mass media , tends to focus on particularly wealthy segments of the country . 
  in addition , hot tourist destinations like orlando do n't really require visitors to interact much with the natives . 
  i 'd suggest , if you 're really interested , that you read a little more about us society before saying things like . 
  watch some shows highlighting minority groups in the us , or documentaries on appalachian , gullah , creole , native , mestizo/chicano , african-american , etc. 
  cultures . 
  even among mainstream american culture , differences exist -- the religious beliefs ( or , more likely , lack thereof ) of a san francisco tech worker are very distinct from a louisianian revivalist . 
  yes , some americans say some pretty stupid shit online . 
  but try to inform yourself rather than sink to their level . 
  and no , / r/shitamericanssay is not a good source for objective cultural analysis . 
  it 's not . 
  calling someone an `` oriental '' has a racist undertone though . 
   if you dont know chomsky you should google him , i can tell you this guy is one of the most realiable sources you can get i agree with noam chomsky on israel , but calling him `` one of the most reliable sources you can get '' is a step too far . 
  he has a heavily biased view -- which is ok , everybody has their own biases , but get your news from a variety of sources . 
  i did n't realize that was an american thing . 
  it 's done in the uk as well . 
  do they charge for tap water in germany ? 
  epoisses is , supposedly , banned on the parisian metro due to its odor . 
  in all seriousness , though , it 's one of my favorite cheeses . 
  i love reblochon and epoisses . 
  i discovered tartiflette last year ... just fantastic , and so easy to make . 
  nothing complements a nice day at the slopes so well . 
  she just sticks her pistol in a fold . 
  free holster !, 
  i 'm very glad he 's mentioned that . 
  russia 's been so subtle and humble about its military power lately , it 's a bit refreshing to see that change . 
  i hope putin 's timing was better than the translator 's . 
  there 's only one european country today that 's shown an aggressive intent to expand and militarily annex land from other sovereign nations while making increasingly threatening gestures toward its neighbors ... 
  regardless of the morality , i think both sides have to admit that sending a damn biker gang to fight is is one of the most * fucking metal * things a sovereign state can do . 
  i do n't think this is one of those meals where you feel really good about yourself after you eat . 
  is n't sausage casing just pulled intestine anyway ? 
  if anything , i 'd think the stomach would be preferable . 
  it 's further upstream from where things start getting messy . 
  [ here 's what it looks like after cooking . 
  ] ( http://images.fxcuisine.com/blogimages/scotland/deep-fried-pizza/scottish-deep-fried-pizza-05-1000.jpg ), 
  i really like kefir -- i had it for the first time visiting ukraine and drank it quite a lot after that . 
  i did n't realize it was one of the ingredients in \u0160altibar\u0161\u010diai though -- i ate the shit out of that when i was in lithuania . 
  my british girlfriend thought i was a freak ; she could n't stomach it at all . 
  interesting , i did n't realize it was banned . 
  it does exist in the states in some places ( though i 've only personally had it in the uk ) ; i guess they make it without the lung . 
  those british gravy meatballs are pretty good too . 
  haggis has such an infamous reputation in the states . 
  i was shocked when i first tasted it : it 's a lovely flavor . 
  i could eat haggis and faggots all day . 
  that 's a shame . 
  even though i suppose an individual can adopt or they can do a staggered adoption , it still seems quite regressive by demeaning same-sex relationships . 
  people did n't think the passengers would be vaporized . 
  i think the idea was that the explosive decompression would be so intense that the passengers would lose consciousness before they realized what was happening . 
  nope . 
  oed says it 's usually treated as singular : http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mathematics, 
  russia and ukraine , i do n't know anyone personally who went to belarus though . 
  though i do n't know anyone who studied in bulgaria , i know people who 've visited ( and i 'd love to see sofia someday ) . 
  not really . 
  i knew plenty of people who studied in eastern europe . 
  that fear does n't really exist anymore . 
  `` mathematics is hard '' , because `` mathematics '' is singular . 
  thus shortening to `` math '' ;-), 
  some british people get * so * worked up about someone saying `` math '' . 
  it 's like they do n't understand dialects exist . 
  so it 's * not * plural . 
  would you say `` maths is hard '' or `` maths are hard '' ? 
  american apparel still does , right ? 
  i may be wrong their . 
  their ceo is a cock , unfortunately . 
  gucci vutton and abercrumbie and filtch are also safe . 
  yeah , i 've definitely met people here who say stuff like `` sure i speak french , i can say ou est la bibliotheque and je voudrais un biere '', 
  it completely depends . 
  in san francisco , being religious is weird . 
  it 's less religious there than where i live in the uk . 
  in south carolina , the opposite is the case . 
  religion is all-pervasive , and there * are * some people who would judge you for being an atheist . 
  that being said , i was pretty open about my atheism ( well , i did n't wear an `` i 'm an atheist '' sign but i would n't hesitate to bring it up ) and i never faced discrimination . 
  i do n't think they knew they were . 
  apple 's photostream is very poorly messaged and , quite frankly , i think this exposes the fact that we simply do n't teach the non-technical public enough about the risks of cloud storage . 
  calling these girls `` stupid '' is an intellectually easy copout that brushes over the need for education about and legislation around cloud services . 
  eu commissioner `` dumb '' for not understanding the nature of the ~ ~ beach ~ ~ breach ( damn ) or cloud storage , i say . 
  this is such a monumentally stupid argument , imo . 
  the only reason people have trouble visualizing metric is due to imperial education -- something we should be getting * away * from . 
  that 's ridiculous !, 
  if you showed off your car and started dropping brand names , people would think you 're quite strange . 
  the pro-us stuff is not really accurate either . 
  if you 're meeting an american for the first time , it may not be best to unload your criticism of american foreign policy , but the same applies to meeting , say , a german for the first time . 
  or vice versa . 
  intellect and nationality do n't really correlate -- that 's a bit of a 19th-century idea . 
  i live in southern england , but there are quite a lot of fat people here , too .
