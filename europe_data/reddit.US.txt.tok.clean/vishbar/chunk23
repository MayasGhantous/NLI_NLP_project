  i googled `` icelandic phrases '' , 
  i kid , i kid . 
  just as a counterpoint , wolves * do * help keep the deer population in check , which currently has to be done by hunters and wildlife management services ( i do n't know the precise name in the uk ) . 
  well , it 's `` adapted '' in the same way kfc , for example , is nominally american soul food adapted for a global audience . 
  it became a bit bland and generic and stripped the exotic flavors and meats -- for example , a lengua ( beef tongue ) taco probably would n't go down as well with a western audience , but it is incredibly delicious . 
  edit : i 'm not on a moral crusade against adaptations of food , by the way -- i just miss a nice taqueria :-), 
  fishing fleets , too -- there are usually big blotches of light off the shore of japan . 
  yes , definitely . 
  the antlers look pretty awesome . 
  also , random fact , mooses ( meese ? ), 
  are the most dangerous wild animals in alaska . 
  they kill many more people than grizzly bears , mainly because people expect them to have the temperament of cows rather than the horned angry half-ton death machines they really are . 
  yes , i know , i edited my comment a bit to make it more clear . 
  not british , but i live in the uk ... go out for a curry at least once during your trip  and if you enjoy beer , go to a proper pub and try a cask conditioned real ale . 
  you can ask the landlord what he recommends . 
  every pub will have at least three or four behind the bar . 
  you can tell ; the taps look different than keg taps . 
  hahaha , seriously ?!, 
  [ that reminds me of this fine russian fast food chain that certainly is n't related to anything else . 
  ] ( http://en.colette.fr/content/wp-content/uploads/club/itemidem/files/2009/03/makdak.jpg ), 
  fewer the teeth , better the food . 
  apparently the early explorers were familiar with american deer , which are significantly smaller , so when they saw a larger one they thought `` hey , that looks like an elk [ your elk ] ! '', 
  they 'd never actually seen an elk ( moose ) in person , so they figured they were the same . 
  then , when the moose appeared on the scene , i guess they figured `` well , we need a name for this one again ... hey indian , what do you call it ? 
  fine , moose it is '' . 
  we 've kept the native name for reindeer , though -- they 're generally called `` caribou '' here . 
  i 'd always heard that a reindeer is a captive caribou , but i do n't think that 's true . 
  really , we should just call american elk wapiti . 
  i did n't realize this , but apparently that 's true . 
  we actually have another animal we call elk , though . 
  moose/your elk : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moose our elk : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elk apparently our elk does n't exist in europe , only in siberia , china , and parts of central asia . 
  absolutely !, 
  i 'd kill for a taco truck in the uk . 
  do n't take the mexican food you get on the continent as any indication of what real mexican food is like . 
  i did n't think i really liked it that much until i moved out to california . 
  the rule with mexican restaurants : the better it looks , the worse it 'll be . 
  freestanding restaurant in a nice section of town with a full bar , kind waitstaff , and team of professional chefs ? 
  tex-mex garbage . 
  tiny little shack that looks like it 's one step away from a cockroach infection and a person at the register who does n't speak any english except `` five dollar please '' ? 
  * amazing * lengua tacos that 'll blow your socks off . 
  uk mexican food is all `` tex-mex '' , which is really an american thing -- basically , mexican food suited to the western palate . 
  it 's quite a different thing to the actual mexican food served in mexico or parts of the southwestern usa . 
  the relationship is a bit like the british curryhouse curry compared to actual indian cuisine ( even the word `` indian cuisine '' is silly as each state has its own culinary tradition ) . 
  ah , interesting , so they are . 
  people love hog hunting in the us too , in no small part due to the lack of regulation around them . 
  ps , you 've double posted , 
  damn . 
  i need to move up there before you guys declare independence . 
  i would n't worry about safety !, 
  when i lived in california , i spent a lot of time hiking in the sierra nevadas . 
  you really almost never need to worry about animal attacks -- the old adage `` they 're more afraid of you than you are of them '' is definitely true !, 
  i 've only had one up-close encounter with a bear : i drove with some friends up to the town of mammoth lakes , where we were staying in a hotel to stage our backpacking trip for the next day . 
  some idiot had left cans of food in the back of his truck , and a bear smelled it and started ripping his shit apart to get to the food . 
  it was at 1am , though , and bears are usually quite skittish -- if you shout , they 'll run right away . 
  snakes , on the other hand ... i am not such a fan of snakes . 
  when you 're hiking in the desert and you hear that `` tssstsstssstss '' of a rattlesnake ... well , make sure you bring an extra pair of pants . 
  are you sure they were that big ? 
  if so , maybe it was a pair of stray dogs ... 
  the animal lovers oppose sterilization ?!, 
  in the us and uk , at least , stray animals are spayed or neutered as soon as they 're brought into the pound . 
  boars are n't really cool -- they 're quite a menace as they tend to breed and eat like crazy . 
  in some parts of the us , you 're allowed to kill wild boars without any sort of license or limit as the population is getting completely out of hand . 
  edit : i was wrong about boars not being cool -- i 've been looking at boar pictures on the web for the past couple of minutes and they 're quite neat-looking animals -- but that does n't change their potential for becoming an invasive species . 
  * real * mexican food . 
  edit : and shops open later than 4pm on sunday . 
  a couple months ago , as my `` farewell '' to the usa ( i 'm currently living in the uk ) , two friends and i hiked up to [ minaret lake ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/minaretlake.jpg ) in the sierra nevadas during the perseid meteor shower . 
  we set up our tents , and at night just layed out on the rocks watching the stars fall with a big pipe full of medical grade weed and a nalgene bottle full of whiskey . 
  the elevation there is around 3km , so the stars are amazingly clear . 
  it was a nice night . 
  i agree about the baltic states , i 'm also a huge admirer of them . 
  that 's one reason i compared the lvl to the eek and ltl -- structurally similar economies that had wildly varying currency values . 
  i was n't trying to take credit * away * from latvia whatsoever . 
  the ops premise , however :  anyone know why the dollar is at 1.35 per euro even though their economy should be doing far better than ours ? 
  is based off an entirely false premise , and the reply  a strong economy is not the same as an expensive currency . 
  is correct -- many strong economies do n't have expensive currencies , and a snapshot of exchange rates tells you very little about the economies involved . 
  it grew quickly , yes , but not necessarily more quickly than , say , estonia , even though a lat was worth far more than an estonian kroon ( before it was phased out in favor of the euro , of course ) . 
  my point is that you ca n't necessarily judge the strength of an economy by the * absolute * exchange rate of its currency . 
  the entire eurozone does n't issue debt -- debt is issued by the sovereign states of the ez , so there 's not a great way to compare the two as they 're separate financial models . 
  i guess i 'd disagree with your final point -- the perception of americans is that we 're in * huge * debt . 
  i think many in the us would be surprised to learn that our debt/gdp ratio is similar to that of france . 
  i gave you one . 
  though it 's not a * weak * economy , per se , the latvian lat is much more valuable than the us dollar , lithuanian lita , euro , and british pound , though its economy does n't outperform the others . 
  [ go to this site and look at historical exchange rates for the lat since 1995 ( the earliest this tool allows ) ] ( http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates/ ) . 
  it has * never * traded even at parity with the dollar -- in fact , it never broke below 1.5 usd to 1 lat . 
  i do n't think anyone would argue that the latvian economy was stronger or more stable than the united states , or france , or germany , or the uk . 
  an economy in absolute shambles with an expensive currency would be more difficult to find as yes , to an extent , extremely unstable currencies tend to be devalued . 
  however , you ca n't judge the american economy as less strong just because 1 eur = 1.4 usd . 
  useful information only comes when you examine swings in value between currency pairs . 
  edit : i just read your edits . 
  nobody thinks the eurozone has a * weak * economy , i 'm just taking issue with the implication that absolute exchange rates are a good ( or even remotely useful ) way of comparing two economies . 
  it 's not * that * much worse , though . 
  when you 're talking about the debt level of the eurozone , you 're talking about the debt level of 17 different sovereign entities . 
  again , sorted by descending debt to gdp ratios , the us scores * below * belgium , france , italy , greece , and ireland , and not that much higher than spain -- this is using the averaged world factbook and imf numbers . 
  most of your points are correct regarding the us dollar vs. euro . 
  however , the fact that an individual euro is worth more is really a meaningless statistic -- currencies will not and should not be judged as directly competing for parity . 
  nobody would say myanmar and south korea are on equal economic footing even though 1 myanmar kyat = 1.1 south korean won . 
   us has a higher debt than eurozone . 
  it is as bad as the worst euro offender , greece , and there is absolutely no political will to rein it in . 
  really ?
