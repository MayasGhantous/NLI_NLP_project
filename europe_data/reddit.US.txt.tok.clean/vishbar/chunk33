  anyone who says that you should `` look over the rim of your hamburger '' is obviously an idiot . 
  you do n't * need * to pump up the argument with a bunch of stupid bullshit about how you 're so culturally sensitive . 
  barsoap comes off as the greater douchebag here fwiw . 
   could n't you just roll the nsa , ss , homeland and parts of the fbi into one big agency ? 
  haha !, 
  there 's a reason we call them tlas ( three letter agencies )  i agree that homeland security seems redundant . 
  but each agency has a different mission , different responsibilities , and , more importantly , different rights . 
  keep in mind , the us was founded on a principle of limited government . 
  the reason the fbi , cia , and nsa are separate ( at least in the case of fbi vs cia/nsa ) is that the cia and nsa are forbidden from operating against us citizens at home . 
  since the cia/nsa have limited military powers , there is an idea that the government should never use military powers domestically . 
  i can get behind that idea . 
  the secret service is a weird one . 
  its job is to protect the president and thwart plots against the president 's personal safety ... and also to catch people counterfeiting currency . 
  i have no idea why they act in that regard . 
  well , * primarily * the first . 
  you hear a lot more about the latter -- after all , `` fbi agents solve routine crime involving interstate license fraud '' is n't as juicy as `` fbi agents caught wiretapping illegally '' or something . 
  they definitely deal a lot with the intelligence community -- one of their responsibilities is investigating national security threats within us borders , in addition to counterintelligence work -- but considering they do mostly ordinary law enforcement , i do n't know if they could really be called an `` intelligence agency '' . 
  it depends on how you define the term , i guess . 
  they are a * very * different beast to the cia/nsa . 
  edit : you could probably call certain branches of the fbi intelligence agencies , like the [ fbi national security branch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fbi_national_security_branch ), 
  ha ha ha he speaks english so funny ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ supports ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ violent ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ repression ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ homosexuals ... 
  it 's interesting to see him speak . 
  i really did n't know what his voice would sound like -- he 's almost always either dubbed or subtitled , so i do n't usually pay attention to the sound of his voice . 
  this is the most pathetic yet hilarious argument i 've seen on the internet . 
  `` i 'm more culturally sensitive ! '', 
  `` no , i am ! '', 
  `` i am !, 
  i studied in a bunch of different continents . '', 
  i studied in russia !, 
  i bet you do n't speak as many languages as me . '', 
  both of you come off as * incredible * douchebags . 
  i guess i agree . 
  that would explain why the us is doing so much worse economically than the eu collectively . 
  the uk was generating prism reports . 
  there seems to be an idea in the subreddit that somehow european governments are on a moral high ground ... it seems like many of them ( the netherlands , the uk , the belgians ) either had direct knowledge and access or were being shipped data . 
   so a case can be made for using public funds to create original content that combines quality with mass appeal . 
  how the danes pull it off beats me . 
  the bbc does it , too !, 
  in fact , some of the best american documentaries , radio programs , and non-fiction shows are created by public broadcasters . 
   incidentally , danish cinema and tv film has never been in better shape . 
  do you have some suggestions of danish tv shows and movies ( other than the pusher series ) worth watching ? 
  preferably subtitled in english , 
  yes , but traveling outside the schengen region -- i.e. 
  to the uk , ireland , croatia , etc. -- still requires a passport . 
  plus passports are more commonly used as identity documents in the eu than the us . 
  trade does n't create anything , but it allows for a more equitable distribution of resources . 
  if germany has a surplus of foos but a shortage of bars , and the us has a surplus of bars but a shortage of foos , a free trade agreement allows that to even itself out . 
  trade does n't create inequality ; if anything , it does the opposite . 
  free trade agreements can have some distorting effects when put into place between an economic superpower and a developing or less-developed nation ( e.g. 
  nafta between us and mexico ) but western europe is at an equal level of development as the united states . 
  there 's no reason not to institute free trade . 
  well , traveling to asia and the us are two different beasts . 
  i wonder what percentage of europeans actively travel to asia , and how that contrasts with the amount of people who do so in the us . 
  i think that vacation has * some * to do with it , but i think the main reason is the extreme costs of travel for americans and the fact that many may not be used to traveling internationally -- those europeans who have traveled to asia are probably quite used to handling themselves in a foreign culture where they do n't speak the language . 
  the same americans who would otherwise do so probably go to europe as a first vacation . 
  edit : also , the geographic diversity of the us leads many to simply travel domestically . 
  for deserts , there 's the southwest , for beaches , there 's los angeles/hawaii/myrtle beach , for skiing/mountain climbing/hiking , there 's the sierras , appalachians , and rockies . 
  many americans would rather not spend the thousands of dollars it requires to get to europe/asia when vacations at home cost a quarter of the price . 
   also do n't you think that this might be the reason americans are so insular ? 
  like only 40 % owning a passport ? 
  i think that has more to do with $ 1200 + flights to europe , compared to $ 300 flights to colorado for skiing . 
  the trade agreement is with the european union , which does not include moldova . 
  that being said , no , i do n't `` accept '' it , and i think the us has a lot of challenges in that regard . 
  * every * nation has challenges and areas in which it 's not succeeding , and the us is no different . 
  it 's definitely something that needs to be addressed by public policy . 
  keep in mind , though , that us states have lots of economic diversity as well . 
  just like europe includes sweden and romania , the us includes massachusetts and mississippi . 
  it 's very disingenuous to imply that the us somehow has a lower median standard of living than , say , greece or italy ( or even the uk or germany ) simply is n't correct . 
  yes , we have longer tails , but the majority of citizens live quite nicely . 
  its primary purpose is federal law enforcement and investigation of crimes that cross interstate borders . 
  like any other police organization , it has intelligence components ( wiretapping , confidential informants , that sort of thing ) , but the majority is investigation . 
  it does n't do patrolling and that sort of thing , though . 
   there is a extreme income inequality . 
  median income -- which is n't affected by outliers -- is significantly higher in the us than in europe . 
  there is a huge overlap between the 40 million without healthcare and food stamps , and when compared to the entirety of the population , is 12 % -- definitely a large amount , but not massive . 
  one thing i have to remind people on this site : working conditions , and life in the usa in general , is not * nearly * as bad as it seems by reading reddit . 
  the us is a highly developed nation with a set of challenges , but working life here is n't wage slavery at all , and in fact the vast majority of us citizens life extremely comfortable lives and tend to have quite a bit more disposable income than their european counterparts . 
  if wages fall in spain , free trade with the us and canada would allow for easier american and canadian investment in spain ( i.e. 
  building factories ), 
  both sides will benefit from free flow of capital . 
  trade is good , and reduction of barriers makes it even better . 
  killing the trade agreement would n't be `` standing up '' to the us , it 'd be cutting off europe 's nose to spite its face . 
  i agree with / u/taenk , and i think there are better ways to foster french culture than potentially blocking a trade merger between the two largest economic juggernauts in the world today . 
  the nsa really has very little to do with tariff levels , and keep in mind that many european governments ( including the uk ) were complicit in the intelligence-gathering . 
  yes , most uniformed police ( and ticket-maids ) will enforce traffic laws . 
  a beat cop may not ticket you for parking at an expired meter , but i believe they have that authority . 
  also keep in mind that the us has a higher percentage of people on the roads at any given time than most ( all ? ), 
  european nations , so additional traffic enforcement is necessary . 
  i do n't know about the ordnungsamt , but would n't the fbi be counted ? 
  it is , essentially , the federal-level law enforcement entity . 
  i wonder about , for example , the dea . 
  edit : here is a definition : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/glossary:police_officer `` police officers generally include all ranks of police officers including criminal police , traffic police , border police , gendarmerie , uniformed police , city guard , municipal police . '', 
  so i guess they 're including stuff like border patrol . 
  i do n't exactly know what is considered `` secret service police '' though . 
  yes , definitely . 
  the uscis ( i think that 's who the border agents work for , or maybe they just grant visas ) is one of the most bloated , convoluted , and frustrating agencies of the federal government . 
  the nsa would * never * grant them direct access to surveillance databases -- they 'd get flooded with dumbass calls from high-school dropout border agents who ca n't tell cyrillic from arabic . 
  i 'm sure the nsa and other intelligence agencies communicates certain information , but almost certainly in the form of `` no-entry '' , `` suspect '' , `` arrest on sight '' , that kind of thing . 
  one `` advantage '' of iraq is that the coalition forces obliterated the standing iraqi military in days : combat was massively asymmetrical . 
  in syria , though , both sides are much more evenly balanced , with no end in sight to conventional combat .
