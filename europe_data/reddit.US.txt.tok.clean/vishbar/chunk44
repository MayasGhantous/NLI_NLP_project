  comparison with a few others : [ russian navy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fkoov2d.jpg ) - i could n't find a better infographic , please comment if you do [ chinese navy ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gt-s1ao0djo/venhm5c2tri/aaaaaaaafa8/a5f663xlimm/s1600/china%2bnavy.jpg ) [ american navy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/awvktlr.jpg ), 
  note how the flight deck is empty , 
  oh , yes , definitely ; an asian or african citizenship combined with a european or american would probably end up best . 
  you 'd have to make sure the other country allows dual citizenship , however , as many do n't . 
  i was just curious about that specific combo as it 's relevant to me , 
  i wonder what the best * dual * citizenship to hold would be ? 
  i 'll get british/american dual nationality at some point , it 'd be interesting to see how that combo stacks up against germany . 
  seriously , it 's like # 1 for ~ 500g ( probably less due to dissolved gas ? ), 
  here . 
  argentinians are getting a raw deal . 
  when i was in peru i drank a good amount of inca kola . 
  i quite preferred it to coca cola . 
  argentina seems amazing . 
  excellent beef , beautiful mountains , and fantastic wine . 
  what else could you want ? 
  maybe we 'll see the first radstag soon ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's a polish shop near me -- i always see the ads for carp in december . 
  i 'll check it out this weekend !, 
  [ me right now ] ( http://www.thefirearmsforum.com/attachments/fat-man-little-gun-500x375-jpg.47001/ ), 
  i think it depends on what you 're used to . 
  i grew up in an area of the us famous for it 's seafood , so cured herring was an instant hit with me . 
  i think my british girlfriend would be put off , though . 
  well of course , i figured that went without saying . 
  now where 's a flag i can salute from my motorized wheelchair ? 
  interesting . 
  i used to drink kefir a lot in the usa , but i have n't looked for it here -- hopefully it 's not too difficult to find . 
  also , i 'm surprised you found it hard to find dill !, 
  i use it quite a lot when making salmon . 
  anyway thanks for the recipe -- i do n't think i can wait until summer to try it , though !, 
  it might be a weekend treat ... 
  i make tartiflette sometimes at home when it 's cold , wet , and dreary . 
  it 'll take a few years off your life , but it 's amazing . 
  haring is delicious as well . 
  in fact , that ( and stroopwaffels ) are probably the culinary highlight of the netherlands to me . 
  i could eat those haring rolls they sell in amsterdam all day . 
  i hate these ignorant comments about the united states . 
  we do n't just shout at each other like that , we empty a magazine from our pistols into the air as well . 
  i think the color is quite striking and beautiful to be honest . 
  is it difficult to make ? 
  despite my flair i live in the uk and had n't thought about making it myself . 
  we have a polish shop in my area but i do n't know if they 'd stock lithuanian goods , though i work in london and could find it there . 
  i feel like the former ussr 's soup game is completely on point . 
  i have n't found such delicious soups in the west as i 've had there . 
  i ate borsch at some no-name russian border town from a tiny cafe and it was still divine . 
  [ lithuanian saltibarsciai ] ( http://integrateisgreat.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/saltibarsciai-65378658.jpg ) . 
  my dream is to one day get waterboarded with saltibarsciai . 
  * so * nice . 
  maybe schweinhaxe as well ? 
  unfortunately a lot of that is up to the studios . 
  they seem like they 're trying to clutch onto the last vestiges of a dying business model . 
  there 's the issue of potential industrial espionage by the government as well . 
  that could cause foreign companies , especially those involved in r&d , to take pause . 
  hahaha , you 're just * trying * to get a shillelagh to the face , are n't you ? 
  * eats popcorn *, 
  forest schools are somewhat common here in the uk . 
  my partner , a teacher , really loves that style of play . 
  i 'll probably send my kids to one . 
  loads of people in the uk have multiple credit cards . 
  also , multiple cards does n't mean you have your finances out of control . 
  it can be a very rational move . 
  sounds like you might be struggling with some financial ignorance !, 
  frontline is an excellent series in general . 
  i always liked the navy ad for the seals : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmta7gwxcpo, 
  it 's not . 
  and there are loads of other `` footballs '' where the feet are n't used much . 
  it 's because the game is played on foot rather than horseback . 
  he 's a big putin fan , so likely he 'd take a russian approach to syrian airstrikes with less discrimination against civilian casualties . 
  why should the rest of canada get to dictate whether or not saskatchewan is part of nafta ? 
  trump right now , is getting about 35 % of the republican vote , and trump is * nobody 's * second choice . 
  the majority of americans are pretty terrified about a trump presidency , so i 'm almost hoping he gets the nod : unlike rubio , trump ca n't appeal to the center . 
  errr ... how would a satellite be able to tell the presence of 2 civilian hostages in a stronghold ? 
  it 's definitely a sad situation , but these kinds of things happen in war . 
  it 's not like is signposted exactly where they were keeping their hostages . 
  be rational . 
  harper lee and umberto eco in just a few days ... 
  it 's a real shame . 
  umberto eco was one of my favorite writers growing up . 
  baudolino is excellent as well . 
  honestly i 've loved all his books so far . 
  i do n't think david cameron 's going to push for any regulations * limiting * animal sex ... 
  i definitely know more about slovenia . 
  i did a bit of travelling with some slovenes and have always wanted to visit -- have n't got the time yet , unfortunately . 
  slovakia seems really nice too , though . 
  i 'd love to do some climbing in the tatras . 
  fear ? 
  i take it you 've not been to norfolk ... 
  anti-establishment candidates have been gaining ground all over the world , not just in the usa . 
  if bombing hospitals is cool , we should call russia miles davis . 
  [ switzerland has some even stranger traditional sausages . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dog_meat#switzerland ), 
  reference to this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_meat_adulteration_scandal it 's common in some european countries as well . 
  are you familiar with your history ? 
  the us has long been a proponent of a strong , united europe . 
  i think it 's also incredibly a joke . 
  no need to get salty , your decaying fish is salty enough . 
  horse is very tasty . 
  it 's eaten as a matter of course in mongolia ( and , until recently , the uk ) . 
  i am originally from sc but lived in california before moving to the uk i completely agree . 
  you can not find a decent peach in ca ( or in the uk ) compared to a locally-grown sc peach from a farmers market . 
  i guess the variety is different ?
