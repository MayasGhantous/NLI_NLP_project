the average price for one square meter of * residential floor space * in manhattan is worth over us$ 15,000 . 
  commercial is usally more . 
  land would probably be an order of magnitude more . 
  google : `` average square meter price manhattan '', 
  ah looks like eu is catching up to the `` cut funding , blame incompetence , point fingers '' politics that us has been practicing for ages . 
  [ ref1 ] ( https://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/8/11/1410611/-republicans-who-cut-and-tried-to-defund-epa-now-attack-it-for-not-preventing-colorado-mine-spill ) [ ref2 ] ( http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/cdc-failures-on-ebola-are-not-from-phantom-budget-cuts/ ), 
  this is ridiculous . 
  cameron should visit us to argue against trump , hillary or whoever he prefers . 
  this is an international phenomenon , the fact that english is the current lingua franca . 
  for example , japanese protestors protesting against china would put up signs in english !!, 
  what they meant is `` phonemic orthography '' , it is a spectrum with english being more phonemic than maybe french but less phonemic than most other european languages . 
  it 's not hard if they hire some competent strategists or speech writers . 
   we promote a more inclusive society , a more cosmopolitan society . 
  we are outward looking . 
  we want to making foreign investors feel right at home . 
  we want to attract talents from far and wide , etc. 
  their current `` nonwhite '' vs `` white '' rhetoric is not going market very well . 
  it is only required for `` free trade '' of service economy . 
  for example , * consultant/contractors * technology ( though this could be teleconferenced to some degree ) * actors/artists/models / athletes/special talents ( though most countries already have special visa for those ) * installation based projects * infrastructure contracts * education * logistics, 
  it is a guardian article . 
  even if this was a serious proposal , it clearly favors uk way more than it favors eu in the short term . 
  of course guardian is going to cherry-pick something like this for publication . 
  i am sure there are other proposals would favor the eu ( like charging uk single-market access fee so high that makes up for the economic damages of brexit on the continent ) also they could put the single market as part of this 7-year deal . 
  as in uk would need to renegotiate or lose the single market at the end of 7 years . 
  that would make this a pretty good deal for some on the continent , as they could tell uk business/talents `` you have 7 years to move to continent '' . 
  since they ca n't go to the negotiating table until article 50 , there 's no point posturing now . 
  the only thing they can do right now is unilaterally voiding the treaty , which is pointless , and would weaken their negotiating position . 
  brexit created jobs !!!!, 
  ( for the lawyers ), 
  maybe `` black box '' on non-autonomous cars too ? 
  cause you know planes are flown by humans for most part , and they have black boxes . 
  countries are still soveign . 
  eu institutions and legal system are result of treaties formed by those soveignties . 
  it is entirely possible for all countries except uk to disband eu and form a new entity that is immediate successor . 
  however , it is unlikely as it would shift quite a lot of legal and economic risk onto eu members, 
  that 's a false dichotomy . 
  the statement would make all elected leaders with low approval rating a dictator . 
  * have companies/cities go drain uk jobs/market/companies * a new treaty like `` treaty of lisbon '' that create a new version of the union without uk, 
  in the super long-term ( decades ) , it does n't make a difference . 
  capital investment moves slower than labor , but eventually it would shift towards countries that can provide the highest return ( usually poorer areas ) . 
  in the medium-term ( years ) , free movement allow for faster adjustment ( e.g. 
  china 's internal migrants , us 's silicon valley ) , so that region as a whole is more competitive . 
  for policymakers , the questions usually are * does my country want ( such and such industries ) ? 
  * how do we supply labor for those industries ? 
  * how do we supply capital for those industries ? 
  * if we do n't have all the resources , do we want to cannibalize existing industries for any of those ? 
  * if we do n't have all the resources , do we want to partner with other countries to do this ? 
  the industries might be high tech , like chip fabrication , medicine , aerospace , etc. 
  it could be low tech , like call centers , garment , etc. 
  or anywhere in between . 
  it is entirely depending up how well the country positions itself in the long-run . 
  probably varies from country to country . 
  some countries may want to use this opportunity to gain favors for help in other places ( e.g. 
  un security council ), 
  yes , small country 1 could restrict market access multinationals as well . 
  but no multinational would kowtow to small countries to gain access to their market . 
  you do n't need to `` corrupt '' smaller counties , you just go bargain with them because their negotiating position is weaker vs multinationals . 
   hello , ( small country # 1 ) , do you want me to locate my business in your country ? 
  if so give us low corporate taxes , so we do n't go talk to ( small country # 2 ) . 
  for major countries , they could just tell the corporations to fuck off and set up regulations so its harder for the multinational to enter their market . 
  not only might the multinational lose out on the major country 's market , they also risk opening themselves to future competitors from the country . 
  dragging it out is only advantageous to uk if uk and eu are the only 2 parties on the playing fields . 
  that is not the case here , there are a number of parties who are not bound to any treaty , which can act in such a way that would be disadvantageous to uk : * eu businesses seeking to edge out uk businesses * eu cities seeking to edge out uk cities * uk/eu business seeking to reduce loses * eu entities currently operating in uk * scotland, 
  easy :  dear london businesses , are you tired of not knowing your future and the constant fluctuation of the gbp ? 
  fear not !!!, 
  move to ( eurozone city ) , we will given you a 5 year tax exemption rebate , and ask about our employee relocation service . 
  -- ( eurozone mayor ), 
  that might be too much for the current generation to chew on ( the fact that they would 've been better off if they had stuck with the status quo ) , but just wait until all those people retire in 40 years , i am sure the new generation would n't care about their parent 's mistakes . 
  of course if this does lead to a restructuring of the eu that both sides can agree is better and claim responsibility , then i do n't see why not even in the current generation . 
  simple , give tax breaks to all the uk businesses that move their operations to eu until a new treaty is signed . 
  i am not saying that 's a good idea , but if delaying strategy is something that uk plans to do to wait for better opportunity , then this would be one of many nobs that eu/non-exiting country could do to protect their own negotiating position . 
  i am sure spain could be persuaded if rest of eu pledge support of its claim on gibraltar . 
  i am also pretty sure uk can persuade spain to veto scotland with co-administration of gibraltar . 
  iana expert , this is just my gut feeling from years of playing civilization . 
  not surprising . 
  with maybe few exception , businesses generally like big homogenized markets . 
  you can play that game too : * trump administration - the regime * trump tower - the compound * trump wall - the orange curtain * trump trade deals - trump mercantilism, 
  can the eu declare ambassador as `` persona non grata '' ? 
  not really sure how diplomatic immunity works with supranational entity like the ue . 
  if it does , i assume that could be done here if he becomes too annoying . 
  britain definitely had a competitive edge in financial services . 
  however , that might be on the chopping block with the negotiation . 
  the populous in most countries hates banks , but with right policy/regulation , banks are actually competitive advantage in globalization , as you can divert capital to fund investment-intensive industries ( e.g. 
  technology ) . 
  missile defense is not effective if the adversary is a major world power . 
  they can easily develop an [ effective decoy systems ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnsr7dxhdcy ) . 
  however , for soft power , missile defense and [ nuclear latency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_latency ) are probably the better choices . 
  a drop in import should already be happening because gbp is already deprecating in value . 
  a $ 20000 import ( e.g. 
  car ) that would 've cost # 15500 before june should now be around # 17500 . 
  european goods would be more expensive and less competitive ( if there 's locally sourced competition ) in the uk regardless of how brexit negotiation goes , just to what degree . 
   financial stability risks around [ the eu exit ] process are greater on the continent than they are in the u.k. is he suggesting the continent is too reliant upon british financial services ? 
  and would be adversely effected if the access is lost ? 
  sounds like insinuating bs without actually saying it , so people ca n't call him out . 
  i am sure there 's enough non-british institutions willing to expand their liquidity/swaps/insurance offerings in the next few years . 
  newfoundland and nova scotia block most of it . 
  the part in direct line of sight is probably florida . 
  i thought that 's the purpose for `` life with parole '' . 
  the convict would serve a life sentence , but if they are deemed safe , they can be released with parole . 
  aixtron is a public company , right ?
