you 'd think that the mediterranean would fit the bill for having a fixed range of temperatures , though i suppose it as a mostly-closed body of water is much younger than the oceans , so i guess there 's less time to evolve . 
  yeah , it was originally reading about the [ sargasso sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sargasso_sea ) that made me think about that -- why you only have it in one place . 
  my guess is because of the circular currents , causing floating things to not leave the place , so floating plants experience a fixed range of temperatures . 
  wow , thanks !, 
   the event coincides precisely with a catastrophic decline in carbon dioxide levels , which fell from 3500 ppm in the early eocene to 650 ppm during this event . 
  we 're worried about passing 400 ppm today . 
  you know , i am kind of surprised that in all the history of the earth , no species has ever successfully managed to just grow on top of the ocean and grab all the solar energy for itself , cutting off everything beneath and starving the oceans , just creating a giant mat of vegetable matter on top . 
  in calm lakes , you have [ duckweed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lemnoideae ) and similar floating plants , but there is n't a plant that has `` covered the oceans '' . 
  i suppose that the issue is that the currents invariably carry any floating plant to some part of the ocean where the temperature is n't suitable for it to survive , and it dies there . 
  plants ca n't stay in one place , it 's too deep for plants to anchor themselves , and if you try growing out from shore , there 's an increasing amount of stress placed on yourself as you grow out longer . 
  still , given the number of things that can enter dormant state and then revive later when conditions are reasonable , it 's amazing that no plant has ever managed to just float and grow when it can . 
  fortunate for us , i guess , but still surprising . 
   sure !, 
  could you remind me where are lybia , mali , nigeria , somalia . . ? 
  i 'm somewhat a bit clumsy about geography ... africa . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're getting at . 
   protecting muslim brotherhood i 'd say that the primary concern was european energy security as part of the cold war . 
   the us literally tore down their nato commitments nato commitments do not include africa . 
  this is explicitly part of the nato charter . 
  http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm  the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them ** in europe or north america ** shall be considered an attack against them all nato also is not obligated to deal with attacks on hawaii or the falklands or french guiana or so forth . 
  the [ us rationale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) :  the operation , [ 299 ] aimed at taking control of the suez canal , gaza , and parts of sinai , was highly successful for the invaders from a military point of view , but was a disaster from a political point of view , resulting in international criticism and diplomatic pressure . 
  along with the suez crisis , the united states was also dealing with the near-simultaneous hungarian revolution . 
  vice president richard nixon later explained : `` we could n't on one hand , complain about the soviets intervening in hungary and , on the other hand , approve of the british and the french picking that particular time to intervene against nasser '' . 
  [ 300 ] beyond that , it was eisenhower 's belief that if the united states were seen to acquiesce in the attack on egypt , that the resulting backlash in the arab world might win the arabs over to the soviet union . 
  [ 301 ] -  the attack on egypt greatly offended many in the islamic world . 
  in pakistan , 300,000 people showed up in a rally in lahore to show solidarity with egypt while in karachi a mob chanting anti-british slogans burned down the british high commission . 
  [ 302 ] in syria , the military government blew up the kirkuk -- baniyas pipeline that allowed iraqi oil to reach tankers in the mediterranean to punish iraq for supporting the invasion , and to cut britain off from one of its main routes for taking delivery of iraqi oil . 
  [ 303 ] king saud of saudi arabia imposed a total oil embargo on britain and france . 
  [ 304 ]   when israel refused to withdraw its troops from the gaza strip and sharm el-sheikh , eisenhower declared , `` we must not allow europe to go flat on its back for the want of oil . '', 
  he sought un-backed efforts to impose economic sanctions on israel until it fully withdrew from egyptian territory . 
  the move was a gamble to gain control of a mediterranean access . 
  that would have been useful , perhaps , but the us assessment was that it was not worth the risk of losing the middle east , and giving the soviet union control over europe 's energy supply ; that would have been potentially a loss of europe .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexuality_in_japan  several writers have noted the strong historical tradition of open bisexuality and homosexuality among male buddhist institutions in japan .

  i wonder how actually serious he is ? 
  i mean , he must know that he would n't get it , so perhaps it 's just a crowd-pleaser ? 
  he 's still at or near the top , but falling . 
  hmm . 
  i ca n't read french , but is it referring to inequality ( i.e. 
  greater spread in income , like the wealthier getting wealthier faster than the poor ) or poverty ( having less stuff in absolute terms ) ? 
  i think he 's confusing [ islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam ) and [ islamism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamism ) .

  i mean , who wants to be the politician who rolls back anti-nazi censorship ?

  france was a founding member of nato in 1948 and has n't ever chosen to leave -- there 's a formal notification process that would initiate that . 
  she just was n't participating in the command structure for some decades . 
  edit : here , [ wikipedia has an expansion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato#french_withdrawal ) :  nato 's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during charles de gaulle 's presidency of france . 
  [ 34 ] de gaulle protested against the usa 's strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between it and the united kingdom . 
  in a memorandum sent to president dwight d. eisenhower and prime minister harold macmillan on 17 september 1958 , he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put france on an equal footing with the us and the uk . 
  [ 35 ]   considering the response to be unsatisfactory , de gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country . 
  he wanted to give france , in the event of an east german incursion into west germany , the option of coming to a separate peace with the eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger nato -- warsaw pact war . 
  [ 36 ] in february 1959 , france withdrew its mediterranean fleet from nato command , [ 37 ] and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on french soil . 
  this caused the united states to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of france and return control of the air force bases that had operated in france since 1950 to the french by 1967 . 
    though france showed solidarity with the rest of nato during the cuban missile crisis in 1962 , de gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing france 's atlantic and channel fleets from nato command . 
  [ 38 ] in 1966 , all french armed forces were removed from nato 's integrated military command , and all non-french nato troops were asked to leave france . 
  us secretary of state dean rusk was later quoted as asking de gaulle whether his order included `` the bodies of american soldiers in france 's cemeteries ? 
  '' [ 39 ] this withdrawal forced the relocation of shape from rocquencourt , near paris , to casteau , north of mons , belgium , by 16 october 1967 . 
  [ 40 ] france remained a member of the alliance , and committed to the defence of europe from possible warsaw pact attack with its own forces stationed in the federal republic of germany throughout the cold war . 
  a series of secret accords between us and french officials , the lemnitzer -- ailleret agreements , detailed how french forces would dovetail back into nato 's command structure should east-west hostilities break out . 
  [ 41 ]   france announced their return to full participation at the 2009 strasbourg -- kehl summit . 
  [ 42 ] an additional reason that i do n't see mentioned by wikipedia is apparently that france wanted nato to expand to guarantee french control of her colonial interests , and could not sell nato on becoming global .

   if theres russian citizens with dual citizenship deport them to russia . . students too . 
  dual citizens abroad are not a convenient punching bag to punish actions by the russian state . 
  hell , in many cases , they are people who may decidedly disagree with current russian policy . 
  there are plenty of existing levers to put pressure on russia . 
  hitting them is not necessary . 
   i hate that the west are tolerating this little sociopathic egomaniac and his affairs there 's a response over the ukraine situation , which is ongoing . 
  as for chechnya , i think that it 's unlikely that most countries would see it as something other than russian internal affairs . 
  i think that it 's a clusterfuck , but it 's russia 's clusterfuck . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sodomy_law#criminalization_in_modern_days  in africa , male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in mauritania , sudan , and some parts of nigeria and somalia . 
  male and sometimes female homosexual acts are minor to major criminal offences in many other african countries ; for example , life imprisonment is a prospective penalty in sierra leone , tanzania and uganda . 
  a notable exception is south africa , where same-sex marriage is legal . 
    in asia , male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in iran , saudi arabia , brunei , the united arab emirates , and yemen . 
  additionally , life imprisonment is the formal penalty for male homosexual acts in bangladesh , the maldives , myanmar , pakistan , and qatar . 
  but anti-sodomy laws have been repealed in israel ( which recognises but does not perform same-sex marriages ) , japan , kazakhstan , the philippines , and thailand . 
  remember that western social norms are not global social norms , and not all countries have signed up to them . 
  we 've talked a lot about sovereignty -- one of the things that sovereign powers get to do is set laws on behavior , including banning homosexuality , and if russia does n't become involved in chechnya ... well , that 's their call . 
  the outside world can offer asylum to people who flee if they meet their standards for asylum , but it 's russian turf .
