  finally , i really think that the role of the euro is overblown as a concern about the eu . 
  the european financial crisis was n't a result of the euro aligning or not aligning to oca boundaries , but of dangerous debt decisions . 
  yes , maybe the euro exacerbated unemployment . 
  but a government could certainly borrow on terms that would `` leave it a back door to effectively default '' without needing to leave the euro . 
  my concern is more over mis-incentives . 
  people were criticizing media coverage over the most-recent british one , and i 'm starting to agree . 
  while , yes , it * does * have the positive benefit of expressing solidarity , it has the negative effect of increasing the visibility of terrorism . 
  terrorism works by creating terror -- if you want to discourage it , it 's the one thing that you do n't want to do . 
  we know that people have concern over terrorism that is wildly-disproportionate to its actual effect in society , and know that things like this increase the visibility in the media . 
  i think that , in retrospect , our domestic response to 9/11 was perhaps unwise . 
  the government sought to use terrorism as a domestic political tool ( `` my pet policy must go through because * terrorism could be anywhere * '' ) , but in doing so , and in keeping terrorism in everyone 's mind , also facilitated terrorism . 
  iceland has gobs of cheap electricity because they have few people and thus a lot of hydropower available relative to the population , plus geothermal power . 
  they are home to tons of energy-intensive industry because they have so much cheap electricity . 
  they eat more power per capita than any other country in the world . 
  even if you guys did [ atlantropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ) , you would n't be able to provide electrical power from hydropower for even everyone in germany at current usage levels , and i doubt that you have gobs of untapped hydropower sources just sitting around .

  might be used to sound a bit folksy . 
  [ double negatives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_negative ) ( or triple , etc. . . ) might be a better example for what you want . 
  `` i ai n't never gone to no rodeo . '', 
   also , these `` abominations '' are straight-up ridiculous examples of german legalese . 
  nobody actually uses words like that not * that * extreme , maybe , but i 've definitely seen compound words in practical use in german that are longer than other languages than i 'm aware of . 
  here 's the [ main page of german wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:hauptseite ) . 
  that 's pretty lengthy .

  hmm . 
  what percent of the population do you think learns language from the nuts-and-bolts up ? 
  i mean , i work with a lot of people who are multilingual , and none of them could speak about language in a technical sense . 
  they know how to speak two , three , maybe four languages , but they do n't know the technical terms for what they 're doing . 
  not saying that it does n't provide a benefit , but it seems to be intuitive-enough that the mind can draw the parallels between languages without needing to formally name the terms . 
   no , i have no clue what the word `` akkusativ '' precisely means , i assume [ accusative case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accusative_case ) . 
  i did n't know what it is either , since apparently it 's trivial in english . 
  does n't seem to add much that could n't be inferred from context . 
   looks at what they had to go through was n't really a big deal for canada .

  ah , but in 2015 , you guys apparently also [ greenlighted use of hydrofracking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_united_kingdom#infrastructure_act_2015_sections_43_and_50 ) . 
  that has greatly-expanded natural gas accessible in the us , and i suspect will do the same over there . 
  at least in the us , thanks to the development of hydrofracking , natural gas is just about the cheapest form of electrical power you can get . 
  it is displacing coal as a source of electrical power . 
  electrical power is an input to just about everything . 
  * any * sanctions , or just the list specific to crimea and donbas ? 
  because the us has a [ damn long list of individuals with sanctions against them ] ( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/sdn-list/pages/default.aspx ) ( see [ here for text file ] ( https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdnlist.txt ) ) . 
  i mean , that 's kgb , you name it . 
  and presumably by acting as a proxy for other people , they can effectively `` farm out '' their tax-exempt status . 
  buddhist temples used to do that with land-holdings in china a couple hundred years back -- hold lands as a proxy for farmers , use their tax-exempt status to avoid paying taxes on the harvest , split the difference with the farmer . 
  i 'm a little dubious that this was n't considered ahead-of-time . 
  it 's * possible * that the idea was that if the state compensated someone -- which is kind of what i 'd been suspicious might happen -- it would * also * force their assets to become public . 
  this would include potentially-hidden assets , which would be very awkward if they 'd just finished quietly running off with a very large amount of money that they were not supposed to have . 
  so , russia pays $ n to sketchy figure , now public and world knows that somehow that person had accrued $ n. 
  * if * that was the goal , it could also explain this exceedingly-weird-ass way of having the russian taxpayer cover the losses -- this does n't actually expose the amount of assets lost . 
   the eu is a colonialistic christian alliance with crusader mentality < dubious  based on my image from people here , it 's mostly got a lot of people people bitching about letting turkey in because islam , not people trying to take turkey over because christianization . 
  okay , actually , that 's fair -- i had n't thought of echr , and that 's a legit concern -- the italy ruling on [ non-refoulement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-refoulement ) was a factor . 
  as you point out , it 's * not * eu-specific , but [ apparently the treaty of lisbon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relationship_between_the_european_court_of_justice_and_european_court_of_human_rights ) makes ultimate echr accession mandatory for the eu . 
  apparently , the [ echr does n't follow ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/02/italy-historic-european-court-judgment-upholds-migrants-rights/ ) what wikipedia calls a `` strict '' interpretation of non-refoulement , which would permit people intercepted in the water to still be returned to where they came from ... which i suspect is what a lot of people in the eu would prefer . 
  well , take a look at my [ follow-up comment where i expand on it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/63ahvl/the_brussels_effect_the_unprecedented_and_deeply/dft4lp6/ ) , then . 
  [ according to this page ] ( http://www.progressives-zentrum.org/hungary-the-country-of-the-pro-european-people-and-a-eurosceptic-government/?lang=en ) :  thus , hungary is one of the most pro-eu countries in the european union , led by one of the most anti-eu governments . 
  how can we explain this paradox ? 
  -  following the regime transition after the end of the cold war there was a cross-party consensus in the hungarian political elite regarding the objective of hungary 's eu integration . 
  in the referendum about eu accession held in 2003 , 84 % of voters supported membership -- though turnout was relatively low . 
  the leftwing hungarian socialist party ( magyar szocialista p\u00e1rt , mszp ) and the liberal alliance of free democrats ( szabad demokrat\u00e1k sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge , szdsz ) were the most uncritical supporters of the eu , and they ultimately led the country into joining the european club in 2004 . 
  already at the time , the idea of the ` nation ' played a more prominent role than the european union in the rhetoric of the main rightwing party , but fidesz , too , was nevertheless staunchly committed to eu integration . 
    however , the economic crisis between 2008 and 2010 not only led to a collapse of the hungarian economic system but also to a collapse in the support of the leftwing and liberal parties , along with the values they stand for . 
  hungarians had expected the european union -- just as they had previously expected the process of democratic transition -- to provide ` austrian standards of living ' , security and a sense of western integration . 
  instead , merely four years after accession they were confronted with economic recession , unemployment , a growing gap between rich and poor and political instability . 
    this was the crisis that prime minister viktor orb\u00e1n exploited in 2010 when he defined his own government as the very anti-thesis of previous governments and the values they represented . 
  -  orb\u00e1n also altered his government 's relationship with eu institutions after he was repeatedly the subject of criticisms by the european commission and the european parliament on account of government measures that changed the media system , the judiciary , the central bank and other independent institutions . 
  the prime minister decided he would no longer treat these institutions as cooperating partners in his communication , but would instead portray them as hungary 's enemies . 
  orb\u00e1n 's logic was that if he argued that the eu institutions were enemies of hungary , then voters might regard the concerns voiced by the eu as expressions of an international conspiracy that questions the sovereign decisions of hungarians . 
    by 2010 , far-right jobbik , which had been established explicitly as an anti-eu party , emerged as the third-strongest political formation , and began to win over a segment of the voters of fidesz . 
  unlike fidesz , jobbik was not merely euro-sceptic but also expressly endorsed hungary 's departure from the european union . 
  a surge in jobbik 's support led orb\u00e1n to the conclusion that he should not soften his anti-brussels rhetoric , in the hope that he could thereby retain the loyalty of euro-sceptic fidesz voters . 
  -  immigration and refugee affairs continue to remain one of the few policy areas where hungarians trust their own government more than the european union . 
  in almost all other areas , the eu 's credibility continues to be very high . 
  assuming that this guy 's take is right , hungary is unlikely to leave the eu , and the hungarian government is mostly anti-eu to try to undermine trust of the eu insofar as criticism of the hungarian government goes . 
  i wonder if perhaps brussels has attempted to use political pressure because it lacks the ability to impose policy , but that unlike imposing policy , political pressure tends to set off politicians that are the target of it , whereupon they start trying to undermine the eu to eliminate a threat to themselves . 
  i 'm not familiar with the situation in poland with pis , but it does sound a bit similar . 
   it 's been how long since the boats started coming i do n't really see how this is an eu-induced problem . 
  * some of the eu has schengen , but migrants illegally passed through croatia without trouble , and croatia was not in schengen . 
  * the eu grants freedom of movement to any citizens , and countries * do * have the ability to grant citizenship to refugees . 
  to me , that seems like a real concern , as unwisely-giving or simply selling eu access is a concern . 
  i think that this is not a problem that is very difficult to fix -- even if one did n't want to give competence over immigration to the eu , one could establish some sort of `` brake '' on immigration that other members could apply . 
  the problem is rather that a number of countries in the eu are much wealthier than some places elsewhere in the world , and people today have the ability to see these places and travel to them . 
  if the eu were dissolved today , that process would not stop . 
  i think that you may be thinking of what , say , the nsa/cia/etc may do abroad -- i 'm referring to domestic activities . 
   there 's a significant cultural aspect . 
  people felt that gmos went too far in changing food chain . 
  the cfr paper i linked talks about food regulatory changes that predated genetic engineering ... it 's worth a read . 
   there 's a reason why much of us produce tastes like crap to europeans there 's no taste difference to gmos . 
  i mean , all right , you could theoretically genetically-engineer something with a different taste , but i 've yet to hear of any commercial product with such a thing ( though i guess it will probably happen in the future as biotech gets better ) . 
   protectionist lobbies likely saw the effect and assisted it with their money and pr . 
  see , i had the same `` ah ha , it must be protectionist '' thing . 
  but , as i pointed out , the cfr paper talks about it and makes a pretty compelling argument that it was not ( if it was , it is unlikely to be particularly advantageous to european agribusiness , and the industry organizations that would be expected to support such a thing in europe did not ) . 
  in the united states , it is unconstitutional ( a [ fifth amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) violation ) to compel turning over a password . 
  in the uk , [ ripa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regulation_of_investigatory_powers_act_2000 ) permits the government to require this . 
  i understand that france has a similar constraint . 
  after 9/11 , you are correct that there was a tremendous fight over bush [ warrantless wiretapping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nsa_warrantless_surveillance_%282001%e2%80%9307%29 ) .
