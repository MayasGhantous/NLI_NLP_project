  you can block it with , say , your hand . 
  it 's not helpful if you 're * trying * to make it hard to be read . 
  second of all , the problem is that a vehicle not carrying contraband needs to pass through . 
  if i just do n't move goods with rfid tags , i look the same as such a vehicle . 
  i do n't entirely agree . 
  sure , it might be the major concern , but i expect that both sides have an interest in : * having some sort of regularized status for their citizens abroad . 
  * working out some sort of fishing agreement other than `` all agreements just disolve '' . 
  * figuring how how things like radio regulation will be worked out in the future ( i.e. 
  if the uk authorizes different radio use than the eu does , could create issues on both sides , and i 'm assuming that the existing mechanism for agreement is eu ) . 
  i do think that the uk has little incentive to do what the eu has asked for -- commitment to large , ongoing cash payments prior to and not contingent upon any commitment from the eu on trade . 
  i think that that might have been what you were getting at , but it 's not the same thing as caring only about trade . 
  i 'm sure that this will just do wonders for corbin 's popularity in the uk ... / s, 
  i think that you guys are talking about two different things : the imposed sanctions and nord stream 2 . 
  honestly , as long as there 's always reliable review before deportation , the most that could happen is harassment . 
  this is a handful of anecdotes , not a statistic . 
  what percentage of russia-initiated requests are seen as being politically-grounded ? 
  i 'm doubtful that it 's a substantial chunk of them , and to be concerned about it , i 'd want to see statistics . 
  three cases is not a fundamental concern . 
  if someone can say `` five percent of russia-initiated requests are political , and it 's being used as a significant tool of harassment '' fine . 
  but that 's not what this article is . 
   but over the last month , fidget spinners have puzzled russian pundits , who suspect them to be u.s.-made tools of manipulation for russia 's opposition . 
  the day a low-cost toy is manufactured in the us is the day that chinese and us wages have finally more-or-less equalized . 
   `` why the spinner has become so popular in russia now is a mystery , '' sokolov said . 
  `` who could be promoting it en masse ? '' ... 
  okay , i could * possibly * understand this during the sovet union . 
  maybe . 
  though i 'm suspicious that fads existed in the soviet union as well . 
  but in * russia * ? 
  has n't russia had toy fads ? 
  no , but i mean ... i guess i could understand complaining about there being no power lines somewhere and having power lines being put in , because now you 've got an artificial object in your previously-natural horizon . 
  but why is upgrading power line capacity objectionable ? 
  it 's just a convenient place to be involved in a multinational exercise since there 's one already happening there . 
   australia gets a hilariously tiny amount of migrants compared to what we are getting . 
  note that the number of migrants they get is tightly-bound to the policies they 've adopted . 
  one would not expect a more-restrictive policy to keep having the same numbers arrive . 
   if you build a large detention/processing center in a non-populated area of the eu you 'll need a quota system to distribute the refugees that are legitimate . 
  we just build a ton of detention centers and then slow the rate of acceptance to the point that you 're looking at years in a detention center before your case gets processed . 
  discourages those who do n't have a legitimate claim ( hell , and those that do , to a lesser extent ) without violating the letter of the refugee convention . 
  the convention prohibits detaining those granted asylum , but not those waiting to have asylum processed . 
  you can see the political debate here about whether `` sufficient vetting '' is occurring as a proxy for the debate about the numbers accepted , since more vetting slows the intake rate further . 
  nice try at deflection of the criticism , damn commie . 
  nah , it 's entirely tongue-in-cheek , at least in modern use . 
  / r/murica / articles :  article 5 : no damn commies !, 
  -  article 8 : whenever you utter the word `` commie , '' you must insert a `` damn '' before . 
    example :   ~ ~ i ai n't no commie . ~ ~   i ai n't no * damn * commie . 
  yup .

  two weeks ago i was posting in a thread on this sub where a fellow american , / u/belizehouse , [ wrote the following ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6l668o/official_uk_appreciation_thread/djs0iiy/?context=3 ) :  you 'll hear the faster versions with the shrill sounds of eagles making sea gull noises when it matters the most when we can see the whites in yer eyes he was alluding to a quote popularly-known as being from an american commander at the [ battle of bunker hill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_bunker_hill#.22the_whites_of_their_eyes.22 ) , a notable battle in the american revolutionary war , `` do n't fire until you can see the whites of their eyes '' . 
  that was 242 years ago . 
  i suspect that just about everyone has their origin battles in popular culture ... 
   here in germany people protest power line upgrades that are meant for our own electricity . 
  why do people in germany complain about power line upgrades ? 
   negative effect what sort of negative effect ? 
  / u/pm _ me_your_ladyboys does n't seem to be too much of a shrinking violet , mind . 
   i can pretty much tell what are they thinking : sex crimes will skyrocket [ this overview paper points out that , as you suggest , availability of pornography is negatively-correlated with sex crime ] ( http://www.hawaii.edu/pcss/biblio/articles/2005to2009/2009-pornography-acceptance-crime.html ) -- more porn , less crime . 
  so that 's not so good . 
  maybe it 'll increase the birth rate in britain ... i guess that 'd be good . 
  nah , not a big problem , but thanks from me and all other desktop users !, 
  if the source of the french dilemma is that the french public does n't trust having nuclear power plants in france , why not just purchase nuclear power generated elsewhere ? 
  it looks like ukraine -- which also has a lot of nuclear production , and is highly unlikely to want to err when it comes to nuclear power -- is exporting electricity to poland . 
  i normally strip out the `` m. '' from wikipedia urls when i link to them . 
  that is , `` en.m.wikipedia.org '' becomes `` en.wikipedia.org '' .

  [ 0.005 % ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/30/how-apples-irish-subsidiaries-paid-a-0005-percent-tax-rate-in-2014.html ) !, 
   forth , and mostly important , you can not raise w without raising productivity . 
  while i agree with your broader conclusion , that imposing a legislative minimum on wages is going to be a clusterfuck , i have to point out that wages are n't inherently directly bound to productivity , and in fact can be inversely-related to productivity . 
  for example , let 's say that ten thousand people work on assembly lines at a widget factory . 
  over time , the assembly lines become partially-automated . 
  the productivity of each worker is higher -- say that it doubles . 
  however , the demand for their labor may be lower , and maybe now you only need half as many workers . 
  it 's entirely possible for wages to fall to the point that half of the workers leave . 
  true , it could also mean that widgets expand their market , widgets shift from being an expensive item-for-the-few to a product used by the masses , and more workers are required . 
  but there 's no guarantee of that . 
   if you want less refugees , then finally fund the unhcr properly so that less people see the need to come to europe . 
  i mean , that 's not exactly a low-refugee-immigration-to-europe solution . 
  the unhcr is a major advocate of europe accepting more refugees . 
  [ un urges leaders to accept more refugees ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/syria-war-urges-leaders-accept-refugees-160330092114353.html ) :  the un refugee agency unhcr convened a meeting of more than 90 countries at the swiss un seat in geneva , aiming to win new pledges for resettlement and family reunification programmes , as well as study visas . 
  the unhcr 's goal is n't to simply set up permanent tent cities in turkey or wherever . 
   so he 's in their database now -- retinal patterns , dna , voice graph , fingerprints , footprints , palm prints , wrist prints , every fucking part of the body that had wrinkles on it -- almost -- those bastards rolled in ink and made a print and digitized it into their computer . 
  -- * snow crash *, 
   the study found 28 % of children may have stumbled across pornography while browsing , while 19 % had searched for it deliberately . 
  that seems low . 
  i 'm assuming that these numbers are self-reported . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald wikipedia 's article on the battle , for context . 
  to be fair , humans do have a bias here . 
  [ wikipedia : escallation of commitment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escalation_of_commitment ) :  escalation of commitment refers to a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group -- when faced with increasingly negative outcomes from some decision , action , or investment -- continues the same behavior rather than alter course . 
  they maintain actions that are irrational , but align with previous decisions and actions . 
  [ 1 ] that is , your missing wages are a sunk cost . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sunk_cost  in traditional microeconomic theory , only prospective ( future ) costs are relevant to an investment decision . 
  traditional economics proposes that economic actors should not let sunk costs influence their decisions . 
  doing so would not be rationally assessing a decision exclusively on its own merits . 
  alternatively , a decision-maker might make rational decisions according to their own incentives , outside of efficiency or profitability . 
  this is considered to be an incentive problem and is distinct from a sunk cost problem . 
    evidence from behavioral economics suggests this theory fails to predict real-world behavior . 
  sunk costs do , in fact , influence actors ' decisions because humans are prone to [ loss aversion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loss_aversion ) and [ framing effects ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/framing_effect_\\ ( psychology \\ ) ) . 
  in light of such cognitive quirks , it is unsurprising that people frequently fail to behave in ways that economists deem `` rational '' . 
  additionally , if you 've no idea of or ability to avail yourself of legal recourse to recoup your wages , you might feel that your only shot at getting your missing wages is to stay on ; that if you leave , the employer is less likely to pay earlier wages that he already has n't paid . 
  that goes above-and-beyond simple sunk-cost bias , which deals wih a fixed-size reward : the incentive to stay does get larger the longer you have n't been paid . 
  i wonder if part of the problem might be the euro .
