  i 've written on this sub about how even if you have currencies that do n't float with respect to each other ( germany 's currency and greece 's currency are locked ) , wages * will * still readjust to achieve trade equilibrium . 
  however , without floating currencies , the way this happens is for companies to lay people off and then hire people at lower wages ( disruptive ) or go out of business and have a new business with lower wages be formed ( disruptive ) . 
  it may be that this process makes it very easy for this sort of non-wage-payment situation to come up -- the employer `` should '' be unable to make payroll , lay people off , then hire , but obviously does n't want to do that . 
  i 'm kinda curious whether deferring wages was as common pre-euro in greece as post-euro . 
  if it does n't exist , might be interesting to have a standard system and set of requirements for classifying nationally-critical power-requiring systems ( e.g. 
  hospital power supplies , municipal water pumps , telco infrastructure ) that requires a certain number of minimum hours of backup-generator-driven operation without outside power , as well as providing for priority access for diesel deliveries for those systems . 
  maybe , but i also doubt that navalny is getting chemicals in the face from those who consider him irrelevant . 
  i think that polls are a good idea , because it 's easy to have bias in perception . 
  nothing wrong with assigning names , but i 'd like it overlaying a map of some kind of religiosity metric . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/most-religious-countries-in-the-world/ by that metric , poland and macedonia are pretty religious , with southeastern europe in general being pretty religious . 
  austria is pretty areligious . 
  well , first of all , working retail is largely a local labor market . 
  second of all , sure , why would it be dishonest in any way , just because it 's dealing with a larger market ? 
  if the majority desire of the town is honestly fewer tourists , increase rates until the numbers are sufficiently low . 
  if it 's just some people who do n't like it ... well ... 
   why do office workers not have to work on weekends some do . 
  if you provide customer support , you do . 
  i write software , and i 've occasionally worked on weekends . 
  i recall one month of crunch time near a release where i worked every day for a month ( though i 'll grant that that 's unusual ) . 
  but many fields are pretty forgiving of a certain amount of latency until something gets handled . 
  let 's say you 're , oh , a civil engineer . 
  you are n't planning a bridge on impulse : you 've got a pretty long lead time and known schedule in advance . 
  that means that it 's just as easy for the company doing the work to hire enough people and split up the work and have people do work in five-day blocks . 
  but if you 're working in other fields , people may be less-amenable to taking two days to handle handle sudden demands : * you 're a systems administrator in it and there 's some catastrophic failure on the weekend . 
  you may well be called to come in . 
  * you 're a neurosurgeon . 
  you may need to be on-call for people who have been , say , shot in the head and need emergency surgery . 
  sure , some surgeries can be postponed until the week , but not all of them . 
  * you provide customer service on a product . 
  without someone providing customer service , companies that use your product that would operate on the weekend are also dead in the water . 
  * retail . 
  without retail functioning on a weekend , nobody has access to the products that they sell ( and in particular , since a lot of shopping is by individuals , it may be more-convenient for individuals to do so on a weekend ) . 
   if we start with it they will take away the weekend pay as it will be a regular workday [ market rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/market_rate ) gets set by the market -- it 's competition for available labor ( `` hey , these * other * guys are paying better rates/are better to work for than these guys ... i 'm gon na work for them instead ! '' ), 
  that sets market rate . 
  if there are sufficient people who do n't value weekend time more-highly , then weekend pay will be the same as weekly pay ; if there are not , then it wo n't . 
  same as people working at night , in remote locations , or with any other sort of constraints ( e.g. 
  like oil rigs , where people are paid more for having to be `` on site at work '' for a couple of weeks at a time ) . 
  okay , so why is n't she reporting that to the greek authority in charge of ensuring that workers are paid by employers what they 're owed ? 
   no you do n't understand ... they do n't pay ... they are obligated by law to do it . . and they do n't do it so in greece , what happens if i report an employer who is n't paying when he 's contractually agreed to pay to the authority in charge of enforcing this ? 
   the majority of the shops for example in my city are all family owned who want one day to rest . 
  if that 's the case , then they would n't be open anyway -- no need to prevent them from opening . 
  heck , even with small stores that are consistently open seven days a week here , like convenience stores or gas stations , i do n't know anything where the owners are present seven days a week -- you hire someone . 
   only big international companies like zara h&m etc want to be open ... once i was so tired working two weeks in a row all right , but that does n't mean that * any one worker * is working seven days a week , 365 days a year . 
  it just means that they 've got a roster of employees , and some number of people do work on a given day . 
   no work on sundays / no shopping on sundays ... we are n't slaves we are workers fine , anyone is free to say that they 're not willing to work on the weekend . 
  but why stop someone * else * who * is * willing to do so from doing that ? 
  i mean , maybe you have to pay more to manage to get someone working on a weekend , but if someone 's willing to do it , why inconvenience everyone who might want to use those stores ? 
   some of them even do n't get paid till the end of the season yeah , that i ca n't figure out , as it seems a real risk for an employer just bailing if they ca n't pay at the end . 
  are there no regulations requiring employers to pay on a monthly or bi-monthly basis or whatever ? 
   this has forced , for example , germans and austrians to label their traditional plum or berry `` marmelade '' as `` konfit\u00fcre '' , while ensuring that nearly all european marmalade is made with oranges or lemons . 
  i 'd add that in the us , [ marmalade is a citrus preserve as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marmalade ) , not a plum or berry preserve , though it looks like [ there 's nothing enforcing this ] ( https://www.fda.gov/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm074536.htm ) . 
  / u/4-vektor says that he 's hitting a paywall . 
  copying article here :  ** marmalade brexit row spreads as german mep preserves humour **   * von weizs\u00e4cker in a jam after proposal to ` sweeten the bitter aftertaste of * brexit '   an attempt at levity to `` sweeten the bitter aftertaste of brexit '' left one german mep in a jam this week . 
    jakob von weizs\u00e4cker , a member of the european parliament 's socialist group , asked earlier this year whether germany could take back control of marmalade regulation once the uk leaves the eu . 
    ever since a noted diplomatic victory for britain in the late 1970s , all marmalade in the eu has been required to have at least 20 per cent citrus fruit content . 
  this has forced , for example , germans and austrians to label their traditional plum or berry `` marmelade '' as `` konfit\u00fcre '' , while ensuring that nearly all european marmalade is made with oranges or lemons . 
    `` allowing marmalade to be called marmalade again could therefore help to sweeten the bitter aftertaste of brexit for many eu citizens , '' mr von weizs\u00e4cker said as he made the case that it was time to overturn a law that had only been brought in to `` avoid overwhelming our british friends '' .

    but outrage spread quickly in eurosceptic circles , after the daily telegraph published a story on monday under the headline `` german mep demands that brexit ends hated eu marmalade law '' . 
    similar headlines -- `` brussels mep plots sweet revenge '' and `` petty german meps say brexit will allow them to reclaim marmalade from the brits '' -- appeared in the daily mail and daily express , respectively . 
    `` i doubt paddington bear would be impressed , '' said jacob rees-mogg , the conservative mp and prominent eurosceptic , in a reference to the marmalade-loving children 's book character . 
    `` but once we have left the eu we will not need to worry about pettifogging regulations , '' mr rees-mogg added . 
    in response , mr von weizs\u00e4cker , who studied in the uk as a teenager , wrote a series of letters about how his `` innocent banter '' had been distorted into a `` story about an angry german demanding his ` marmelade ' back '' . 
    [ image : a more traditional view of marmalade as enjoyed by the british ] ( https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3a%2f%2fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2f1720a9d0-6884-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614?source=next&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;width=700 )   `` rest assured that i am rather fond of marmelade ( the british version ) , even marmite , the sense of humor and the slightly tendentious reporting on eu affairs in parts of the british press and all the rest of it , '' he wrote in a letter to mr rees-mogg . 
  `` i shall be sad to see britain leave the eu in 2019 . ''   as a peace offering , he invited the mp for north east somerset to a `` symbolic exchange of a jar of home-cooked erdbeermarmelade in return for a decent jar of marmalade -- and a more wholesome dinner afterwards '' . 
    mr von weizs\u00e4cker says he is still waiting for a reply from mr rees-mogg -- but he has nevertheless learned a lesson . 
    in a letter to the daily telegraph on thursday , the german politician wrote : `` after this experience we shall duly abort any attempts to export our sense of humour and go back to exporting cars instead . '', 
  god * damn * . 
  the image in the thumbnail is from [ alamy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alamy ) , a british stock photography source . 
  that means that this picture was n't taken for the article -- someone had , ahead of time , * just in case * someone might need a german flag done up in marmalade , staged and photographed it .

  i think that it is unlikely for the cia to overthrow governments in general . 
  i think that it is extremely unlikely to go after a nato member . 
  i think that it is * silly * to think that the us would consider a spy being * fired * as grounds to overthrow a government . 
  and you think that because turkey fired some number of people that you think work for the cia , that the cia would overthrow the government ? 
  look , i do n't know how to put this . 
  do you honestly think that governments do n't fire people that are involved in spying ? 
  do you think that the us expects them to * retain * anyone who is spying ? 
  so you think that the purge is not of erdogan 's political opponents , but of * tens of thousands of people working for the cia * ? 
  you still have n't answered me as to when this purge happened . 
  even assuming that such a thing happened at some point , it would hardly be something that a government -- * any government * -- could expect to complain about .
