  two more possibilities : ( b2 ) , nothing much happens but now you 've got a rallying point of outrage in catalonia and an awkward point for political attacks or ( b3 ) spain 's government comes in and arrests relevant people or otherwise forcibly shuts things down , though things do n't hit civil war status . 
  ( a ) when was this ? 
  ( b ) why the devil would that be objectionable ? 
  if someone * were * determined to be spying for a foreign intelligence agency , you 'd * always * expect them to be fired and probably jailed . 
  france is a european country . 
  she 's also a south american country . 
   turkey is n't even a european nation you can go dig up the un or whatever definition of europe , and [ kirklareli province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c4%b1rklareli_province ) , [ edirne province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edirne_province ) , [ tekirda\u011f province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tekirda%c4%9f_province ) , and half of [ istanbul province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_province ) are all in europe . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  i mean , i guess you could dump gasoline on the corpse and burn it or something , but i do n't know how else you 'd dispose of a large corpse . 
  is there a lithuanian law being broken over it ? 
  i do n't see how it would be the purges at all . 
  i think that the purges are pretty shitty for turkey , but that 's an entirely disconnected matter . 
  what * are * the things that turkey has done that you think would warrant the us doing something like that ? 
  because i sure as heck do n't see them . 
  there is no reason for the eu to require that the `` exit bill '' negotiations be separate and that they precede all other negotiations with brexit unless the eu does not intend to extend an offer to britain that britain would be willing to pay the `` exit bill '' and still accept . 
  my own view is that it is in the interests of both the uk and the eu to have a mutually-advantageous deal , so a deal could be cut that both would be willing to sign onto , and thus that the `` bill first '' approach is the wrong way to handle this . 
  how * is * it `` semi-nazi '' compared to the expectations of any other country ? 
  edit : hell , i do n't even know what oath you 're thinking of as being characteristic of nazi germany . 
  it might be the infamous [ hitler oath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hitler_oath ) , which was n't a citizenship oath * either * . 
  hitler military oath :  i swear to god this sacred oath that to the leader of the german empire and people , adolf hitler , supreme commander of the armed forces , i shall render unconditional obedience and that as a brave soldier i shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath . 
  hitler civil servant oath :  i swear : i will be faithful and obedient to the leader of the german empire and people , adolf hitler , to observe the law , and to conscientiously fulfill my official duties , so help me god . 
  the whole reason that that particular oath was objectionable was because it was a * personal oath of loyalty * -- that is , hitler was asking for loyalty to him personally , not to the state or constitution . 
  the loyalty in the us citizenship oath is very explicitly to the constitution . 
  a person being naturalized in the us is swearing to protect the constitution -- * including * against the leader or government itself ( `` i will support and defend the constitution ... against all enemies , foreign ** and domestic ** '' ) . 
   oh , i definitely think it 's a more than fair think for the eu to make it 's rules and such clear if catalonia is to change it 's status from `` region '' of a member state to independent state . 
  no argument there . 
  right , but that 's not what i 'm getting at -- juncker 's already done that . 
  i 'm saying that the claim that the eu would recognize a secessionist portion of a member -- as part of the eu or not -- and * then * accept that portion as a member due to economic threats seems extraordinarily-unlikely to me , and i think that many catalans have a different view of the matter . 
  i do n't agree with / u/gerardpb2 's basic idea that the eu would buy into catalonian secession , but you 're missing what he 's claiming . 
  he 's not saying that this is legal under spanish law -- it 's obviously not . 
  he 's claiming that catalonia will be able to successfully issue a threat that will cause at the eu and spain to accept independence and catalonia as a member , regardless of whether it 's legal in spain , that it will simply be accepted as a [ * fait accompli * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fait_accompli ) . 
  my own view is that this is probably a very unrealistic reading of the situation ( and one probably propagated by people who want to pull in support from people who might not otherwise support secession ) . 
  the confederate states of america * also * sold the idea that their secession would simply be treated as a * fait accompli * as well , back before the [ american civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_war ) ... 
  point is that if the idea is that if an individual in catalonia has to decide whether-or-not to support secession , if his decision rests upon eu support , it 'll have already been made if it reaches the point of being tested . 
  that 's not a concern for people who do n't care about whether-or-not support from the eu exists , and just want support for secession from others in catalonia . 
  but finding out too late that that kind of eu support does n't exist may be a very bad thing for people who predicated their support for secession on the belief that eu support would be present . 
  the question of secession on the whole might not be an eu matter , and i agree with you there . 
  however , the degree to which people involved with it might be leveraging the belief or misbelief that the eu would do something in the event of secession probably falls within the eu 's bailiwick . 
     when flying in eu , you do n't really need to worry about anything . 
  when flying in to the us , you need to be aware of the way tsa can treat you and your luggage . 
  this needs to be taken into account when travelling and many people actually recommend taking certain precautions that sound pratty absurd to me . 
  well , i suppse that 's necessary when dealing with the tsa . 
  you mean that you think that the tsa would steal your property , but customs workers in the eu would not ? 
  would you support the eu eliminating the requirement that the `` exit bill '' be a precondition , and instead something negotiated alongside all of the other items ? 
  honestly , if someone legitimately wants a mutually-advantageous arrangement , i do n't see any reason to require any bit to be a precondition . 
  the two sides come up with some sort of package of agreements that both prefer to the alternative . 
  you 'd only require one thing to be agreed-upon first if you plan not to agree to something that the other guy would expect in exchange for that thing . 
   that 's not the plan , because nobody thinks it would be necessary to reach that point < rubs temples  if all of this is predicated on the fact that nobody believes that it could actually happen , then the threat lacks credibility . 
  you have two choices . 
  either catalonia is making a credible threat or not . 
  if the threat is credible , then the plan that catalan leaders are proposing is to have catalonia say that it will gut the ez and spain if it is n't made a full member . 
  if it 's not credible , then it 's ignorable . 
  you know how russia was [ hosting that western separatist conference with the catalans a bit back , where the catalans were the only `` serious '' separatist group present ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/texas-california-separatists-attend-pro-kremlin-conference/story?id=42395066 ) ? 
  they are n't doing it because they expect there to be some sort of smooth transition with the eu simply getting a new member . 
  and they are n't doing it because russia specifically has some beef with spain . 
  they 're doing it because it will create an internal clusterfuck for the eu . 
  honestly , if i were juncker , i 'd come out and make a strong statement against the likelihood of catalonia being recognized and accepted into the eu any time in the near future , because i 'm pretty sure that you would n't have the support that exists if catalonia did n't expect to join the eu . 
  if a majority vote goes through in favor of secession , it 's going to create one hell of a mess . 
  has she explicitly promised reversal of the constitutional changes that erdogan made ? 
  because that is my greatest concern , but it would also mean promising to override a referendum , which is politically dangerous . 
  if you * do n't * do that , then you could ride an anti-erdogan backlash , but fall to temptation to * use * those powers rather than eliminate them . 
  of all things for the us to attack a nato member over , you choose a purge of military officers ? 
  why the hell would the us do that ? 
   if spain does n't accept it , catalonia is not going to accept paying any euro of spain 's massive unpayable debt . 
  without catalonia , spain will have a debt of approx 120 % of their gdp . 
  `` our plan for making the eu accept us is to threaten spain with crashing the eurozone and thereby causing major damage to the eu . 
  afterwards , we will be accepted in a friendly embrace . '', 
  frankly , you know the brit leave guys who got criticized for not having an extensive set of premade plans ? 
  they 're still * way * ahead of this , imho . 
  that 's a terrible idea , because it 's going to invariably cause people to use normal spaces instead of non-breaking spaces and have wrapped numbers . 
  that 's actually significantly worse than agreeing on one standard * or * just inventing a new symbol . 
  what the hell were the standards committed * thinking * ? 
  christ , albania . 
  your upholstery looks like some sort of creepy blood veins . 
  trump is associated with * laissez-faire * in your head ? 
  that 's not the [ us citizenship oath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oath_of_allegiance_%28united_states%29 ) :  i hereby declare , on oath , that i absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince , potentate , state , or sovereignty of whom or which i have heretofore been a subject or citizen ; that i will support and defend the constitution and laws of the united states of america against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ; that i will bear arms on behalf of the united states when required by the law ; that i will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the united states when required by the law ; that i will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law ; and that i take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion ; so help me god . 
  elevation changes will get a lot of it . 
  the hottest place in the world , as well as the lowest place in north america , is [ death valley , california ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_valley ) :  death valley 's badwater basin is the point of the lowest elevation in north america , at 282 feet ( 86 m ) below sea level . 
  [ 1 ] this point is 84.6 miles ( 136.2 km ) east-southeast of [ mount whitney ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_whitney ) , the highest point in the contiguous united states with an elevation of 14,505 feet ( 4,421 m ) . 
  [ 4 ] death valley 's furnace creek holds the record for the highest reliably recorded air temperature in the world , 134 \u00b0 f ( 56.7 \u00b0 c ) on july 10 , 1913 . 
  in europe , try mont blanc summit to southwestern france . 
  that us map is [ quite similar to the map by percentage of population in a us state that is black ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_african-american_population#/media/file:african_american_by_state_in_the_usa_in_2010.svg ) -- that is , the rate at which there 's a negative association rises very closely with a rise in the portion of the state 's population that is black . 
  it 'd be interesting to see what the linear regression correlation is there . 
  nothing like a good old war to build fraternal bonds . 
  the f-22 has a smaller radar cross-section , which is n't insignificant for aircraft designed around stealth . 
  http://mil-embedded.com/guest-blogs/radar-cross-section-the-measure-of-stealth/  the 5g f-35 has an rcs of 0.005 m2 , about the size of a golf ball . 
  however , from the rear , it looks much bigger because of the exhaust nozzles , the same problem we saw with the 5g russian pak-fa ( t-50 ) . 
  for comparison , the 5g f-22 has an rcs of 0.0001 m2 , about the size of a bumble bee . 
  it 's also significantly faster . 
  both multirole fighters . 
  the f-35 is a much newer plane , so it 's really not a very level comparison . 
  it 's stealthy , and variants can fly off various types of carriers . 
  the typhoon is faster and more manuverable . 
  [ according to a google search ] ( http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/f-35-vs-eurofighter-typhoon-which-fighter-will-dominate-15535 ) , the uk intends to use them in concert :  the f-35bs will also operate alongside britain 's fleet of eurofighter typhoons . 
  indeed , the raf plans to operate 107 upgraded typhoons into the 2030s alongside the f-35 . 
  as with the u.s. services , the u.k. will use the fourth-generation air superiority fighter alongside the stealthy f-35 . 
  basically , the f-35 will act as a flying sensor node while the typhoon will be a flying missile magazine when taking on threats inside heavily defended airspace . 
  okay , that 's actually pretty cool . 
  the f-35 has a female interface . 
  which nation ?
