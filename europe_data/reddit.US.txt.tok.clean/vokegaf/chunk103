   `` who stood behind the forest brothers until the mid 1950s ? '' zakharova asks in her facebook post . 
  `` correct -- western intelligence agencies . '' so i guess the idea is to say `` the baltics were n't really unhappy about their incorporation into the ussr ... it was all silliness and unrest stirred up by the cia and mi6 and so forth '' . 
  let 's check wikipedia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers  active : 1940 -- 1941 , 1944 -- 1956 -  by the late 1940s and early 1950s the forest brothers were provided with supplies , liaison officers and logistical coordination by the british ( mi6 ) , american , and swedish secret intelligence services . 
  [ citation needed ] this support played a key role in directing the baltic resistance movement , however it diminished significantly after mi6 's operation jungle was severely compromised by the activities of british spies ( kim philby and others ) who forwarded information to the soviets , enabling the kgb to identify , infiltrate and eliminate many baltic guerrilla units and cut others off from any further contact with western intelligence operatives . 
  sounds like they had existed for over half a decade before we were providing support ... 
   european hypocrisy ... the eu has the same gdp as us but claims it does n't have the money to build a strong army capable to scare russia . 
  an obvious lie . 
  the eu does n't want to spend money for its security cause it wants to use it for more economic growth . 
  but us should spend its own money for eu 's security . 
  then act morally superior and blame us for having such a big army and spending so much money for its military , being too warlike , etc. 
  note that while the concerns may be accurate -- wanting to reinvest budget in the economy despite feeling that defense spending is necessary -- and there may be people who rag on the us for its military , the eu is not a hivemind , and these are not necessarily the same peole doing these . 
  for it to be hypocritical , it 'd need to be the same people doing the same thing . 
   fast expansion of eu was failure . 
  merging europe in a working democratic structure requires much longer time then we have . 
  why do you feel that there is a time limit ? 
  i 'm actually really interested in what caused that swing , because it 's really large . 
  now do africa . 
  i liked , for example , the parliaments of europe series . 
  does it take much more effort to post a link to some article on a news feed ? 
  i come to / r/europe to mostly have the submissions be conversation-starters . 
  i 've actually seen interesting food discussions ... 
  you had the [ british jamming and compromising german navigational radio systems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_beams ) and leaking misinformation to the the germans about what had been hit . 
  the [ germans jammed and compromised british navigational radio systems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gee_%28navigation%29 ) . 
  some navigation was via landmarks , which did n't always work so well because you could be flying above clouds . 
  both sides ( as well as american coastal targets , where lights early in the war helped german u-boats for some time ) [ used blackouts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blackout_%28wartime%29#world_war_ii ) to make it hard for submarines and bombers to find targets and figure out where they were . 
  both sides tried to camouflage and use misdirection . 
  [ in one particularly epic effort , the us built an entire fake subdivision on top of lockheed production facilities ] ( http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/100years/stories/camouflage.html ) . 
  and you do n't hear as much about mis-targeted allied raids that were off target but hit something in germany or occupied territory . 
  i suspect that there were a lot more cases where british or american bombers were furiously bombing the wrong german town , certain that they were bombing something completely different , than there were cases of hitting the wrong target in a neutral country . 
  there was a rather lame question asked theresa may in a recent tv interview : `` what was the naughtiest thing you 've ever done . '', 
  she said `` running through wheat fields as a child '' , deflecting the thing but coming off as a bit silly . 
  i do n't think that is a factor for ireland ... 
   ever seen an 8 year old girl wearing a t-shirt that says `` i suck hard and long like a vacuum cleaner '' ? 
  honestly , if you 're a chinese dude designing clothing and you put out a shirt sized for eight-year-old girls that reads `` i suck hard and long like a vacuum cleaner '' , that 's just malicious . 
  til there was an [ original bangor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bangor,_gwynedd ) from which [ bangor , maine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bangor,_maine ) takes its name . 
  colonies are forcefully held in that status . 
  puerto rico is not -- various us territories have applied for independence , to be countries in free association with the us , to become states , or chosen to retain their status , and have done all of these . 
  puerto rico has spent years without seeking to change that status . 
  it 's only this year that they voted internally to apply to become a state . 
  then they need to have the government apply to congress for statehood and be accepted ( which i would n't be surprised wo n't happen until the democrats are in , since puerto rico will vote democrat ) . 
  secondly , states have no bankruptcy process either . 
  they can refuse to pay debts and fight it out with their creditors , but that 's their business -- it 's not a mechanism in the legal system . 
   # 50m for one apartment is even for london a bit to much . 
  [ nyc 's sold a $ 200 million condo ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/17/billionaire-ken-griffin-buys-200m-condo-complex.html ) .

  note that both china and vietnam have sub-replacement total fertility rates of their own . 
  the decrease in size of each generation is not nearly as large as in the eu , and i 'm sure that you could find people who do want to migrate to the eu ( and in china 's case , the source population is large enough that it 's not as much of a drain ) . 
  but i 'm pointing out that in terms of maintaining population , it * is * a [ beggar-thy-neighbor policy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beggar_thy_neighbour ) -- it only functions by creating problems for one 's neighbors . 
   edit : also regarding your gdp point , automation is clearly the solution and a sharp decline in population might kick innovation into overdrive in that field . 
  automation may be able to deal with the first point , at least as long as one does not insist on a standard of living for one 's elderly that rises with the rest of the world 's . 
  but it ca n't really be counted on for help with with gdp-versus-the-rest-of-the-world , because the eu does not automate in a vacuum . 
  as automation technologies spread in the eu , they will presumably do the same in other countries in the world . 
  okay , first of all , this is copied from an alternet article -- this is what you might call the more-disreputable side of left-wing activism in the states . 
   according to the article top income in bottom half of americans is around 150 % poverty treshold for a family of four , second , i do n't see the statistic you list , but that seems unlikely . 
  that 'd be the 50 % income line -- the median household income -- at 150 % the poverty threshold for a family of four . 
  [ us median household income in 2015 was $ 55,775 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/household_income_in_the_united_states ) . 
  the poverty threshold for [ four people , two related children ] ( http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq1.htm ) in a household in 2015 was $ 24,036 . 
  the median household income is over double that . 
  third , the poverty line is a more-or-less arbitrarily-set level , and one set by each country . 
  it 's not some sort of internationally-comparable value -- that is , a country 's definition can differ entirely from that of another . 
  it might be useful in watching changes from year to year in that country , but it 's not useful or meant to be useful to say `` country a is worse than country b because country a has a higher percentage of people below its poverty threshold . '', 
  well , it 's got two major consequences . 
  the first is that typically there is some sort of social security present -- the state provides some funds for the elderly . 
  that relies on a younger generation contributing . 
  this becomes harder if the state is shrinking ( well , if it 's shrinking quickly ) . 
  the second is that there are some benefits to maintaining international clout -- that 's part of why the eu exists in the first place -- and if the eu 's population declines ... well , its gdp is tied to that . 
   and of course americans , cheery on top , putting missiles everywhere on the late iron wall . 
  i prefer the term `` ballistic missile interceptors '' . 
  not that they * are n't * missiles -- they 're anti-missile missiles -- but because there have been intentional efforts to confuse them with surface-to-surface missiles , and `` ballistic missile interceptor '' is unambiguous . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/switzerland_during_the_world_wars more than that , looks like . 
   during the invasion of france , german aircraft violated swiss airspace at least 197 times . 
  [ 15 ] in several air incidents , the swiss shot down 11 luftwaffe planes between may 10 , 1940 and june 17 , 1940 . 
  [ 15 ] -  on june 20 , 1940 , the swiss air force was ordered to stop intercepting planes violating swiss airspace . 
  swiss fighters began instead to force intruding aircraft to land at swiss airfields . 
  anti-aircraft units still operated . 
  later , hitler and hermann g\u00f6ring sent saboteurs to destroy swiss airfields . 
  however , the saboteurs were captured by swiss troops before they could cause any damage . 
  -  from 1943 switzerland stopped american and british aircraft , mainly bombers , overflying switzerland during world war ii : six times by swiss air force fighters and nine by flak cannons , and 36 airmen were killed . 
  -  switzerland , surrounded by axis-controlled territory , also suffered from allied bombings during the war ; most notably from the accidental bombing of schaffhausen by american planes on april 1 , 1944 . 
  it was mistaken for ludwigshafen am rhein , a german town 284 kilometres away . 
  40 people were killed and over 50 buildings destroyed , among them a group of small factories producing anti-aircraft shells , ball-bearings , and bf-109 parts for germany . 
  [ 20 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ]   the bombing limited much of the leniency the swiss had shown toward allied airspace violations . 
  eventually , the problem became so bad that they declared a zero-tolerance policy for violation by either axis or allied aircraft and authorized attacks on american aircraft . 
  puerto rico is a us territory and it speaks mostly spanish ... 
  i mean , yeah , but you still have to stop and talk to a border control officer briefly about any fruit or vegetables that you might have . 
  the us also has some border controls internal to us territory : for example , guam is a us territory , but one still needs to pass through customs when entering or leaving it . 
  trade with the eu is also a matter for the eu . 
  if that 's * really * what the eu wants to spend its political clout on ... well , just as you 've the privilege of saying `` my legal system 's punishments are none of your business '' , they 've the privilege of saying `` trading with me without tariff is none of your business '' . 
  i think that there are innumerable reasons for the eu not to do this , and i would greatly oppose having my own country do it . 
  but it 's hard to say that you 'd shoot someone for placing conditions on trading with them tariff-free . 
  the echr has fined italy for dropping people off in libya . 
  to do that without being fined , italy would need to withdraw from echr jurisdiction , and iirc presently it is a requirement of being an eu member -- the eu would collectively need to change that . 
   there are of course other solutions besides self-destruction through mass colonization . 
  the article listed more births as another option to avoid shrinking .
