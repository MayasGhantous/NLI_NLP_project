  just by being on reddit , you 're cross-pollinating the languages . 
  i bet that the same thing is true in the spanish-speaking world too . 
  furthermore , afaict , british dialects are weakening as there 's more interchange and cross - `` class '' interchange . 
  that 's not an argument for fragmentation . 
  people on here often know more about us tv or movies than i do ( is it even `` my '' culture anymore , then ? 
  ) , as i do n't watch much current material . 
  that 's gon na come with any new trendy words , which makes it harder to fragment . 
  north korea and south korea are [ seeing language drift ] ( https://www.onehourtranslation.com/translation/blog/north-and-south-differences-korean-language ) , but that is due to an extraordinary geopolitical situation , and not one i expect to see elsewhere .

  but ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_europe [ leonese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leonese_dialect ) has 20k-50k speakers . 
  that 's the size of a town . 
  if you move anywhere , you 're almost certainly not going to be using it on a daily basis . 
  it 's too few users to make it financially-worthwhile to translate content , so you 're gon na be using spanish-language products much of your day . 
  sure , if you throw enough effort and resources at it , you could keep it a iive language . 
  but , honestly , that 's just a lot of work for a limited gain . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornish_language  native speakers   300-400 ( 2015 )   l2 users : 325-625 ( estimated ) honestly , with that few users and limited content in the language , i think that you 'd have so little inertia that [ language shift ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_shift ) would be giving you a rather different language on a regular basis anyway . 
  would it be possible to make it look attractive more-cheaply than motorizing it ? 
  berliners : able to build a functioning airport in almost no time with almost no resources if they * really , badly * want to do so : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_blockade  the french air force , meanwhile , had become involved in the first indochina war , so it could only bring up some old junkers ju 52s to support its own troops and they were too small and slow to be of much help . 
  however , france agreed to build a complete , new and larger airport in its sector on the shores of lake tegel . 
  french military engineers , managing german construction crews , were able to complete the construction in under 90 days . 
  the airport was mostly built by hand , by thousands of mostly female labourers who worked day and night . 
  remove the urgency and : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_brandenburg_airport  after almost 15 years of planning , construction began in 2006 . 
  originally planned to open in 2010 , the airport has encountered a series of delays and cost overruns due to poor construction planning , execution , management , and corruption . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] current estimates suggest the airport will open in 2019 . 
  this is 28 years from planning start to current projected open , and it 's supposed to replace an airport that was operating in under three months .

  ethiopia is 164 out of 186 on the [ country ranking of per-capita gdp ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  south africa is 85 . 
  so let developers build some expensive skyscrapers too -- that 's just a function of what exists and what it costs . 
  if an asshole like trump can do well selling gaudy tower condos with a high pricetag to people who want to show off here , i guarantee someone can manage it in the uk too . 
  [ penthouse apartments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penthouse_apartment ) can fill an i-got-money-look-at-me role as much as sprawling detached houses can .

  well , you know how the eu has steel workers pissy about steel and want to feel like someone is protecting them ? 
  the us has the same . 
  and much as i 'd like to tell them `` if the market says we do n't need more domestically-produced steel , it 's time to find another job '' , i 'm also not having to win a popularity contest with 'em . 
  my guess is that either there will be no protection put in place or protection put in place for a short period of time -- both have happened in the past -- with trump making a tremendous amount of noise about how he `` fought for the workers '' . 
   it is the first operational supersonic svtol stealth aircraft , meaning it can initiate a vertical or horizontal takeoff ... well , the f-35b ( the one the brits use and our marines use on their amphibious assault ships use ) can . 
  the f-35a ca n't , and the f-35c ca n't . 
  not exactly fair to just cherry-pick the strong points of each variant without being specific about the variant you 're talking about . 
  you can hire the same engineers and do your own program . 
  i was interviewing an f-35 software engineer for a position about a year ago . 
   reverse engineering will fuel our own development . 
  realistically , the way to do that is to require technology transfer and part development as a condition of purchase but that also costs more , because then the company that created it loses the exclusivity of the technology . 
  if the eu were purchasing as a bloc , maybe , but i i think that the countries that wanted in bought in during the f-35 development phase already . 
  ca n't be a jet , because it would n't have a jet engine , but : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steam_aircraft  1852 : henri giffard flew a 3-horsepower ( 2 kw ) steam-powered dirigible over paris ; it was the first powered aircraft . 
  the french have been on this for a while . 
  i actually kinda wonder about the prospect of a lot of things that used to be fighters migrating to drones . 
  the [ new york air national guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_air_national_guard ) 174th fighter wing migrated from the [ f-16 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_dynamics_f-16_fighting_falcon ) to the [ mq-9 reaper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_atomics_mq-9_reaper ) rather than the f-35 . 
  for some things , a drone is preferable . 
  do n't have to worry about killing a pilot from acceleration or lug around stuff to support the pilot . 
  you can take risks that most human pilots probably would not want to take . 
  the mq-9 is cheaper than an f-35 ( though that particular drone is also a lot less capable ) . 
  easier to have long linger times . 
  i guess the downside is that you need a human to communicate with it if you want to make human-class decisions ( not just `` after two hours , return to airstrip and land '' ) and that means communications and dealing with jamming and maybe leaking position information . 
  well , the weight ( 30 metric tons ) is more comparable to traditional light tanks . 
  an abrams or leopard 2 -- main battle tanks -- is a bit over twice as heavy . 
  wikipedia 's [ light tank article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/light_tank ) uses the pl-01 as an example of a light tank . 
  i mean , i dunno ... it does n't seem more aesthetic at night to me . 
  maybe it uses a bit more ground-level space at a time when there 's more pedestrian traffic load ?

  well , insofar as [ civilization is settled populations of structured society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilization ) , i think that it 's pretty hard to argue that africa has no civilization . 
  [ south america is a lot better off than africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
   namely africa and parts of asia . 
  asia does n't really have really high population growth areas . 
  in fact , a few areas of asia ( japan , south korea ) have problems with collapsing population that are as bad as in the worst-hit countries in europe . 
  [ really , only afghanistan and iraq have reasonably high fertility rates in asia .

  you could fuel your body with gruel . 
  i pay for someone to raise and kill cows because they 're fun for me to eat . 
  i 'll do the same if someone can make a neat spectacle of 'em . 
   for example , in `` white '' spain we have barbaric traditions such as the `` running of the bulls '' and so on . 
  eh , it 's just visible . 
  if you do n't mind raising a cow in a pen for its life to be slaughtered and eaten -- i do n't -- i do n't see the running of the bulls as particularly concerning . 
  if it amuses the spaniards , i say go for it . 
   europe was never in a desperate situation like africa is . 
  actually , europe did get up towards the carrying capacity of the land given the level of agricultural technology at the time . 
  when the plagues came through europe , wages radically increased .
