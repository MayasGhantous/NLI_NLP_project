  that is , the bounding factor on production in agrarian europe was the land , not labor . 
  cutting th populationsignificantly made the worker much wealthier and helped kick off the rise of the middle class . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consequences_of_the_black_death  europe had been overpopulated before the plague , and a reduction of 30 % to 50 % of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources . 
  [ 24 ] historian walter scheidel contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the black death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor , reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter , which lowered economic inequality by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers . 
  he states that `` the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations . '', 
   human resource consumption levels must decrease significantly or we 're screwed good , globally . 
  i 'm not giving up my air conditioning , man . 
  india is n't growing that quickly . 
  africa is . 
  doing it with a more-highly-skilled population than nigeria is , though . 
  a lot of the ussr became the eu and is definitely catching up . 
  well , at a local level i 'd call it positive -- it 's because agriculture in eastern europe is being industrialized , which significantly reduces farm labor requirements . 
  i do n't have an average farm size thing in front of me , but iirc poland had comparatively small farms . 
  the us has tons of towns out in rural areas that have massively shrunk to have only a few people living in 'em as it urbanized . 
  it was disruptive -- you 're breaking up communities -- but it also [ made the us a shit-ton wealthier ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mou3f/angry_reaction_to_emmanuel_macrons_remark_that/dk4flx5/?context=3 ) . 
  i agree that on a country level , it 's a serious concern , though -- particularly because things like social security systems in the eu presently operate at a country level -- the young tend to pay for the old . 
  so if a big chunk of people move from one eu member to another eu member , it causes the funding for the source eu 's welfare systems to evaporate . 
  i think that it 's less work ethic and more that [ smallholder farms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smallholding ) run by people who do n't know anything about farming are going to have a tough time competing against mechanized [ industrial farms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intensive_farming ) . 
  go back two hundred years , and people had these dinky little farms that were labor-intensive . 
  since that time , a lot of places started using large farms that used machinery to do a lot of the work -- now you 've got a lot of people with agricultural science degrees running farms like large businesses with few laborers . 
  when that happens , you can produce more per land and per person . 
   an example of industrial agriculture providing cheap and plentiful food is the u.s. 's `` most successful program of agricultural development of any country in the world '' . 
  between 1930 and 2000 u.s. agricultural productivity ( output divided by all inputs ) rose by an average of about 2 percent annually causing food prices to decrease . 
  `` the percentage of u.s. disposable income spent on food prepared at home decreased , from 22 percent as late as 1950 to 7 percent by the end of the century . '', 
  the eu is doing the same thing , with some delay : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:output,_labour_force_and_livestock,_2007%e2%80%9313_yb16.png between 2007 and 2013 , the number of people working on farms in the eu-28 dropped by 20 % . 
  during that same time period , farm output in the eu-28 increased by 16 % . 
  the bulk of this was in some eastern european countries . 
  for example , slovakia saw 44 % of her farm labor evaporate in those six years , and concurrently saw total farm output rise by 43 % . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8d/distribution_of_holdings_by_size_class_%28utilised_agricultural_area%29%2c_2005_and_2010.png between 2005 and 2010 , slovakia saw her * number * of farms fall by 65 % -- small farms were being consolidated into larger farms . 
  when zimbabwe redistributed land from a few ( yes , white ) farmers running large industrial farms to many smallholder blacks without farming experience , productivity collapsed -- it 's doing what the us did and the eu is doing today , but * in reverse * . 
  needless to say , they got the same effect in reverse as well .

  relevant dates for the atlantic slave trade ending :  on 22 february 1807 , the house of commons passed a motion 283 votes to 16 to abolish the atlantic slave trade . 
  the united states abolished the slave trade the same year , but not its internal slave trade which became the dominant character in american slavery until the 1860s . 
  [ 125 ] in 1805 the british order-in-council had restricted the importation of slaves into colonies that had been captured from france and the netherlands . 
  [ 122 ] britain continued to press other nations to end its trade ; in 1810 an anglo-portuguese treaty was signed whereby portugal agreed to restrict its trade into its colonies ; an 1813 anglo-swedish treaty whereby sweden outlawed its slave trade ; the treaty of paris 1814 where france agreed with britain that the trade is `` repugnant to the principles of natural justice '' and agreed to abolish the slave trade in five years ; the 1814 anglo-netherlands treaty where the dutch outlawed its slave trade . 
  [ 122 ] the [ scramble for africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scramble_for_africa ) colonial period dates :  the `` scramble for africa '' was the occupation , division , and colonisation of african territory by european powers during the period of new imperialism , between 1881 and 1914 . 
  it is also called the partition of africa and by some , the conquest of africa . 
  in 1870 , only 10 percent of africa was under european control ; by 1914 it had increased to almost 90 percent of the continent , with only ethiopia ( abyssinia ) , the dervish state ( present-day somalia ) [ 1 ] and liberia still being independent . 
  eh , i 'm a bit doubtful that space is the limiting factor . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_reform_in_zimbabwe  before 2000 , land-owning farmers had large tracts of land and used economies of scale to raise capital , borrow money when necessary , and purchase modern mechanized farm equipment to increase productivity on their land . 
  because the primary beneficiaries of the land reform were members of the government and their families , despite the fact that most had no experience in running a farm , the drop in total farm output has been tremendous and has even produced starvation and famine , according to aid agencies . 
  [ 53 ] export crops have suffered tremendously in this period . 
  whereas zimbabwe was the world 's sixth largest producer of tobacco in 2001 , [ 54 ] in 2005 it produced less than a third the amount produced in 2000 . 
  [ 55 ] zimbabwe was once so rich in agricultural produce that it was dubbed the `` bread basket '' of southern africa , while it is now struggling to feed its own population . 
  [ 56 ] about 45 percent of the population is now considered malnourished . 
  it 's possible to improve yields on land a fair amount . 
   almost 4 billions by 2100 , when europe should still have about 700 millions inhabitants . 
  [ actually , europe will have declined to 653 million by then ] ( https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/files/wpp2017_keyfindings.pdf ) , and africa will be at 4.47 billion . 
  the un 's projections for 2015 were revised upwards for africa in the 2017 projections .

  i wonder if this does not apply to the [ eurasian economic union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_economic_union ) because it 's not just an fta .

  india is growing , but slowly . 
  sub-saharan africa is where rapid growth is . 
  men are involved in producing and raising children too ... 
  india has a large population , so in absolute terms any growth is large , but is not growing very quickly in percentage terms today -- it has a tfr of 2.5 . 
  [ not as of 2015 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:total_fertility_rate,_1960%e2%80%932015_\\ ( live_births_per_woman \\ ) _ yb17.png ) , though it 's close . 
  the eu-28 as a whole is not losing 40 % per generation . 
  assuming 2.1 is sustaining , 40 % per generation is a tfr of 1.26 . 
  no member is that low , though portugal , greece , spain , and poland are close . 
  as of 2015 , the eu-28 had a tfr of 1.58 , or a loss of about 25 % per generation . 
   apart from the fact that the user flair selection has become a bit too difficult , reddit has a hard limit of 350 user-selectable flairs , and we have n't even put the first level administrative regions of several countries . 
  well , you could do the `` set up a bot to let users request a flair '' thing too and have unlimited flairs . 
  edit :  but it may have to wait for phase ii of the reorg project ( where regional flags will probably be assigned by a bot instead of being user-selectable by the limiting reddit flair selection system ) ah , okay . 
   but abandoning any pretense of diplomacy , siemens said it would begin criminal and civil proceedings in russia against those responsible for what it called the fraudulent export of the turbines . 
  the unusually sharp statement on monday followed news reports about the violations , from what the company called `` reliable sources . '' yeah , i bet that the russian judicial system is gon na get * right on that * .

  it 's got a lot of people who are really interested in the technical details of politics , though . 
  that is , when they say `` ukpolitics '' , they do n't want to argue about policy . 
  they want to talk about the actual politics-in-the-technical-sense -- whether a particular quote or photograph is a good or bad idea , models to predict voting , etc.
