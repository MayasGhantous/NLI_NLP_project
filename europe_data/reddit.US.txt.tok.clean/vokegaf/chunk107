  i 'm hurt , finland . 
  you and romania are the only two eu members [ where having sex with a horse is legal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legality_of_bestiality_by_country_or_territory ) , and we 've got states where the same is the case . 
  i think that our deep-seated equestrian affection , our appreciation for sheep-shagging , should transcend all these other minor differences . 
   you have to watch out for customs workers . 
  i dunno what you mean by this one . 
   try not to get sued for saying/doing harmless things . 
  not correct on this this one . 
  it 's extremely difficult to be hit by slander/libel laws in the us . 
  canada does n't have the minimum wage exception , and tipping is also a practice in canada ( though you 're also likely * making * minimum wage , so you probably do want those tips ... ) < checks wikipedia  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gratuity#europe  albania : tipping ( bakshish ) in albania is very much expected almost everywhere . 
  -  croatia : tips ( napojnica , man\u010da , tip ) are sometimes expected , mostly in restaurants -- but they are not mandatory . 
  restaurant tips are around 3-5 % [ 22 ] ( or more ) . 
  -  austria and germany : it is illegal , and rare , to charge a service fee without the customer 's consent . 
  but a tip of about 5 % - 10 % , depending on the type of service , is customary . 
  -  hungary : tipping is widespread in hungary , the degree of expectation and the expected amount varies with price , type and quality of service , also influenced by the satisfaction of the customer . 
  -  russia : since the early 2000s tipping has become somewhat of a norm again . 
  however , still a lot of confusion persists around tipping : russians do not have a widespread consensus on how much to tip , for what services , where and how . 
  in larger urban areas , like moscow and st petersburg , tips of 10 % are expected in high-end restaurants , coffee shops , bars and hotels , and are normally left in cash on the table , after the bill is paid by credit card ; or as part of cash payment if a credit card is not used . 
  -  united kingdom : tips of 10 % are common in restaurants , but not compulsory . 
  sometimes , more often in london and other large cities than in other areas , a service charge may be levied , often of 12.5 % compare to the us :  tipping is a practiced social custom in the united states . 
  tipping by definition is voluntary - at the discretion of the customer . 
  in restaurants offering traditional table service , [ 65 ] a gratuity of 15-20 % of the amount of a customer 's check ( 15 % or more in new york city ) is customary when adequate service is provided . 
  buffet-style restaurants where the server brings only beverages , 10 % is customary . 
  [ 66 ] higher tips may be given for excellent service , and lower tips for mediocre service . 
  in the case of bad or rude service no tip may be given , and the restaurant manager may be notified of the problem . 
  so , yes , it 's certainly more-important in the us , considered more of an obligation , and a larger amount . 
  but it 's also not exactly a qualitative difference from the way things work in a number of european countries . 
  also , in the us , the employer is still obligated to pay minimum wage -- it 's just that there 's some legal amount of the tip that can go towards paying it . 
  [ * freakonomics * had a podcast ] ( http://freakonomics.com/podcast/danny-meyer/ ) about no-tipping restaurants in the us , so people * have * tried them , but they have n't really taken off . 
  wikipedia says that wait staff generally are n't very enthusiastic about them . 
  note that poland does have grounds for complaint : their goal was to not be conquered , and when france did not attack , it meant that they assuredly would be . 
  further , they did not have any sort of opportunity to lessen the damage or try for some other form of alternative approach . 
  so ... it is true that france did n't follow through on a promise , though the promise to attack was made only between the french and polish militaries , not the civilian leadership -- it was not a treaty , nor legally binding . 
  the man probably most-responsible was gen. gamelin , who extended the promise : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maurice_gamelin  when war was declared in 1939 , gamelin was france 's commander in chief , with his headquarters at the ch\u00e2teau de vincennes . 
  france saw little action during the phoney war , apart from a few french divisions crossing the german border in the saar offensive , who travelled a mere 8 km ( 5.0 mi ) . 
  they stopped even before reaching germany 's unfinished siegfried line . 
  according to general siegfried westphal , a german staff officer on the western front , if france had attacked in september 1939 german forces could not have held out for more than one or two weeks . 
  gamelin ordered his troops back behind the maginot line , but only after telling france 's ally , poland , that france had broken the siegfried line and that help was on its way . 
  gamelin 's long-term strategy was to wait until france had fully rearmed and for the british and french armies to build up their forces , even though this would mean waiting until 1941 . 
  he prohibited any bombing of the industrial areas of the ruhr , in case the germans retaliated . 
  the french mobilisation had called up many essential workers , which disrupted vital french industries in the first weeks of the campaign . 
    gamelin 's vision for france 's defence was based upon a static defence along the franco-german border , which was reinforced by the maginot line . 
  however , the line did not extend along the belgian frontier . 
  during the winter of 1939-40 , which was one of the coldest of the 20th century , work on the extension of the line along the belgian frontier was slow and not of the same quality as the original defences . 
  gamelin , along with many other members of the french high command , saw the ardennes as impenetrable and chose to defend it with only ten reserve divisions and few fortifications . 
  most of the french army was posted against the north of the belgian frontier . 
  according to general hasso von manteuffel , the german panzer commander , france had more and better tanks than germany , but chose to disperse them . 
  the flip side is that i would guess ( though i 'm no expert on french planning of the time ) that while france did intend to let poland fall , that france intended to win the war and restore poland afterwards , and believed that she would improve her chances of success by not attacking . 
  letting poland believe that help was on the way was not honest , but it was also probably not equivalent to giving up on poland 's existence and arguably was in line with what france believed to be best-serving poland 's interests by ultimately winning the war -- though it did condemn poland to an unexpected nazi occupation . 
   you lot and the brits let hitler get away with everything , ireland , speaking of inactivity ... 
   wwll aka velikaya otechestvennaya only began in 1941 . 
  also , before december 7 , 1941 , it 's just another one of those silly dust-ups that europeans are always having and not * really * a global concern . 
  i 'd call him a great man , though he lucked the hell out by getting to run things in world war ii instead of being remembered for his ill-fated [ gallipoli campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallipoli_campaign ) in world war i. 
  he was , i think , a better writer and orator than admiral . 
  george soros . 
  given the context of the material , you 'd want a large flock on your side to leverage the [ bandwagon effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandwagon_effect ) . 
  it 'd make sense to take a liberal interpretation on who was with the hen . 
  yeah , in poland 's case , fair enough , though i do wonder what would have happened to ( all of ) germany and france in that scenario . 
  honestly , from the standpoint of much of western europe , there were a lot of ways for things to go very badly wrong with stalin and hitler ( well , and mussolini ) looking for land and with a non-aggression pact signed . 
  the ending that happened was pretty crummy for eastern europe ( though maybe better than third reich ? ), 
  but was better for we than a lot of potential outcomes ... 
   yeah i wonder why a country devastated by a war just 20 years prior was reluctant to start invading left and right . 
  france committed to conflict . 
  she declared war on germany . 
  she expected to be in for another long , bloody conflict that ground up much of her manpower . 
  the error she made ( other than in not being straightforward with poland ) was in thinking that the defender would hold a huge advantage , as had been the case in world war i. 
  people rushing barbed wire , trenches , and machine guns pay a high price . 
  france wanted to fight a defensive war of attrition , to force germany to attack her fortifications on her terms . 
  instead , germany had developed offensive tank tactics , took a risky and successful gamble ( going through the ardennes and gambling on achieving surprise ) . 
  she had panzer commanders that chose to ignore their orders and continue to push on in advance of infantry , even though doing so was exposing them to being cut off . 
  that made the huge single `` breakout '' offensive strike that had been repeatedly promised in world war i , but never achieved , a reality in world war ii . 
  this time around , being on offense was the winning strategy . 
   there were lots of ways to avoid this , most notably not allying with countries like france and the uk at most it screwed up over polish planning , but there were n't any great replacement allies . 
  who else is poland gon na ally with ? 
  you 've eliminated france and the uk ( though i 'm not sure that the uk had made any promise of response -- her alliance was with france , i believe , not poland ) . 
  not an axis power allied with germany . 
  the us was an ocean away happily being neutral . 
  i suspect that canada would tend to follow the uk . 
  the nordics did n't want to get dragged in . 
  most smaller european countries , like the netherlands , seem very unlikely to act if france and the uk are n't acting or would favor germany . 
  to be fair , hindsight is also 20/20 . 
  and you 'd have a weakened france , germany , poland , and a powerful and expansionist ussr waiting to vulture the aftermath . 
   if it would n't have been for the turks abroad the referndum would have been lost for erdogan . 
  you sure ? 
  netherlands and germany alone definitely were n't enough to swing the referendum -- i checked those numbers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penal_transportation  england transported its convicts , political prisoners as well as prisoners of war from scotland and ireland to its overseas colonies in the americas from the 1610s until early in the american revolution in 1776 , when transportation to america was temporarily suspended by the criminal law act 1776 ( 16 geo . 
  [ 1 ] the practice would become mandated for use in scotland consequent to an act in 1785 , but remained used less than in england . 
  transportation on a large scale would resume with the departure of the first fleet to australia in 1787 , and continue there until 1868 . 
  dammit , great britain , you already populated the continent with malcontents once . 
  `` economic migrants '' !, 
  i just object to the idea that they 're all planning to live on welfare . 
  that 's what i thought , but you 've got a chick with french colors there . 
   turned out that in reality they are often illiterate welfare shoppers . 
  illiterate , yeah , some , but i think that few people * really * come to the eu with a dream of living on welfare . 
  they probably care more about the size of wages ... 
  poor china . 
  it 's interesting in that i ca n't think of much upbeat and cheerful wwii propaganda . 
  maybe at best showing industrious workers or noble soldiers -- the soviets in particular seemed to like that -- but not happy chicks walking around . 
  the stuff i can think of tends to be a lot less upbeat .
