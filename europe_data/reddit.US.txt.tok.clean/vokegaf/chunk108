  excerpts from [ * a frozen hell : the russo-finnish winter war of 1939-1940 * ] ( https://www.amazon.com/frozen-hell-russo-finnish-winter-1939-1940/dp/1565122496/ ) on foreign support :  finland 's early victories fired the imagination of the outside world . 
  the so-called `` phony war '' on the western front was beginning to bore people . 
  the first month of the winter war , however , raised the spirits of all those who were opposed to tyranny , especially since so few shots had yet been fired in tyranny 's general direction . 
  as historian max jakobsen elloquently put it : `` so many small nations had been bullied into humiliating surrender , the dictators had won so many cheap victories , that idealism had been left starving ... the maginot line might have reflected a feeling of security for those living behind it , but it could not inspire them as did the image of a finnish soldier hurling a bottle at a tank . '', 
    everybody wanted to get involved , now that it looked like finland might have a fighting chance . 
  unfortunately there was a rather extensive global conflict going on , and that made it hard for well-intentioned volunteers to reach finland . 
  nevertheless , spontaneous gestures of help were made from every direction . 
  eight thousand swedes volunteered , and they at least were both close and acclimated . 
  no other foreign volunteers saw as much action as the swedes . 
  eight hundred norwegians and danes volunteered . 
  a battalion embarked from hungary . 
  italian pilots flew north at the controls of fiat bombers . 
  three hundred and fifty finnish-american volunteers sailed from new york on the * gripsholm * . 
  among the stranger volunteers on record were a jamaican negro and a handful of japanese . 
    from london , the incurably romantic kermit roosevelt , son of the rough rider president , announced the formation of an `` international brigade '' optimistically entitled the `` finnish legion . '', 
  his recruiting bulletins were worded to imply that anyone who had ever donned a pair of skis was qualified to join , without further training or conditioning . 
  roosevelt rounded up a total of 230 men for his `` legion '' and managed to get them to finland by the end of march , too late to fight but not too late for them to become a major nuisance . 
  the finns who processed these warriors found them to be a motley crew indeed : 30 percent were declared unfit for active duty , due to age , outstanding criminal records , or gross physical infirmities . 
  several had only one eye , and one over-the-hill idealist showed up sporting a wooden leg , just the thing for ski combat . 
    their fates were as diverse as their personal stories : sixty of them tried tried to return to england via norway but managed to land in oslo , in april , at the same time the german army did . 
  some were detained as prisoners , others managed tos curry back across the border to sweden . 
  about 100 of them just settled in finland , doing whatever came to hand : farming , logging , teaching english . 
  one man ended up as the resident pro at the helsinki golf club . 
  another , a journalist named evans , obtained a post at the british embassy and eventually became harold macmillan 's press secretary . 
  the rest simply vanished from the historical record , blending in with their surroundings either in finland or sweden . 
  it is even possible that a few of them eventually realized their desire to fight the russians by serving in the finnish army during the continuation war of 1941-44 . 
    the finnish public was certainly flattered by all this attention , and the rumor mills worked overtime , cranking out increasingly fabulous yarns about imminent and massive foreign intervention . 
  to the average finnish civilian , it must have looked as though the entire western world was flexing its muscles to help `` brave little finland . '', 
    the muscle flexing , of course , was mostlly rhetorical . 
  the sad truth was that few western countries , no matter how sympathetic to finland , were in any position to help out , due to overriding concerns of foreign policy . 
  nowhere was this more true than in neighboring sweden , where the gulf between cold-blooded political reality and public emotion assumed the dimensions of national schizophrenia . 
  popular sentiment was accurately reflected in the recruiting posters of the swedish volunteer movement :    with finland for sweden !, 
      now the world knows what it means to be a finn -- it is your duty to show what it means to be a swede !, 
      join the swedish volunteers !!, 
    apart from the extreme step of actually volunteering , hundreds of `` help finland '' projects were underway by mid-december ; everyone wanted to help . 
  everyone , that is , except the swedish government , who found the finnish situation acutely embarrassing . 
  sweden 's ruling politicians did not dare offer enough help to make a real difference in the odds . 
  to do so would have compromised sweden 's neutrality at a very precarious time . 
  direct intervention on behalf of finland might have meant war with russia , or it was feared , some sort of hostile move , eventually , from the germans . 
  regarding the germans , the swedes were being overly sensitive . 
  it was not , after all , in hitler 's best interests to allow a soviet republic to be established only five minutes ' flying time away from the strategically priceless ore fields in northern sweden . 
  at the very least , effective swedish aid would have prolonged the conflict , and that , too , would have been in hitler 's interest , since the finnish war kept stalin tied down in the northland and turned away from the balkans . 
  hitler would not have moved a finger to stop ten swedish divisions from marching to the aid of finland . 
    matters were not helped by the hypocritical vacillations of sweden 's leaders . 
  the swedish people were passionately proud of their volunteer effort , and if a plebiscite had been taken about the matter , they would probably have voted overwhelmingly to go to war for their neighbor and former province . 
  large segments of the swedish population viewed their own leaders as spineless and craven . 
  some public officials resigned in protest and shame . 
  when foreign minister sandler spoke in the riksdag and labeled his government 's policy `` neutrality carried to the point of pure idiocy , '' he was rewarded with a standing ovation . 
    the germans allowed some arms to pass through the reich , until a swedish newspaper broke the story and hitler initiated a policy of stony silence toward finland , in response to frantic diplomatic pressure from his new `` ally '' , the ussr . 
  oddly enough , however , some of the strongest sympathy for finland was manifested in fascist italy . 
  huge crowds , including hundreds of black shirts in uniform , demonstrated emotionally in front of the finnish embassy in rome , then , carrying the finnish ambassador on their shoulders , marched to the russian compound and vigorously stoned it . 
  italy dispatched substantial shipments of military equipment , including seventeen fiat bombers and 150 volunteers , one of whom was killed in combat . 
  v\u00e4in\u00f6 tanner even made attempts to enlist mussolini 's diplomatic influence to bring about peace negotiations with moscow . 
  il duce , however , brushed aside those appeals . 
  like hitler , he too was happy to have stalin 's attention turned from the balkans , where he had dreams of aggrandizement equal to , if less reallistic than , those of the f\u00fchrer . 
    in america , popular sentiment was almost totally pro-finland . 
  to the american people , finland was almost a `` pet '' nation : a tough , brave little country that always `` paid its debts on time , '' spawned great late-romantic music , and enthralled sports fans with the exploits of its champion athletes . 
  in new york , mayor la guardia sponsored a `` help finland '' rally in madison square garden . 
  the american red cross sent substantial humanitarian aid . 
  stokowski and toscanini conducted benefit concerts -- all sibelius , naturally . 
    franklin roosevelt was caught in an awkward position by the conflict . 
  he wanted to help finland , but he was hemmed in by strong isolationist feelings in congress and by the restrictive neutrality laws that were still on the books from the spanish civil war . 
  when the first reports of mass bombings of civilians blazed across the front pages of american newspapers , fdr actually contemplated severing relations with the soviet union . 
  he was bombarded with so many political arguments against doing that , however , that he finally went too far in the other direction . 
  the american ambassador in moscow was instructed to deliver a gutless and generalized appeal for `` both sides '' to refrain from bombing civilian targets , stating that the u.s. government did not approve of bombing nonmilitary targets . 
  the upshot of this policy statement , one historian acidly observed , was that `` america was on record as being against evil . '', 
  nevertheless , roosevelt permitted high-level american diplomats to confer with their finnish coutnerparts for the purpose of finding ways to get around the letter of the law . 
  the outcome of these discussions was a scheme by which , under certain conditions , certain types of arms could be purchased by nations friendly to the united states , provided that the deal was made on a cash only basis , and that any items thus contracted for were shipped from america only in vessels flying the flag of the purchaser . 
  [ continued from parent ]  for the scandinavian states , especially sweden , the end of the war was a welcome relief . 
  in international politics , the sovereignty and independent action of small states is all too frequently abridged and circumscribed by the national an international interests of their great neighbors . 
  such was the case with sweden . 
  under pressure at home and abroad , the swedish government had been in an increasingly uncomfortable position for the preceding three months . 
  on the one hand , the immense popularity and support of the finnish cause in sweden , originating in the ancient cultural and historical associations between the two states , as well as the natural human tendency to side with the underdog , hand placed the swedish government in an embarrassing and , perhaps , ultimately untenable political position , especially when the allies requested transit rights to finland for their troops . 
  on the other hand , the subtle and not so subtle diplomatic coercion and duress to which sweden was subjected by the soviet union and germany militated against active and overt support of finland . 
  moral questions aside , sweden pursued a course best calculated to preserve her own independence , and by doing so , she was able to send material aid to finland after the war . 
  [ continued from parent ]  all the planning and problems attendant upon an allied expedition were recognized by the finns , who knew in reality that there was little hope of help arriving in time or in sufficient force to change the course of the war . 
  but they also recognized the very real psychological value of such preparations in bringing the russians to the negotiating table . 
  moreover , the proposals could be calculated to evoke more action and obtain more support from nroway and sweden on finland 's behalf . 
    consequently , as the february offensive gained momentum on the isthmus , the finnish government undertook a twofold policy . 
  on the one hand , it pursued the allied offers of assistance . 
  the threat of allied intervention was used in an effort to temper the russian peace terms and , hopefully , to get germany to put pressure on moscow to end the war . 
  the possibility of peace was employed to gain larger troop commitments from the allies . 
    when the allied plan to come to finland 's aid was first announced in early february , the proposal was so vague that not even an anticipated departure date could be given . 
  at this time , london and paris indicated they were prepared to forego diplomatic niceties and just let the troop transports appear at narvik without prioer consultation with oslo and stockholm .
