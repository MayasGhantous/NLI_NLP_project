  however , part of the reason for that fight was because it was seen as highly-objectionable -- and it rolled back many moves , and even then , they were done under a fair number of restrictions , and has had a number of additional restrictions added . 
  many european countries have been [ fairly willing to let the government engage in wiretapping without the same standard required to gain wiretap access ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/how_they_do_it/2006/02/wiretapping_europeanstyle.html ) . 
  in the us , there are relatively-strong restrictions on government monitoring of what happens in a home . 
  [ * kyllo v. united states * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyllo_v._united_states ) established , for example , that use of far-infrared imaging to obtain not-visible to the human-eye information was not legal . 
  [ privacy lost : eu , u.s. laws differ greatly ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15221111/ns/technology_and_science-privacy_lost/t/la-difference-stark-eu-us-privacy-laws/ ) has a bunch of examples . 
   the reason that privacy laws in europe and the u.s. are so different springs from a basic divergence in attitude : europeans reserve their deepest distrust for corporations , while americans are far more concerned about their government invading their privacy . 
  -  in many parts of europe , for example :   * personal information can not be collected without consumers ' permission , and they have the right to review the data and correct inaccuracies . 
    * companies that process data must register their activities with the government . 
    * employers can not read workers ' private e-mail . 
    * personal information can not be shared by companies or across borders without express permission from the data subject . 
    * checkout clerks can not ask for shoppers ' phone numbers . 
  -  with those privacy protections come other , curious laws and regulations that would fluster most americans ... while companies face severe regulations limiting their use of consumers ' personal information , governments are largely exempt from such limitations . 
  while the use of credit reports is rare in europe , wiretapping is not . 
  in the netherlands , for example , wiretaps are 130 times more common than in the u.s. 
  many europeans carry some kind of national id card , still unthinkable for many in the u.s. 
  in germany , every citizen and long-term visitor must register his or her address with the police . 
  -  `` in europe the first line of defense against private wrongdoing is the state , '' said joel r. reidenberg , privacy expert at fordham university school law school . 
  `` in the u.s. our instinct is more liberal : let private actors sue each other . '' in the us , it is ( see [ * united states v. jones * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_v._jones_%282012%29 ) ) unconstitutional for the government to plant a gps tracking device without warrant . 
  on the other hand , for private citizens , it 's typically just fine to do so . 
  for an employer , it 's almost certainly okay to do so in a company vehicle , whereas in many eu countries , the employer probably can not do so without at least informing the employee . 
  in the us , it is unconstitutional ( [ * riley v. california * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riley_v._california ) ) for the police to search a cell phone without warrant . 
  in the uk , [ i understand that it 's law enforcement practice for detainees ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18102793 ) . 
  those seem a * teensy * bit biased against the eu . 
  why ? 
  physical frexit !, 
  iberia island !, 
  that 's odd . 
  i recall bungie entering publishing because , as they put it , all the money was in publishing , not developing . 
  technically , he 's intended to represent an italian-american new york plumber , and the design team was japanese . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mario  mario 's character design , particularly his large nose , draws on western influences ; once he became a plumber , miyamoto decided to `` put him in new york '' and make him italian , [ 10 ] lightheartedly attributing mario 's nationality to his mustache . 
  [ 11 ] other sources have mario 's profession chosen to be carpenter in an effort to depict the character as an ordinary hard worker , and make it easier for players to identify with him . 
  [ 12 ] after a colleague suggested that mario more closely resembled a plumber , miyamoto changed mario 's profession accordingly and developed mario bros. , [ 3 ] featuring the character in the sewers of new york city .

  i really am very dubious about `` old artisan production is coming back '' claims . 
  i would n't really mind , but i wonder how many people really kneecap their career by heading into these after reading similar articles . 
  issues : ** it scales badly in labor cost ** artisan work requires someone to make an item for a particular customer . 
  this means that a lot of human time is required , and it grows linearly in the number of customers . 
  thus , labor cost is very high , and there is tremendous pressure to tamp that labor cost down . 
  this is a * prime * target to move production overseas to places with cheaper labor on . 
  europe has expensive labor . 
  maybe not as bad as the us , but pretty damn expensive . 
  you 're fighting an uphill battle against the numbers . 
  maybe you can manage to try to target a bespoke product where the actual creator is talking to the person . 
  i dunno , maybe a tailor , where you want the finished work available tomorrow * and * you need him to personally measure you . 
  that is incompatible with offshoring , but i think that there are few products for which this is true . 
  ** most artisan goods are luxury goods . 
  that does n't work well with high-labor-cost environments . 
  ** i suspect that for * most * goods that i could get handmade ( rugs , furniture , whatever ) , the person doing so is not doing so because the item is functionally-superior to a mass-produced , machine-made good . 
  rather , they 're doing so because the hand-made nature * itself * indicates that the item has a higher cost and the higher cost itself is desirable -- a [ veblen good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veblen_good ) . 
  the problem is that people typically want these to show off the cost they paid ... but not necessarily to actually * pay * the cost , which is why there 's such a flood of counterfeits of luxury brands out there . 
  when you are manufacturing such a luxury good , you want to visibly and credibly make the statement that a lot of money was paid for the item . 
  however , this * does n't * work incredibly well with handmade goods in a high-labor-cost environment , because you can produce the good overseas and make it indistinguishable from the one produced in a high-labor-cost environment . 
  i think that in most cases , luxury goods today that want to state that they are expensive rely on the brand , not the handmade nature , and rely on trademark law and reputation to safeguard the brand . 
  you could as easily machine-produce the thing . 
  ** artisan goods made sense for the masses only when markets were small . 
  that mostly-isn ' t the world we live in . 
  ** markets today are big and getting bigger . 
  an artisan good has a high labor cost that grows linearly with the number of items produced . 
  that 's fine * if * the number of items produced will be very small . 
  but as the size of the market grows , it makes more-and-more sense to get investors , have a high fixed cost to set up mass production , and reduce the marginal cost of producing each good . 
  and that is , largely , what most manufacturers are doing . 
  if you make the market large-enough , it 's almost always possible to have a really-good and cheap mass-produced version that 's preferable to an artisan version . 
  i can buy a $ 10k fountain pen , but it 's not going to be any more reliable -- probably less -- than a bic ballpoint that i can buy for a few cents . 
  if you can sell from country to country , from continent to continent ... the merits of mass production just grow . 
  and ... that 's what 's happening . 
  ** there is a limited standard of living that artisan production can support for artisans in terms of the living standards of others ** if i spend eight hours making something , then the customer must at a minimum spend enough to pay me for a day 's labor . 
  in a reasonably-egalitarian society , that means that he is going to have to pay something on the order of eight hours of * his * labor to get my labor . 
  that 's damn expensive . 
  if the entire world got twice as wealthy in real terms -- twice as many natural resources and all that -- then it 'd * still * take that eight hours . 
  it is impossible to raise the standard-of-living in a society if my standard of living is bound tightly with the amount of time i hire someone else in the society to do something . 
  instead , we 'd want to find a process that lets the person manage to expend half as much time to produce the same thing , or , better , even less . 
  that could produce a society that is wealthier across-the-board . 
  -- yes , there is a market for artisan goods . 
  it will remain . 
  but i am very , very dubious that there will be any sort of significant renaissance . 
  the math simply does not work out , and the same factors that have mostly eliminated artisan work have not gone away . 
   we would but your president is warming up the planet - us included . 
  [ michel temer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_temer ) , human forge , eh ? 
   `` all the leaders of the eu countries went to the vatican and listened to the pope submissively . 
  do you now understand why they have not been taking turkey into the eu for 54 years ? 
  the situation is quite loud and clear , it is a crusader alliance . 
  april 16 will also be the day to evaluate this , '' president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan said at a rally in ankara on april 2 . 
  no backsies , erdogan . 
  it 's official now . 
  you said that this is what the referendum is * really * on . 
  if the eu is a `` crusader alliance '' , vote `` yes '' to give erdogan extensive one-man powers in turkey . 
  and * if the eu is not a `` crusader alliance '' , vote `` no '' to not give erdogan extensive one-man powers in turkey . 
  this document seemed to feel that -- in line with the wto 's take -- that protecting european manufacturers , not consumer preference ( not artificially-induced-via-marketing consumer preference ) was the eu 's primary concern . 
  while i admit to having had plenty of suspicion along those grounds myself ( particularly given [ historic attempts at establishing protectionist policy by european agribusiness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax#background ) ) , the [ cfr has a more-focused paper i read a while back that argued that this is not the case ] ( http://www.cfr.org/agricultural-policy/regulation-gmos-europe-united-states-case-study-contemporary-european-regulatory-politics/p8688 ) , that anti-gmo-preference in europe was more a product of the eu having a number of different regulatory systems across different countries combined with a number of health scares shortly before genetically-engineered products showed up . 
  while i am not very sympathetic either to the rationale behind anti-gmo positions or to arguments for labelling ( as this sort of thing created the gluten-free craze ) , i do think that the paper makes some good points . 
  the goal from the eu was probably not primarily-protectionist . 
  i think that the eu would be better-off using genetically-engineered products , but i do not think that gmo restrictions would actually be particularly helpful in shielding european farmers , nor do i think that european agribusiness really had this as an overarching goal . 
  ehh ... not finished reading , but i think that some major factors are missing here . 
  first , as the size of the market increases , the costs of producing separate products falls , reducing what the authors call the `` california effect '' . 
  producing a new product is going to have largely-fixed costs . 
  as the unit count rises , so does the relevance of the fixed costs . 
  so it may be very inefficient to produce a separate product for slovakia and slovenia , but not so inefficient to produce a separate product for the eu and the us . 
  second , there are some incentives to have separate products -- because it permits for [ price discrimination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/price_discrimination ) .
