  for this purpose , the most feasible area was the scandinavian peninsular -- in particular , narvik and the railroad from there to lulea . 
  a move there would serve a threefold purpose : firstly , narvik , the winter port for shipping iron ore to germany , would thus be effectively closed to german use ; secondly , the railroad , which passed through the swedish iron ore fields , could be prevented from shipping any more ore to germany through the baltic sea ; thirdly , with its connections to finland , the railroad would be the quickest and easiest means to get troops to the finnish front . 
  the first two steps were calculated to open the second front against germany , and , as all later operational plans were to indicate , this goal remained uppermost in the minds of the allied strategists .

  damn . 
  that 's a lot of people . 
  the batman-in-the-comic-books versus the [ batman-in - * batman begins * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzkfvwb7k40&amp;t=3m35s ) debate ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omission_bias, 
  well , that 'd be better than violating duty-to-aid . 
  my expectation is that most rioters are n't willing to firebomb things if they 're at serious risk for it . 
   president donald trump will attend a summit of the three seas initiative in poland on thursday that his hosts hope will boost economic ties between the united states and the ex-communist countries of central and eastern europe . 
  i dunno how much can be done in isolation to set trade terms by that bloc alone -- that 's an eu competence . 
  not everyone in africa is muslim . 
  i do n't believe that . 
  germany took four years to do the holocaust and that 's about the dead opposite of kid gloves . 
   eu is trying to pull this * awful * , warring continent how is europe `` awful '' ? 
  does n't eu membership entail accepting echr jurisdiction atm , though ? 
  that would need to be changed . 
  i mean that you 're going to wind up with people growing different crops , not simply saying `` my plant ca n't grow here ... i give up '' . 
  looking at a [ plant hardiness zone map ] ( http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/phzmweb/ ) for flat land in the us , 1 degree c produces a shift of ~ 40km away from the equator . 
  so plant and crop bands will move maybe 32-64 km south for each degree in change . 
  i see [ projected changes for from the 1980s to 2100 of 2.5-6 degrees celsius in africa , depending upon area ] ( https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/wgiiar5-chap22_final.pdf ) . 
  that will shift crops 80-384km . 
  africa 's somewhere between 7,000 to 8,000 km from north to south . 
  crops that * are * adapted for a closer-to-the-equator area will move into areas further from the equator . 
  german jewish immigration , baby . 
  you do n't normally change people when you change crops . 
  let me put it another way : africa 's already seen much larger-in agricultural collapses from when it redistributed colonial-era land . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_reform_in_zimbabwe#impact_on_production  before 2000 , land-owning farmers had large tracts of land and used economies of scale to raise capital , borrow money when necessary , and purchase modern mechanized farm equipment to increase productivity on their land . 
  because the primary beneficiaries of the land reform were members of the government and their families , despite the fact that most had no experience in running a farm , the drop in total farm output has been tremendous and has even produced starvation and famine , according to aid agencies . 
  [ 53 ] export crops have suffered tremendously in this period . 
  whereas zimbabwe was the world 's sixth largest producer of tobacco in 2001 , [ 54 ] in 2005 it produced less than a third the amount produced in 2000 . 
  [ 55 ] zimbabwe was once so rich in agricultural produce that it was dubbed the `` bread basket '' of southern africa , while it is now struggling to feed its own population . 
  [ 56 ] about 45 percent of the population is now considered malnourished . 
  crops for export such as tobacco , coffee and tea have suffered the most under the land reform . 
  the main everyday food for zimbabweans , maize , has been reduced by 31 % , while small grains production has grown by 163 % . 
  [ 34 ] if you are n't constantly in a fret about small , non-industrial farms in africa , then you should n't be bothered by climate change 's impact . 
  i strongly suspect that it 's being raised for political reasons in europe -- you have people who do n't like immigration and you have people who have been worked up about climate change , so by * merging * the two , you have a potent political tool . 
  the us did the same thing with `` green jobs '' , which let it politically merge people who wanted protected , make-work jobs , and people who were up in a tizzy about the environment . 
  if you have to weld together an unlikely political coalition , that 's a viable way to do it . 
  it looks like [ taiwan is looking to do so ] ( http://english.president.gov.tw/news/5121 ) :  the president stressed that taiwan is an island nation , and our government 's commitment to free trade is an unchanging policy position , therefore we hope to sign a free trade agreement with the uk , and welcome more british companies to invest in taiwan . 
  the uk , she added , was the first country in europe to grant visa-free courtesies to travelers from taiwan , and has always been a trailblazer in the promotion of relations with taiwan . 
   you got no sch in english fair ` nuff . 
  though just about anything in a major european language has made it into english in some way , i think : borsch/borscht , eschew , kitsch , putsch , schedule ( if you 're a brit , not a yank ) , schlep , schlock , schmaltz , schmooze , schmuck , schnapps , schnauzer , and schwa . 
  any pressure to migrate in africa from climate change is a drop in the bucket compared to population growth . 
  this is just people adapting a political narrative to fit new news items . 
  is there some reason why i see so many people writing `` schengen '' as `` shengen '' ? 
  is there some language in europe where that 's the correct spelling , and people are pulling in spelling from that language ? 
  it 's usually europeans , not americans , so i ca n't imagine that this is a lack-of-familiarity thing . 
   if it will be just a little bit warmer , wheat , cereals , fruits and vegetables wo n't grow so good anymore means that people move the bands where they grow a given plant a bit away from the equator . 
  people do joke about the holocaust . 
  i 'm really glad that facial recognition software is n't quite to the point of creating mass databases of people based on sight alone , but it will be there , and then i 'm not sure what will happen to mass protests like this one . 
  i do n't particularly think that it 's all that much worse , and people clearly enjoy it . 
  i mean , you can destroy records of its precepts , kill adherents . 
  the nazis did a pretty serious number on judaism . 
   leftists on full damage control . 
  if so , i 'll take it . 
  trashing cities every couple of years is a bad thing , and maybe this 'll reduce it . 
  i hope you do n't eat beef , because it does n't just wind up by magic at the store ... 
  not that any such discussions are happening but if they were everything is now in place for them to happen . 
  < lets out long , exasperated sigh  there are organizations in the eu that will not want any given trade deal to be made . 
  same as in the us . 
  any time you change the economic environment , any time you change what is demanded , some people and organizations will lose out . 
  workers in us auto manufacturing plants , for example , lost jobs and would have wound up with probably-less-desirable jobs as a result of nafta . 
  that is where you 'll get organized efforts opposing trade deals to come from . 
  these are not spontaneous concerns : they are the result of marketing efforts funded by this crowd . 
   here in the eu the main opposition to ttip was the clause that allowed corporations to sue european governments for loss of income , essentially reducing their sovereignty . 
  you 're talking about a rather-misleading representation of isds . 
  every existing eu free trade agreement that i 've looked at , and i would assume all of them , has exactly this provision , which was something that the eu wanted to ensure that the other party did n't screw it over . 
  i suspect that the same will be true of every existing us fta . 
  the only reason that you heard about it or thought that it had any importance is because folks working on the anti-ttip effort assessed that most people did n't know about this and highlighted it as a major concern , relying on unfamiliarity with normal trade practice . 
   you americans may be fine with the way corporate personhood is defined , but from our viewpoint , the power corporations hold in the us is scary ( e.g. 
  citizen united ) . 
  * citizens united * is unrelated to ttip and simply provides that people can donate funds to put up political ads . 
  it 's massively-overblown by the left . 
   moreover , some of your industries have subpar industry practices that would collide with our regulations . 
  again , same marketing efforts will highlight any differences and rely on distrust of whatever is done abroad . 
  to provide background : europe 's chicken industry is one industry that would severely lose from the passage of ttip . 
  europe presently has non-globally-competitive chicken production practices , and european poultry farmers trying to block competition from the us has been a [ long-standing feature of the economic environment between the two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax ) :  largely because of post-world war ii intensive chicken farming and accompanying price reductions , chicken , once internationally synonymous with luxury , became a staple food in the u.s. [ 10 ] prior to the early 1960s , not only had chicken remained prohibitively expensive in europe , it had remained a delicacy . 
  [ 11 ] with imports of inexpensive chicken from the u.s. , chicken prices fell quickly and sharply across europe , radically affecting european chicken consumption . 
  [ 11 ] in 1961 , per capita chicken consumption rose up to 23 % in west germany . 
  [ 11 ] u.s. chicken overtook nearly half of the imported european chicken market . 
  [ 11 ]   subsequently , the dutch accused the u.s. of dumping chickens at prices below cost of production . 
  [ 11 ] the french government banned u.s. chicken and raised concerns that hormones could affect male virility . 
  [ 11 ] german farmers ' associations accused u.s. poultry men of fattening chicken artificially with arsenic . 
  [ 11 ]   coming on the heels of a `` crisis in trade relations between the u.s. and the common market , '' [ 11 ] europe moved ahead with tariffs , intending that they would encourage europe 's post-war agricultural self-sufficiency . 
  [ 12 ] european markets began setting chicken price controls . 
  [ 11 ] france introduced the higher tariff first , persuading west germany to join them -- even while the french hoped to win a larger share of the profitable german chicken market after excluding u.s. 
  chicken . 
  [ 3 ] europe adopted the common agricultural policy , imposing minimum import prices on all imported chicken and nullifying prior tariff bindings and concessions . 
    beginning in 1962 , the u.s. had accused europe 's common market of unfairly restricting imports of american poultry . 
  by august 1962 , u.s. exporters had lost 25 % of their european chicken sales . 
  [ 11 ] losses to the u.s. poultry industry were estimated at $ 26 -- 28 million [ 3 ] ( over $ 210 million in 2014 u.s. dollars ) . 
    senator j. william fulbright , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and democratic senator from arkansas , a chief u.s. poultry-producing state , interrupted a nato debate on nuclear armament to protest trade sanctions on u.s. chicken , [ 3 ] going so far as to threaten cutting u.s. troops in nato . 
  konrad adenauer , then chancellor of germany , later reported that he and president john f. kennedy had a great deal of correspondence over a period of two years , about berlin , laos , the bay of pigs invasion , `` and i guess that about half of it has been about chickens . '', 
  even today , a chicken produced under the processes used in us requires processes that require < checks online  about 3/4ths the costs involved in the eu . 
  tariffs are not the only way to protect an inefficient producer . 
  it 's also possible to establish incompatible standards -- these are called [ ntbs , non-tariff barriers to trade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-tariff_barriers_to_trade ) . 
  there are a number of areas in which various industries have set these up . 
  the auto industry is one -- us auto safety standards are more-or-less similar to the eu 's , with neither being dramatically more restrictive , but by using different sets of standards , it 's the case that autos made for one market can not be sold in the other market . 
  poultry is another .
