  before world war ii , it looks like the royal canadian navy was tiny . 
  http://www.navalreview.ca/wp-content/uploads/public/vol5num3/vol5num3art2.pdf  it was quite possibly the only navy to end the war with more * vessels * than it had * officers * when the war began . 
  being a neighbor with the us would if anything mitigate the naval concern , since there is no way for a country to cut off canada from the us in a conflict the way a hostile naval power could have cut off australia from the rest of the world . 
  i do n't view being able to put up billboards and run ads as oligarchy . 
  they are targeting a single market but not further integration ( well , that i know of ) beyond that . 
  they have free population movement , etc. 
   the proper functioning of the single market should really be the only thing that is fundamental . 
  so the australia-new zealand model ? 
   dead weight countries : - /, 
  how about germany or canada ? 
  those are both federal states . 
  definitely needs a bug report going to google . 
  your ad blocker sucks . 
  i use ublock origin and can open the link just fine . 
  * [ firefox add-on ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/ ) * [ chrome add-on ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en ), 
  note that countries with the highest benefits are also the countries with the highest wages relative to country-of-origin . 
  there can be a self-interested economic rationale on the part of migrants , even where that rationale is not `` simply absorb welfare '' . 
  my own suspicion is that few economic migrants intentionally plan to * only * sponge off welfare . 
  `` i 'll help make things better . 
  let 's split some of the gains . '', 
  if europe can not figure out how to integrate economic migrants from africa , then unless she 's going to accept economic decline , she had better get her fertility rate up or find another source of immigration from economic migrants who * can * be integrated . 
  africa will explode population-wise and is probably gon na stay poor for some time , so that 's a reliable source of warm bodies . 
  latin america is * slowly * growing , as is india and the middle east . 
  much of the rest of the world is either well-to-do or does n't have a growing population ( though most of the world is n't seeing a * crashing population * a la europe ... ), 
  well , i suppose they are in net effect , but it 's not immigration that produces that effect -- people have already been choosing not to have children , and this just fills the vast hole created . 
  people saying `` i do n't want to see decline '' and blaming immigrants have causality mixed up ... 
  well , europe 's population is projected by the eu ( europop2013 ) to peak in ~ 2050 : at that point , the increasing ability to keep the elderly alive is outrun by decades of not having many children finally overwhelming all other factors . 
  ( also , keep in mind that unless things change , you 're not gon na be extracting a lot of work out of the elderly . 
  while we can keep people * alive * longer , i dunno how much we can do to keep them * productive * : the mind and body really do go . 
  they 're gon na be pensioners , and that 's just adding to the economic load on the increasingly-small younger portion of the population . 
  so economically , i 'd assume that things peak sooner . ), 
  anyway , at that point , one of the following three points is gon na hold : * the fertility rate losses of past decades have been reversed . 
  i doubt that it 'll be high enough to stop declines , but it could reduce them , with about a twenty year delay -- think of raising a kid as being a twenty-year investment that produces a new worker -- on flattening out losses in production . 
  * europe gets millions of immigrants ( probably from africa , unless europe is actively discouraging obtaining immigrants from africa and soliciting immigrants from somewhere else . 
  india or latin america are presently poor enough and have large-enough and slowly-growing populations ) . 
  currently , each generation in the eu-28 is about three-quarters the size of the previous generation , which is a big hole to fill . 
  * europe 's global economic clout declines . 
   it 's difficult to respond to that . 
  it 's completely backwards to defend a law because of its adherence to another law , i 'm not talking about the * legal * principle . 
  i 'm saying that i 'd object to the ideological principle of the government saying `` you are not permitted to go set up billboards or purchase tv ads to support someone '' . 
   do you actually like the consequence that it 's impossible to compete with other candidates , if those other candidates have the support of billionaires who are willing to spend money on political campaigns ? 
   seychelles also incarcerates some somali pirates . 
  subtracting the somali pirate inmates still leaves the seychelles with the highest incarceration rate in the world . 
  hmm . 
  the same did n't apply to canada , and canada went into world war ii . 
    i 'm not advocating for a unitary state like france where other cultures got suppressed . 
    and yet that model would make belgium actually functional , rather than the mess it is today . 
  is it the walloons that get suppressed , or the flemings ? 
  san marino did n't !, 
  for [ * citizens united * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens_united_v._fec ) to have been ruled otherwise , the government would necessarily have had to regulate political speech . 
  it would be a grave violation of freedom of speech , and i would be highly opposed to such a ruling happening . 
  the american civil war established that states could not unilaterally leave union . 
  the meaning of [ federation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation ) presently implies this :  a federation ( also known as a federal state ) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central ( federal ) government . 
  in a federation , the self-governing status of the component states , as well as the division of power between them and the central government , is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party , the states or the federal political body . 
  http://www.asianz.org.nz/reports/report/new-zealand-trade-strategy-and-evolving-asian-pacific-regional-economic-architecture/sequence-of-integration-fta-and-single-market-without-customs-union/  australasian economic integration , like european integration , has deepened . 
  however , deepening trans-tasman integration differs from european precedent in at least two important ways . 
  first , australasian policymakers did not create a customs union before constructing a single market . 
  second , a single market has remained the goal of australasian economic integration . 
  while policymakers have discussed possibilities for further deepening the relationship -- including a customs and/or currency union -- they have chosen not to move beyond efforts to complete a single market . 
  these outcomes reflect the impacts of forces mediating the transmission of ideas from europe to australasia . 
  hmm . 
  it may stay an economic union . 
  i suspect that it 's just based on whether the data was trivially-available and someone cared . 
  i did the math and the us has ~ 1.4 latvias of adult prisoners .

  [ looks like the cathedral had a near miss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strasbourg_cathedral_bombing_plot ) :  in december 2000 , an al-qaeda plot to bomb the strasbourg christmas market , at the feet of the strasbourg cathedral on new year 's eve was discovered . 
  the plot was foiled by french and german police after a terrorist network based in frankfurt , germany , the `` frankfurt group '' , was unravelled . 
  a total of fourteen people were convicted as part of the plot ; four in germany and ten in france , including the operational leader , mohammed bensakhria ( a.k.a. 
  `` meliani '' ) , thought to be a european deputy to osama bin laden . 
  the alleged mastermind of the plot was thought to have been abu doha , who was detained in the united kingdom . 
  edit : as for world war ii , it looks like : * strasbourg was south of the fighting with the germans , so i assume that it did n't suffer damage in the german capture . 
  * it looks like it did [ receive some allied bombing in world war ii , though not severe compared to many other cities ] ( https://dlozeve.github.io/ww2-bombings/ ) . 
  * [ german soldiers apparently retreated from strasbourg fairly-rapidly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberation_of_strasbourg ) , so there was n't much damage created in the allied capture . 
  may was the daughter of a priest too . 
  huh . 
  weird coincidence . 
   she did use '' \u0442\u044b '' , an informal version of `` you '' , just like `` du '' and `` sie '' in german , which is not suitable for diplomatic talk . 
  the [ t-v distinction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%e2%80%93v_distinction ) is dead or dying across a number of languages . 
  you sure that this was n't intentional ? 
  [ well , a stereo at least ... ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/14/boris-johnsons-water-cannons-cost-320000-will-sold-knock-off/ ), 
   but what is this thing called russophobia ? 
  the term suggests a fundamental dislike of russia or russians . 
  by accusing western societies of `` russophobia '' , pro-kremlin propaganda outlets downgrade criticism of kremlin policies and actions to being somehow irrational and not worthy of a serious reply . 
  at the same time , the term tries to turn the tables against the west , which in pro-kremlin media is often depicted as a place where the fight against intolerance has gone too far . 
  good point . 
  using `` russophobia '' is an example of using language to try to frame a narrative !, 
  it 's good to be aware of it when it happens , as if it were an honest point that the writer were trying to raise , he could simply make the point explicitly instead of trying to load language . 
   if we accept the russophobia narrative , it suddenly becomes the west that is intolerant , and not pro-kremlin media with , for example , their regrettable use of ** homophobic ** , sexist , racist and anti-semitic propaganda . 
  as katri pynn\u00f6niemi of the finnish institute of international affairs puts it : `` the attacker becomes the victim and the victim is accused of starting the conflict '' . 
  wrong . 
  there 's also king george iii , aka `` tea tax nazi '' .

   we have been so weak and unsure of ourselves since christianity ( god ) died i thought that he was n't too enthusiastic about christianity .
