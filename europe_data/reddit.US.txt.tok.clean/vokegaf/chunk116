  okay , but by-and-large , life is not easy for africans in africa . 
   bmw closed its battery production 3 years ago , it was the last on german soil . 
  if i were an auto company , why would i do my battery production domestically ? 
  probably a lot cheaper to do it overseas somewhere with lax environmental laws . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/take-home_vehicle  the use of company cars is widespread in some regions . 
  for example , business registrations account for roughly 50 % of all car sales in the eu , largely due to taxation rules which give companies a strong incentive to provide the benefit . 
  god * damn * , europe . 
   which means , with volvo 's model cycles lasting up to 10 years , that this is n't likely to be archieved before 2030 . 
  i mean , i get your point , but you 're making some conservative assumptions : * `` up to '' ten years , not ten years . 
  * i dunno what phase of the model life cycle they 're in . 
  if it 's ten years and i choose a transition time randomly , on average it 'd be five years into the life cycle . 
  granted , if they 're choosing a transition point immediately after all models are introduced model introduction -- which they may be -- then it 'd maximize the time until switchover . 
  * this is n't a new issue -- it 's been like this for decades . 
  i know that there have been incentives , but they have n't worked , at least not to the level necessary . 
  * also , immigration means that you can `` make up for '' time in the past . 
  you ca n't have a twenty-year-old born to compensate for the fact twenty years ago , people were n't having kids . 
  even if you ( implausibly ) immediately bring tfr to 3 and hold it there long enough to make up for the decline in terms of current total population , it means that you 're gon na face a slump followed by a boom . 
  applies to schooling , geriatric care , the works -- pain in the ass . 
  but you * can * have a twenty-year-old immigrate , can fill in that demographic hole after-the-fact if you use immigration to do so . 
  maybe so , but that 's been the case for a long time , and incentives have n't happened or have n't been effective . 
   poland is trying to rebuild its influence '' in the region as the most populous country , the most militarily and economically powerfull . 
  moscow believes that warsaw will promote a project designed to build a `` new sanitary cordon against russia , deploy a missile defense system and to some extent create a kind of competition against russia . '', 
  okay , two points about stuff i 've seen from the kremlin now : * `` do n't trust poland , because they 're off building spheres of influence '' . 
  * trying to undermine trust between countries by claiming self-interest or ulterior motives has come up on a number of occasions . 
  `` russia is concerned that germany is out to get other countries in the region '' and so forth . 
  ultimately , russia 's facing a coalition , and trying to cause rifts to widen is a good idea . 
  * if someone accuses russia of doing something , or there is reason to believe that russia os doing something , then russia will claim that another country is off doing it . 
  * this happens even when the claim is ridiculous . 
  right after russia attacked ukraine , for example , i remember claims floating around that nato was planning to attack it . 
  poland is not trying to establish a [ * cordon sanitaire * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cordon_sanitaire ) . 
  it borders kaliningrad , and doing that would entail somehow slicing off part of kaliningrad , which is n't what poland 's been doing . 
  i think that this may have more to do with normalizing things that * russia * has done than anything else . 
  because if you have the political desire necessary , death and violation of duty-to-rescue is a dumb place to start breaking rules . 
  just violate non-refoulement restrictions if you need to do so -- people get dumped on the closest shore . 
  or withdraw from the refugee convention and set up detention centers . 
  people advocating for letting people drown are just venting frustration . 
  it 's not a good fix . 
  i think that the major factors that would produce action or not are different when it comes to defending against an attack and enforcing immigration restrictions . 
   once given asylum ( or in some cases even before ) many of them use their provided social welfare money to fly back to eritrea for `` vacations '' ... statistics ? 
  `` many '' is a weasel word -- it can mean just about anything . 
  there 's only immigration . 
  if people are n't having kids , that 's an independent process . 
  not pulling in migrants is n't gon na magic up a bunch of extra births in europe . 
  so who regulates commercial drivers ? 
  the states that they pass through , or the states where they accept a fare ? 
  helmia tried to post a [ reasonably innocuous comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6k7ko6/the_official_portrait_of_president_macron_has/djjx820/ ) and her client multiple-posted a week ago . 
  i do n't think that the eu is gon na be really enthusiastic about recognizing a region whose first effort is going to be threatening trying to induce collapse of the euro zone . 
   i ca n't fathom a universe in which the eu raises borders and abolishes schengen in catalonia , the gateway of the iberian peninsula to europe . 
  why would the eu do that , unless spain withdraws ? 
  i also think that the eu is producing some of this . 
  both scotland in indyref 1 and catalonia planned to join the eu and leverage the eu 's size , while eliminating having to pay other regions of the country . 
  the us constitution disallows the us from forming new states out of existing states without agreement from the state and the federal government . 
  i wonder if a similar clause in the eu might avoid this sort of fragmentation . 
   when estonia , latvia and lithuania had their referendums no county said they would recognize them . 
  in us eyes , there was never an annexation of the baltic states , so there was no need for an independence referendum -- they had never stopped being independent , and the baltic diplomatic delegations in new york continued to speak for the country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_government-in-exile  of the three baltic states , only estonia established a formal government in exile . 
  in the cases of latvia and lithuania , sovereign authority had been vested in its diplomatic legations . 
  even with regard to estonia , the legations were the primary instrument for the conduct of diplomacy and for administering the daily matters of state ( such as issuing passports ) . 
  estonia 's primary legation was the consulate in new york city . 
    under the stimson doctrine , united states , and under similar doctrines , the legitimacy of the soviet occupation of baltic states was never recognized . 
  as primary diplomatic authority was exercised by the estonian consulate ( in new york ) , the government in exile 's role from oslo was , to a great degree , symbolic in nature . 
   same thing happened with the baltics . 
  with the baltics , the us simply said from the beginning that they 'd never been annexed and were illegally occupied . 
  no annexation , no quesrtion one way or another of secession . 
  some other countries recognized annexation , but the us did n't . 
  too naughty for ya ? 
  no , because the truth of what happened thousands of years ago is n't germane to the point , which is to highlight the benefits of common language for working together to achieve things .

  luckily , the statement 's meaning here was n't predicated on belief in any religion . 
  [ genesis 11:4 -9 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+11%3a4-9&amp;version=niv ) :  then they said , `` come , let us build ourselves a city , with a tower that reaches to the heavens , so that we may make a name for ourselves ; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth . ''   but the lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building . 
  the lord said , `` if as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this , then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them . 
  come , let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other . ''   so the lord scattered them from there over all the earth , and they stopped building the city . 
  that is why it was called babel -- because there the lord confused the language of the whole world . 
  from there the lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth .

   deus vult * twitchtwitchtwitch * http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/11/17/the-american-western-european-values-gap/  americans also distinguish themselves from western europeans on views about the importance of religion . 
  half of americans deem religion very important in their lives ; fewer than a quarter in spain ( 22 % ) , germany ( 21 % ) , britain ( 17 % ) and france ( 13 % ) share this view . 
    moreover , americans are far more inclined than western europeans to say it is necessary to believe in god in order to be moral and have good values ; 53 % say this is the case in the u.s. , compared with just one-third in germany , 20 % in britain , 19 % in spain and 15 % in france . 
    in the u.s. , women and older respondents place more importance on religion and are more likely than men and younger people to say that faith in god is a necessary foundation for morality and good values . 
  about six-in-ten ( 59 % ) american women say religion is very important in their lives , compared with 41 % of men ; and while a majority ( 56 % ) of americans ages 50 and older say religion is very important to them , 48 % of those ages 30 to 49 and 41 % of those younger than 30 place similar importance on religion . 
    similarly , while a majority of american women ( 58 % ) say it is necessary to believe in god in order to be moral and have good values , men are nearly evenly divided , with 47 % saying belief in god is a necessary foundation for morality and 51 % saying it is not . 
  among americans ages 50 and older , 58 % say one must believe in god in order to be moral and have good values ; 50 % of those ages 30 to 49 and 46 % of those younger than 30 share this view .

   in 1830 , drawing inspiration from the recent july revolution in france , the southern provinces of the united netherlands rebelled against dutch rule after a period of growing economic , religious , and political alienation . 
  after some fighting in august-september 1830 , the dutch were forced out of much of the region and belgium gained de facto independence . 
  i think he means that the belgian flag has to go dutch for the benefit of the walloons , not that the belgian colonies need to have the belgian flag .
