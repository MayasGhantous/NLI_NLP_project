  oh , for chrissake . 
  hmm . 
  i was going to say `` basketball '' and `` ice hockey '' , but apparently canada was substantially-responsible for ice hockey while part of the british empire : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_hockey#precursors  while the game 's origins lie elsewhere , montreal is at the centre of the development of the sport of contemporary ice hockey , and is recognized as the birthplace of organized hockey . 
  [ 18 ] on march 3 , 1875 , the first organized indoor game was played at montreal 's victoria skating rink between two nine-player teams , including james creighton and several mcgill university students . 
  ... and while basketball * was * invented in the us , it was apparently by a canadian immigrant during the british empire days : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_naismith  naismith earned a ba in physical education ( 1888 ) and a diploma at the presbyterian college in montreal ( 1890 ) . 
  [ 7 ] from 1891 on , naismith taught physical education and became the first mcgill director of athletics , but then left montreal to become a physical education teacher at the ymca international training school in springfield , massachusetts . 
  [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ snip ]  at springfield ymca , naismith struggled with a rowdy class that was confined to indoor games throughout the harsh new england winter and thus was perpetually short-tempered . 
  under orders from dr. luther gulick , head of springfield ymca physical education , naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an `` athletic distraction '' : gulick demanded that it would not take up much room , could help its track athletes to keep in shape [ 10 ] and explicitly emphasized to `` make it fair for all players and not too rough . 
  '' ... the first game of `` basket ball '' was played in december 1891 . 
  looks like [ golf was from the dutch , though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_golf ) :  the origins of golf are unclear and much debated . 
  however , it is generally accepted that modern golf developed in the netherlands during the middle ages . 
  the game did not find international popularity until the late 19th century , when it spread into the rest of the united kingdom and then to the british empire and the united states .

  ah , well . 
  in the immortal words of vice president biden , [ god save the queen !, 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/07/joe-biden-whispers-god-save-queen-certifies-us-election-results/ ), 
  i 'll believe that there 's probably some form of legal differences , but in the sense that a court must authorize police involvement , skimming french wikipedia with google translate , it looks pretty similar to my eyes to a us search warrant for most cases . 
  [ perquisition ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2ffr.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fperquisition&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) :  searches are regulated by articles 56 et seq. 
  of the code of criminal procedure . 
  they are possible in all places where the person can say `` at home '' ( definition of the home ) irrespective of his or her title of occupation , such as a campsite or a hotel room or the apartment of a third party if she lives there . 
    only the intrusion into the home of a police officer without a decision of the liberty judge or without the consent of the occupant constitutes an infringement of the right to inviolability of the home . 
    however , in the context of a flagrant investigation , the consent of the occupier and the decision of the judge of freedoms are not necessary ( the '' search warrant '' does not exist in french law ; a concept that is only present in canadian and american law ) [ 1 ] . 
  `` flagrant investigation '' in france sounds like a search directly in the aftermath of a crime where the person is directly linked to the crime ( e.g. 
  the police chasing an armed person from a killing to a house and being able to search the a house ) without needing to obtain judicial approval . 
  in the us , the police could still * enter * the house while chasing someone and anything in plain view could be used as evidence , but as long as the police have secured the scene , they could n't then go rummaging around the house without first obtaining a warrant . 
  so i 'll grant that the bar may differ , but they do n't seem that radically different -- that is , the french police ca n't simply say `` oh , i think that i 'll go search the house of this sketchy character because he 's sketchy '' . 
  the us only had country-of-origin immigration quotas in the period between 1921 and 1965 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_quota_act  the emergency quota act , also known as the emergency immigration act of 1921 , the immigration restriction act of 1921 , the per centum law , and the johnson quota act ( ch . 
  8 , 42 stat . 
  5 of may 19 , 1921 ) restricted immigration into the united states . 
  although intended as temporary legislation , the act `` proved in the long run the most important turning-point in american immigration policy '' [ 2 ] because it added two new features to american immigration law : numerical limits on immigration and the use of a quota system for establishing those limits . 
  these limits came to be known as the national origins formula . 
  today , the us does not directly restrict immigration overall on country of origin . 
  the us does have a naturalization limit that specifically applies to refugees , currently of about 70k people per year , which has specified per-continent limits . 
  the issue is n't the country entirely dying out . 
  that 'd take some generations , even in the case of portugal . 
  it 's the loss of social security and international decline of the economy . 
  today , absent any changes , every generation in the eu is 3/4 the size of the prior . 
  in portugal , a particularly badly-off country , it 's 1/2 . 
  two generations of that , a working life , and every portuguese person is having to pay to support four times as many elderly . 
  in the long run , if a quarter of europe is depopulated each generation , europe 's going to wind up with someone else coming in anyway . 
  maybe not today or tomorrow , maybe it can be delayed for a handful of generations , but when europe 's military and economic importance have declined to a small fraction of what they are today , and the land is the same mild-climated , pleasant place , europe will lose wars or simply not have the resources to control who enters . 
  today , europe has the resources to select who it is who comes in and structure that immigration . 
  that wo n't be what happens down the line if europe simply ignores the issue . 
   anyway , i think majority of people would gladly see their wages and pensions trimmed but preserve their society , than live in a mena ghetto , and still be poor . 
  so , you 'll pull your own weight , eh ? 
  do n't need younger people to support you in your old age via government programs because you 're a saver ? 
  good for you . 
  are you ready for house prices to also collapse ? 
  because that 's what happens in a shrinking population . 
  that 's where most people store the largest portion of their assets . 
  i 'd add that i personally think that europe would be better off if it dealt with the bulk of this via increase in birthrate , rather than immigration . 
  but i think that a steady process of immigration is still much preferable to decline of international capability and a sharp fall in standard of living coupled with ultimately entirely-unmanaged immigration . 
   the eu still ca n't afford headlines along the lines of `` france and germany force small countries to trigger economic collapse so they can get richer '' and `` unemployment doubles in x country because eu does n't want them to compete '' . 
  i mean , okay , there 's a sense in which * no * union is going to want negative headlines . 
  but broadly-speaking , i think that if the eu is going to have critical headlines , these are probably ones that it is most-capable of swallowing without risks to its integrity . 
  here 's a [ list of european tax havens ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/wealth-management/121515/top-10-european-tax-havens.asp ) . 
  * with the exception of ireland , sweden , and jersey ( well , and england , but that point is moot ) , every entry there is really tightly geographically-connected to the eu . 
  i mean , sure , luxembourg * could * leave the eu , but it 'd be a monumental pain in the rear for luxembourg . 
  * the whole point of * being * a tax haven in the eu means that it 's hard to credibly threaten leaving over losing the ability to be a tax haven in the eu ... because leaving produces the same `` ca n't be a tax haven in the eu '' effect . 
  a tax haven would need to credibly argue that if it * could n't * be a tax haven , it would be worse off in the eu than out . 
  if switzerland , say , wants to threaten leaving schengen over gun rights , then she can at least claim that if she leaves schengen , she gets to keep her gun rights . 
  but if she says `` if you do n't let me keep my gun rights , i 'll leave and drop my gun rights anyway ... '' well , that does n't sound nearly as likely that she 's going to actually follow through . 
  * specifically with regard to ireland -- which i assume is where you 're coming at this from -- there 's a public that is [ very pro-eu ] ( http://www.newstalk.com/reader/47.301/89864/0/ ) . 
  for ireland to credibly say that leaving is a risk , the public would have to see a 30 % + shift in their opinions of the eu based upon tax policy changes being forced on ireland by the eu . 
  i do n't follow irish politics , but i doubt that that is gon na happen . 
  if the much-more-at-risk-of-leaving uk did n't get significant concessions in the face of an actual referendum , i have a hard time seeing ireland getting the eu to back down on something that 's disliked by many other members . 
  ireland is simply not a country that brussels needs to expend more resources on to obtain political capital . 
  france is a larger risk , and i 'm pretty sure that france is n't enthusiastic about irish tax policy . 
  [ it did n't stop the uss * caron * from doing the run ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4jqhnxrwbg ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homelessness_in_russia  after the breakup of the ussr , the problem of homelessness sharpened dramatically , partially because of the legal vacuum of the early 1990s with some laws contradicting each other and partially because of a high rate of frauds in the realty market . 
  in 1991 articles 198 and 209 of russian criminal code which instituted a criminal penalty for not having permanent residence were abolished . 
  because most flats had been privatized and many people sold their last shelter without successfully buying another , there was a sharp increase of homeless . 
  renting apartments from a private owner became widespread ( which usually only gives temporary registration and the apartment owner could evict the lessee after the contract is over , or if the rent was unpaid ) . 
  in moscow , the first overnight shelter for homeless was opened in 1992 . 
  [ 2 ] in the late 1990s certain amendments in law were implemented to reduce the rise in homelessness , such as the prohibition of selling last flat with registered children . 
  well , if there was a difference here , what did estonia and russia do differently ?

  i 'm not trying to argue in favor of one system or another -- i 'm just saying that india is somewhat-unusual in having this characteristic , and it definitely is a strong departure from what you 're advocating for in the eu . 
  my own take , were the us to be `` done from scratch '' today , would be to make representation proportional to population . 
  i think that the main argument for per-state representation is that it makes joining much more acceptable to new , low-population members . 
  it might have been important to the us in the era of westward expansion , but i think that today , it is probably disadvantageous . 
  eurostat uses `` ea '' ( euro area ) rather than `` ez '' ( euro zone ) ?
