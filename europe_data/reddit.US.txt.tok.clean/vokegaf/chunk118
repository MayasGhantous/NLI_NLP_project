  if you mean where you can legitimately get by with english ... i dunno . 
  are there any places in countries that do n't have english as an official language that use enough english that it 's possible to really get by without significant inconvenience ? 
  i mean , did all those british retirees in spain pick up spanish ? 
  i think that non-tax-haven countries are going to object to locking in tax-haven based gains -- that is , they 're going to see revenue from being a tax haven as not properly being `` owned '' by the tax haven . 
  ironically , india 's bicameral legislature appears to allocate both legislative houses in proportion to population , and does n't allocate power on a per-state basis . 
  not that i think that germany wields radically disproportionate influence , but i think that that 's pretty much independent of where political influence is . 
  i mean , regardless of who influences what , is he seriously going to say `` i think that germany , france , and italy should debate the future of the eu , and the other countries can just wait for the results '' ? 
  what , federation ? 
  some people like risking being mauled ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1edmel_b0o, 
  yeah , i do n't buy it . 
  you 've got papal inerrancy and biblical literalism in various christian denominations . 
  roe = = rules of engagement -- that 's what i 'd normally think of as governing such a situation . 
  is roi something similar ? 
  note : nm = = nanometers nmi = = nautical miles, 
   no doubt orchestrated by the turkish state i 'm not sure that i agree . 
  what 's turkey get out of it ? 
  what , you think that he went out hunting with a political supporter of his and then * intentionally * shot him in the face ? 
  hell , i 've got plenty of complaints about cheney , but `` cheney tried to personally murder someone '' is not one . 
  well , northern italy is probably a destination for immigration , as the eu goes . 
  but , yeah , you 're right -- the eu is n't at the moment a single unit , at least in terms of workers moving in . 
  i kind of think of the eu as a single unit , since ultimately , any naturalized citizen of an eu member can move wherever they want as long as they 're working , and i think that if you legally live and work in an eu member long enough , you normally wind up naturalized . 
  i was just reading an article on here about the proposal of eu-level social security . 
  my guess is that ultimately , the eu is going to wind up federalizing or at the minimum having a common welfare budget , because if it does n't , poorer eu members are just gon na have their welfare systems collapse due to people moving within the eu -- people are gon na move to the `` blue banana '' , and eliminating more barriers to migration , like language , are gon na tend to keep propelling that process along . 
  so for the eu in the long run , my bet is going to be that it will wind up being a unit and having a somewhat-common budget . 
  but if it does n't ... yeah , i agree that the wealthier members are gon na have an easier time pulling people in . 
  honestly , the process for amending the constitution in some countries is a lot higher than in others . 
  i kind of wish that there was a wiki page covering it , because `` adding something to the constitution '' has wildly different importance in various countries . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitutional_amendment in the us , you require 75 % of all * state legislatures * to agree to make a change -- that is a * ton * of legislative seats that need to change , since you 're talking about majority control of 3/4ths of 50 ( maybe 100 ... most are bicameral , and i dunno what ratification looks like at the state level ) independent legislatures . 
  the republicans [ presently have an exceptionally-high level of power ] ( https://m.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/14/1598918/-republicans-now-dominate-state-government-with-32-legislatures-and-33-governors ) in terms of control of single-party control of state legislatures in the us -- the democrats imploded under obama -- and even they are n't at a point where they can modify the us constitution without also getting democrat-controlled legislatures to agree . 
  so something getting into the federal constitution is both very hard to do and represents a very fundamental change to the way society and law works . 
  in denmark , the bar is very high and goes directly to the public . 
  wikipedia says that you need majority approval by the parliament , * then * a general election , then a second majority approval by the parliament , and then a referendum which requires at least 40 % popular participation . 
  in france , it sounds like it requires 3/5ths of the seats of the central government 's legislatures ( or a majority in a popular referendum ) . 
  i strongly suspect that it is not uncommon for a coalition in a parliamentary system to have a 3/5ths majority . 
  that 's much closer to the 2.5 / 5 majority required to pass an ordinary law -- the constitution should look and feel much more similar to other law . 
  in the uk , even if you * had * a single constitution , ( a ) a simple majority of parliament could modify it and ( b ) aside from a few corner cases , i understand that parliament can not normally bind future parliaments * anyway * . 
  parliament-today can not do something that would be any more difficult for parliament-tomorrow to undo than the passing of a law . 
  https://www.britannica.com/topic/search-and-seizure  in france the police have extensive powers of search and seizure in the case of flagrant offense and when a crime is being committed or has just been committed , but in other instances court authorization is required . 
  like , in terms of wanting to associate with russia or the eu ? 
  maybe kazakhstan or belarus ? 
  that being said , while ( not * that * surprisingly ) there is n't serbian support for nato membership , there was pretty substantial support as of december 2014 for eu membership . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union 58 % yes , 26 % no , 16 % undecided so whether-or-not the government is in favor , i do n't think that they 'd have a hard time wrestling it through -- there probably is public support . 
  also , we rank fairly-high on : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_prevalence_of_opiates_use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_prevalence_of_cocaine_use also , that lists prevalence of use , rather than quantity . 
  some drugs can be tested for in city sewage , and i understand that london sees a [ very high quantity of cocaine in its sewage ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/europe/wastewater-drug-tests/ ) . 
  < doubtful  china has significant ai industry compared to , say , europe ? 
  we do drink substantially less alcohol on average than most of you guys , though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita big especialliy in eastern europe . 
  we do have our own vices , though . 
  in polandball , the netherlands is always portrayed with red eyes from marijuana , whereas frankly the us and canada are a greater source ( though i guess we get sunglasses , so ... ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annual_cannabis_use_by_country, 
  hmm . 
  do you have a source to that ? 
  the articles i have read just said that it would apply to eu citizens , not only those who held eu citizenship at brexit . 
  oh ... no , no , i expected that ( though i also expect that the uk is probably off doing private discussions -- a customs union only intrinsically requires that trade agreements not be * in force * concurrently ) . 
  i mean that [ the eu said that it would not talk about eu-uk trade until non-trade issues had been resolved ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-talks-negotiations-latest-uk-eu-divorce-deal-government-agrees-caves-in-before-trade-deal-a7798076.html ) . 
  i am not enthusiastic about unfiltered immigration to europe . 
  i 'd rather see it be skilled . 
  but i do think that europe needs a much higher rate of immigration or a much higher birthrate ( or a major decline in economic clout ) . 
  and i think that a policy that consists of absolutely zero immigration from africa * or * the near east is going to face challenges unless it 's attached to either an alternate source of immigration or major policy changes to bring the fertility rate up . 
  you want a preferably-poor ( easier to appeal to workers ) source with a large , growing population , ideally with a common language and ideally with whom you have a geopolitical interest in building ties with . 
  maybe latin america or india , i dunno . 
  to expand , it looks like [ operation * mare nostrum * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_mare_nostrum ) was specific to italy . 
  blocking parallel talks on trade ? 
  the ottoman empire , transylvania , and russia did n't do too well . 
  austria did n't do too badly . 
  nominal * is * `` regular '' . 
  it measures the international economic clout of a country . 
  you normally use it if you want to meausre how important access to a market is , or how much clout a country has , or how much it can purchase of something on the international market . 
  ppp roughly adjusts for the cost-of-living in a country . 
  typically , it 's a bit `` flatter '' in that wealthy countries require you to purchase labor time from people who make more money . 
  the author should probably have adjusted for ppp here , if he wanted to indicate `` how good an average life is '' in a country . 
  i ca n't think of any cases where ppp adjustment is useful outside of per-capita numbers . 
  tbf , if you work in a wealthy-in-nominal terms country , save like crazy , and then retire to a poorer country , you 're serving the invisible hand and do okay on it . 
  when he says `` the difference is we can control who from india ... '' he does n't mean that the uk ca n't now but will be able to after brexit . 
  he 's saying that unlike with from-eu immigration , from-outside-eu immigration does not have that the case . 
  eh , i think that there were actions on both sides that slowed the process . 
  the eu also drew red lines to start discussions , did n't go for an early offer from the uk on citizens in each other 's territory , and explicitly ruled out parallel talks on trade -- those could all have gone faster . 
  the uk decided to screw around with a general election * after * article 50 ( probably to avoid having the ge be a referendum on article 50 ) and did n't start talks until after the ge . 
  if his main concern is the uk not being competitive internationally economically and we wildly extrapolate from that as representative of what the uk will want : * customs union is probably out . 
  * immigration probably is n't a huge concern ( someone opposed to `` economic nationalism '' is n't particularly likely to be enthusiastic about birthright to a high living standard ) . 
  that being said , i do n't think that the eu * cares * much about immigration to the uk other than in the degree to which it can bind together the various eu members ( or theoretically in the long term bring the uk back in ) , so that may not be of much interest . 
  * he may have no objection to cooperation on security policy . 
  * he would presumably have no issue in cooperating with the eu economically as long as it does not reduce the uk 's ability to have a liberal economy and be internationally competitive . 
  * i suspect that he 's not going to buy into eu labor law . 
  hmm . 
  that title sounds really bad going in -- i figured that his concerns were that the eu was a geopolitical enemy -- but then i read the article , and apparently his beef is that countries in the eu have used it to advocate for even-larger-scale protectionism and to defeat liberal economic policy . 
  that is , he sees it as an economic weight around the neck of the uk . 
   filmed at an event by the libertarian alliance in 2010 , he goes on to argue that the eu has `` succeeded in raising economic nationalism to a continental scale '' . 
    the wycombe mp , who played a lead role in the leave campaign , adds : `` it was meant to defeat economic nationalism , it is therefore a failure in its own terms . 
  economically , i 'm sympathetic to him . 
  the uk is pretty liberal economically compared to a lot of eu members , and the eu , as an institution , is going to reflect the reality in those members . 
  i 'd probably be irritated having to deal with french agricultural policy too . 
  however , politically , i do think that he needs to realize that the eu can only work * if * it can obtain sufficient political support in member countries , and that it is hard to get the necessary buy-in in many countries . 
  we were just talking about political pressure in france from farmers , for example , for a more-protectionist environment . 
  that is , if he had simply said `` let 's just have an ultra-liberal economy in europe '' , it would n't have worked , because many european countries would not have been able to push through the relevant policies ( even if leadership generally agreed ) . 
  i do think that europe 's political leaders have been trying to produce a more-or-less economically-liberal political structure . 
  i do n't think that it can happen overnight . 
  and i think that an eu without the uk is likely to be * less * liberal , and the uk is still gon na want to do business with the mainland . 
  nah , he had that right -- the 200 nautical mile ( nmi , not nm -- that 'd be nanometers ) is to the distance offshore where the eez ends . 
  it 's not `` 200 nmi above-and-beyond other zones '' , but `` 200 nmi off the beach at low tide '' ) . 
  the [ wikipedia eez article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone ) has a [ picture showing the differences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone#/media/file:zonmar-en.svg ) .
