  nitpick : as has been pointed out in other threads , the fishing rights in british territorial waters were not part of eu membership , but of independent british arrangements with other countries . 
   do you think the eu refusing to hold parallel trade talks and demanding 100 billion euro is ` seeking amiable relations ' ? 
  frankly , i think that the uk and the eu should have parallelized everything possible and started on the day that article 50 was used . 
  hard brexit is disadvantageous to both , and the time constraints are not favorable . 
   the eu want unlimited and unrestricted rights for eu citizens in the uk with nothing in return . 
  it 's not unlimited other than in time , and not unrestricted . 
  it would be their eu rights `` frozen '' at the time that the uk leaves the eu . 
  they would n't get post-brexit `` new '' eu rights while in the uk ( which is going to be damned awkward , because there 's no way to revise those rights in the future , even if they wind up having problems ) . 
  i agree that this does not seem acceptable to me . 
  this sort of relationship with [ extraterritorial jurisdiction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extraterritorial_jurisdiction ) for one 's citziens is not common , and one of the few times i can think of it happening was when the uk forced it upon colonial-era china . 
  i do n't know what the eu 's actual concerns are , but one thing might be an immediate post-brexit spate of british laws ejecting recent pre-brexit immigrants . 
  i think that i could see eu-uk agreement on some sort of bounds that sunset to avoid that . 
  if the uk is in good faith willing to commit to immigration that has already happened , then it should n't object to some sort of strictures there . 
  but simply handing authority over to the ecj seems pretty problematic to me . 
  i 'm hoping that the eu is treating this as an optimistic starting point , rather than a red line . 
   the eu is demanding ecj authority over the uk for the next 100 years wait , when did they bound the ecj goal at 100 years ? 
  i thought that it was unlimited . 
  or are you using `` 100 years '' as just a metaphor for `` forever '' ? 
  i could understand the ecj authority during some sort of phase-out period ( merkel , after all , had suggested a five year implementation period ) not being off the table . 
   188 miles just to be nit-picky , the eez is 200 `` nautical miles '' . 
  the unqualified word `` mile '' normally refers to the [ international mile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mile#international_mile ) . 
   the international mile is precisely equal to 1.609344 km ( or 25146/15625 km as a fraction ) . 
  [ 41 ] it was established as part of the 1959 international yard and pound agreement reached by the united states , the united kingdom , canada , australia , new zealand , and south africa , [ 42 ] which resolved small but measurable differences that had arisen from separate physical standards each country had maintained for the yard . 
  that differs from the [ nautical mile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nautical_mile ) :  a nautical mile is a unit of measurement defined as exactly 1852 meters ( about 6,076.1 feet or 1.1508 statute miles ) . 
  historically , it was defined as one minute of latitude , which is equivalent to one sixtieth of a degree of latitude . 
  today it is an si derived unit , being rounded to an even number of meters [ 2 ] and remains in use for both air and marine navigation [ 3 ] and for the definition of territorial waters . 
  [ 4 ] a nautical mile is about 1.15 international miles . 
  hmm . 
  i drink tap water . 
  but i do know some people ( especially immigrants to the us , from poorer countries where the municipal water system is n't all that trustworthy ) who refuse to drink anything but bottled water . 
  i guess this is how standard-of-living costs increase . 
  a romanian who hangs out on / r/the _ donald . 
  this is a new one on me . 
  scientology had people get `` earn their way to the next level towards the truth '' too . 
  all these cults recycle the same damn rhetoric . 
  [ fire a warning shot across her nose ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pncdi_ubguo ), 
  i do n't think that anyone is seriously saying that it was n't legal , just that it might be been better from a diplomatic standpoint to have extended leniency , as turkey probably did not believe it to be a threat to turkey and probably had not exhausted all avenues to get russia to stay out of their airspace . 
  turkey certainly had the * legal * right to shoot down the russian plane . 
  but , then , the soviet union also had the * legal * right to [ shoot down kal-007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) , and that was not seen as a good move after-the-fact . 
  huh . 
  if it were actually running drugs ( as opposed to trying to stage an incident , as some other people have suggested ) , seems like a staggeringly stupid idea to violate territorial waters in a highly-contested area . 
  / r/totallynotrobots, 
  could legitimately be bad aim , if they were aiming close to the thing . 
  problem is , i doubt that greece is gon na apologize to the ship for hitting it without the ship apologizing for being in greek waters . 
  is n't catch-and-discard not breaking the rules , though ? 
  i mean , the uk has some say in anything that the eu does by virtue of being an eu member . 
  i do n't know if that 's the case , but i will believe that incentives are such as to encourage that . 
   i suppose `` selling of vital infrastructure , resources and industry '' to highest foreign bidders is not `` corruption '' to you . 
  what , privatization in general ? 
  no , i certainly would n't call it corruption . 
  i think that it does a good job of getting market forces working where they had n't been . 
  aside from national security issues , foreign dollars are as green as domestic dollars . 
  i am not particularly rabid about may -- i mean , she has n't done anything really exceptional as pm thus far that i know of -- but i do n't see why it 's that objectionable . 
  may needed a larger coalition , parties normally enter coalitions to get things that they want , and in the dup 's case it was more government funding for ni . 
  and personally , i think that the uk probably is n't badly hurt by sending a bit more money to a poorer region . 
  if i were a northern irishman , i 'd say that the dup was doing a solid job of looking out for my interests . 
  if i were a tory voter , i guess that i 'd consider getting a viable coalition worth sacrificing a `` not into wealth redistribution '' principle slightly . 
  if i were an sf voter , i 'd have a hard time complaining about the dup bringing in more funds , and if i were a labour voter , i think that i 'd have a hard time complaining too much about more funds being sent to poorer areas of the uk . 
  it 's not corruption unless the dup are acting against northern ireland 's interests . 
   theresa may literally paid a billion to the dup so they 'd back her in parliament , it was a money going to * northern ireland * , not the dup , right ? 
  i mean , ni is n't exactly the wealthiest place in the uk -- that 'd arguably be a redistributionist policy . 
  note that france is required to honor nato article 5 invocations by the uk in the event of an attack , so france will be on both sides of that one . 
  according to the wikipedia article , the uk does get extended * territorial * waters based on it , though , and it sounds like that 's what is affected here , ratherthan the agreement on eez . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rockall  the united kingdom claimed and incorporated rockall in 1955 . 
  it does not make a claim to extended eez based on rockall and the country has ratified the united nations convention on the law of the sea ( unclos ) , which says that `` rocks which can not sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf '' . 
  [ 1 ] however , such features are entitled to a territorial sea extending 12 nautical miles . 
   royal fishes dammit , uk . 
  according to [ this overview of the matter ] ( https://www.intechopen.com/books/new-approaches-to-the-study-of-marine-mammals/when-whales-became-mammals-the-scientific-journey-of-cetaceans-from-fish-to-mammals-in-the-history-o ) , the english charles darwin was the first person to finally make the jump to calling whales not a type of fish -- since the time of aristotle at least , they 'd been considered a special type of fish -- and yet the uk 's parliament is probably about the last to keep calling them ( albeit in a narrow legal sense ) fish . 
  iirc from / r/ukpolitics discussion , there was a domestic promise made by leave at some point that fishing rights would be returned to british fishermen . 
  anyone familiar with the situation know whether it could be referring to this rather than the common fisheries agreement ? 
  i 'm assuming that the ( lesser ) area here is lower-impact than the area in the eez . 
  well , i ca n't say what gives it soul , but it does produce housing with sane costs , and the high cost of london housing * has * been something that people have regularly ( and understandably ) been complaining about on the uk subs .

  not unless it starts selecting a prime minister . 
  not all legislatures are parliaments . 
  it 's a perfectly cromulent word , but you 've got a picture of the us senate chamber there , and our legislature 's not a parliamentary one .

  yeah , but they 're also all gon na die off sometime in the next 30 years . 
  i think that most of the concern of the person worried about immigration is that it will fundamentally change his home society in some permanent way that he does n't like . 
  his first post was `` what 's next , spiritist seance ? 
  lol '' i can only assume that for god-knows-what-reason , he does n't like this . 
   parliament * twitch twitch *, 
  really and honestly , legislators should have google glasses-type things ( maybe sans camera ) . 
  it 's less disruptive , because it 's not obvious that you 're working on something , and it does n't display your screen contents to everyone behind you . 
  so , just so we 're clear , you do n't have any objection to someone lying in state , but you do specifically object to someone lying in state in a hemicycle-shaped legislative chamber ? 
  what is the basis for that concern ? 
  i really do n't think so . 
  i think that for erdogan , religion is just a tool . 
  i do n't think that he 's much interest in going particularly far with it . 
   religion is regarded by the common people as true , by the wise as false , and by the rulers as useful . 
  -- seneca the younger you can find plenty of us politicians who have used christianity as a political tool over the past century , and the us did n't head towards the christian equivalent of islamism , did n't head towards [ dominionism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominion_theology ) . 
  what i object to with erdogan is n't that he leverages religion , but that he 's taking actions that deeply modify the political system to eliminate sources of opposition to him ( to say nothing of his mass purges ) . 
  yeah , that 's kinda got blackmail or spying potential . 
  i mean , okay , this guy may not be an angel , but i wonder how much of that is going on in other situations ... 
  well , is a reasonable response `` now let 'em burn '' ? 
  because i 'd think that a better one would be `` what 's going wrong and how can it be addressed ? '', 
  aside from the gold on the frames , i like erdogan 's decor .
