  * especially * if the relative ability or willingness to pay differs a lot , there is an incentive for a vendor to * want * to segment up a market . 
  that lets them produce two different prices for different segments . 
  us and european auto manufacturers have shown no objection to there being largely-similar-but-incompatible safety requirements for the us and the eu . 
  that is , there 's no real pressure on them to conform to both , because their desire to shift the [ consumer surplus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_surplus ) to producer surplus dominates their desire to leverage economy of scale . 
  third , i think that the authors may be attributing effects caused by the size of the us market to the `` california effect '' . 
  because goods move fairly-freely within the us , the `` california effect '' is relatively strong -- it is a pain in the ass for people to have a `` california version '' and a `` non-california-version '' when normally people expect to be able to buy goods and use them regardless of state lines , when people will normally be operating the automobiles across state lines anyway , etc. 
  however , that is * not * as much the case for international markets -- while canada -- even closely-integrated canada -- certainly adopts many us standards , the same degree of product movement does n't exist . 
  however , the us market is very large . 
  there are many things where it simply makes sense to produce something for the us market , and does not make sense to produce something for a many very small markets like , iceland . 
  this does not mean that the same holds * vis-a-vis * the eu and the us , which are both very large markets . 
  many of the examples that are used here do not depend on the `` california effect '' , but depend on situations where there really is naturally a single product -- for example , a single multinational in both the us and the eu that wants to merge with another multinational , or a single website that can be accessed in the eu and the us . 
  in this situation , the eu can certainly exert influence , but it is not doing so via the `` california effect '' , but because it has direct impact on the one `` product '' that is currently being produced . 
   the eu has adopted stricter privacy regulations than the us . 
  the eu places more restrictions on what companies may do . 
  the us places more restrictions on what the government may do . 
   military power is so useful , like destabilizing the me , for example . 
  western europe and thus the european union -- if it existed -- would be a very different place today without military power having had supported it . 
  i 'd keep perspective in mind -- there are successful uses and unsuccessful uses . 
  i think that very few would argue that an absence of hard power is viable -- that the two typically address different situations . 
  for example , take world war ii . 
  the us blocked oil shipments to japan to place japan in a position where japan could not continue to wage war against china . 
  however , if the us had not had hard power capability , had the us only tried to use soft power , japan would have simply seized the oil -- as it attempted to do -- and continued on its merry way . 
  on the other hand , using only hard power and preemptively-attacking japan would probably not have been politically-acceptable , and would likely greatly-diminish prospects for a low-cost solution . 
  it was only the two working in concert that ended the occupation of china . 
  i think that , perhaps because of recency bias over events , that it becomes * en vogue * to treat all uses of something as clearly useless or incorrect . 
  do peaceful political protests work ? 
  sometimes they do , and sometimes they do not . 
  but it would be foolish to say `` these did not work , so people should not use them '' . 
  they 're a tool in the toolbox . 
  the dude is turkish . 
  it never says that he 's muslim . 
  so , albania has a very moderate muslim population . 
  would you object to albanians immigrating to slovenia ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_literacy_rate to keep the thread data-driven , looks like turkey has about a 95 % literacy rate among people 15 and older . 
  i bet that if they asked about his kids , they 'd be able to speak german just fine . 
  come on , 18-25 is n't a kid . 
   also , anyone can do a swastika . 
  it 's not like it 's copyright protected or anything . 
  dammit , people . 
  trademark , not copyright . 
   actually you 're from the place where there 's even less restrictions on free speech and an even stronger fascist and authoritarian movement . 
  one of us have had those rights for a long time and one of us did n't wind up with hitler . 
  i am not at all convinced that antifa beating people up is a plus . 
   mature we 're talking about shit reddit says here . 
  i feel like someone needs to start a subreddit just to track all the alliances and drama going on on / r/place . 
  i mean , gibraltar has 32k people . 
  this is like the mayor of a small town saying something . 
  i 'm still a little disappointed with how rude international figures have been in the past few years ( and , yes , that includes trump ) , but it 's worth keeping this in perspective . 
  i think that if they were n't going to follow the referendum , that they should n't have put it up , frankly . 
  honestly , this `` let 's play chicken with leaving the eu to see if i can get concessions that i want '' is a problem . 
  it 's relatively-easy to leave the eu , and because of the veto-based structure , relatively-hard to get changes without something drastic ( like being on the verge of leaving the eu ) . 
  that seems like a bad combination . 
  i mean , in theory i suppose so , but in practice i bet that it would either ( a ) require separating gibraltar from the uk in many ways that probably would not be acceptable to either or ( b ) become a glorious source of loopholes for the uk 's future arrangements with the eu . 
  hmm . 
  do you have some examples ? 
   in 2006 , a russian law legalized targeted killing abroad . 
  russia has never acknowledged using the authority under that law and has specifically denied any government ties to high-profile poisoning cases . 
  i 'm not very enthusiastic about that , but what exactly does it have to do with this affair , other than being a poisoning with a metal ? 
  this clearly is n't a litvinenko-style polonium poisoning , and it was on russian soil . 
  europe 's kansas -- a giant wheat producer . 
  has a flag showing wheat . 
  probably has a ton of farmers that really like talking about wheat . 
  [ * metro : last light * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro:_last_light ) was developed there . 
  currently running way below full economic potential -- gdp per-capita is on par with poland in the mid-1990s . 
  has a big whack of corruption to eliminate . 
  i do n't think that it is . 
  `` a cuckholded husband who is taking it out on the kids '' ? 
  that 's `` someone angry that he was cheated on '' , not `` someone with a fetish who just watched his wife take part in the fetish , then simply beat up on the kids '' . 
  i think that some people would dispute what `` legitimate political target '' would mean , but i 'll certainly agree that the ira was much less interested in simply running up a high kill count . 
  the [ brain slug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_jo%c3%a3o_vi ) can easily control a new portuguese host . 
  i think that showing pictures of bodies , while it may very much violate social norms , is n't really sensationalism . 
  sensationalism would be overhyping what 's actually happened , like `` terrorists strike russian train ... could the kremlin be next ? '', 
  schizophrenics are n't inherently homicidal . 
  we went metal detector crazy after 9/11 , so if it 's a problem , it 's more widespread than that . 
  hmm . 
  the ira did kill people ( and tried to kill other people , like margaret thatcher ) . 
  i agree that it did aim for property-rather-than-people in some cases , but neither was it bloodless . 
   instead it 's `` freedom ! '', 
  and independence days and celebrations independence days are fun and britain has n't gotten to declare independence from anything since ... hell , i dunno , the roman empire ? 
  we have n't shut up about ours and it 's been two hundred and fifty years . 
  c'mon , got ta let 'em have some fun too . 
  now now . 
  most autistic people are perfectly polite . 
  if world war iii is on , just giving notice that we get dibs on invading iran . 
  well , it was the italians who signed off on killing the guy the first time around , so you 'd think that the eu could let some other people have a go at it . 
  i dunno ... [ mccarthy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_mccarthy ) arguably made for some tangles . 
  if you 're retired , you do n't care about most of that . 
  makes it cheaper to get stuff , if anything . 
  i see that you left off the [ commonwealth of nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) to simplify it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sign_of_the_horns lots of different things . 
   the apotropaic usage of the sign can also be seen in italy and in other mediterranean cultures where , when confronted with unfortunate events , or simply when these events are mentioned , the sign of the horns may be given to ward off bad luck . 
  it is also used traditionally to counter or ward off the `` evil eye '' ( malocchio in italian ) . 
  in italy specifically , the gesture is known as the * corna * . 
  -  the 1969 back album cover for witchcraft destroys minds & reaps souls on mercury records by chicago-based psychedelic-occult rock band coven , led by singer jinx dawson , pictured coven band members giving the `` sign of the horns '' correctly [ citation needed ] and included a black mass poster showing members at a ritual making the sign . 
  starting in early 1968 , coven concerts always began and ended with dawson giving the sign on stage . 
  this began the common use in heavy metal music . 
  berlusconi was n't an autocrat , was he ? 
  i said that sympathy may have decreased , not that it does n't exist . 
  in the same way that , say , another massacre somewhere in central africa does n't really register on one 's radar , so too do does increased distance cause similar separation . 
  [ pre-ukraine , russia was seen as the american public as being mostly-friendly .
