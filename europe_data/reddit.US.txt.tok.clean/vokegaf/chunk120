  what happened in turkey was not particularly contingent on islamism . 
  this was no iranian revolution . 
  why on earth would german taxpayers want a hard brexit ? 
   she threw away a majority , and then had to pay the dup # 1.5 bn to hold onto power . . she 's not a shrewd operator . 
  i remember / r/ukpolitics . 
  pretty much everyone expected a tory ge landslide early on . 
  she was wrong in that many young people abruptly voted labour , but but this was an error that seemed to be made by the bulk of those following british politics . 
   it is increasingly clear that any deal will result in the watering down of brexit . 
  of course . 
  having any sort of trade agreement is a watering down of brexit from what would otherwise happen . 
  the uk and the eu both have an interest in doing that . 
   11 million appear to have been settled , not in europe . 
   the issues goes beyond the turks and kurds and actually threatens to undo foundations of which modern europe rest upon , namely the [ westphalian peace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_westphalia ) where countries agreed not to interfere in others countries internal affairs . 
  disagree . 
  not saying that erdogan can not or does not involve himself in internal affairs of other countries . 
  but the rallies were aimed at affecting turkish domestic politics ; any side effect on german politics ( e.g. 
  fighting betwen people in favor of and opposed to erdogan ) was incidental to that . 
  erdogan wanted turks abroad to vote for him in a turkish referendum . 
  whether-or-not that vote was a good idea , it clearly was predominantly an issue for turkey . 
  the problem is that i know : ** in the past , when it comes to wine , people have had a tremendous ability to support biases in taste judgements that do n't hold up in double-blind testing ** . 
  that makes me skeptical of assertions about food based on subjective experience , especially when the differences are supposed to be strong and broad and vague and there has n't been a testing lab showing strong support for such claims . 
  these people were not intentionally lying , but their subjective experience did not match up with the ingredients in the bottle . 
  a better starting place would be buying chocolate bars from two countries with the same expiration date and establishing that people can reliably identify the `` western '' and `` eastern '' bars in double-blind tests . 
  if there is a major difference , that must hold and it 's cheap to do . 
  if that can be done and they can be reliably distinguished , then look at whether storage practices differ or start doing chemical analysis . 
  ** putin made similar claims to bush ** , which are even more implausible . 
   during a trade dispute when russia cut off imports of american chicken drumsticks ( known colloquially within russia as `` bush legs '' ) , putin in a private conversation with bush asserted that americans deliberately sent bad poultry to russia . 
    `` i know you have separate plants for chickens for america and chickens for russia , '' putin told bush . 
    bush was astonished . 
  `` vladimir , you 're wrong . ''   `` my people have told me this is true , '' putin insisted . 
  ** there 's no economic mechanism to explain it . 
  ** if ee were more price-sensitive than we -- which i could believe -- then for goods that are [ `` binned '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/product_binning ) , like fruit , you might see most stores selling less-expensive grade b fruit . 
  but the claim is that there is a conspiracy to sell worse-quality goods at the same price . 
  that mechanism can not exist unless the food is being sold more cheaply . 
  if anything , i would expect we-produced goods sold in ee to be higher-quality ( and more expensive ) due to the [ alchain-allen effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alchian%e2%80%93allen_effect ) . 
  ** it is difficult to believe that anything like this would not have come to light . 
  ** this would require a broad effort from manufacturers across the board and the establishment of plainly-obvious-to-someone-involved-in-production different processes and batches . 
  it would be extremely difficult to hide -- it ca n't be one or two or three people . 
  ** conspiracy claims have in the past found fertile ground when one group feels marginalized ** . 
  [ operation infektion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_infektion ) would n't have worked without it . 
  is it impossible ? 
  but is it very unlikely , and i feel that alternate explanations make much more sense for such a belief existing . 
  i 'm gon na be blunt : i think that a lot of people do n't like the idea that their ideas might not have popular support , so they have a wealthy mogul rather than public opinion be the reason for their views not taking off . 
  this is not exclusive to the right . 
  everyone needs a boogeyman . 
  hmm . 
  in the us [ immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than the native-born ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/immigrants-commit-less-crime-than-native-born-americans-trump-speech-2017-3/#native-born-americans-are-incarcerated-at-a-much-higher-rate-than-immigrants-1 ) . 
  the london housing situation should really be resolved by removing height limitations . 
  i think that you may be confusing tax havens with locations where it 's easy to establish anonymous corporations . 
  hmm . 
  you 're making it sound like a staged photo op , which it was n't . 
  the existing one brought up when taking the mountaintop was really small . 
  the photographer grabbed a shot that later became famous -- it was n't being set up to make his life easier . 
  seems like it would make a good foundation for something that you did n't want to sink . 
  i 'm not super entrhralled with a lot of their stuff -- a lot of it seems really repetitive to me . 
  the eagle there is badass [ art deco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/art_deco ) , though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lying_in_state  lying in state is the tradition in which the body of a dead official is placed in a state building , either outside or inside a coffin , to allow the public to pay their respects . 
  it traditionally takes place in the principal government building of a country , state , or city . 
  while the practice differs among countries , a viewing in a location other than the principal government building may be referred to as lying in repose . 
  i 'm just really not seeing why you find this objectionable . 
  [ the casket precedes the riderless horse with reversed boots in the stirrups ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riderless_horse ), 
  funerals are a thing in the secular world too , dude . 
   it was an interesting moment to see the first casket with a eu flag on it . 
  * not sure if appropriate to say `` to many more '' !, 
  why do you lack the euro ? 
  you mean its establishment was not recent enough ? 
  you know , watching pissy folks on the continent wish for a breakup of the uk comes off as approximately as lame as watching pissy brexiters wish for a collapse of the eu . 
  just saying . 
  germany , insofar as imposing german fines goes !, 
   precedent shows that crime and terror will only increase while the promised economic benefits will never materialize , ethnic divisions will increase and the far-right will just get more ammunition the worse things get .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legislative_violence#canada  * 5 december 2012 : ndp house leader nathan cullen attempted to delay the passing of a conservative budget bill , leading to a threatening confrontation between conservative government house leader peter van loan and ndp leader tom mulcair , described in the media as a `` near-brawl '' . 
  [ 3 ]   * 18 may 2016 : before a vote in the house of commons prime minister justin trudeau `` manhandled '' conservative party opposition whip gord brown and inadvertently elbowed ndp mp ruth ellen brosseau . 
  ( or perhaps your wikipedia history is less-complete ... ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legislative_violence#united_states  * 15 february 1798 : federalist congressman roger griswold of connecticut attacked vermont representative matthew lyon with a hickory walking stick in the chambers of the united states house of representatives . 
  griswold struck lyon repeatedly about the head , shoulders and arms , while lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows . 
  lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace , took up a pair of metal tongs , and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement . 
  griswold then tripped lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground , at which point the two were separated . 
  after a break of several minutes , however , lyon unexpectedly pursued griswold again with the tongs , and the brawl was re-ignited . 
    the two men had a prior history of conflict . 
  on january 30 of that year , griswold had publicly insulted lyon by calling him a coward , and lyon had retaliated by spitting in griswold 's face . 
  as a result of lyon 's actions in that case , he became the first congressman to have charges filed against him with that body 's ethics committee , although he escaped censure through a vote in the house . 
    * 4 december 1837 : john wilson , the speaker of the arkansas house of representatives and president of the arkansas real estate bank , stabbed representative j. j. anthony to death during a legislative dispute on the floor of the chamber . 
  [ 40 ] anthony had suggested that bounties for the killing of wolves be administered by the president of the state bank , a responsibility comically beneath an official of wilson 's stature . 
  incensed , he drew a bowie knife and attacked anthony , who was unable to defend himself despite drawing a knife of his own . 
  although wilson was expelled from his office , he was later acquitted of murder . 
  [ 41 ] [ 42 ]   * 22 may 1856 : congressman preston brooks of south carolina [ famously assaulted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caning_of_charles_sumner ) charles sumner of massachusetts for a previous speech of his , saying his uncle andrew butler took `` a mistress who , though ugly to others , is always lovely to him ; though polluted in the sight of the world , is chaste in his sight -- i mean , the harlot , slavery . 
  '' [ 43 ] after having consulted with fellow south carolina congressman laurence keitt on the situation , brooks and keitt decided that sumner had the social status of a `` drunkard '' and was thus unworthy of the traditional challenge to a duel . 
  brooks ( accompanied by keitt ) , approached and confronted sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty senate chamber . 
  as sumner began to stand up , brooks began beating sumner severely on the head with a thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet . 
  sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk ( which was bolted to the floor ) , but brooks continued to bash sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor . 
  by this time , sumner was blinded by his own blood , and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed , lapsing into unconsciousness . 
  brooks continued to beat the motionless sumner until he broke his cane , then quietly left the chamber . 
  several other senators attempted to help sumner , but were blocked by keitt , who had jumped into the aisle , brandishing a pistol and shouting , `` let them be !, 
  '' [ 44 ] keitt was censured for his actions and resigned in protest , but was overwhelmingly re-elected to his seat by his south carolina constituency within a month . 
  [ 45 ] for several decades following , senators often carried walking canes and even revolvers in the senate chamber , fearing a similar assault . 
    * 5 february 1858 : congressman laurence keitt of south carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later , starting a massive brawl on the house floor during a tense late-night debate . 
  keitt became offended when pennsylvania congressman ( and later speaker of the house ) galusha a. 
  grow stepped over to the democrat side of the house chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech . 
  keitt dismissively interrupted grow 's speech to demand he sit down , calling him a `` black republican puppy '' .
