  [ vice : what happened to the american mafia ? 
  ] ( https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kwxbpa/what-happened-to-the-american-mafia-712 )  vice : what 's the present state of the mafia in america ? 
    john alite : it 's going back to the old ways of [ stay ] underground and stay quiet and build up . 
  make money and stay low key . 
    scott burnstein : the mafia in america today is still surviving ; however , [ it 's ] not thriving like it once was . 
  serious mob activity still exists , although not as `` greased in '' to the high levels of political power and the country 's infrastructure as in the mafia 's golden era of the 1950s , 60s , and 70s . 
  traditional mob hotbeds like new york , chicago , detroit , boston , providence , philadelphia , and new jersey are still operational and functioning at a consistent level ( some have been hampered by legal assaults in recent years ) , while other cities with a rich mob history like cleveland , milwaukee , kansas city , st. louis , la , pittsburgh , buffalo , new orleans , and tampa bay are either defunct altogether or heading quickly in that direction . 
    the mafia lineage is not being passed on down to the younger generation as it had been in the past , and a lot of members of the mafia -- unlike in the mob 's heyday -- are refraining from bringing their sons into the `` family business . '', 
    what caused the mafia 's decline ? 
    louis ferrante : the world changed . 
  at one time , italian immigrants had few ways to earn a living and provide for their families . 
  today , italians have the same opportunities to advance as anyone else . 
    christian cipollini : times change ; they ebb and flow . 
  the mafia in the united states was absolutely an amazingly long-standing organization that thrived , adapted , and survived for over a century . 
  the downfall was going to happen no matter what , when considering history 's epic tales of virtually every empire rising and inevitably declining . 
  the american mafia had based a lot of its progress on the assistance of politicians , the supply of contraband , and rackets across the board . 
  as time went on , there were fewer people taking payoffs , younger and more savvy organizations excelled in the drug trade , and many of the rackets the mafia dominated -- well , they just do n't exist anymore . 
  then , of course , the deadly blow of rico [ racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act ] and the fact that a loyalty is merely a word now , not an oath . 
    a mafioso faced with decades in prison or switching sides is n't even a dilemma anymore -- they talk and walk . 
  i dunno if someone committing crimes really encourages them not to leave . 
  * ca n't go to the police . 
  * probably no records of their presence . 
  * can arrange to have them deported . 
  * little public support for their protection . 
  * no support network in place to facilitate leaving a crime/prostitution/etc network . 
  * probably little knowledge of local law . 
  * may have limited language knowledge . 
  yeah , they 're probably delightful . 
  businesses operate where the money is . 
  the difficulty of firing increases the risk of hiring . 
  if a hire is riskier , employers are less-willing to do them . 
  it 's not free -- employers factor that in into hiring decisions . 
  iirc , french labor law extends perks from employers to people who have long term jobs , which creates an incentive to not hire people for extended periods of time . 
  similarly , obamacare extended perks from employers to people who work more than 35 hours a week , ensuring that many employers were unwilling to hire people for more than 35 hours a week . 
  it 's badly-crafted labor law . 
  if you want to subsidize the poor , just extend money from the government to them . 
  trying to create elaborate twiddling in the labor market just creates distortions and a lot of unwanted side effects . 
  i think that it 's going to result in lower unemployment and higher pay and that those will be more-worthwhile to workers than what they 're exchanging . 
  it 's not ... really banter when people are just flaming each other . 
  well , there are sanctions going on . 
  what would your preferred response be ? 
  it 's not `` marxists '' . 
  it 's some sort of [ nonsense about `` cultural marxists '' ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/cultural_marxism ) , which seems to amount to `` everything social-values left that i do n't like , which we 're gon na smear with marx because nobody likes marx '' and has approximately fuck-all to do with anything that marx advocated for . 
   cultural marxism generally refers to one of two things :   1 . 
  first -- extremely rarely -- `` cultural marxism '' refers to the general application of the frankfurt school 's marxist ideology to the social sciences . 
  second -- about 99.9 % of the time -- `` cultural marxism '' is a snarl word used to paint anyone with progressive tendencies as a secret communist . 
  the term alludes to a conspiracy theory in which sinister left-wingers have infiltrated media , academia , and science and are engaged in a decades-long plot to undermine western culture . 
  some variants of the conspiracy alleges that basically all of modern social liberalism is , in fact , a communist front . 
    this conspiracy theory hinges on the idea that the frankfurt school was n't just an arcane strain of academic criticism . 
  [ note 1 ] instead , the frankfurt school was behind an ongoing marxist plot to destroy the capitalist west from within , spreading its tentacles throughout academia and indoctrinating students to hate patriotism & freedom . 
  thus , rock 'n' roll , sixties counterculture , the civil rights movement , the anti-war movement , homosexuality , [ 1 ] modern feminism , and in general all the `` decay '' in the west since the fifties are allegedly products of the frankfurt school . 
  [ 2 ] it 's also the work of the jews . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ]   the conspiracist usage originated in nazi germany , where kulturbolschewismus ( `` cultural bolshevism '' ) was used to abuse political opponents . 
  in particular , jews purportedly were secretly orchestrating the spread of communism ( jewish bolshevismwikipedia 's w.svg ) as well as promoting sexual & gender permissiveness ( `` sexual bolshevism '' ) . 
  [ 5 ]   if anyone rants about `` cultural marxists taking over culture !, 
  '' , feel free to remind them that they 're literally spouting nazi propaganda updated for the modern era . 
  that 's a really dangerous policy . 
  there are legal policies , and even illegal policies that are a lot less objectionable than that that would stop immigration . 
  there may not be the political desire for those , but if so , there is n't the political desire to let people die , either . 
  you do n't want the international system of `` someone is dying at sea , everyone is responsible for rescuing them '' to break down . 
  there was no immigration control to the united states -- i mean , there was no institution , even if the idea of trying to somehow block off a huge continent with limited records of who was `` supposed '' to be there anyway had been practical -- until ~ 1870 . 
  http://immigration.procon.org/view.timeline.php?timelineid=000023 at that point , restrictions on chinese immigration was the main concern . 
  sketchy cheap shipping companies were also literally dumping dead or dying people off ships onto port city docks , and the burden was being placed on charitable organizations in the cities -- higher level government was brought in . 
  by 1882 , prohibitions against sketchy characters -- criminals , poor , insane -- were put into place . 
  any form of patrols along the mexican border only started in ~ 1915 . 
  1921 had racial quotas go into place , requiring immigration in a given year to not exceed 3 % of the foreign born population already residing in the us , more-or-less freezing racial ratios . 
  in 1924 , this was cut to 2 % . . 
  in 1965 , racial restrictions were lifted . 
  somewhere in here ( maybe pre-1965 ) , naturalization limits were imposed that were heavily oriented towards family of existing citizens and skilled immigration . 
  so , i disagree with you about the us up until 1870 -- there was no real control at all . 
  after 1870 until the 1920s , there were some restrictions . 
  between the 1920s to the 1960s , there were racial restrictions . 
  and from some point ( probably including the 1960s ) , the system was aimed at family of us citizens and skilled workers . 
  so i guess you 've got maybe pre-1920s us and post-1920s us , one with little or no control , and one with a substantial degree of control . 
   poland would n't have withstood the invasion of both the soviet union or nazi germany if only their citizens had been armed . 
  it could n't have stopped an invasion at the borders , a line of people standing watching tanks come on , not . 
  could it have made occupation untenable ? 
  sure . 
  algeria did it to france ; the goal of a guerrila war is bot to stand in formation and fight a conventional army . 
  the goal if thw conventional army is not to exterminate , but to control , and the latter ia thwartable . 
  nazi germany * did * run into switzerland using a similar threat :  he made it very clear that switzerland would resist any nazi invasion . 
  if they ran out of bullets they were to resort to the bayonet . 
  he said that switzerland would defend itself against any invader and would never surrender . 
  [ 5 ] the swiss government had a decentralised structure , so even the federal president was a relatively powerless official with no authority to surrender the country . 
  indeed , swiss citizens had been instructed to regard any surrender broadcast as enemy lies and resist to the end . 
    as a consequence , general guisan developed his famous r\u00e9duit national concept in summer 1940 , according to which the swiss army would have retreated into the alps relatively soon if attacked , but would have kept up resistance based on some sort of guerrilla and stay-behind tactics from there . 
  the swiss paramilitary organization aktion nationaler widerstand ( resistant national action ) , formed from contacts between selected army figures and conservative civilian circles , had the explicit task to persuade the civilian population to resist invaders . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ]   however , guisan 's and switzerland 's main strategy was deterrence rather than fighting , and germany never risked invasion . 
  on 20 august 1945 , [ 9 ] general guisan left his command , considering his mission to be fulfilled . 
  well , mao and marx were also two different people , not a hivemind . 
   under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered ; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated , by force if necessary . 
  -- karl marx , address of the central committee to the communist league , 1850, 
  mao liked firearms among the public until he was power and then promptly started ensuring exclusive control of them to his regime . 
  [ library of congress : firearms control : china ] ( https://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/china.php )  firearms are very tightly controlled in china . 
  firearms control has been in place for most of the history of the people 's republic of china ( prc ) . 
  only about twenty months after the formal establishment of the prc , the provisional measures on firearms control were published on june 27 , 1951 ( provisional measures ) . 
  [ 1 ] many of the articles in the provisional measures were designed to identify and gain control of the large number of firearms that were within the territory of china at the time as a result of the long period of civil war that ended with the chinese communist party 's victory in 1949 . 
  for example , there was a provision authorizing public security organs ( police ) at all levels to take an inventory of all the firearms in the area , and permits could then be issued to those authorized to have firearms .
