  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect i 'm very dubious that this is gon na work . 
  they were both [ time man of the year .

   `` guns are tools , not for killing . 
  a kitchen knife is the same thing as an semi-automated weapon , which is * totally * not a much better tool for killing '' if your aim is to kill a bunch of people , a bomb is a substantially better tool than a gun . 
   it also needs the monopoly of violence . 
  this is what defines a state . 
  so ... the united states is n't a state ? 
  are you doing substring matches ? 
  i mean , `` th ** us ** , you are incorrect '' does n't have much to do with the united states . 
  i mean , i agree to * some * extent , though less on ease and more on success rate . 
  suicide by firearm tends to have a high success rate . 
  men tend to suicide with firearms , women by overdosing on drugs , which has a comparatively poor success rate . 
  women try at a higher rate , men succeed at a higher rate . 
  i still think that trying to reduce suicide by prohibiting firearms it probably not really a very good approach . 
  taking a dive off a building also works pretty well . 
  i remember looking up south korea 's suicide statistics . 
  about the same as the us , though with very restrictive gun law -- they just have a lot of tall buildings and a much higher rate of deaths from falls . 
  honestly , the questions around euthenasia and right-to-die are a lot broader than the question of firearms , though . 
  non-gun violence is a partial substitute for gun violence . 
  he 's objecting to you looking only at gun violence instead of overall violence , as otherwise you 're biased by this effect . 
  and libertarian new hampshire next door !, 
  east asians have a lower rate in the us , though !, 
  `` hate facts '' ? 
   there 's no such thing as a gun that ca n't kill you . 
  same goes for a brick . 
   what 's stoping them or some numbnuts on either side of the political divide from going on a killing spree on april 10th or carrying out an assassination ? 
  same thing that stops them from bombing buildings , ramming cars through crowds of people , setting off a chlorine gas container outside a building 's air intake , etc ? 
  the us has about four times the per-capita rate of switzerland , three times finland . 
  and most people in the us who are shot to death are shot by themselves . 
  not generally-legal euthanasia . 
  i do n't think that he 's delusional at all -- i agree wholeheartedly . 
  it 's hard to have a small number of people * forcibly * control a large number if their ability to exert force is comparable . 
  i mean , it 's maybe not * polite * , but his point is legitimate . 
  saying `` you can have a function country if you do n't do x '' is not a sufficient counterargument against a policy . 
   before everybody freaks out < cautiously lowers champagne glass , 
   eritrea is a small country . 
  i do n't know why you 're bringing that up as an example . 
  it 's insignificant , both as a country and as a source of refugees . 
  it 's in the top-10 list , iirc -- but the reason i 'm raising it is intentionally because it represents a difficult problem for policies that involve temporary refuge . 
  there is no war , no reason to believe that the situation will change , and yet conditions there are also considered inhumane -- eritreans are not simply not wanting to be in eritrea because it is poor . 
  any policy that is based around an assumption that it 's possible to provide two years of sanctuary and then have the person in question vanish is clearly not going to work here . 
   anyway , are these fines you mentioned really significant ? 
  http://www.dw.com/en/court-fines-italy-for-deporting-migrants-to-libya/a-15761455  the court also said the migrants `` were exposed to the risk of being repatriated to somalia and eritrea '' where they could have faced more ill treatment . 
  it ordered rome to pay 15,000 euros ( roughly $ 20,000 ) in compensation to each of the plaintiffs in the case . 
  yes , because even if the court does n't raise fines ( which i imagine that it would if it was simply being ignored ) as long as the illegal migrants are receiving $ 20k/head , it becomes profitable for illegal migrants to `` loop '' between italy and libya . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11553193/dirty-business-of-people-smuggling-italian-police-release-wiretaps-from-trafficking-network.html  it costs around $ 5,000 ( # 3,341 ) to be transported from west africa or the horn of africa across the sahara to the libyan coast , investigators said in a 500-page document . 
    migrants then pay around $ 1,500 for the boat crossing to italy , and money on top of that to be put on trains and buses to rome , milan and across the alps to northern europe . 
  that 's a better than ten-to-one roi for an illegal immigrant on being shipped to italy , being intercepted , being them deported , collecting a fine , and then illegally going to italy again . 
  there are `` not nice but legal '' routes that i 'd argue would legally work -- the [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) that australia uses , the [ us 's approach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_detention_in_the_united_states ) of `` illegal immigrants go into immigration detention , and unless they want to leave we 've got a five year backlog until we get around to looking at their application , so you damn well better be actually in fear of your life and have a compelling refugee case to try that in the us '' . 
   luckily those allow for very narrow interpretations that would allow us to deport 95 % of those coming . 
  yeah , but [ italy also signed up for echr jurisdiction ] ( https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/european-court-of-human-rights-italy-sanctions-result-in-review-of-immigration-policy/ ) , so it ca n't deport people to places that the echr feels is unsafe . 
  and while that might permit deporting a bangladeshi as long as bangladesh is cooperative , it is n't going to do anything for any country judged to be unsafe . 
  if an eritrean comes from libya to italy , libya does n't accept deportation , and the echr finds eritrea to be unsafe , italy ca n't deport . 
  if eritrea is uncooperative , same issue -- [ and it used to have a large financial incentive to not accept deportations ] ( http://afkinsider.com/129605/remittances-to-eritrea-shrink-refugees-spend-money-helping-people-leave-instead/ ) :  remittances to eritrea , once estimated to account for about a third of the country 's gross domestic product , are shrinking with eritreans in the diaspora now spending the money on helping people leave eritrea instead of supporting relatives at home , an official told bbc . 
  i do n't know how much of the eritrean economy remittances from workers abroad make up now , but certainly very few countries are going to be willing to have a third of their economy evaporate . 
  it may deal with ngos , but it does n't deal with the `` sail boat out , sink it , tell italian coast guard that rescue is required '' strategy . 
  italy 's * still * legally-obligated by the unclos to provide rescue to ships in distress , regardless of whether that distress was intentionally-induced , and then the coast guard ships become subject to non-refoulement restrictions -- italy already tried returning people to libya and was fined for it . 
  if so , i do n't understand why such a dramatic move would be necessary . 
  italy is a country . 
  it is entirely legitimate for it to : * ban individual ships from italian territorial waters . 
  italy 's a sovereign country and can dictate what happens within its waters . 
  * seize any ships/planes/etc being used to ship illegal immigrants to italy . 
  the refugee convention protects illegal immigrants themselves from penalty if they come directly from the place that they are in danger in and qualify as refugees . 
  it does not protect owners of ships involved ( which is precisely why smugglers are using throwaway ships and sinking them or cheap rafts ) . 
  italy can quite happily seize ngo ships for any number of reasons , or simply pass a law against doing explicitly what they 're doing , with a penalty of forfeiture of the ship . 
  countries * have * done this in the past when people used ships to transfer illegal immigrants somewhere . 
  italy does not need to have a blanket ban just to cover ngos . 
  ... says the guy with the `` european federation '' flair ... 
  ehhhh ... 
  i mean , it is not cheap to replace used parts on military aircraft , even if trainers are intended to be cheaper than fighters . 
  if france is n't making it a perk -- and i assume that the french air force does n't see a lot of value in keeping generals current on flight abilities , since there 's little chance that they 'd be piloting -- having people use the french air force 's jets as private travel machines is costing substantially more than it would cost to take a commercial jet . 
  commercial charter light jets look like they run maybe [ $ 4k/hour ] ( https://www.sherpareport.com/aircraft/cost-charter-private-aircraft.html ) , and while i could n't find a cpfh for a jet trainer , it 's gon na be more than a turboprop trainer , and that looks like upwards of $ 2500/hour . 
  it 's not gon na break the bank if a few people are doing it , but it 's not using a [ peugeot p4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peugeot_p4 ) to run private errands either . 
   he is also said to have taken a six-seat military transport plane along with a pilot and co-pilot , the ** satirical newspaper ** said . 
  so ... i take it that this is n't satire , else the bbc would n't be reporting it ? 
  no all-caps words in the title , though . 
  i 'm not saying that germany has any such restrictions on it or that the frigate classification exists for that reason . 
  i do think that it is the case that japan 's did , even if that was a weak restriction ( not wanting to do a constitutional revision ) . 
  aircraft carriers are difficult to sell as a defensive weapon , barring maybe recapturing a distant piece of land . 
  the parallel i was drawing between germany and japan was not over ship classification , but that both had text in their constitutions that i think would not have normally been placed there . 
  the constitution was being written during occupation , where the legislators doing the authoring had an overwhelming interest in making credible promises to occupiers that neither was going to go attack if the occupation were to end soon . 
  i do not think that japan 's article 9 is text that people would normally place in a constitution -- even green parties do not , i think , normally go that far . 
  similarly , while i think that germany 's postwar legislature had a strong desire to not want to see another rise-of-hitler -- after all , hitler had been pretty awful for competing political parties during his rise and had made catastrophic decisions for germany -- i also am dubious that germany would have established the eternity clause . 
  maybe there would have been a high bar set on changes , but i do n't think that the bar would have been `` may not be changed '' . 
  i 'd add that i do n't really think that commitments like that are in anyone 's interest in the long term . 
  it might be interesting if japan and germany were both to hold constitutional conventions , , as a way of ensuring that the constitutions actually reflect what each see as truly in their own interests . 
  i 'm not disputing that air support did n't exist . 
  i 'm disputing that this was due to a refusal from the us , uk , and france to provide that support . 
  ... okay , if you think that blackwater/xe/whatever * does * claim a country 's resources , i 'm not sure what i can say to that . 
  well , you know , you say po-tay-toh , i say po-tah-toh ... 
   which is why mauritius is trying to push this through the international court of justice . 
  they know very well that the uk would veto anything going into the unsc . 
  right , but my point is that if you 're saying `` look , i did something with no impact , because if i had tried to do something with impact , you 'd have simply nullified it '' , it 's hardly demonstrating limited prestige of the nullifier . 
  the author was claiming that this portrayed the uk as not very prestigious ... 
  okay . 
  that title would be inapplicable , because pmcs do n't get to claim a country 's resources . 
   i 'm not talking about progressive politics . 
  i 'm talking about a tax rate that increases progressively , as in a higher amount of money is taxed at a higher rate . 
  substitute `` left wing '' if you want -- my point is that asking * the economist * for a really great way to transfer more funds to the poor is probably not going to be incredibly successful .
