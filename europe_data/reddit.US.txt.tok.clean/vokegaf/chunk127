  means that you need to watch your borders . 
  this includes the uk , the original common-law country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_identity_card_policies_by_country  privacy international said that `` virtually no common law country has a card '' . 
  -  * in 1985 , there was a failed proposal to create an australia card . 
  in 2006 the australian government announced the introduction of a non-compulsory access card that would act as a gateway to services administered by the department of human services . 
  this project , however , was terminated in november 2007 . 
  -  * in the past , canadian citizenship cards were issued to new canadians upon naturalization and established canadians ( upon request ) . 
  as of 2012 these cards have been discontinued , and there is no national identity card or equivalent . 
  driver 's licenses issued by the provinces are the primary form of identification . 
  -  * new zealand : no national identity card . 
  acceptable types of identification for proof of identification may include passports , firearms licences , driving licences , 18 + cards ( issued by hospitality nz ) , a supergold ( senior citizen 's ) card , birth certificates or a citizenship certificate . 
  -  * uk : compulsory identity cards were to be introduced under the identity cards act 2006 . 
  initial cards , not yet compulsory , were introduced for those who wanted them in 2009 , but the requirement and the cards were abolished by the identity documents act 2010 after a change of government . 
  the us status is pretty similar , but the wp article counts it as non having no identity card . 
  * shrug *, 
  this is the `` fiscal right '' form of ubi . 
  one reason that ubi gets the noise it does is that depending upon the implementation , it can be appealing to the right or the left . 
  from the standpoint of market-oriented folks like myself , it makes a lot of sense . 
  it eliminates much of the potential for state graft -- you ca n't give a contract for housing to your brother-in-law if all you 're doing is handing out money . 
  if you want to leverage competition and market mechanisms , it looks pretty good . 
  the obvious counterarguments are `` what if we ca n't trust welfare recipients to buy housing instead of drugs , and there 's a negative externality associated with purchasing drugs '' . 
  i 'm guessing that you favor the left form -- that is , it should simply expand the size of state handouts , without reduction in the existing welfare mechanisms . 
  i dunno how effectively [ anti-fouling paint ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-fouling_paint ) eliminates that . 
  may not be a major problem for modern naval vessels . 
  just seconding the point : as per the normal use of the term , the qe class is a supercarrier . 
  that 's actually a good point . 
  i 'm sure that the uk * could * afford a nuclear-powered carrier if they wanted , but by having two non-nuclear carriers , it means that they can always have one active for quick response time ( and in an emergency could deploy both at once to provide more capabilities ) . 
  france making the tradeoff in favor of nuclear power but only having a single carrier means that it could be quite some time before france could respond to something that requires carrier involvement ... and if someone does intend to act against france and can choose their time , they 'll probably do so at a time to take advantage of france 's lowest readiness level . 
  it 's a tradeoff ... 
  if you could standardize automated manufacturing systems , i could see being able to rapidly scale up or scale down production . 
  for those not familiar with the joke , [ wikipedia : boiling vessel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boiling_vessel ) :  a boiling vessel is a water heating system fitted to british armoured fighting vehicles that permits the crew to heat water and cook food by drawing power from the vehicle electrical supply . 
  huh . 
  [ general order no . 
  99 ] ( https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/g/general-orders/general-order-no-99-prohibition-in-the-navy.html ) was apparently never rescinded , but it [ clearly does happen ] ( http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/steel-beach-when-us-navy-ships-throw-giant-beach-picni-1658725234 ) . 
  how so ? 
  i 'd say that having a berth in the black sea is what 's important . 
  yeah , see , that makes a lot more sense , thanks . 
  i 'd say that probably most ee countries would rather that we not take in a lot of refugees either . 
  [ response was pretty similar among us states to syrian refugees ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/world/paris-attacks-syrian-refugees-backlash/index.html ) . 
  i understand that submarines are also normally approximately neutral buoyancy . 
  modern destroyers are also getting pretty large compared to their historical size . 
  the first us destroyer , [ uss * bainbridge * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_bainbridge_\\ ( dd-1 \\ ) ) , displaced 721 t , less than a tenth the size of one of the f125 frigates . 
  setting aside the issue of whether any russian leaders make the top 10 figures in human history ... 
  i mean , what 's the exact translation of `` greatest '' here ? 
  because for some definitions of `` greatest '' , i certainly think that stalin was a greater leader than putin . 
  he certainly had much more impact on the world . 
   a us carrier holds about 70 + aircraft at a time , but will only send 40-45 of them to fight at a time . 
  ( we 're talking a major fleet engagement , think midway 2.0 ) hmm . 
  in a midway 2.0 battle , i do n't think that that 'd be held back . 
  midway used a fuller portion of the available complement . 
  there were three us carriers at midway : [ * yorktown * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_yorktown_%28cv-5%29 ) ( 90 aircraft ) , [ * enterprise * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_enterprise_%28cv-6%29 ) ( 90 aircraft ) , and [ * hornet * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_hornet_%28cv-8%29 ) ( 72 aircraft ) . 
  that 's a total available count of 252 aircraft if the carriers are full . 
  wikipedia has midway using 233 aircraft on the us side , so that 's close to everything that they could pack aboard , and doing so was important to get the best odds in a carrier-carrier battle . 
  it serves little to pull punches then :  nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers , plus those on midway island , gave the u.s. rough parity with yamamoto 's four carriers , mainly because american carrier air groups were larger than japanese ones . 
  nimitz-class carriers [ * can * carry 85-90 aircraft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier ) according to wikipedia , about the same . 
  the [ qe class * can * carry `` over 70 '' aircraft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier ) , pretty close . 
  2032 meters if you count distance down . 
  displacement of the * charles de gaulle * : 42,500 tonnes , or 46848 t. displacement of the queen elizabeth class : 77,800 t. displacement of the nimitz class : 101,600 t. eh , the qe class is 1.66 times the displacement of the * charles de gaulle * . 
  the nimitz class is 1.31 times the displacement of the qe class . 
  i mean , i would n't call the ratio `` almost the same '' , honestly ... 
  maybe israel can make a carrier for the dead sea ( high salinity water with a density of 1.24 kg/l , compared to a more-typical 1.02-1 .03 in the oceans ) and they can be different . 
   submarines can not provide air support for either ground forces or the fleet . 
  well ... it 's not quite the same thing , but : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cruise_missile_submarine, 
  your current frigates are getting so large that they 're larger than some historical aircraft carriers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f125-class_frigate  f125 is the project name for the type 125 baden-w\u00fcrttemberg class of frigates , currently in development for the german navy by arge f125 , a joint-venture of thyssen-krupp and l\u00fcrssen . 
  the f125-class are officially classified as frigates but in size they are comparable to destroyers , since , with a displacement of more than 7,200 tons , they will be the biggest class of frigate worldwide . 
   displacement : 7,200 tonnes so ... the `` tonne '' is a metric ton . 
  converted to short tons , that 's 7,920 t. [ japanese aircraft carrier h\u014dsh\u014d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_aircraft_carrier_h%c5%8dsh%c5%8d )  displacement : 7,590 t, 
    british navy personnel around the globe donned black armbands to mark the lamentable day . 
  mock funerals were staged . 
    that 's hilarious !, 
  it sounds like the false funeral and drinking party with the remaining alcohol is something of a tradition . 
  [ apparently we did it too in one last grand finale when we eliminated the last possession of alcohol aboard , immediately before world war i ] ( https://news.usni.org/2014/07/01/hundred-years-dry-u-s-navys-end-alcohol-sea ) :  some ships were content with piling tables with food and booze , others got more creative and created themes such as `` wild west '' saloons or held funerals where mourners could watch john barlycorn 's burial at sea . 
  a few ships decided it was easier just to pour all the alcohol on board into one large bowl to make a very strong punch . 
  with ships from several other nations in the region to observe the situation in veracruz , the u.s. navy invited foreign contingents to join in the festivities . 
  soon parties from the british , french , german , spanish and dutch navies began to travel by small launches from ship to ship to help eliminate the soon-to-be contraband . 
  the occasion would also be one of the last peaceful interactions between the navies for many years . 
  a world war would erupt by the end of the month ; less than a year after participating in the event , the german cruiser * dresden * was hunted down and knocked out of action by the royal navy . 
  do you have an article title or page number ? 
  [ none of the articles in that issue are clearly talking about carriers ] ( https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1999-06 ) . 
   this is a code language for gypsies in the czech republic . 
  note that this is typically called [ dog-whistle politics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dog-whistle_politics ) :  dog-whistle politics is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional , different or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup . 
  the phrase is often used as a pejorative because of the inherently deceptive nature of the practice and because the dog-whistle messages are frequently distasteful to the general populace . 
  the analogy is to a dog whistle , whose high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans . 
  it addresses an issue where politicians ca n't go to one city and say one thing and go somewhere else and say something else , because it 's easy to record them and tell everyone about what they 're saying today . 
  so you have to say one thing that is * interpreted * differently ... 
   its like the same reason that the us has a naval base on haiwaii , it has a deep harbor nearby , something that crimea has also . 
  well , let 's take a look : http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/commerce/rus_port_of_novorossiysk_1537.php  the port of novorossiysk has 11 berths totaling more than 1.4 kilometers in length with alongside depth of from 6.8 to 13.9 meters . 
  i do n't see berthing depths on their sevastopol page : http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/ukr_port_of_sevastopol_1571.php however , the deepest sevastopol berth [ listed on this page ] ( http://www.sifservice.com/index.php/en/directory/ports-ukraine/sea-ports/item/148-sevastopol-sea-port ) is 9.75 meters , shallower than novorossiysk . 
  ( i 'll grant that both may exclude their military berths , as both have russian naval bases there . ), 
   would n't make sense to build a whole new black sea fleet hq when you can literally retake one established during the ussr . 
  it does if it means that now you 've pissed off ukraine and the eu and the us and various other countries . 
  you 're talking about shipping some rock and concrete out to build sheltered water and piers versus large-scale economic conflict . 
  edit : hell , i would n't be surprised if russia 's spending more on the [ kerch strait bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kerch_strait_bridge ) alone than they would on expanding port facilities . 
   construction on the bridge began in may 2015 . 
  the project is estimated to cost 228 billion roubles ( 4.36 billion usd ) . 
  http://www.newsweek.com/russia-unveil-new-14-bn-black-sea-fleet-base-four-years-484974  the new base will be finished soon , according to the fleet 's former commander igor kasatonov . 
  ironically , the base will open in the russian port of novorossiysk , which is a historical term for territories in modern ukraine , meaning `` new russia . ''   `` the construction of the novorossiysk naval base will be completed by 2020 , '' kasatonov said . 
  `` the western pier will be built this year . 
  the main task now is the construction of the western breakwater .
