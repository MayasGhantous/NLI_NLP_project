  the final deadline for completion is tough to determine but it will likely be before 2020 . ''   the black sea fleet headquarters will relocate to the novorossiysk base , but continue docking in crimea . 
    russian state contractor rosstroy confirmed the $ 1.4 billion base should be fully built in four years , with the soldiers ' barracks and village expected to cost a further $ 24 million , according to ria novosti . 
    currently the base is 47 percent complete , kasatonov said , and once it is functioning , it will be the permanent deployment point for all black sea fleet boats . 
  https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2016-03-24/consequences-western-financial-sanctions-russian-economy  determining the short - , medium - and long-term effects of the sanctions is difficult . 
  in the autumn of 2014 , the minister for the economy , alexey ulyukaev , assessed that the immediate costs of financial sanctions had reached around us$ 90 billion , i.e. 
  around 4.8 % of gdp in 2014 [ 6 ] , pointing out that this was precisely the amount russian entities would have to obtain from the domestic market to refinance their foreign debts [ 7 ] . 
  at the same time , the minister of finance , anton siluanov , estimated that the annual costs of the sanctions were around us$ 40 billion , arguing that the falling oil prices had affected the russian economy most of all ( losses reaching between us$ 90 and 100 billion ) [ 8 ] . 
  the central bank in its survey developed in august 2015 also assessed that the impact of the financial sanctions was much lower than that of the situation on the oil market : estimating that the joint effect of the sanctions and the falling oil prices between mid 2014 and mid 2016 would be between 4.2 and 4.8 % of gdp , while the effect of the sanctions alone would be 1.0 -- 1.2 % of gdp [ 9 ] . 
  that 's making naval construction at novorossiysk look pretty affordable . 
  what is your source for that ? 
  the us navy 's [ carrier page ] ( http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4200&amp;tid=200&amp;ct=4 ) , for example , only lists `` 30 + knots '' . 
  looking online , it looks like it 's width above the waterline that 's the issue -- aircraft carriers with angled runways are very wide and will apparently crash into structures on both sides of the canal , so the qe-class , which does have angled runways , may not be panamax-compliant . 
   3 ) the uk , unlike france , has its own oil fields , so has a secure supply of fuel . 
  neither has it 's own supply of uranium . 
  who cares ? 
  the ford class carriers run for 25 years without refueling . 
  the uk and france are both capable of obtaining and physically storing all the uranium they could need for a naval war in a strategic stockpile . 
  edit : also , canada and australia are [ major producers of uranium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_uranium_production ) and are unlikely to be unfriendly to the uk . 
  good luck cutting them off from the uk . 
  this is n't bulky oil that we 're talking about -- you could fly or ship ( even using submarines , the way [ germany was to japan in world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_submarine_u-234 ) ) uranium . 
  if you can shut down uk-canada or uk-australia access to move uranium , there 'd be no point , because you 'd already be able to win any war against the uk simply by virtue of the capabilities you 'd have to have . 
   wave making resistance depends dramatically on the general proportions and shape of the hull : many modern displacement designs can easily exceed their ` hull speed ' without planing . 
  from your link . 
  not saying that this is the case for the nimitz class , but i doubt that anyone who does know the real maximum viable speed for the nimitz is permitted to give it on an open forum ; it 'll be classified . 
   frenchs can host and launch americans planes and americans carriers can launch frenchs planes the us has [ ten nimitz-class carriers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier ) . 
  these will be active until 2025 , when the first of them is scheduled to start being decomissioned . 
  [ french rafales do fly off these ] ( https://www.strategypage.com/military_photos/military_photos_20100607211719.aspx ) . 
  i ca n't find anything on the f-35c flying off the french * charles de gaulle * , though i imagine that it could be possible . 
  i do n't know whether f-35bs can operate off either ( i seem to recall that runway surfaces need to be able to handle a lot of thermal load to deal with the exhaust of f-35bs doing vertical landings hitting them , and that some ships can not handle that ) , but it would n't surprise me if they could . 
  that being said , the [ brits have famously used an shipping container on an unwitting spanish container ship as a platform to operate the harrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alraigo_incident ) , so if the f-35b is comparable , i imagine that it could handle things pretty well in a pinch . 
  here 's a [ shot of a british sea harrier operating off a nimitz-class carrier ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:bae_sea_harrier_800_nas_on_uss_eisenhower_1984.jpeg ) . 
  the us also has the [ ford-class carriers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerald_r._ford-class_aircraft_carrier ) , which will start being brought into commission this year . 
  i would expect that rafales could operate off these . 
  no idea on f-35bs . 
  the us has eight [ wasp-class amphibious assault ships ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wasp-class_amphibious_assault_ship ) and one [ america-class amphibious assault ship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america-class_amphibious_assault_ship ) , with an additional ten america-class amphibious assault ships coming online . 
  these operate the f-35b , the same as british qe2 class operates . 
  so there 's substantial us-uk naval aviation intercompatibility . 
  in the falklands islands war , the us offered the uk the amphibious assault ship [ uss * iwo jima * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_iwo_jima_%28lph-2%29 ) if the uk lost a carrier , as it was a harrier platform . 
  i imagine that if need be , the brits could use amphibious assault ships as svtol platforms , above-and-beyond the nimitz and ford carriers . 
   one ca n't outrun enemies . 
  having a higher speed than the other side ( and knowledge of their location , of course ... ) provides the initiative to your fleet -- that is , you can choose to engage or not engage , and thus choose the time and place to be most advantageous to you . 
   it 's sure nice to have to get quicker to whereever one wants to be , but who really cares if that takes three instead of two weeks ? 
  rapidly moving carriers was arguably important to the us at the [ battle of midway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_midway#american_reinforcements ) , since the us needed to quickly move and concentrate her carrier forces to fight against superior japanese numbers . 
  if she could have moved carriers faster , she would have moved the [ * saratoga * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_saratoga_%28cv-3%29 ) in five fewer days and brought another in ... a high speed ( and ability to withstand battle damage ) was a substantial characteristic that separated [ fleet carriers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fleet_carrier ) -- the big things that went out to fight carrier-versus-carrier battles -- from slower carriers :  additional speed was not necessary for maintaining station with the battle fleet , but enabled the carrier to catch up with the battle fleet after temporarily leaving formation to turn into the wind for launch or recovery of aircraft . 
  the speed of the carrier during launch effectively decreased the takeoff distance for embarked aircraft , so faster carriers could operate heavier aircraft with greater range and superior combat capability . 
  as such naval aircraft became operational , no nation could risk fielding less capable aircraft ; so the speed of later purpose-designed aircraft carriers was set by the speed of the converted battle cruisers . 
  -  a fleet carrier would carry more than 50 aircraft , and be fast enough to keep up with other major elements of the fleet , such as cruisers and battleships . 
  -  as combat experience demonstrated the importance of aircraft carriers , numerous ships were rapidly converted to operate aircraft during world war ii ; and it became important to differentiate ships with the speed and size allowed by the washington naval treaty from ships that were slower and/or carried fewer aircraft . 
  ships of similar speed carrying fewer aircraft were identified as light aircraft carriers ( cvl ) and ships of lower speed became known as escort aircraft carriers ( cve ) . 
  looking at [ wikipedia 's list of sunken aircraft carriers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sunken_aircraft_carriers ) , the worst combat losses of large carriers have never been that large : [ japanese aircraft carrier * shinano * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_aircraft_carrier_shinano ) had the largest potential complement at a capacity of 120 aircraft , but at the time of being torpedoed was carrying only 50 suicide aircraft . 
  a number of japanese and us fleet carriers went down in world war ii , but they were typically in a fight at the time and probably had launched a number of their aircraft . 
  the japanese carriers at the [ battle of midway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_midway ) were recovering aircraft when hit by us carrier wings , and probably had a not-insignificant chunk of their air wings go down with the ship or , without anywhere else to land , ditch in the water . 
  the [ hms * ark royal * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_ark_royal_%2891%29#final_voyage_and_sinking ) could carry 60 aircraft and was torpedoed by a german u-boat ( good in terms of maximizing losses , since it was a surprise ) , but it was after returning from a run to ferry aircraft in the mediterranean , so i suspect that she had few planes aboard . 
   could host the seaharrier which does n't have a radar . 
  that sounds surprising . 
  < checks wikipedia  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_aerospace_sea_harrier  the sea harrier was largely based on the harrier gr3 , but was modified to have a raised cockpit with a `` bubble '' canopy for greater visibility , [ 13 ] and an extended forward fuselage to accommodate the ferranti blue fox radar . 
  [ 9 ] -  the sea harrier fa2 featured the blue vixen radar , which was described as one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world ; [ 26 ] the blue fox radar was seen by some critics as having comparatively low performance for what was available at the time of procurement . 
  [ 25 ] the blue vixen formed the basis for development of the eurofighter typhoon 's captor radar . 
  [ 27 ] you mean `` does n't have a radar '' in the literal sense or just that you do n't like its radar capabilities ? 
   the straits between the marmara sea are an international zone , though . 
  in peacetime , yes . 
  turkey can shut them down to her enemies when turkey is at war , though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_straits http://sam.baskent.edu.tr/belge/montreux_eng.pdf  article 19 . 
    in time of war , turkey not being belligerent , warships shall enjoy complete freedom of transit and navigation through the straits under the same conditions as those laid down in article 10 to 18 . 
  [ snip ]  article 20 . 
    in time of war , turkey being belligerent , the provisions of articles 10 to 18 shall not be applicable ; the passage of warships shall be left entirely to the discretion of the turkish government . 
  needless to say , this makes the question of who turkey sides with in any war involving russia a question of great interest for everyone involved . 
   i 'm convinced that they 're pushing for this precisely because they do n't want to set a precedent that countries can boycott a decision that was taken against their will through the majority , even when it 's a decision that their public overwhelmingly does n't agree with and that is very sensitive among the public . 
  [ syrian refugees were a contentious issue wrt federal and state authority here too ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/world/paris-attacks-syrian-refugees-backlash/ ) .

   it 's being classified as a super-carrier based on its displacement that 's the definition of a supercarrier . 
  it does n't mean `` extra-good carrier '' , but `` large carrier '' . 
  http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/how-panama-canal-changed-shape-war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panamax i ca n't find anything with google on whether the qe-class carriers are panamax-compliant , but it 'd be interesting to know whether they are . 
  there * are * some perks to being smaller too . 
  it looks like us nimitz-class and ford-class supercarriers are larger than panamax . 
  i mean , in theory it could fly other [ stovl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stovl ) - capable fixed-wing aircraft , but afaik there is n't anyone out there making something that the brits would be likely to use . 
  it looks like there are still a few countries flying harriers ( [ wikipedia says italy , spain , and the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mcdonnell_douglas_av-8b_harrier_ii#operators ) ) , but they 're all at the end of their planned lives , and i think that the f-35b is really aimed at replacing them and remedying limitations with them . 
  the brits will definitely operate helicopters off of them as well . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supercarrier  supercarrier is an unofficial descriptive term for the largest type of aircraft carrier , typically those displacing over 70,000 short tons ( 64,000 metric tons ) . 
  [ 1 ] supercarriers are the largest warships ever built , larger than the largest battleships laid down by any country . 
  the united states navy has ten active supercarriers as of 2015 . 
  [ 2 ] the soviet union was constructing one supercarrier before cancelling it in 1991 . 
  the united kingdom has two queen elizabeth-class carriers under construction , expected to enter service in 2018 . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ]   outside the us , there are more light carriers closer to 30,000 tons , such as italy 's cavour . 
  a few countries operate medium-sized fleet carriers of around 40,000 tons , such as the french navy 's charles de gaulle and the indian navy 's ins vikramaditya . 
  i dunno about dry . 
  looks like they do n't regularly issue alcohol shipboard , though they do apparently have blood-alcohol limits while being on duty . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rum_ration  the rum ration ( also called tot ) was a daily amount of rum given to sailors on royal navy ships . 
  it was abolished in 1970 after concerns that regular intakes of alcohol would lead to unsteady hands when working machinery . 
  -  a sailor 's ration of alcohol was originally beer with a daily ration of one gallon ( i.e. 
  eight pints ) . 
  this official allowance continued till after the napoleonic wars . 
  when beer was not available , as it would often spoil easily , it could be substituted by a pint of wine or half a pint of spirits depending on what was locally available . 
  in later years , the political influence of the west indian planters led to rum being given the preference over arrack and other spirits . 
  the half pint of spirits was originally issued neat ; it is said that sailors would `` prove '' its strength by checking that gunpowder doused with rum would still burn ( thus verifying that rum was at least 57 % abv ) . 
  -  other navies in the world also removed the rum ration : the united states navy was the first to abolish the rum ration , removing it in 1862 . http://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-rum-soaked-royal-navy-sobered-up  for sunday marks the 46th anniversary of black tot day . 
  on july 31 , 1970 , the british royal navy ended a centuries-old hallowed tradition : the issuing a daily dram of liquor to sailors aboard its ships ... on july 31 , 1970 , british navy personnel around the globe donned black armbands to mark the lamentable day . 
  mock funerals were staged . 
  a british guided-missile destroyer tied up at pearl harbor in hawaii was the nearest british ship to the international date line , so it was the last to do away with the tot . 
    crewmen assembled on deck of the hms fife , tossed back their final dram , then tossed glasses into the harbor followed by a barrel .
