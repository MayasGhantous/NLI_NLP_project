    and a centuries-old tradition came to an end . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11037096/royal-navy-alcohol-consumption-curbed-after-fatal-submarine-shooting.html  the navy is taking steps to tackle binge drinking after the shooting of a commander on a nuclear powered submarine by a drunken colleague , the government has said . 
  -  the hearing had previously heard that donovan had drunk 20 pints of cider and lager , cocktails and double vodkas in the 48 hours before he was put on a guard duty with the sa80 rifle . 
  i ca n't find a good summary of the qe 's recreational facilities , but i suspect that , given her size , they 're going to be pretty substantial . 
  a museum 400 years after her creation ? 
  lookin ' good there !, 
   what happened when you went from confederation to federation ? 
  i am not an expert on that period . 
  i do know that there was debate and some people and states who were * very * opposed to federation , but you can find better sources online than me . 
  there are books and online resources on it . 
   where there any protests/revolts , any states trying to leave ? 
  apparently yes , with [ rhode island being the state most-opposed and involving a threatened trade embargo by the other states in her case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratification_of_the_united_states_constitution_by_rhode_island ) :  opposition was chiefly due to the paper money issued in rhode island pounds since 1786 by the governing country party , intended to pay off the state 's burdensome revolutionary war debt . 
  other issues included fear of direct federal taxes and aversion toward the comparatively lengthy terms for members of congress . 
  ( the lower house of the rhode island general assembly was elected twice a year , and the upper house annually . ), 
  the large quaker population was offended by provisions on the slave trade [ rhode island was anti-slavery -- vokegaf ] , while federalists ' scorn for the state 's `` excess of democracy '' made its residents see the constitution as a threat . 
  the handful of federalist supporters was chiefly to be found among the mercantile classes of providence and newport . 
  [ 3 ]   nearly a dozen conventions failed that had been called in rhode island to ratify the constitution , often by wide margins ; in one instance , 92 percent voted against ratification . 
  opposition to the proposed constitution was greatest in rural areas ; an attempt in providence to celebrate new hampshire 's ratification on july 4 , 1788 was broken up by a thousand-man force of country party supporters that descended on the capital to prevent the observances from going forward . 
  armed confrontation and possible civil war were averted only after organizers agreed to ensure that the celebrations would only commemorate independence day and not new hampshire 's ratification . 
  ... plus a [ compromise deal being made ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massachusetts_compromise ) between those in favor of federation and those opposed that resulted in the creation of our [ bill of rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_bill_of_rights ) to further limit the federal government . 
  when you hear americans talking about their first amendment or second amendment or fourth amendment or whatnot rights , that 's the bill of rights . 
   i personally do n't believe that it will happen in my lifetime ( i 'm in my 20s ) unless there is a significant pressure from the outside . 
  i mean , the single market 's freedom of movement will presumably lead to population mixing , which i imagine is going to be a mechanism to blunt a lot of the objection . 
  one of the major elements of the transition to federation is the shift from the veto to a majority vote -- that tremendously increases the power of the central government to do things , since they do n't need a new treaty for everything -- and i was just reading an article on here about how germany apparently presently has her sights set on changing that wherever possible . 
  perhaps they 've a vision of the eu and what it should be that differs from the present reality ? 
  i mean , i 'd imagine that this is true of * all * eu members , whether they 're to the east or west or north or south , unless they feel that the * status quo * is ideal and want to freeze it . 
  in a structure in which people can freely advocate for their political ideas , you 're going to have political debate . 
  looking at us political forums , things are n't any less-ardent over here ... 
   is there any resentment of the federal government because of this ? 
  probably . 
  the public of any state is going to object if the federal government passes a law that it really objects to , regardless of whether-or-not the power of the purse is used as the vehicle for that , and when people feel that there 's a good argument that the federal government is stepping outside of its limited realm of authority into state authority , then you 'll have people also upset about that . 
  i think that it 's pretty reasonable to say that questions over that have produced plenty of upset . 
  the [ civil war we fought ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_war ) , the largest internal disagreement , was over whether the federal government ( which was trending anti-slavery ... the pro-slavery states were probably going to lose their fragile senate deadlock ) had the ability to impose anti-slavery policy and probably ultimately kill off slavery , or whether the state governments could decide perpetually on slavery themselves within their borders . 
  one more-recent point of popular dispute on reddit was over [ * gonzales v. raich * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gonzales_v._raich ) , when the supreme court decided that the commerce clause in the constitution permitted the federal government to prohibit production and consumption of marijuana internal to a state . 
  while the federal government won legally , it also resulted in states that disagreed with the federal government refusing to enforce the federal laws , and the public simply acting as if the federal laws did n't exist , and the federal government ( thus far ) choosing not to try to force the matter . 
   are there any attempts to question or saboutage its authority ? 
  the question of state authority versus federal authority has been a point of contention since the very beginning . 
  i expect that it will continue to be in the future . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/states'_rights the first two political parties , the [ federalist party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalist_party ) and the [ democratic-republican party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic-republican_party ) , largely split along this issue . 
   it would have never occured to me that there are some similarities between the eu and the us in this sense . 
  many of the issues that the eu deals with as a confederation reminds me of the us dealing with the same issues during its short term as a confederation under the [ articles of confederation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/articles_of_confederation ) . 
  the eu has been doing a confederation for a lot longer than the us tried before giving up and federating , though ... 
  eh , still cheaper to dredge a harbor or build a breakwater out further than fight the eu and the us economically . 
   not to mention , the location is strategically less valuable . 
  in what way ? 
  i 'd say that it has all the important characteristics of sevastopol . 
   i suppose it 's a very big deal for the states ? 
  well , the eu does n't ( yet , at any rate ) have the ability to tax via qmv . 
  the us federal government does have the ability to tax . 
  in practice , i do n't know of many cases where it 's come up , but it * is * a real thing . 
  i 'm not familiar with the constitutional case law here , though it looks like wikipedia has a decent summary : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxing_and_spending_clause the constitution only grants it the power to do so on criteria that is uniform across the us :  but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states . 
  and the supreme court has struck down cases where it 's blatant :  in 1922 , the supreme court struck down a 1919 tax on child labor in bailey v. drexel furniture co. , [ 14 ] commonly referred to as the `` child labor tax case '' . 
  the court had previously held that congress did not have the power to directly regulate labor , and found the law at issue to be an attempt to indirectly accomplish the same end . 
  this ruling appeared to have been reinforced in united states v. butler , [ 10 ] in which the supreme court of the united states ruled that the processing taxes instituted under the 1933 agricultural adjustment act were an unconstitutional attempt to regulate state activity in violation of the tenth amendment . 
  though obviously , it 's possible to impose criteria that have the * effect * of being non-uniform to some degree -- taxing someone making $ 150k/year more-heavily than someone making $ 20k/year is obviously going to intrinsically perform some amount of transfer from wealthy states to poorer states . 
  however , * spending * is less-restrictive and does not need to be uniform as long as it is `` non-coercive '' , for some value of `` non-coerciveness '' . 
  scotus has apparently upheld the 10 % of highway funding being withheld for not raising the drinking age , but treated withholding medicare funds for the obama expansion -- a much larger amount of money -- as being coercive . 
   not to mention things like language barrier which , while surmountable for educated workers , make it very hard for less educated workers . 
  honestly , at this point , i 'd guess that the language barrier is probably the remaining factor keeping europe 's population from very large-scale movement . 
  if you look at the rate of [ urbanization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization ) , over 100 years , over 30 % of the * global * population has relocated from rural areas to cities . 
  making such a move requires the kind of shift that crossing into another country would require . 
  i have no doubt that 30 % or more of people in the eu would also happily relocate across country lines , given the option ... it 's just that there are still a variety of languages being spoken in different countries in the eu . 
   the structural funds are in place to ~ ~ eliminate ~ ~ reduce inequality amongst the eu . 
  and honestly , i 'd put it less in those terms and more that it 's a smart investment to develop capital that you expect to be relying on tomorrow . 
  if part of the union is seeing its potential wasted because of underdevelopment , the whole union winds up worse-off . 
  i see about 35 britons in that picture . 
  it 's a politically-contentious issue . 
  do you * honestly * expect the uk to not have 35 people protesting the matter ? 
  i mean , i can see complaining about things that countries have done , but showing an image of a 35 people in a country protesting something and calling that unacceptable is * absurd * . 
  i am certain that i can find pictures of 35 people in germany protesting in favor of all kinds of batshit insane things . 
  here 's a [ german anti-immigrant protest ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-22/thousands-of-germans-attend-an-anti-immigration-rally/6033056 ) . 
  here 's a [ german pro-immigrant protest ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4611702,00.html ) . 
  if i 'm to take an image of about 35 people in a protest to be representative of the country having unacceptable division , how am i to feel about this , where there are far more than 35 people on each side ? 
  * every * functioning democracy is going to have this kind of thing . 
  public political advocacy is part of life in a democracy . 
  condemning people for it is , i think , not a good idea . 
     obviously this provokes reactions from people from net-receiving countries , pointing out that eu funds are absolutely not the only money transfers that happen within the eu . 
  a better response is really that fiscal transfers were never made contingent on adoption of desired policies . 
  that being said , it is true that someone is going to control funds , and they 're going to invariably have influence via those funds . 
  in the us , it 's the federal legislature rather than individual states , though there 's still an ongoing dispute about to the extent that it can be constitutionally used to exert political pressure :  the [ power of the purse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/power_of_the_purse ) has also been used to compel the u.s. states to pass laws , in cases where congress does not have the desire or constitutional power to make it a federal matter . 
  the most well-known example of this is regarding the drinking age , where congress passed a law to withhold 10 % of federal funds for highways in any state that did not raise the age to 21 . 
  the law was upheld by the u.s. supreme court in the south dakota v. dole case . 
  congress was not allowed to change the drinking age directly because the 21st amendment ( which ended prohibition in the u.s. ) gave control of alcohol to the states . 
  in 2009 , congress considered similar legislation regarding texting while driving . 
    this power was curtailed somewhat in a case regarding the affordable care act , in which the supreme court ruled in june 2012 that the law 's withholding of all existing medicaid funding for states that failed or refused to expand their medicaid programs to cover the uninsured poor was `` unduly coercive '' , despite the fact that the federal government would pay the entirety of the states ' expansion for the first years , and 90 % thereafter . 
  it was left unclear what percentage would be considered acceptable . 
  so down the line , maybe czechia will be able to vote for and have input on use of spending decisions , but unless the eu takes up more-stringent restrictions on use of budget to force policy than the us has , there 's probably going to be someone using the purse as a policy club to some degree . 
  to be fair , the ez founders should really have established time limits for transition if they did want member countries to implement it even when they did n't want to do so . 
  well , it does mean that bond investors may be more-cautious , if they know that czechia can easily make the value of their bonds drop . 
  well , to be fair , i 'd rather have gridlock blocking use of eu loans than do what greece did and spend it badly . 
  it 's not the worst option out there . 
   it was maintaining access to and control over the warm-water port of sevastopol , without which moscow would lack a major warm-water port . 
  [ novorossiysk is also a warm-water port on the black sea , and * is * in russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_novorossiysk ) . 
  it is far more expensive from russia 's standpoint in both economic and political terms to fight conflicts over crimea than it would be to expand naval facilities at the [ port of novorossiysk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_novorossiysk ) . 
  syria at least is on the mediterranean , which avoids the turkish-controlled dardanelles . 
  :-) hmm . 
  i was curious ... according to the wikipedia article , `` fairy floss '' was the name used for the first machine-made stuff from a tennessee inventor but was later superseded by `` cotton candy '' from a competing lousiana inventor who made a different machine . 
  you know , the whole thing is gloriously stereotypical . 
  apparently , there used to be a fancy , labor-intensive desert in europe made in small quantities for the wealthy :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cotton_candy    there are several claims for the origin of cotton candy , with some sources tracing it to a form of spun sugar found in europe in the 19th century . 
  at that time , spun sugar was an expensive , labor-intensive endeavor and was not generally available to the average person .
