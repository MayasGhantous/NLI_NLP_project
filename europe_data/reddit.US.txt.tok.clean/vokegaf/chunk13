  after ukraine , it was seen as unfriendly or an enemy ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/1642/russia.aspx ) . 
  you propose that people should care less about lives of us citizens . 
  i said that i suspect that people in isis do care less . 
  how is it not a response ? 
  i 'm sure that people in isis do care less . 
  on the flip side , i doubt that there 's a single nation that has voluntarily-granted independence to more land than the british . 
  because it 's going to get really boring about a month in . 
  * * the economist * is quite opposed to brexit . 
  * i 've seen little love for trump or bannon in the british press . 
   gibraltar going to be anally reamed over this by the eu . 
  because the bureaucrats dealing with this are neither actors in a soap opera nor the politicians doing this for political reasons . 
  they 've got a list of concerns to address , and whatever the latest shit-talking in the newspaper is does n't register on that . 
  in fact , it 's a fair bet that most of them would rather that the media shut up about the issue for the next two years ( not going to happen , obviously , but ... ), 
  this is going to go well beyond the simple [ physical brexit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnusivd239o ) if it also moves australia to the middle of the atlantic . 
  eh , / r/ukpolitics is more that direction , but there are also a fair number of liberal democrats there who are decidedly less-than-happy . 
  i feel like a bigger difference is age -- / r/ukpolitics seems significantly older and somewhat-more-right-wing . 
  [ john f. kennedy , national address ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egdugzawcrw ) :  third : it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack by the soviet union on the united states , requiring a full retaliatory response upon the soviet union . 
  not really an edgy , pimple-faced teenager in his mum 's basement ... 
  eh , the servicing thing is decades apart . 
  it 's a comparatively-minimal form of influence . 
  trump was polite to [ the taoiseach two weeks ago when he was asking trump to let illegal irish immigrants work legally in the us ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/17/irelands-prime-minister-calls-on-trump-to-support-illegal-irish-immigrants-as-he-unveils-referendum.html ) . 
   the problem is , as we can see in the us , that when you feed the fire , it reaches a point in which can not be controlled anymore . 
   not really it 's men who enjoy seeing their wives sleep with other men sometimes even demeaning them as they do so . 
  that 's a fetish , not the traditional meaning of the term . 
  the brits have probably voluntarily given up more land than any other country in history over the past century . 
  in this analogy , who is the wife ? 
   at least one politician even suggested norway might have to threaten to veto uk efta membership norway 's minister for european affairs . 
  which was then largely blunted/retracted by a follow-up statement a week later by norway 's pm . 
  a better bet : norway has a veto over efta membership and wants to see what it can get by leveraging it . 
  i dunno , would say that keeping high volume on a `` the eu is trying to pry us apart '' narrative is good domestic politics for scottish solidarity . 
  um , most of those listed were pre-russia-invading-ukraine . 
  the 2004 [ beslan siege ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beslan_school_siege ) got major coverage here . 
  after the ukraine situation , yeah , sympathy may have decreased . 
  and as i said , you are n't in the eu , and for you , joining would be as trivial as moving to the uk-in-the-eu . 
  it seems like an odd thing for you to get upset about . 
  fine . 
  my intent is n't to make an argument for leviticus 's legitimacy . 
  my point is that if the csu objection to allowing same-sex couples from adopting is that the csu is christian , it seems like they are okay with the homosexual things that the bible prohibits but are objecting to the at-most-very-peripheral-to-homosexuality things that the bible does not prohibit . 
   to me it is always absolutely hilarious when christians quote the old testament . 
  leviticus is old testament , though romans is new testament . 
  but ... that 's not really my point . 
  / u/all _ rand0m 's argument was that the csu 's opposition to same-sex couples adopting was due to the fact that they are a christian party . 
  my point is that there does n't seem to be a basis for this prohibition in christianity , certainly less of one than against things that germany does permit . 
   it 's really just an academic different whether you dedicate 10 % of your income to your pension or plan or pay 10 % extra to social security . 
  it 's not academic whether generation 5 is funding generation 4 's pension or generation 5 's pension . 
  i mean , yes , you could debt-fund something else , in theory , but i think the idea is that there is n't a lot of off-the-books debt that shows up as future pension obligations . 
  [ i decided to check ] ( http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-germany.pdf ) :  ii ) substantive conditions for the making of an adoption order -  b ) who may adopt ? 
  -  1 ) civil status requirements -  the plain language of the law does not favor married couples , but interpretation of the standard of adoption -- welfare of the child -- results in the vast majority of adoptees being placed with married couples . 
  -  since 2001 , same sex couples in germany may enter into a registered partnership ( * lebenspartnerschaft * ) . 
  registered partners now have basic adoption rights , although not equal to those of married couples . 
  as of january 1 , 2005 , a person may adopt the biological child of his or her registered partner . 
  the law does not , however , allow registered partners to adopt a child as a couple ( like a married couple may and must ) . 
  a registered partner may still adopt alone , but his or her registered partner would not be able to then adopt the adoptee . 
  so singles can adopt in germany , though in practice courts tend to favor married couples . 
  same-sex unions can only have one member adopt , doing so as an individual . 
  because i 'm interested in what-all 's going on . 
  i 'm not getting angry about it , though . 
  that does n't really address my point , though : the bible does n't forbid two men from raising a child . 
  it forbids two men to have sex . 
  germany does not have a school curriculum that includes teaching children not to have homosexual sex . 
  germany prohibits hardcore pornography from being provided to minors -- presumably because it is a social ill that children must not be exposed to -- but does not prohibit , say , depictions of same-sex unions being visible to children . 
  there is some political discussion in the us -- not sure if this extends to germany , but / u/cloun-penisdotfart has a us flair -- about the fact that men tend to be somewhat disadvantaged in things like court fights over custody of children . 
  / r/mensrights has it [ on their faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights/wiki/faq#wiki_7._what_are_the_focal_topics_of_the_mrm.3f ) . 
  well , i can find [ leviticus 18:22 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+18%3a22&amp;version=niv ) :  do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman ; that is detestable . 
  and [ leviticus 20:13 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+20%3a13&amp;version=niv ) :  if a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable . 
  they are to be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads . 
  and [ romans 1:26 -27 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%3a26-27&amp;version=niv ) :  because of this , god gave them over to shameful lusts . 
  even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones . 
  in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . 
  men committed shameful acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their error . 
  i definitely see the bible condemning homosexual sex , which germany 's laws are fine with . 
  but i do n't see the bible condemning same-sex couples adopting kids . 
   and of course kids need parents of both genders i do n't think that 's the critical factor , or you 'd see a similar objection to permitting single parents to raise children . 
   mass scale pakistani / muslim rape gangs all over the uk what is the obsession you guys have with this ? 
   i very much doubt their children will contribute either their children will be brought up in your educational system . 
  why would n't they ? 
  you 're not going to be able to have people transition to self-funding their own pension in a quarter-generation or whatever . 
  probably would require multiple generations to avoid clobbering standard of living too badly . 
  til that the ticker symbol for conversion from the us dollar to the icelandic krona is usdick . 
  they would n't . 
  edit : just because this comment now makes no sense , the parent comment said roughly `` to peg one 's currency to the euro , would n't the country have to first join the eu ? '', 
   the csu is currently considering a five-point program of policy measures for families with children . 
  according to the news report , it includes a one-off payment to help parents pay for equipment for their first baby , increased income tax deductions for parents for each child they have , the introduction of a bank account to pay for a child 's education into which the state would make contributions , the gradual abolition of day care costs and the reduction of social insurance contributions for low-income families . 
  i see that the csu has an action plan for this unsustainably-low fertility thing !, 
   since 2001 there has been a special legal arrangement for same-sex couples in germany which stipulates they are not allowed to adopt children . 
  see , i do n't get this . 
  i can understand how , if you oppose homosexuality being non-taboo , you might want to make sodomy or same-sex marriage or whatever illegal , to avoid giving the state 's imprimatur to it . 
  but what the dickens does blocking * adoption * to same-sex marriage buy ? 
  well , freedom of movement facilitates economic convergence , which poland definitely would like to see . 
  the uk has n't proposed [ this sort of level of fiscal transfers ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-difference-between-the-us-and-europe-in-1-graph/256857/ ) , which would be another way to achieve that . 
  is this even an issue any more , or is szyd\u0142o just staging a big show for domestic consumption ? 
  berlin was surrounded by east germany . 
   you can literally say all the pre ww2 racist stuff that people used to say about jews as long as you say muslims instead . 
  `` muslims control global finance ! '', 
  does n't have the same ring to it . 
   for years europeans have called israelis , russians and eastern europeans , chinese , and americans `` islamophobic . '', 
  it is n't an irrational fear ; we know the beast . 
  [ the us has ~ 1 % muslim . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_the_united_states ) [ eastern europe has even less .
