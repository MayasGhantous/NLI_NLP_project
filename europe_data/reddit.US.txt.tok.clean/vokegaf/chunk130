  [ 7 ]   http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcandy.html#cottoncandy    1769 ... take a quarter of a pound of treble-refined sugar in one lump , and set it before a moderate fire on the middle of a silver salver or pewter plate . 
  set it a little aslant , and when it begins to run like clear water to the edge of the plate or salver , have ready a tin cover or china bowl set on a still , with the mouth downward close to your sugar that it may not cool by carrying too far . 
  then take a clean knife and take up as much of the syrup as the point will hold , and a fine thread will come from the point , which you must draw as quicky as possible backwards and forwards and also around the mould , as long as it will spin from the knife . 
  be very careful you do not drop the syrup on the web , if you do it will spoil it . 
  then dip your knife into the syrup again and take up more , and so keep spinning till your sugar is done or your web is thick enough . 
  the us invents a machine that makes a form of it in bulk for the masses . 
  this is sold at fairs in tooth-rotting quantities . 
  ( i will leave it up to you as to whether the fact that the initial inventors both were dentists was a coincidence . ), 
  it enters popular culture :  machine-spun cotton candy was invented in 1897 by the [ tennessee ] dentist william morrison and confectioner john c. wharton and first introduced to a wide audience at the 1904 world 's fair as `` fairy floss '' [ 9 ] with great success , selling 68,655 boxes at 25 cents per box ( equivalent to $ 6 [ 10 ] per box today ) . 
  joseph lascaux , a dentist from new orleans , louisiana , invented a similar cotton candy machine in 1921 . 
  in fact , the lascaux patent named the sweet confection `` cotton candy '' and the `` fairy floss '' name faded away , although it retains this name in australia . 
  ... and the british apparently developed their own term ( `` candy floss '' ) , which they still retain . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cotton_candy  cotton candy ( also known as fairy floss in australia , [ 1 ] candy floss in the uk and new zealand ) is a form of spun sugar . 
  australia , dammit , even the kiwis are n't on board with you on that one . 
  i was unclear . 
  i mean that the vw managers in question are n't going to be subject to capital sentences . 
  i 'd think that you 'd need common supervision in a run-up period prior to common resolution if youbalready had large unsupervised banks , or you can just dump unsupervised losses onto other countries . 
  none of their charges are going to be capital . 
  well , restricting poles from competing with french workers is n't gon na help produce equal productivity . 
  why would you blame that guy either ? 
   a supermarket is ugly , pragmatic in its purpose that is purely economic . 
  i 'd say that it 's pretty comparable in that to a collection of specialty stores . 
  a supermarket just means that a consumer does n't need to hit multiple stores to purchase all of what he wants ... 
  i do n't think that the single market is * more * likely to lead to monopoly risk . 
   you bet they are going to move to bulgaria or ukraine in 10-15 years or so , when polish wages are catching up to those of the rest of europe . 
  yes , some hopefully will . 
  that 's part of economic convergence -- you ultimately want to have poorer eu members catch up with wealthier ones , and that means that their labor needs to be doing comparable work . 
  that was always going to be an intrinsic property of having a single market . 
  without it , you 'd have economic backwaters . 
   germany is the only western democracy with an organization like the bpjm . 
  dammit , germany . 
  if france , belgium , and canada have all seen their youth not be crazed by access to uncensored media , might be worth considering whether german youth are actually at significantly greater risk . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chilling_effect  in a legal context , a chilling effect is the inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights by the threat of legal sanction . 
  [ 1 ] the right that is most often described as being suppressed by a chilling effect is the us constitutional right to free speech . 
  a chilling effect may be caused by legal actions such as the passing of a law , the decision of a court , or the threat of a lawsuit ; any legal action that would cause people to hesitate to exercise a legitimate right ( freedom of speech or otherwise ) for fear of legal repercussions . 
  the state can still effect restrictions on speech via creating risk . 
  well , we 'll certainly see . 
  there are a number of legislators saying that the revision is not expected to be lengthy , so we should n't have to wait too long . 
  it 's not uncommon for bills to move between senate and house for revision . 
  this is not killed unless the senate does n't revise the point that the house was objecting to . 
  not directly , perhaps . 
  but i certainly have opinions on the matter , much as how many people who do not live in the us have opinions on the us using force or the manner in which force is used . 
  still no reason to believe that it 's a representative sample of young people ( or even that the people commenting were young ) . 
  i 'm not sure that youtube comments are a representative sample . 
  polls are probably better . 
  how does us and uk behavior differ from italy 's wrt catching terrorists ? 
   i mean being allowed into the eu in the first place seems to be pretty heckin ' rad . 
  in the sense that iran is n't being admitted any time soon , maybe ...

   may 's proposal is already the law to begin with . 
  the existing law would terminate a path to permanent residency for anyone who did n't have a right above-and-beyond citizenship in an eu member and leveraging freedom of labor . 
  that is , if you had n't yet acquired permanent residency , you 'd be out . 
  may is offering to grant temporary residency to people who are already in the uk sufficient to let them continue on the path to permanent residency . 
   sue wilson , a briton who lives in spain and who chairs the bremain in spain group , said one of the main concerns was that the uk 's offer did not accept a role for the european court of justice , the ultimate legal arbiter of all legal disputes relating to the eu , including breaches of eu citizens ' rights across europe . 
    it will remain the arbiter until britain leaves the eu , but downing street does not accept it has a role in legacy issues after brexit . 
  i 'm with may on this one . 
  no country is normally going to grant a foreign court extraterritorial jurisdiction over this , nor is it reasonable to request it . 
  that 's the sort of thing that the british empire did to china during china 's dark days . 
  the eu should not be asking for this to be on the table . 
  the us is only running a trade deficit if you ignore fdi as a form of trade . 
  we create a company . 
  we sell shares in it to investors abroad ( which is n't recorded as an export ) . 
  the money raised is used , among other things , to hire employees . 
  those purchase goods from abroad . 
  part of our stock in trade is ownership in companies . 
  you know those * quebecois * , always stirring up trouble . 
   nationalism is the past and it 's going to die out . 
  not on my watch . 
  murica !, 
  shrinking population * is * a problem in germany , and if it is n't handled via immigration , then germany needs to take a serious look at getting the birth rate up . 
  granted , intra-eu immigration may be enough for germany , but that just makes the problem worse for other eu members . 
   so you think the lower employment is due to germans ' racism rather than mena immigrants lack of immigration and culture , including a `` wife stays at home '' mindset ? 
  in the us , a person not seeking work ( like a housewife ) is not counted towards unemployment statistics . 
  i assume that the same is true for germany . 
   i used to make fun of my friends in london regarding their renting experience . 
  berlin is not that far off now https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/berlin/london/breakdown  housing in london ( united kingdom ) is 89 % more expensive than in berlin ( germany ) i dunno . 
  london is pretty bad . 
  mena does n't have * that * high tfr . 
  it 's really sub-saharan africa that is way up there . 
  [ eurostat fertility rates ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:total_fertility_rate,_1960%e2%80%932015_\\ ( live_births_per_woman ) _ yb17.png ) ireland is not too far off replacement level -- it 's one of the most-stable countries in europe , along with france . 
  that being said , i do n't think that you can reduce it to only catholicism . 
  both [ italy and poland are more catholic than ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_church_by_country ) and have a much lower tfr . 
   but are a tiny fraction of the population compared to immigrants you sure ? 
  i know that there are a lot of guest workers , but i 'm not sure how many naturalize . 
   deep state < rolls eyes , 
  yes , it is bad , because it will be less economically efficient . 
  but what i 'm getting at is that countries do not run long-term surpluses or deficits . 
  decrease exports by n euros/year and you do the same to imports in the long term . 
  the two are inextricably linked at the hip . 
  to say that a decrease in imports is less-bad than a decrease in exports is n't very meaningful ; one causes the other . 
  your goal is not to try to maximize trade surplus by trading with countries with whom you run a trade surplus in preference to those with whom you have a trade deficit . 
  to be fair , you 're in the eu , which makes legal migration vastly easier . 
  a better comparison might be ukraine or kosovo . 
   the fact that they 're moving new model runs away from the uk showed their more focused on new technologies and markets i do n't see why it 'd be relevant to technologies . 
  the [ chicken tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax ) resulting in inefficiently-high production of light trucks in the us ( instead of european or east asian trucks ) being an example . 
   simply put , we 're all disadvantaged only and only if a competitor gets more preferential access to the uk market no . 
  let 's say that there is a $ 1000 fee attached to the sale of each pizza in norway . 
  pizza vendors are going to go out of business , and consumers go without pizza . 
  people are clearly worse-off , even though the relative ranking of competitiveness of pizza vendors may remain the same .
