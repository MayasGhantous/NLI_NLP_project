  as a customer , having a supplier not be viable is equally bad . 
  in both cases you reduce trade , and reducing imports means that you 're also reducing your long term exports by the same amount . 
   it will cost everyone jobs well , it will make just about all involved countries worse off . 
  not sure if `` number of jobs '' is incredibly meaningful . 
   another election could give the opposition parties enough seats to push for a second referendum . 
  i mean , it 's obviously not impossible , but the last election results really made me less hopeful . 
  labour supports brexit , and their strong showing meant that corbyn is going nowhere any time soon . 
  the liberal democrats oppose brexit , but they did n't see the sort of big gains that would be needed . 
  and polls do n't show any major shift in public opinion on the matter . 
  the only real plus was that youth turnout was high -- a high youth turnout would be favorable in any future referendum . 
  no dispute -- i empathize on both points -- but he does have a point that with the liberal uk out , the voice for liberalism will be weaker in the eu . 
  at least on economic policy , germany 's still comparatively close , given what liberal members will need to work with moving forwards . 
  there will be an inevitable shift away from liberal economic policy in the eu ... 
  note that this was n't who liked it , but who was sad or not about it -- and it 's asking almost all eu members , who are going to have more emotional investment . 
  i think that brexit is a bad idea , rendering the eu less liberal and poorer and reducing uk trade and economic impact on the world . 
  but i 've no emotional attachment to the union of the two . 
  it 's unlikely that people in japan or chile are sad about brexit either . 
   were not talking about afghanistan money here . 
  we 're talking marshall plan and decades of commitment . 
  more was spent on post-war afghanistan than the marshall plan . 
   why do n't you go back to an american sub if you hate immigrants ironic . 
  and given that both sides need to train , better to double the bang of your training dollar and train both people who 'd fly the eurofighter and the f-35 at once . 
   a lot of these pmcs exist so countries can avoid having to declare war but still essentially do it . 
  that makes zero sense . 
  at least in the us , pmcs do n't have any bearing on whether or not you need to declare war -- authorizations of use of force are just fine for both . 
  that is across countries -- we 're talking about within a single country . 
   the connection between population size and gdp is very weak . 
  on the contrary , it is very strong : gdp of a country is going to be more or less a linear function of population , unless your economy is defined by extraction of a resource . 
  halve your population , and you can normally produce half as much . 
  you will not have access to a list of the data sources that us intelligence uses in performing assessments . 
  can they at least do english , or perhaps german or french ? 
   spanians spaniards . 
  i 'm not particularly left , but there 's a choice where one of immigration , a significant increase in birth rate , or a serious decline in global power coupled with a decline of the welfare state is inevitable . 
  i do think that more skilled immigration would be greatly preferable to the current situation , but if that is n't going to happen , at the least it 's * possible * to educate and train first-gen and later second gen immigrants . 
  this has happened in the us : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second-generation_immigrants_in_the_united_states  in comparison to first generation immigrants , second-generation immigrants are more likely to achieve higher earnings . 
  [ 2 ] in 2008 , the median annual earnings for second-generation immigrants were $ 42,297 while the median annual earnings for first generation immigrants were $ 32,631 . 
  -  second-generation immigrants are more educated compared to first generation immigrants , exceeding parental education in many instances . 
  [ 5 ] a greater percentage of second-generation immigrants have obtained a level of education beyond a high school diploma , with 59.2 % having at least some college education in 2009 . 
  [ 2 ] also in 2009 , 33 % of the second generation immigrant population had a bachelor 's degree . 
  -  in 2003 , the pew research center projected that in the next twenty years , second generation latinos will account for the largest percentage of the u.s. 
  population . 
  [ 1 ] in 2003 it was also projected that , if current trends continue , over the next 20 years , 1/4 of the growth in the labor force will be due to second-generation immigrants who are latino . 
  [ 1 ] 1/7 of new students enrolling in schools within this same time period will also be second generation latinos . 
  [ 1 ] the increasing representation of second-generation immigrants who are latino in the areas of work , school , and the larger population can be attributed to the continuing influx of latino immigrants and the high fertility rate of latino immigrants , which is higher than any other segment of the national population . 
  [ 1 ]   as the number of second generation latinos/as grows , so will their political and economical influence . 
  in relation to educational achievement , second generation latinos follow the general trend for second-generation immigrants in the united states . 
  in comparison to first generation latino immigrants , second generation latinos are more likely to intermarry with members of other racial groups . 
  these higher rates of racial intermarriage leads to an increase in the birthrates of interracial children , aiding in the elimination of disparities in the u.s. that exist along ethnic lines . 
  i realize that nigeria , pakistan and eritrea are n't identical to mexico , but if europe ca n't work out immigration from viable sources , it needs to * seriously * look into making social or political change to bring europe 's birth rate to a sustainable range . 
  [ in 2014 , there were several european but non-eu countries with higher rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita ) : san marino , monaco , liechtenstein , and iceland . 
   says nothing about hacking though uh ... yes it does :  we assess with high confidence that russian military intelligence ( general staff main intelligence directorate or gru ) used the guccifer 2.0 persona and dcleaks.com to release us victim data . 
  -  be honest , it has nothing to do with `` interference '' , it 's partisanship . 
  be honest : breakins are not endorsements . 
  russia 's abiilty to sanction trade with us is the same in absolute terms as our ability to sanction trade with russia . 
  there 's $ n billion in trade . 
  it can be decreased by either side . 
  in relative terms , the impact on trade will be larger for russia , regardless of who initiates it . 
  i do n't claim to be an expert on sanctions , but afaik it is probably possible to put pressure on a more-politically-sensitive industry or individuals , but aside from that , you 're taking as much harm as you cause . 
  [ in 2011 , the us was # 5 export and # 8 import partner for russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_russia ) at $ 36 billion in then-dollars : top-ten , but behind germany and ukraine , and substantially-smaller than aggregate trade with europe . 
  in 2016 , after sanctions , trade had [ fallen to $ 20 billion ] ( https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4621.html ) . 
  in 2014 , russia [ was the # 30 trading partner for the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_united_states ) . 
  as a result , our ability to seriously hurt each other single-handedly via sanctions is inherently limited . 
  counter-sanctions probably have more to do with domestic politics than any attempt to produce political pressure in the us ; they 're more likely to produce greater relative difficulty in russia than in the us . 
  i 'd argue that it 's more clearly a part of the * identity * . 
  like , you can have a picture of the constitution here and people will recognize it and it 'll be seen as patriotic -- not used as frequently as the flag , but i see it wrapped around trucks and the like . 
  i 'm not going to argue the merits of the individual rights -- we 're not going to agree here . 
   there is however a difference in that countries like mine ( and other european ones with a more ceremonial head of state ) do n't take 180 \u00b0 turns in the executive power ( and head of state ) like yours just did . 
  i disagree . 
  the executive is the head of government , not the head of state -- this changes just as much when you have a pm and king as when you have a president , and you certainly do see changes in direction . 
  what you have is a head of * state * that does not change other than at death or abdication . 
  the head of state does n't do much by way of setting policy -- this does not provide for continuity of policy . 
  a lie ? 
  that 's an accurate summary of us intelligence findings . 
  https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ica_2017_01.pdf  we assess russian president vladimir putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the us presidential election . 
  russia 's goals were to undermine public faith in the us democratic process , denigrate secretary clinton , and harm her electability and potential presidency . 
  we further assess putin and the russian government developed a clear preference for president-elect trump . 
  we have high confidence in these judgments . 
    * we also assess putin and the russian government aspired to help president-elect trump 's election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him . 
  all three agencies agree with this assessment . 
  cia and fbi have high confidence in this judgment , nsa has moderate confidence . 
    * moscow 's approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on russia 's understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates . 
  when it appeared to moscow that secretary clinton was likely to win the election , the russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency . 
    * further information has come to light since election day that , when combined with russian behavior since early november 2016 , increases our confidence in our assessments of russian motivations and goals . 
  some forms of female genital cutting * are * less-severe than male circumcision . 
  there 's a broader range of procedures than with circumcision . 
  cornflakes and penis styling !, 
  to be fair , this is presumably politicking on both sides . 
   you may have your concerns , but i prefer this over what you guys got : you are basically a new nation whenever the executive flips , without any long term stability or accountability . 
  when trump and the gop are out we will be exoected by the democrats to forget it ever happened ... try planning a future with someone as fickle as that . 
  accountability does n't normally do much to a ruling monarch . 
  i get where you 're coming from with stability , but our sense continuity does n't come from a human head of state , but from the constitution , which i 'd argue is part of the identity more than in most ( all current , maybe ? ), 
  other countries . 
  maybe the flag or bald eagle to some degree . 
  i could see an argument for a human head of state being separate from head of government ( though i 'd personally rather it not be a heriditary position ) . 
  that way , you have a politically non-controversial figure to represent the country . 
  the constitution may define being american in the way that queen elizabeth iidefines being british , but the constitution ca n't perform ceremonies . 
  ` course , the constitution also ca n't do embarrassing things ...
