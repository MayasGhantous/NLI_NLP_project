  ireland has about the highest tfr in europe , and is not particularly urbanized . 
  portugal has the lowest tfr in the eu , and has about the same level of urbanization .

  i specifically chose bombings that predated the 1970s-ish islamic bombings to show that terrorist bombings were happening in the west first . 
  right , but china also moves well behind in nominal terms . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china  gdp ( nominal ) : $ 11.8 trillion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union  gdp ( nominal ) : $ 16.518 trillion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states  gdp ( nominal ) : $ 18.558 trillion your article was arguing that the eu was more economically powerfulthan the us , but was using ppp-adjusted data , which it probably should not have been . 
  lot of throwaway accounts on this thread . 
  the article author is using ppp-adjusted data . 
  you usually want that to measure things like per-capita standard of living . 
  if you want to measure economic power , which is what he 's trying to do , you do n't want to ppp-adjust . 
  2007 is when rupert murdoch acquired the wsj . 
  global poverty ( real poverty , not relative poverty ) is actually on unprecedented decline . 
  china in particular is much better off . 
  africa is a notable laggard , yeah , but i 'd be more optimistic on this point than you are . 
   it was kinda disheartening to see such consensus across the political spectrum . 
  not a sentence i often see ... 
   we ca n't even create enough jobs for our young i think that that has more to do with labor law ... 
  note that in the us , recent-migrant birthrates tend to be higher ( largely catholic large-family latinos ) but do fall off to below replacement level over a few generations . 
  still somewhat higher than the general population , but not by much . 
  assuming that the same thing will happen in the eu , i think that a more-important concern might be not `` will migrants have more kids than long-term natives '' and more `` why does everyone who shows up start rapidly dying out ? '', 
  and `` do i want the country to either decline in size and influence or require a high rate of immigration to maintain population ? '', 
  obviously , it 's not essential to freeze world populations in place . 
  but if you ca n't manage to at least be in the vicinity of a 2.1 tfr , in the long term , you must have major population inflows or outflows . 
   pretty much every developing and developed , urbanized coutries face sinking birthrates , from spain , to russia , to iran , to china and to japan . 
  this is not some strange european phenomenon . 
  europe is * really * low , though . 
  only japan and south korea are really in the same ballpark as most european countries . 
  and it ca n't be reduced to wealth : portugal is not particularly well-to-do as european countries go , but is at the bottom of the european countries . 
  so what criteria makes someone an elite ? 
  is terrorist bombing part of the culture of the middle east ?

  found someone owning london real estate who wants to drive prices up further . 
  well , martin luther got a lot of crap too when he started out . 
  i thought that the point of austerity is that you would n't * need * to jack up the tax rates now , anyhow ... 
  no , no . 
  he meant calling us liberals ( european-meaning-liberals located in the us ) `` liberals '' is confusing to people in the us because of the meaning drifting . 
  i think . 
  at leaat that way makes sense . 
  i think that you interpreted it as us liberals ( us-meaning-liberals ) `` liberals '' is confusing to people in europe ... and that would n't be very confusing , because the political center in the us differs to the point where there 's some overlap in meaning again . 
  `` take leadership , but make no decisions that i object to in some way . '', 
  i remember similar calls on the migrant crisis . 
  often followed up by complaints that germany was taking actions that was n't what the person in question wanted and that germany was pushing policy down the throats of other countries . 
  if you want leadership , you got ta accept that sometimes , it 's not gon na be exactly what you personally want . 
   multicultural < continues surreptitiously slipping blue jeans into czechia ,

  http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/12/muslim-prankster-is-shot-in-stomach-after-tossing-fake-backpack-bomb-at-wrong-man-in-video-prank/ in australia :  the brothers dressed as a militant muslim with an arab turban and a beard and then tossed a fake backpack bomb at unsuspecting civilians . 
  -  the brothers made three videos where they make fun of people 's reaction to being attacked by a fake muslim bomber . 
  -  this time , however , they apparently got a different reaction while filming for their fourth video . 
  one of the brothers , arman jalal , was shot in the stomach after ` pranking ' the wrong man . 
  if you honestly are convincing people that they 're under attack , you run the risk of them acting to defend themselves . 
  people in a potentially life-threatening situation with potentially bad light or a limited view of the action and having to act almost immediately may not react the way you would in a fully-controlled situation . 
  i mean , you gon na do it , fair enough , but if you get hurt or killed doing it , going to be on your head ... 
  no , l think that this story is just plain bullshit . 
  okay , you can debate the eu and its relationship . 
  but here are the bits about the us :  even more , it was the west -- used here as an aggregate term to denote the european union and american political elites -- that enabled and even encouraged the process , which now resulted in the drastic retreat of turkey from democracy , and its dramatic sliding towards authoritarianism-come-islamism . 
  -  the transformation of the role of the military , required by the eu and strongly encouraged by the bush administration 's push for global democratization , destroyed the single force in the country that kept dormant the eruptive power for reversal towards islamization and single-person authoritarianism in the country . 
  -  the global changes , with the ill-conceived american-led war on terror , the actual wars in afghanistan and iraq , and the rise of russia as a counterweight to the american global supremacy , gave erdogan the necessary opportunity to grab the moment and carve a niche for turkey as a regional power center . 
  -  the united states , blinded by its push for democratization , forsook the foundations for its pragmatic if cynical , decades-long partnership with turkey -- the military . 
  i can reduce this to two bullet points : * turks are only capable of living in a democratic-ish government if a group of military elites keeps forcing the situation . 
  * by giving turkey influence , turkey was able to forge its own path , and thus inevitably moved towards a single powerful figure running the country . 
  i call bullshit on the first point . 
  there 's nothing intrinsic to turks that renders them incapable of having a democracy . 
  frankly , if i were turkish , i 'd probably be kind of insulted . 
  christianity ? 
  japan 's not very christian . 
  strength of religion ? 
  hell , we 're still pretty religious , and used to be more . 
  education ? 
  go back two hundred years and you had a relatively uneducated populace in democracies . 
  i also call bullshit on the second point . 
  turkey does n't somehow need to be without influence to maintain a democracy . 
  that 's just idiotic . 
  is the us toothless ? 
  i have n't heard of feminist christianity . 
   and yes , the idea of an lgbt friendly abrahamic religion makes no sense to me . 
  the holy books are quite clear on their stance toward homosexual people , to put it mildly . 
  suppose you like other parts of the ideology or culture in abrahamic religion ? 
  christianity today has been reinterpreted in significant ways -- we do n't have any problem with borrowing and landing for interest , for example . 
  but some people are pretty happy with that . 
   to remedy competition amusing . 
  gazprom is presumably doing this to create an environment where [ price discrimination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/price_discrimination ) is possible , which * can only exist in non-competitive markets * :  in a theoretical market with perfect information , perfect substitutes , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopolistic and oligopolistic markets , [ 15 ] where market power can be exercised . 
  otherwise , the moment the seller tries to sell the same good at different prices , the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price but with a tiny discount . 
  while a monopolized market using price discrimination is theoretically more economically-efficient than a monopolized market not using price discrimination , it 's worth noting that it transfers consumer surplus to producer surplus , which is not economically inefficient . 
  that is , selling individually to countries permits gazprom to charge close to the most that any one member is willing to pay , thus extracting more money out of ( especially ) well-to-do customers . 
  yes . 
  eu citizenship is not ( yet ) `` real '' citizenship . 
  you 're a citizen of your member state -- the term citizenship is looking forward towards the potential future . 
  same sort of deal as being a british subject was -- you were still a citizen of your country . 
  finally , normally countries may remove citizenship of citizens anyway , unless it would make them stateless and they are one of a handful of states who [ have agreed not to do that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_the_reduction_of_statelessness ) . 
   anti-canada propaganda man , that ca n't be a plum assignment as propagandists go . 
  my guess is the `` nazis oppressing ethnic russians '' thing was because russia was hoping to make an argument that russia could do a sudetenland , trying to base it on nato actions in ex-yugoslavia ( `` nato eventually redrew borders to avoid ongoing ethnic cleansing , so if this were ethnic cleansing , we could do the same thing too ! '' ), 
  yeah , that 's fair . 
  i 'm just trying to draw a distinction between , say , him saying `` we should destroy paris and berlin '' and lavrov saying `` we should destroy paris and berlin '' . 
  lavrov or putin are `` russia '' to the outside world . 
  the fact that russia 's legislature has stuff like this going on and that it 's popular with enough russians to be a good political move for him is concerning , but i do n't feel like he 's speaking as the voice of russia , either . 
   [ vladimir zhirinovsky suggested to burn paris to ashes and bombard the entire germany in his speech at the russian parliament today ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2v11p9/vladimir_zhirinovsky_suggested_to_burn_paris_to/ ) i do n't much like statements like this , but it 's also important to note that this does n't reflect current russian foreign policy . 
  it 's one guy in the legislature , and i understand that he 's known for making statements like this , i guess to whip up nationalists . 
   [ russia can turn us to radioactive ash - kremlin-backed journalist ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-kiselyov-idusl6n0md0p920140316 ) this is true . 
  the us arguably now has regained peacetime [ first strike capability ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-emptive_nuclear_strike ) ( while russia does not have first strike capability against the us ) . 
  however , if russia attacks first with her full arsenal , the us would not be able to protect herself or anyone else to any great degree -- us defenses are simply nowhere near extensive enough to counter russia 's full arsenal .
