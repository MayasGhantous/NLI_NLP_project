  obviously , the message nord stream 2 sends to poland and ukraine is n't good , regardless of which is assumed . 
  secondly , neither of these positions seem like something that states working together should really hold to . 
  i mean , the us does n't have gas pipelines run out over the ocean to avoid including us states . 
  if we can manage it , i 'd think that the eu can probably do so too ...

  electric fan ? 
  electric fan blowing past a wet towel , if you want to cool it off further ? 
    well , my layman 's reaction to nordstream ii is that it 's not a good idea for political reasons , but it 's not really an eu project , is it ? 
  i mean , any country that wants to run pipeline and fund it can do so . 
    commercial agreements are under the exclusive competence of the eu . 
  this is a matter of energy which is shared competence , so member states are supposed to work together on this . 
  there 's a clear concern for every other member state here , and not only because alliging and becoming dependant on russian gas , but also a competition and industrial concern where germany gets to buy cheaper gas than everyone else . 
  ah , okay , my fault , then -- i thought that nord stream 2 was n't eu . 
  thanks . 
   you could argue that transferring crimea to ukraine in 1954 was a violation of international law i do n't see how . 
  what law was violated ? 
  no : the bulk of the global uranium extracted each year comes from canada and australia . 
  `` chimp '' ? 
   nord-stream ii well , my layman 's reaction to nordstream ii is that it 's not a good idea for political reasons , but it 's not really an eu project , is it ? 
  i mean , any country that wants to run pipeline and fund it can do so . 
   eurobonds and fiscal reform . 
  almost solely opposed by germany at this point . 
  even if netherlands are on germany 's side , there is a clear majority in the rest of the euro states for this . 
  fair enough , but is that disproportionate ? 
  as i understand it , introducing eurobonds would require no members vetoing them , right ? 
  not just a majority vote ? 
  i mean , any other member also has the ability to do the same . 
  it seems more like the issue here is not `` germany has a disproportionate amount of influence '' , but `` the eu 's structure has a bias towards the * status quo * '' . 
  on this particular item , germany happens to favor the status quo ...  pushing for any international free trade treaty they want . 
  i do n't know the history there , but fair enough . 
   the greek drama story ? 
  it was almost solely a german-greek affair when it came to it . 
  but not because germany was in the eu , but because it became a creditor . 
  that is , if any country -- china , the us , etc -- had offered to cover other creditors , they 'd be in the same position . 
  money only translates to power if the money can be made contingent on doing something else , though . 
  normally , countries are not , as far as i know , permitted to simply adjust contributions in the eu . 
  that 's why i was having to fall back to `` what if someone wanted to start up a new initiative and needed funds for that ? 
  '' , to get the money back to something that could be contingent upon something else . 
   when it comes to eu decision-making , the prevailing view in five of nine european nations is that germany has too much influence . 
  this view is most common in greece , italy and spain . 
  i 've seen the `` germany has too much power '' thing repeated quite a bit , but surprisingly-divorced from specific concerns . 
  like , for example , i can say `` low-population states in the us have too much influence in the senate '' , because i think that influence should be at least roughly on a per-capita basis . 
  whether-or-not someone would agree with me , they 'd be pretty clear on my objection . 
  but i 've heard a lot of people complaining about germany 's influence in the eu , but little about the specifics . 
  that makes me skeptical that there 's an issue . 
  germany is n't over-represented in seat count . 
  germany does n't have any unique powers . 
  a german citizen will find it statistically-harder to trigger a veto due to his personal interests , just because there 's a larger pool of people with political influence into whether germany vetoes something . 
  germany 's has a lot of people , but it seems strange to say `` well , these people over here happen to live in one state instead of two , so their influence should be decreased . '', 
  i guess as a well-to-do eu donor , germany can choose to engage in projects that involve a subset of the eu states , and people would care about germany being part of those . 
  but honestly , it seems to me that if there 's a legitimate complaint , it should be fairly clear to most people objecting what the issue is . 
  when i look at [ this quora question ] ( https://www.quora.com/why-is-germany-disproportionately-powerful-in-the-eu ) , what i find is a lot of people all convinced that germany has a lot of influence , but with a lot of divergence on just what that influence is . 
   india is urbanized or deals with dense jungles and mountainous terrain . 
  you 're not gon na be shooting at 300m + . 
  hmm . 
  i 'd think that mountainous terrain would result in more long-range engagements rather than fewer . 
  i mean , with a mountain , there 's larger gaps free of obstruction through the air . 
  well , machine guns were used to defend against charging groups of people in world war i. 
  not very common today , but being able to throw a lot of bullets in that case would be useful . 
  well ... let 's see : * it 's gon na have a device id . 
  that means that you can track the gun , and thus probably identify units that people belong to . 
  * it 's gon na be presumably responding to broadcasts . 
  * probably * not a big deal , but i suppose that there are cases where visibility of a radio signal would be greater than visibillity . 
  it does n't sound like people go in much for super-long-range bluetooth , but they do for wi-fi : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long-range_wi-fi#italy  the longest unamplified wi-fi link is a 304 km link achieved by cisar ( italian center for radio activities ) . 
  it sounds like wi-fi normally has something like 10x the range that bluetooth does . 
  so with a 1.2 m dish antenna , you could maybe theoretically have someone counting and identifying rifles from 30km away . 
  i could see that potentially being a concern . 
  [ that apparently belongs to someone already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paneuropean_union ) . 
  looks like there are more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_metropolitan_areas_that_overlap_multiple_countries https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_divided_cities, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day  in europe , europe day is an annual celebration of peace and unity in europe . 
  there are two separate designations of europe day : 5 may for the council of europe , and 9 may for the european union ( eu ) . 
  `` we 're going to hold the celebration of unity on this day ! '', 
  `` oh , no you do n't !, 
  the celebration of unity happens half a week later ! '', 
  `` hah , we 'll just see about that !, 
  i 'll never give in or compromise !, 
  i can keep this standoff for decades ! '', 
   guns the only metric by which canadians are n't into guns is by comparison to the us . 
  canada has restrictions on handguns , but not long guns . 
  [ canada has the twelveth-highest guns-per-capita ranking in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ) . 
  the uk is much closer to the other end of the spectrum on this , but canada is n't really . 
   canadians are ... well , half french quebec 's a quarter of the canadian population . 
  wireheading ? 
   and with russia continuing to generate most of its revenue from resource sales , which do n't require a broad educated citizenship , things wo n't change in any major way for the foreseeable future . 
  russia does have a well-educated population , though . 
  there are points where anthropomorphization goes a bit too far , and i think that this is it . 
  it varies by state . 
  most us states [ currently use 16 as age of consent , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_the_united_states ) , plus have romeo and juliet laws that lower this further for couples close in age . 
  finally , a number of states provide an exemption if the two are married , and there are a couple of loopholes that permit for young marriages in some cases . 
  some states allow young marriage with parental or judicial approval . 
  [ new hampshire permits girls to marry as young as 13 if a judge permits it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/child_marriage_in_the_united_states ) . 
  due to the [ full faith and credit clause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_faith_and_credit_clause ) , all states must honor a marriage performed in another , so technically all states that have a marital exception effectively go that low . 
  finally , i went looking a while back , when everyone here was complaining about child marriages among people being naturalized in europe . 
  afaict , there is no hard lower limit on the age of married people being naturalized ( though there apparently is a lot of leeway for the ins to block naturalization on any grounds it wants to ) , and naturalization will essentially never nullify a marriage . 
  so in some states , it 's probably theoretically possible to legally have sex with a two-year-old , though it would require a hell of a lot of oddball legal hoops-jumpingand i doubt that it 's an issue in practice . 
  it looks like [ barcelona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_barcelona#humidity ) is pretty humid , though , so you 're starting from a closer point to miami . 
  italy and iraq are both hot places .
