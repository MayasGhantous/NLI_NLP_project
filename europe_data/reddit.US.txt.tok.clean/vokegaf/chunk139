   he is n't stupid , there is absolutely no way you stay that high up for that long ... that defense has been getting worn pretty thin on trump ... 
  dirty bombs are pointless . 
  chemical weapons are much more lethal . 
  i believe that historically in the uk , `` upper-class '' were people who lived off spending down or lending out wealth , `` middle-class '' referred to a small elite of people in what amounted to a managerial or professional class , `` working class '' referred to people who did the bulk of the jobs , and there were more-stringent social divides . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle_class  the size of the middle class depends on how it is defined , whether by education , wealth , environment of upbringing , social network , manners or values , etc. 
  these are all related , but are far from deterministically dependent . 
  the following factors are often ascribed in modern usage to a `` middle class '' : [ by whom ? ], 
    * achievement of tertiary education . 
   * holding professional qualifications , including academics , lawyers , chartered engineers , politicians , and doctors , regardless of leisure or wealth . 
   * belief in bourgeois values , such as high rates of house ownership , delayed gratification , and jobs which are perceived to be secure . 
  in the united kingdom , social status has historically been linked less directly to wealth than in the united states , [ 6 ] and has also been judged by signifiers such as accent ( received pronunciation and u and non-u english ) , manners , place of education ( public school ) , occupation , and the class of a person 's family , circle of friends and acquaintances . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] the us 's use of `` social class '' was more a shorthand for `` how much money you make '' than anything else -- it 's even further away from a true class system , and is [ simply splitting up household income ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_class_in_the_united_states ) . 
  this 2005 division system on wikipedia : | class name | income | | - | - | | upper class ( 1 % ) | top-level executives , celebrities , heirs ; income of $ 500,000 + common . 
  ivy league education common . | | upper middle class [ 1 ] ( 15 % ) | highly-educated ( often with graduate degrees ) professionals & managers with household incomes varying from the high 5-figure range to commonly above $ 100,000 . | | lower middle class ( 32 % ) | semi-professionals and craftsmen with some work autonomy ; household incomes commonly range from $ 35,000 to $ 75,000 . 
  typically , some college education . | | working class ( 32 % ) | clerical , pink - and blue-collar workers with often low job security ; common household incomes range from $ 16,000 to $ 30,000 . 
  high school education . | | lower class ( ca . 
  14 -- 20 % ) | those who occupy poorly-paid positions or rely on government transfers . 
  some high school education . | the system in europe was actually the original system -- the us represents a shift away from tradition . 
  i am not familiar with the history , but my * guess * is that this has to do with politics : the us is pretty wealthy , so by comparing income statistics , largest numbers of people wound up in the `` middle class '' . 
  if you 're running a political party or effort , you want to construct terms to make a large number of people think of themselves as being `` in your group '' . 
  so if you 're left-wing , and you want a `` coalition of the proleteriat '' or whatever , you want a division that has a large working class . 
  if you * do n't * want a left-wing uprising , you want a division that has a * small * working class . 
  ergo , you define `` middle class '' to be half the population , and you 've created a new identity that is separate from `` the workers '' down at the bottom of the totem pole . 
  if you 're concerned about commies/anarchists/socialists / whatever , you want to crack any coalition they 're off building of , say , 85 % of the population or whatnot ... so you establish a political identity that takes the upper 50 % of that as an independent identity of the bottom 35 % and appeal to that middle 50 % in your politics . 
  today , the poor and the wealthy in the us vote democrat , and the middle class votes republican . 
  ( contemporary example of such identity construction : today , you often see people on the left in the us use the phrase `` people of color '' rather than the more-traditional `` black '' -- because they want to construct a political identity that is a coalition inclusive of all nonwhite groups , as this will have the numbers to win political contests , whereas `` black '' does not . ), 
  normally `` dyke '' is the lesbian , and `` dike '' the berm . 
  sounds like [ this is a thing ] ( https://www.nature.com/news/slaughter-of-the-song-birds-1.19222 ) . 
  oh , you 're right , thanks ... i 'd thought that the count was only two seats over the number of seats minus sf 's , because / u/ukpolitics had been mostly using the `` seats minus sf seats '' but that 's including sf 's . 
  apologies !, 
   how do they plan to avoid `` cult status '' , if every nazi in europe will be able to find information on the bell now ? 
  i 'm kind of assuming that neo-nazis do n't all flock , from around an entire continent , to any object that happens to say `` hitler '' on it . 
  well , northern ireland ( a ) has the dup able to let the government collapse and can demand what they want as long as they 're the only option to hold the government up and ( b ) the only reason that the dup can keep the government up is because sinn fein refuses to take their seats . 
  so the structure directing the uk rests upon the shoulders of northern ireland 's parties . 
  edit : my error on ( b ) -- this is not the case . 
  and ironically , sinn fein has the numbers to theoretically end any conservative-dup arrangement if they simply take up their seats and make one vote of no confidence with the other parties ... but they 've followed a tradition of never taking up their seats to prove a point , which is what tips the numbers . 
  edit : as / u/gurkenagurk points out , this is not the case -- my error . 
  sounds like they 're still hashing it out . 
  as of three hours ago , [ dup hopeful of deal on conservative government ` soon ' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40255958 ) . 
  got ta say , northern ireland being in the driver 's seat for the uk as a whole was not the outcome that anyone expected a few weeks ago . 
  they do n't have that much , but i bet that the dutch come in second thanks to dikes . 
  thanks , you 're right , will switch to the correct article . 
   swiss guards are allowed to marry under some circumstances looks like the vatican does n't permit divorce . 
  [ statistics by country , by percent catholic ] ( http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/sc3.html ) : | country | percent catholic | | - | - :| | saint pierre and miquelon | 100 % | | italy | 96.55 % | | malta | 95.34 % | | poland | 94.34 % |, 
   i may be wrong but i think there are no female vatican members wikipedia knows all . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women_in_vatican_city  according to the herald sun in march 2011 , there were `` only 32 female citizens '' residing in the `` smallest state in the world '' . 
  out of the 572 citizens issued with vatican passports , one of them is a nun . 
   if he really had sex with the girl he should spend 10 + years in prison at the very least . 
  well , let 's take a look at sentences . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_europe  ** germany **   \u00a7 176 : '' ( 1 ) whoever commits sexual acts on a person under fourteen ( 14 ) years of age ( a child ) or allows them to be committed on themself by the child , ** shall be punished by imprisonment from six months to ten years ** [ ... ] '' -  ** france **   article 222-24 of the penal code   rape is punished by twenty years of criminal imprisonment : [ snip ]  when committed on a minor of fifteen years ; -  the fact of the commission without violence , constraint , threat or surprise of a sexual offence by an adult on the person of a minor under fifteen years of age is punished by five years ' imprisonment and a fine of $ 75,000 . '', 
  us law varies by state , but there are some extremely severe sentences for statutory rape in certain states . 
   ** louisiana , united states **   ** ( 2 ) however , if the victim was under the age of thirteen years , as provided by paragraph ( a ) ( 4 ) of this section : **   ** ( a ) and if the district attorney seeks a capital verdict , the offender shall be punished by death or life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole , probation , or suspension of sentence , in accordance with the determination of the jury . 
  the provisions of code of criminal procedure art . 
  782 relative to cases in which punishment may be capital shall apply . 
  ** assuming that the jury permits you to live , you may live out the remainder of your days moving between a cell and forced manual labor . 
  one louisiana prison : angola , where prisoners serve hard labor on what was , during the south 's slave days , originally a plantation with slaves doing more-or-less the same thing you will be doing . 
  you are working in the open , [ but if you choose to run , you will be shot down by guards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c2pjny-3gy&amp;t=24m28s ) . 
  well , i mean , both the children and the dude with the camera were victims . 
  the children because of the sex , the guy with the camera because privacy . 
  sure , the former is probably a larger concern than the latter , but it 's not like someone who victimizes ca n't also be a victim . 
   the pensioners and comfortable 50 year olds that voted for this wo n't be affected , i disagree . 
  let 's take a look : * i bet you that a lot of their wealth is tied up in real estate . 
  if the next generation makes less money -- not saying that it will -- that 's the generation that buys your houses . 
  no money in , the value of your house falls . 
  hope that you were n't relying on that for retirement . 
  * if there 's less immigration pressure to the uk , there 's also less demand for housing . 
  * sure , you can have a rule saying `` pensioners must be paid x by the government '' . 
  but you got ta get the funds from somewhere for the government to pay 'em . 
  i guess a really old population could run up debt , but other than that ... * old people want cheap labor to do things like nursing , physical work that they ca n't do , etc. 
  cut off the supply of that , and their money goes less-far . 
  * old people who are retired abroad get hit by gbpeur exchange rate deductions . 
  if your assets are in real estate or the pound , you 're probably not in a good place if the uk does see economic decline . 
  and aside from inflation-protected future pension promises , that 's probably where a lot of older folks have their assets . 
  all that being said , the `` this generation in this country is economically-doomed '' thing is a popular story that i 've seen for decades in different countries , and i do n't think that it 's worth getting excited about . 
  it 's the appeal-to-young reader-eyeballs equivalent of the older reader 's `` the character of today 's youth has gone downhill '' . 
  someone linked a [ cgpgrey video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rstl7nir7gs ) that excerpted some of the * a dictator 's handbook '' . 
  it seems plausible . 
  the idea in the thing is that as long as you 've got a country 's main industry being control of a resource , like access to oil , your goal is to ( a ) maximize how much you can skim off the top and ( b ) minimize how much goes to the public . 
  most of your money is n't coming from labor of your citizenry , but from access to the valuable resource . 
  rather , the public is resource competitors for the wealth there . 
  that creates a feedback loop , where you do n't have an incentive to spend money on the public , and * do * have an incentive to guarantee a large portion of the wealth obtained to people who secure your position ( internal security services , whatever ) . 
  almost everything on [ russia 's export treemap ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:russia_export_treemap.png ) is that resource extraction . 
  if someone else shows up in power , their incentives are , well , similar . 
  so there 's pressure to do the same thing . 
  the really crummy thing is that russia * does * have an educated population , and presumably could support similar exports to other developed countries , where the citizens of the country are the valuable resource that you care about extracting money from . 
  but in order for that to work , you have to be functioning well enough to support the growth of those businesses and ward off corruption from wiping out business . 
  once business producing high-skill-required products for export dominates , the incentives of the leadership also changes . 
  well , alex jones is a major us conspiracy theorist and one of trump 's major supporters . 
  i seem to vaguely recall that he was off talking about how trump was going to defeat all these perfidious conspiracies . 
  having russian gas does n't inherently produce natural gas dependence on russia . 
  as long as you 've the ability to transition to alternate soures of gas ( stockpiling , other sources via pipeline , lng shipping , alternate energy sources , reducing consumption ) if your source is cut off , there 's no harm -- the worst that can happen is that prices rise to whoever the next-lowest seller is , which would happen anyway if not doing business with russia . 
  what produces dependence is not having a way to access an alternate source of gas . 
  the political implications for ukraine and the rest of eastern europe are another issue -- this would permit russia the option of cutting off natural gas to countries in eastern europe without cutting off germany . 
  it also permits the transit fees to ukraine to be cut off -- looks like that is several percent of ukraine 's gdp . 
  obviously , that 's kind of unsettling from ukraine 's standpoint . 
   however , political groups were much quieter about why the current system was designed this way . 
    what is not being said , is that the confusion faced by consumers over the past few years has been created entirely by the eu institutions themselves . 
  i do n't even know what to say to that . 
  if you introduce * any * revision to improve a system that you 're responsible for , * obviously * the old system is something that you 're responsible for . 
  who exactly else * would * have introduced the old system ?
