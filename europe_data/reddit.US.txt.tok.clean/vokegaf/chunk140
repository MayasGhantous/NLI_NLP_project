  somehow madagascar sends a secret agent in and slips a new classification scheme into the thing ? 
  i mean , the article is treating this as if it 's some unveiling of a hidden , secret error , and ... i do n't see how it could be . 
  i wish i knew what the deal is with leaders promoting conspiracy theory . 
  there must be some really sensible political rationale behind it , because it sure does seem to be popular , but ... 
  oh , it was n't serious -- apparently some people must have commented on it . 
  i came in and saw a self-post titled something like `` things that will not happen '' , with `` the queen stepping in '' as one of them , and then a ( serious ) comment below about how someone * did * think that the queen should step in . 
  it was n't a large , detailed , or serious debate or anything . 
  i 'm just saying that it 's a pretty radical shift for eight weeks .

  `` sunland '' ? 
  you can do that in the us , and nobody can be arsed to to it . 
  about the closest thing i can think of is the [ free state project ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_state_project ) , where a lot of people disgruntled that * their * state in the us was n't sufficiently-libertarian decided to all move to new hampshire to get a nice libertarian environment to live in . 
  mormons also moved * en masse * to utah , though before it was a state , to live in an environment that they controlled .

  nice try , bavaria . 
  we know about the leiderhosen . 
  i recommend getting some highly-educated , wealthy muslims . 
  i 'm less concerned about dugin developing ideas himself and more that he 's echoing the ideas of others . 
  very awkward if he wins next time . 
  low volume . 
  with media that has mass appeal , you can spread the cost over more readers . 
  well , it 's important in negotiation to establish that you 're * willing * to turn down offers . 
  i doubt that davis is doing that here , because the uk and the eu can do that privately in negotiations . 
  instead , i bet that he 's demonstrating to people who are worried that the uk 's representatives wo n't `` stand up '' for the country by being willing to turn down offers . 
  domestic politics . 
  kinda like how barnier was `` threatening to prolong negotiations '' -- hardly a threat , just the veneer of politics on top of the actual negotiations . 
   do they think that will prevent them to pay the 60 billions bill just like that ? 
  well , they can certainly not pay anything . 
  the question is whether doing so makes sense in terms of the costs to the uk . 
  my own uninformed bet is that the uk wo n't pay 60b eur and wo n't pay 0 eur , but will probably wind up paying something somewhere in between .

  okay . 
  how do journals fund themselves without being able to charge fees to read papers ? 
  yeah , eight weeks ago , that 's what the british were saying about their general election . 
  now / r/ukpolitics has people talking about the viability of the queen stepping in . 
  well , the us first amendment does n't , as it 's a set of limitations on government . 
  but it 'd be possible , in some country , to pass a positive right that would cover a different scope and also affect private comanies : free speech is n't intrinsicly limited to negative rights . 
  it 's just that in us constitutional law , negative rights are the norm . 
  straitjacket, 
   we do n't technically have blasphemy laws weeeellll ... in northern ireland and maybe scotland ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law_in_the_united_kingdom, 
  just to be clear , the desecration of the koran is prohibited in islam . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quran_desecration nobody in judiaism or christianity cares , because judaism and christianity do n't restrict what you do with a torah or bible . 
  the painting bit is due to [ moral rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_rights ) , which are an oddball form of intellectual property rights bigger in europe than over here -- we 've got a very minimal set of those guarantees , but they do exist . 
  hmm . 
  i think that that brush may be too broad . 
  there have been a number of efforts that failed that were considered modern and progressive in their time . 
  among others : * prohibition of alcohol * use of eugenics * communism `` progressivism '' refers to a broad and ever-changing set of ideals . 
  noting in this quote indicates that the goal of the bombing was to hit civilian targets . 
  it simply indicates that nato is * aware * that that will inherently be civilian casualties as a result of making the decision to bomb and accepting that there will be collateral damage . 
  that 's just fine wrt international law . 
  https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-04-21/finland-likely-to-quit-euro-in-coming-decades-lawmaker-says  helsinki ( reuters ) - finland 's exit from the euro zone is possible and even likely in the future , euroskeptic lawmaker sampo terho , the frontrunner in a race to lead the co-ruling finns party , said on friday . 
  -  terho is considered the most popular candidate for the party leadership , trailed by halla-aho . 
  a poll for finnish broadcaster mtv released this wednesday showed support for terho among party activists at 60 percent , compared with 22 percent for halla-aho . 
    he has generally taken more moderate positions than halla-aho , a member of european parliament who has said bluntly he would take finland out of the euro zone and the european union . 
  http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/politics/14814-government-s-future-in-doubt-after-halla-aho-takes-reins-of-finns-party.html  jussi halla-aho , who is known for his hard-line views and outspoken comments on immigration and multiculturalism , was elected as the chairperson of the populist party by an absolute majority in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 on saturday . 
  so , if i understand correctly , the guy who said that he would take finland out of the eu rather than the more-moderate guy who just wants to take finland out of the eurozone just came to control of the party , and so the other parties are breaking up the coalition ? 
   why are you publicly burning books ? 
    sure , it should be your right to do it . 
  but why would you ? 
  why would i do it , were i going to do so ? 
  because i object to the prospect of people trying to suppress criticism of a religion via violence . 
  if you 've got people trying to kill people who criticize their religion , then i 'll happily add to the crowd criticizing that religion . 
  i 'm not going to go out and draw cartoons of , i dunno , buddha , because the buddhists are n't out attacking people who portray buddha negatively , so there 's no point . 
  ah , okay , had n't seen the parent comment and realized that your goal was to draw a distinction between hate speech and blasphemy . 
  well , * you * may assert that the aim of nato bombing was to hit civilian population rather than to achieve military goals , but i do n't agree , and i do n't find claims along those lines to be particularly credible . 
  there is no restriction on the eu not to state what the eu would do in a given situation . 
  here 's barroso doing exactly this wrt scotland : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20664907  `` for european union purposes , from a legal point of view , it is certainly a new state . 
  if a country becomes independent it is a new state and has to negotiate with the eu . '', 
  now , if you think that catalonia is different than scotland and has special status , then why not go get the eu to make an official pronouncement on the idea that it would get automatic eu membership ? 
  secondly , in catalonia 's position , you 're asserting that the eu would recognize a catalonian unilateral declaration of independence from an eu member state -- barroso was talking about a bilaterally-agreed-upon separation for scotland . 
  so why not get the eu to make a statement on whether it would recognize catalonia 's unilateral separation if catalonia made such a declaration ? 
  after all , you 're gambling quite a bit on the eu doing that . 
  and how about a third question -- if the eu recognized a unilateral declaration , and catalonia received no automatic eu membership , would the eu be willing to accept catalonia as a member even via the regular process , given that spain is objecting ? 
  i 'm going to be blunt . 
  i think that the answer to all three questions is `` no '' : * no , the eu would not automatically grant eu membership to a secessionist portion of a member state . 
  * no , the eu would not recognize the independence of a secessionist portion of a member state following a unilateral declaration of independence . 
  * no , the eu would not permit a secessionist portion of a member state eu to start membership proceedings , even if it hypothetically did recognize independence , due to spain objecting . 
  and not only do i think that the answer to all those questions is `` no '' , but i personally am really not very sympathetic to either scottish or catalonian independence efforts . 
  in both cases , the surge of efforts followed a spat over resources that do not seem profoundly unjust to me : * scotland 's interest kicked up after oil was discovered in british waters that would become scottish waters if scotland left the uk . 
  * catalonian interest kicked up over a dispute over the relative apportionment of taxes a decade back . 
  fom what little i 've read , i am sympathetic to catalonia on wrt the tax issue -- that is , i think that it 's entirely reasonable for catalonia to ask that catalonia 's relative tax burden in spain be reduced . 
  but i do not think that it warrants an independence dispute . 
  the precedent of granting independence to either on those grounds and then eu membership would create a monumental clusterfuck in the eu . 
  if either of those two go independent , now every wealthy region or region with rich natural resources in the eu goes out and says `` yeah ... * i 'm * a unique people , and * i * need independence so that i do n't have to fund poorer areas in my country '' . 
  [ london insists that it needs independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_independence ) , and so forth . 
  oh , and the other one is representation at the european council . 
  leave and get your own vote !, 
  who does n't want their own ec vote ? 
  neither of those areas are large enough to want to `` go it alone '' , but since the countries that they are part of are eu members , suddenly the idea of simply adjusting some borders , relying on the eu to be the `` country '' , and getting a larger share of resources looks pretty good . 
  because that 's an incredibly problematic sort of precedent to set , the us does n't support efforts by states to split . 
  i would be very surprised if the eu adopts such an approach either . 
  it 's wikipedia citing a primary source . 
   question : is a market and a hospital a military objective ?
