  neither a market nor a hospital is intrinsically a military objective simply by virtue of being a market or a hospital . 
  you could not say `` that was a market , so it 's okay to be bombed '' , or `` that is a hospital , so it 's okay to be bombed '' . 
  however : * they are not `` safe '' places guaranteed not to be hit . 
  if an area is being bombed and a hospital is located near to a command center and a bomb intending to flatten a command center also wipes out the hospital , that 's fine . 
  * they are not immune to incorrect identification . 
  if a hospital is mis-identified as a bunker and hit , that 's fine . 
  * they can become military objectives depending on how they are used . 
  if soldiers decide to use a hospital as shelter , and it is bombed , that 's fine . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distinction_%28law%29 nope -- your understanding is incorrect . 
  there 's no guarantee that civilians or civilian infrastructure not suffer in war . 
  you do n't get to attack civilians for the sake of hitting civilians . 
  however , there is absolutely no expectation that civilians not be killed or harmed in a conflict . 
   but why did n't you answer my question about 9/11 ? 
  because i think that it 's pretty obvious but i 'll be explicit if you want : yes , 9/11 was a terrorist attack . 
   eu ca n't get relations with internal regions of an eu state ( catalonia in this case ) . 
  the eu does n't require diplomatic relations to issue a statement on something . 
   if you really think civilian collateral damage is ok , yes , i do . 
  specifically hitting civilians for the sake of hitting civilians is not , but that 's not what i posted . 
   burn any bibles < checks to see what he was charged with  unlawful symbol burning . 
  no follow up . 
  this wo n't have gone to court . 
  way back when , the kkk used to burn crosses on the lawns of black people to tell them that unless they got out of town , they were going to be victimized . 
  that was a threat , and some states passed a law against doing this . 
  the burning must be a threat for such a law to be constitutional . 
  the first amendment does not render true threats protected free speech -- just as how sending spoken or written death threats to people is not protected , so is taking a wordless action that tells someone that you 're going to kill them . 
  i 'd also add that it was not a criticism of religion -- the kkk was protestant and saw a flaming cross as a positive symbol , not a way to indicate that there was something objectionable about christianity . 
  in this case , the charge will have been dropped and the guy released . 
  the guy was burning a bible , but it clearly was not threatening the members of the church and does not meet the criteria of the unlawful symbol burning law . 
  he might have been trespassing , but i doubt that there 's anything in his speech that you can go after . 
  maybe you can charge him with public urination . 
   obscene from your link :  as used , however , the test generally makes it difficult to outlaw any form of expression . 
  they 've also been narrowed over time . 
  there 's a long list precisely because every nook and cranny there has been fought over . 
   i am not sure what to think about this koran burning though . 
  it is a little on the extreme side , if you ask me . 
  certainly there are other ways to express your distaste for a particular religion . 
  i do n't particularly give a damn about islam 's content , but i sure as hell object to any religion that feels that it can restrict public criticism of that religion . 
  part of living in a world in which the public is expected to evaluate things is permitting them to do so , * even if it involves people possibly saying things that you do n't agree with * . 
   garland texas not a very successful attack , given that both of the perpetrators were gunned down after having wounded a security guard in the leg . 
   even though there are cultural differences between anglos and latinos the cultural jump is not that big .

  searching for [ `` burning koran '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=burning koran ) on youtube turns up about 51,000 videos , many of which appear to be americans happily burning korans . 
  i suppose that it 'd be possible to use some sort of rough filter to try to block germans from viewing them and similar content spread across the internet , but at the end of the day , i think that it 's probably not very practically enforceable . 
  [ danish man who videoed himself burning the quran charged with blasphemy ] ( https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-man-burned-quran-koran-video-blasphemy-facebook-islam-prosecuted-charged-46-years-a7594796.html ) : case is first time danish prosecutors have charged anyone with blasphemy in 46 years  a danish man who posed a video of himself setting fire to the quran on facebook has been charged with blasphemy in the first such prosecution for 46 years . 
    the 42-year-old suspect put the clip , entitled `` consider your neighbour : it stinks when it burns '' to a group called `` yes to freedom -- no to islam '' in december 2015 . 
    jan reckendorff , from the public prosecutor 's office in viborg , said : `` it is the prosecution 's view that circumstances involving the burning of holy books such as the bible and the quran can in some cases be a violation of the blasphemy clause , which covers public scorn or mockery of religion . 
    `` it is our opinion that the circumstances of this case mean it should be prosecuted so the courts now have an opportunity to take a position on the matter . '', 
  `` hate speech '' , like terms over here that have legal meaning , will have defined more-rigorously in the eu than the common-use sense of the word via case law . 
  that being said , i was just paging through this document , written by some high muckety-muck lawyer involved with crafting eu rights : [ hate speech : a comparison between the european court of human rights and the united states supreme court jurisprudence ] ( https://www.regent.edu/acad/schlaw/student_life/studentorgs/lawreview/docs/issues/v25n1/04kiskavol.25.1.pdf ) :  `` hate speech '' seems to be whatever people choose it to mean . 
  it lacks any objective criteria whatsoever . 
  a recent factsheet of the echr admits that `` [ t ] here is no universally accepted definition of ... ` hate speech . ''' similarly , a previous factsheet observed that `` [ t ] he identification of expressions ... [ of ] ` hate speech ' is sometimes difficult because this kind of speech does not necessarily manifest itself through the expression of hatred or of emotions . 
  it can also be concealed in statements which at a first glance may seem to be rational or normal . ''   the purpose of the factsheet is to simplify for the general public the meaning of the legal concept behind `` hate speech . '' instead , the factsheet defines `` hate speech '' as : ( 1 ) without definition , ( 2 ) difficult to identify , and ( 3 ) speech that can sometimes appear rational and normal . 
  as will be discussed below , the echr , which uses legal certainty as a keystone in its interpretation of the legitimacy of interferences with convention rights , upholds vague `` hate speech '' laws criminalizing certain forms of expression . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech_laws_in_the_united_kingdom it looks like the [ relevant bit is this ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/contents ) , part 18 . 
  part 29b would probably be more-appropriate , since it deals with religious hatred , but it 's limited to * threatening * actions , and this is clearly not threatening , so they have to go with racial hatred . 
   ( 1 ) a person who uses threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour , or displays any written material which is threatening , abusive or insulting , is guilty of an offence if --   ( a ) he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred , or   ( b ) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby . 
  oh , good , so now we have * two * groups of drunk idiots being drunk idiots and have introduced violence into the equation .

  i mean , i agree -- it will cause a reduction in unemployment , and an overall increase in wages for people who remain . 
  but it does leave the issue of keeping pensions funded : people who are abroad also are n't funding ukraine 's pension system : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pensions_in_ukraine  the amount paid to retirees is 70 % of her/his previous salary . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] the average pension in ukraine is $ 53.78 ( in june 2015 ) . 
  [ 2 ] pensions can as high as $ 68.75 per month are also common ( in december 2014 ) . 
  [ 4 ] -  the current pension system is hampered by an over representation of pensioners in the population ; thus there are not enough working citizens contributing for each pensioner . 
  [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] in 2013 the ukrainian government spend 17.2 % of ukraine 's gdp on public pensions , one of the highest shares in europe and the world . 
  [ 11 ] in ukraine 's case , simply increasing the productivity of workers may help a lot , but currently there 's no unified eu pension system , so the state where someone is working receives any funds , not the state that is obligated to pay for the worker 's parents ' pension . 
  anyway , do n't want to be a downer ... it 's a question for down the road . 
  congrats all on the visa-free status !, 
  it 's not just people leaving over past years , though , yeah , that 's big . 
  ukraine 's got a [ tfr of ~ 1.3 ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=up&amp;v=31 ) , which is [ slightly below portugal ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:total_fertility_rate,_1960%e2%80%932015_%28live_births_per_woman%29_yb17.png ) , which currently has the lowest tfr in the eu-28 . 
  if anything , it 's ukraine that would need people from elsewhere in europe to fill ukraine 's demographic hole . 
   seriously dude , if you have nothing of real value you can not effectively trade with other nations , because your currency will devalue until you can not import raw materials , and food will become more expensive . 
  sure , if you have nothing of real value , the equilibrium will result in imports stopping . 
  but ( a ) it buys you nothing to simply induce that state artificially , which is what you 're proposing and ( b ) the united states exports about $ 2 trillion/year , which relies on exporting things of real value . 
  it happens to import more than that at the moment , but there 's nothing `` wrong '' with that . 
   you ca n't farm your own mind you , because gluts will be fed into your market ruining local farmers , while they are unable to import the seeds , and chemical products needed to farm effectively . 
  if you ever reached the point where farmers could n't import seeds -- which is quite unlikely , but let 's imagine it -- then wages would need to be very low , which would make domestic seed production increasingly-viable . 
   this even affects nations like india in which local companies die without protectionism in * any * country , companies die without protectionism . 
  if i protect industry a , this simply transfers wealth from all * other * industries in my country to industry a. 
  if i remove the protections afforded to a , then companies in industry a will most-certainly die . 
  but , because i 'm not bleeding off the other industries , it means that other companies will show up or grow where they would not have been able to do so before . 
   and the only ones who can do business are foreign enterprises who do n't have to use their silly currency to exploit the work force floating currencies do n't `` exploit '' the workforce . 
  if you want to be paid in some foreign currency , if workers valued that , then companies could do that . 
  what it means is that their pay will fluctuate wildly relative to the costs that they pay , so they may not be able to meet their rent or mortgage payment , then may suddenly make much more money the next day . 
  my guess is that folks in europe probably run into this more than over here in the states , but i know that some people in europe did things like take out mortgages in foreign currencies in the mid-2000s housing boom that they expected to pay in their wages , which were in the local currency . 
  great until the relative values of the currency change and they ca n't meet their mortgage payment . 
  there 's also nothing special about a foreign enterprise that would require or permit it to use foreign currency . 
  if you 're a company in the us , you can certainly store assets in rubles or whatever you want . 
    the reason china wound up falling well behind was because of intentional isolation from the rest of the world . 
    no they ended up falling behind , because they were so much better than everyone else that they did n't need to adapt . 
  that was certainly the schtick that chinese leadership sold the concept on . 
   case , and point the usa . 
  the only place that is really advancing in any way is california ( technologically at least ) , um . 
  california has a couple of important industries , but there are plenty of other places that do technology work . 
  biotech 's mostly an east coast thing . 
   ... but that 's more down to the insane property prices than voluntarism . 
  also no . 
  how do you even get `` property prices produces technological advancement '' ? 
   this leads to an export deficit , if there is free trade trade leads to long-term equilibrium . 
  you do n't need to actively manage it .
