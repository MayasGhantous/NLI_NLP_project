  the rationale for merkel would have been getting past a `` hump '' of discontent and maintaining the eu 's integrity . 
  in the eu 's shoes , i would have made an offer then , the key part being expiration . 
  crummy precedent , yeah , but the breakup is imho worse . 
  but offering single market membership * now * does n't avoid the uk breaking out of the eu . 
  that is , the eu would n't get the main thing that it wanted back during merkel-cameron when it did n't offer to limit freedom of movement . 
  it would set an even worse precedent -- now not only can labor organizations in wealthy members lobby for restrictions on their competition from other countries but members can leave and * then * get those restrictions . 
  that 's a terrible incentive to create . 
  so ... i do not think that the eu will offer the single market without freedom of movement now . 
  that is probably not the thought process the british public went through . 
  many had promises that conflicted with what i wrote above . 
  many probably thought that they could just negotiate a bit harder and * that * would give them the economic benefits they wanted without the bits that were pissing off workers who wanted protectionist labor policy . 
  however , i do think that that 's probably the inexorable mechanism that 's been set in motion now . 
  the british public has not , thus far , shifted its position on brexit . 
  i think that a shift among the british public here and a willingness to do a second referendum on brexit ( unlikely , given current numbers ) is the only viable way for the uk to remain a member of the single market . 
  the uk 's political parties are chained to the referendum on the wheel of brexit . 
  they can not afford to cancel brexit , because they would go against a referendum , which would be very politically-unpopular . 
  i further think that they can not afford to reverse on freedom of movement , as it would go against what * many * people wanted . 
  if any one of the big two parties agreed to that , it would become politically-vulnerable . 
  maybe a labour-conservative coalition , so that both parties are complicit and neither can claim innocence , if both wanted to survive the ensuing resurgence of euroskeptic parties . 
  the eu has drawn a red line on extending single market membership without freedom of movement . 
  it is chained to that policy -- while i could * possibly * have imagined it being violated for a limited period of time back during the merkel-cameron negotiations to `` preserve the union '' , i have a hard time believing it would be sacrificed now , when the eu will wind up with the uk out anyway . 
  once those dominoes have fallen , the uk winds up outside of the single market . 
  nothing is enforceable . 
  the real disincentive the eu has to discourage the uk from just terminating payments into programs is not the courtroom , but that the eu and the uk might not wind up with a trade relationship that the uk wants . 
   if the offer from the eu is `` give us x or else we wo n't consider negotiating an fta '' , then no deal very much is preferable . 
  well , yes . 
  what i mean is that i am confident that there is room for a mutually-advantageous agreement between the two . 
  assuming that both parties act competently , i would expect the two to arrive at some form of deal in which both are better off than wto rules . 
  obviously , there are terms that neither party will accept , but neither party * wants * to offer terms that the other side wo n't accept . 
  well , in this context , the guy is n't involved in terrorism , so the assassin . 
   a shot hit mr. osmayev on the right side of his chest . 
  but he was not immediately incapacitated and struggled with the shooter for control of the gun . 
  ms. okuyeva , however , long fearful of assassination attempts , was carrying a pistol under her coat , as well as a tube of the blood-clotting agent celox in her purse . 
  she shot mr. denisultanov-kurmakayev four times as he and her husband fought . 
  both were gravely wounded but survived . 
  kinda supports the `` the only solution for bad guys with guns is good guys with guns '' argument . 
  improving our own birthrates it 's possible . 
  are political parties offering up viable plans to do that ? 
  and is there political support for what it will cost ? 
  i mean , there have been many years of low birth rates now , and countries have not taken action over all that time . 
   instead of relying on constant unsustainable growth i think that it 's possible to function with a steady-state population , or a slightly-shrinking or slightly-growing one . 
  however , at current tfr rates , each of spain 's generations is under two-thirds the size of the previous . 
  that 's a huge gap to fill . 
   as even teamed up with the dup there is just a majority of 2 . 
  / r/ukpolitics points out that by-elections also happen , so this majority could go away within the next five years , even if it remains rock-solid in unity . 
   even the conservatives will find it hard to justify working with a lot of the dup 's policies , there will be disagreements and in-fighting from the moderate sides of the conservatives if they do enact some of the dup 's policies . 
  both sides have a strong incentive not to break the coalition , though . 
  if i were the dup and i believe that promoting something would break the coalition , it would n't make sense for me to do it . 
  eh ... i mean : * it was clearly possible to let people read their desired brexit scenario into brexit . 
  that makes it politically a good idea for him * not * to provide specifics -- he can `` promise different things to different people '' without actually saying anything . 
  * he was never very likely to be setting the details anyway . 
  the only thing that would have done is to have potentially created friction with , say , the conservatives or labour with their * own * plans . 
  * nobody would be able to guarantee that their promises go through , since they do n't know for sure who winds up negotiating . 
  hell , we still do n't know who will be , thanks to this election . 
  * some of any plan will depend upon what the eu is willing to do . 
  exposing what the uk would be willing to settle for probably is n't an option . 
  if he says `` this is what we * hope * to get '' , he 's ( a ) making unrealistic promises , and ( b ) setting things up for political failure . 
  if he says `` this is what we actually believe we can get '' * and * it was in line with what the british bureaucracy believes , he 's exposing negotiating information . 
  third parties are free to offer their own analysis , which is what they did . 
  basically , all he can promise is what the uk can unilaterally do -- initiate article 50 . 
   strange he brought up california , they have a grassroots indy movement going on there as well . 
  not exactly grassroots . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yes_california  the campaign president is louis j. marinelli , a new yorker who lives in russia [ 10 ] and has received significant assistance from the russian government to promote his efforts . 
  [ 11 ] the vice president is marcus ruiz evans . 
  [ 12 ] both men are former republicans [ 13 ] and marinelli says he voted for donald trump . 
  [ 10 ]   marinelli announced on december 18 , 2016 , the yes california campaign had opened an `` embassy '' in moscow as a cultural centre to help educate russians about california 's history , boost trade , and promote tourism . 
  the `` embassy '' has no legal standing . 
  [ 14 ] the moscow office was partially funded by a kremlin-backed charity linked to russian president vladimir putin , while the anti-globalization movement of russia provided the office space rent-free . 
  [ 15 ] [ 16 ] does not have public support . 
  this is `` russia funds movement so that they can say that there is a secessionist movement in the us '' . 
  i 've been saying that an extension makes sense for the eu . 
  * it gets the uk to effectively `` pay in '' for another year , which effectively resolves some of the dispute over the `` brexit bill '' in the eu 's favor . 
  * it 's not to the eu 's advantage to have the uk unable to negotiate because someone might jam a monkey wrench in at any moment . 
  just like canada and ceta . 
  * the eu does n't benefit if the government is liable to be swapped out halfway through the negotiations and wipes the negotiations that have been done . 
  well , it depends upon the form of brexit-lite . 
  from softest to hardest : | description | name | politically viable | | - | - | - | | retain eu membership | | not politically-viable on the uk 's end . 
  requires ignoring a referendum , and there is n't currently public support for a second referendum to reverse the first . | | drop eu membership , have custom deal that retains everything . | | probably not politically-viable on the uk 's end . 
  while it might technically fit the referendum , many voters want freedom of movement to end , and this would not permit that . | | eea membership | norway option | probabably not viable in the uk . 
  requires freedom of movement . | | custom opt-in-eea-alike | switzerland option | probably not viable in the uk . 
  requires freedom of movement . | | customs union membership | turkey option | probably viable . 
  would piss off some people who do n't like the eu setting rules . | | free trade agreement | | viable . | | wto rules | `` no deal '' | viable in that this is the default , and it 's probably possible to `` crash out '' | while customs union membership is politically viable and does n't violate anyone 's red lines , afaik , i think that turkey 's arrangement is * very * unfavorable to turkey . 
  they have no input on the customs union . 
  they are not allowed to sign ftas with other countries . 
  the eu may choose to or not to include them in eu ftas ( with ttip , they were excluded ) . 
  imho , this sort of unequal relationship is only really a reasonable idea as a temporary transition to something else . 
  for turkey , my guess is that the aim was to transition to eu membership . 
  if that is clearly off the table , my assumption is that they will ultimately want to renegotiate this . 
  i do not think that the uk would accept that long-term -- it does n't provide enough of a benefit over an fta with the eu to warrant the drawbacks . 
  however , let 's say that the uk can negotiate an arrangement where it 's a full member in customs union decisions . 
  the specific form the turkey arrangement takes also excludes services , which means that it only deals with tariffs on goods . 
  that 's probably a lot-less interesting to the uk . 
  afaik , nobody has drawn any red lines on the eu side prohibiting the uk from obtaining the right to provide services , and i 'd assume that the uk would want that . 
  the eu would not be willing to provide the uk with input on regulatory decisions , but then , only businesses in the uk that actually exported to the eu would need to follow any product requirements , and only on those products . 
  if the form of such an option takes the one that turkey has , my guess is that this would place the uk in a weak position as to setting rules that are critical for its own economy . 
  i do not think that the uk would accept this . 
  it 's not impossible that the eu would let the uk have full partnership in crafting ftas and setting the customs union tariff schedule . 
  this is similar to the turkey option , but does n't have the unequal characteristics of the turkey deal . 
  in that scenario , the uk might or might not be able to provide financial services to the eu and would need to accept tariff schedules that probably are not ideal for it , but would benefit from the eu in negotiating size . 
  the uk would give up the ability to sign ftas with others .
