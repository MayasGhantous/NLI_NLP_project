   due to the uk 's rules on bringing back a non-eu wife not an answer to your question , but what are those ? 
  it does not entail a commitment to go to war . 
  this sounded kinda cringeworthy to me . 
  i 've talked about the prospects of a `` second referendum '' or similar with others on here , but it does n't sound like the article author was really interested in exploring the prospects of a reversal . 
  instead , it seemed more to be interested in dominance/submission , luxuriating in the prospect of being * crawled * to . 
  that 's pretty disappointing for a media source that we regularly reference on here . 
  i mean , technically the same is true of eu mutual aid , or even a country defending part of itself . 
  this is n't a very high bar for success , but i 'll take it . 
  i 'd expect that they can advise him on what 's important , but that he can have his speechwriters do whatever he wants . 
  i 'll see your conservative dup members and raise you : * [ amish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amish ) : `` the world stopped in the 1700s '' * [ quiverfull ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quiverfull ) : `` god wants us to have as many babies as possible '' * conservative colleges like [ pensacola christian college ] ( http://www.pensapedia.com/wiki/pensacola_christian_college ) : '' in the absence of being able to have physical contact , a fad has developed among dating students on campus where couples stare deeply into each other 's eyes . 
  this practice by students is variously called `` eye kissing '' , or `` optical intercourse '' and is jokingly called `` making eye babies . 
  '' [ 8 ] this activity however is discouraged by the administration . '', 
  * [ the seventh-day adventists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seventh-day_adventist_church ) : `` yes , the world literally was made a few thousand years ago , in six days . '', 
  you can neutralize pretty much anything you do n't like in the bible by saying `` well ... that was just intended to be read * allegorically * '' . 
   in christian doctrine , all sexual actions committed without the express purpose of procreation are bad . 
  hmm . 
  there are probably interpretations that do take that position , but that is definitely not a majority view across modern christian denominations . 
  even the roman catholic church permits the rhythm method of control . 
  200k * registered * arrivals , maybe ? 
  i thought that there was a cia conspiracy in the list too . 
  eu , you know his you 've been giving turkey a lot of shit ? 
  yeah . 
  it would mean that somewhere , someone with a plan is in control ... 
  the new testament too : romans 1:26 -- 27 :  because of this , god gave them over to shameful lusts . 
  even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones . 
  in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . 
  men committed shameful acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their error . 
   nope , they do n't want the roi to join the uk , but they also do n't want a border because it will wreck ni 's economy , specifically agriculture . 
  a lot of their supporters are in the agricultural industry . 
  but ... the uk is a net food importer , and the roi is a net food exporter . 
  hell , if you had self-interested farmers in the uk , i 'd think they 'd want to wall off the outside world as much as possible and extract money from the people inside . 
   they want to leave the eu because they do n't like foreigners . 
  fair enough . 
   they 'll also never accept the alternative which is border controls between ni and the rest of the uk . 
  they view ni as being every bit as british as the rest of the uk and wo n't accept a `` 2-tier '' uk . 
  yeah , that i can understand : it 'd be a move towards ni secession . 
  that leaves two options , as i see it , that do n't violate stated red lines : * the eu leaves no borders in ireland , maybe spot checks or something . 
  probably gon na be some level of smuggling . 
  great for the roi , and apparently the dup like it . 
  the uk probably is okay with it . 
  the one to complain would be other eu members . 
  * the uk remains in the customs union ( but not single market ) . 
  this is like turkey . 
  great for the eu , pretty crummy economically for the uk . 
  otherwise , someone has to give up on something , like roi accepting hard borders , the uk accepting no brexit , or the uk accepting freedom of movement . 
  well , you do n't have it after eating it . 
  not intact , at any rate . 
  what would you have had her do ? 
  sh ca n't really coalition with anyone else . 
  that 's kinda my take too -- as a long term option , soft brexit seems really unstable . 
  though the uk * could * use it as a transitional period , intending to ultimately leave . 
  i think that eea and similar status is intended as a lobby for countries that are n't totally ready to commit , to ease integration ... but it could go the other way too . 
  also , it might buy time for the eu to re-sell the uk on eu membership . 
  eh , at least they show up , unlike sf . 
  the uk leadership shows no signs of doing anything illegal . 
  besides , they have a vote of no confidence available . 
  if they do n't want a border and do n't want to be in the eu , are they trying to get the roi to rejoin the uk or something ? 
  that says the padlocking ended in 1965 . 
  the bible does n't have any problem with cousins marrying . 
  the bible [ does have restrictions on some forms of incest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incest_in_the_bible ) . 
  atheism is correlated with a drop in fertility . 
  [ why people with no religion are projected to decline as a share of the world 's population ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/why-people-with-no-religion-are-projected-to-decline-as-a-share-of-the-worlds-population/ )  despite this , in coming decades , the global share of religiously unaffiliated people is actually expected to fall , according to pew research center 's new study on the future of world religions . 
  -  this relative decline is largely attributable to the fact that religious `` nones '' are , on average , older and have fewer children than people who are affiliated with a religion . 
  in 2015 , for instance , the median age of people who belong to any of the world 's religions was 29 , compared with 36 among the unaffiliated . 
  and between 2010 and 2015 , adherents of religions are estimated to have given birth to an average of 2.45 children per woman , compared with an average of 1.65 children among the unaffiliated . 
  sounds like some good old southern baptists !, 
  eh , i doubt that there 's gon na be a huge effect on the uk as a whole . 
  does n't sound like their concern is shifting things outside of ni . 
  the bible does n't condemn pedopholia . 
  it does condemn homosexuality . 
   but have to pay 2-3x more in usa . 
  not that much . 
  https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm  france : 0.796 1/0 .796 = 26 % more in the us . 
   objectives for the forthcoming brexit negotiations included maintaining the common travel area with the republic and ease of trade throughout the eu . 
  cta seems like a no-brainer for the relevant parties . 
  ca n't be an issue . 
  `` ease of trade throughout the eu '' seems too vague to make a call on . 
  single market ? 
  i do n't think that the eu or the uk are gon na give in on attaching freedom of movement to the single market . 
  eu-uk free trade agreement ? 
  sure , everyone wants that . 
   the dup campaigned for brexit but its manifesto argued for maintaining a `` seamless and frictionless '' border with ireland . 
  well , that 's gon na make it even harder for the eu to impose customs barriers entering the eu . 
  ni is essential on the uk side , and the roi has a veto in the eu . 
  the eu could give in and risk smuggling . 
  maybe the uk could be pressed to give in and stay in the customs union -- that 'd break a lot of promises from davis , and i think that it 's long-term unstable , but the eu would be delighted and it 'd mean no need for customs borders . 
   < social conservativism in ni  seems pretty easy to give in on . 
  dunno how the dup could get promises that would last longer than the coalition , though . 
   the cost per unit is higher than the f-35 , a fifth generation multi role stealth fighter , where as the eurofighter is a 4th generation fighter/interceptor . 
  what 's the volume on each ? 
   my question was aimed at the french state 's habit of demanding the lion 's share of workload from multinational projects , extracting know-how and then walking off in a pretend-huff to do its own thing ( think boxer and vcbi ) . 
  hmm . 
  on the franco-anglo carrier collaboration , was n't it the brits that left ? 
  i dunno what the story is with aircraft , but is it the french state at fault or particular companies/collaborations ? 
  because it seems implausible to me that the french state would intentionally arrange for collaborations to fail . 
  they 've got a reputation as a partner to maintain . 
  i do agree with the idea of making munitions interoperable where possible . 
  obviously , in some cases , maybe interoperability might give up someone 's clever secret ( e.g. 
  a computer on an aircraft offloading a description of a ship many miles away that an anti-shipping missile needs to target to the missile ) , since it 's not all dumb bombs . 
  but physically-compatible basepoints and electrical guaranteea and data connectors does n't seem unreasonable .
