  i want competetion . 
  i do n't want one social network . 
  a few years back , it would have been myspace . 
  if there is a single thing that i would intensely oppose , it would be centralization of the internet . 
  no state , no authority gets special status . 
  you want to build a centralized network , go try to make an internet competitor . 
  it will fail , outcompeted by the internet . 
  do you feel that the snp would be interested in being a regional party in the uk , aiming at dealing with concerns that are common in scotland , or is an independence agenda necessary for them to exist ? 
  is the dup unpredictable ? 
  i 'd think that their goals are probably pretty straightforward -- they 're gon na want policy to ensure that northern ireland does n't become part of the roi any time in the near future . 
  i 'd have no idea what a grand coalition might do , or a lib-con coalition , or what snp would want in a coalition ( given that indyref2 was just rejected in scotland ) . 
  is n't this more predictable in overall goal ? 
   i believe we should do our best to just have stable , respectful relationships with them based on sincerity , frankness and trust . 
  me too , which is why i think that russia should end the occupation of ukraine . 
  i do n't feel that the lack of sincerity has been from the west . 
  no , what i mean is that each member country has people who decide who to work with , what is vital and is n't , and all that . 
  you need to know how you 're going to act towards the outside world to know what to purchase for your military . 
  for example , corbyn wants some sort of power-sharing scheme or something with argentina . 
  he might have no interest in aircraft carriers , if he plans to give up british islands . 
  deciding whether to buy and train people on naval cruise missiles or on fixed , long-range surface-to-air missiles depends on who you expect to need to be dealing with and where . 
  it 's not the lack of obligation to work together , but the lack of a unified * goal * , to have people pulling together . 
  well , * i * was ... 
  flair text checks out . 
  depends on location . 
  the federal government does n't make the call on this . 
   u.s. libertarian party being kooky , c'mon , russell means passed on ... 
   better than any other system well ... a presidential system does avoid that . 
  well , the brexit referendum aftermath was quite the red wedding . 
  they do n't know about belgium yet . 
  [ correct ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/countries-according-to-alcohol-consumption/ ) . 
  alcohol is an especially european thing . 
   the most un-american americans right now are conservative white people . 
  the minorities respect the constitution . 
  [ not really that much movement compared to brexit ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=1y ), 
  a right guarantees that you 're in the legal right , not that it 's impossible for someone to violate your rights . 
  well , the main alternative is corbyn . 
  looks like they * are * doing better than expected , though . 
  i have high hopes for this -- could be really transformative and popular . 
  best of luck with it !, 
  you would n't be here posting this now if it were n't for d-day !, 
  bedsit negotiations will presumably involve the roi 's relationship with the uk . 
  i imagine that dup being the kingmaker is probably not what the roi wants . 
  this is n't advantageous for the eu . 
  was it good for canada when the eu had to deal with wallonia on ceta ? 
  i mean , if it gets meaning across ... 
   wait this is about making money ? 
  i thought they wanted to help people . 
  the best efforts do both .

  he said `` muslims '' , not specifically `` turks '' .

  no referendum nonsense this time .

   avoiding any make-or-break issues that could trigger mass opposition gee , it 's a good thing that britain has no important , country-affecting , make-or-break issues on its immediate plate then , eh ? 
  a federal uk ? 
  i guess it sends a political message . 
  you 're correct , it 's not . 
  but a weapon where helium fusion was occurring would have to be very powerful . 
  i 'm assuming that farms are gon na remain legal . 
  so apparently raising animals for eat-once-and-it 's - gone steak is okay , but raising them for a fur coat that you wear for a lifetime is n't ? 
  not really what it means , though . 
  australia 's part of the west , too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_bloc  the western bloc or capitalist bloc during the cold war refers to the countries allied with the nato against the soviet union and its allies . 
  the latter were referred to as the eastern bloc . 
  the governments and press of the western bloc were more inclined to refer to themselves as the free world or the western world . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_world  the western world or the west is a term usually referring to various nations , depending on the context , most often including at least part of europe . 
  there are many accepted definitions based on commonalities . 
  [ 1 ] the western world is also known as the occident ( from latin : occidens `` sunset , west '' , as contrasted with orient ) . 
    the concept of the western part of the earth has its roots in greco-roman world in europe , judaism and the advent of christianity in ancient israel . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] in the modern era , western culture has been heavily influenced by the traditions of the renaissance , protestant reformation , age of enlightenment -- and shaped by the expansive imperialism and colonialism of the 15th to 20th centuries . 
  before the cold war era , the traditional western viewpoint identified western civilization with the western christian ( catholic-protestant ) countries and culture . 
  [ 7 ] its political usage was temporarily changed by the antagonism during the cold war in the mid-to-late 20th century ( 1947 -- 1991 ) . 
    the term originally had a literal geographic meaning . 
  it contrasted europe with the cultures and civilizations of the middle east and north africa , sub-saharan africa , south asia , southeast asia , and the remote far east which early-modern europeans saw as the east . 
  in the contemporary cultural meaning , the phrase western world includes europe , as well as many countries of european colonial origin with substantial european ancestral populations in the americas and oceania . 
  [ 8 ] gon na be one of those , not `` western hemisphere '' . 
  most of europe is in the eastern hemisphere . 
   do n't consider the us to be thewest . 
  it 's time we stop doing that . 
  at sufficiently high pressures , you do get fusion of helium . 
  make more babies, 
  actually , us taxation hits the wealthy harder than the poor more than eu taxation . 
  however , the us also spends less on the poor . 
  you do n't think he 's gon na step down after the election ? 
  well , the liberal democrats threw everything they had into getting a referendum on it , but ... 
  i do n't think it was misguided , either ... 
  it hurts ld more . 
  however , fptp rewards regions where a party wins a plurality without `` wasting '' a lot of extra voters on that region . 
  concentrate all your voters in a few regions , and you get seats for them but sacrifice more seats elsewhere .

  i would not unify armies until unifying foreign policy . 
  doing them at the same time would be an options . 
  army procurement and training and other things depend on foreign policy . 
  you can do whatever you want with * your * money . 
  i disagree with your first point -- if they were in the federal scope , it would be an issue , regardless of who initiated it . 
  i think reagan . 
  cruise missiles against iran ( but not technically bombs ) and bombing of libya ( not in the middle east ) , though . 
  * honestly , `` targeted '' is not all that meaningful . 
  you can aim a missile at whatever , and i 'm sure that there are a number of plans which all involve different targets being hit . 
  same thing for aircraft plans .
