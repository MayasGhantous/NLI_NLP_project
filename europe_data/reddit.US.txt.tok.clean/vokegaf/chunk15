  cnn , msnbc and fox all have political positions , sure , but they are n't comparabel to these . 
  deciding to not celebrate a day is n't erasing the event it commemorates . 
  if textbooks had the revolution removed , that 'd be a legit effort . 
  i do n't know how to find who is funding arbitrary media sources . 
  some of them , sure . 
  someone 's done the legwork and put it online . 
  but small-scale ones ? 
  also , rebranding can make it hard to distinguish -- now you have more to remember . 
  for example : * russia today * used to just go by the reasonably-straightforward `` russia today '' . 
  it rebranded to `` rt '' . 
  then you have [ ruptly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruptly ) , which is operated by rt but does n't use rt branding on its [ youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/ruptlytv ) . 
  that 's for a single source , from russia . 
  * al jazeera * , from qatar , also uses the `` aj + '' brand for a [ youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucv3nm3t-xagvhkh9jt0virg ) . 
  so then you 've got not just n sources to know , but 3 times that or so . 
  i wonder if using [ bayesian text classification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naive_bayes_classifier ) to measure similarity of news sources to existing major ones would be interesting -- like , tell me at a glance whether the site i 'm on has content that 's most-like rt , dw , or voa . 
  iirc , google auto-generates captioning for video on youtube , so it might even be usable for video channels . 
  rare to find countries that wo n't fight for their territorial integrity , though perhaps gauche to make the point without risk to territorial integrity . 
  sir , i have sampled your alternative truth , and i think that i prefer real truth . 
  i was shocked when i read about the broad street epidemic and realized how recently it was that medicine became data-driven . 
  trump does this for political points domestically . 
  you 'll note that he 's very long on high-profile statements and visibly flailing to try to get a populist agenda through , but short on actually doing things . 
  wan na join nafta , uk ? 
  gets the whole `` renegotiate nafta '' trump promise checked . 
  if someone wants to see federation , surely they are a federalist . 
  that 's an old one , came out right after the brexit referendum . 
  sexist ? 
  keeping their carrier safe is what destroyers are for . 
  the page lists submarines there because they can be attached , not because they 're normally there . 
  you could entirely-reasonably operate a carrier strike group without submarines . 
   it 's fair to say that the f-35b is a complicated aircraft : it 's new ; it 's stovl ; it 's supersonic ; and it has stealth capabilities . 
  the complexity on this project is on the aircraft side of things . 
  the ships themselves are not particularly complicated - they are enormous floating blocks on which planes can take off and land . 
  i know , nothing to a supercarrier . 
  i could probably cobble together one or two on an idle weekend . 
  a [ us carrier strike group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carrier_strike_group ) normally does n't have submarines . 
  i assume that the same would be true for the british . 
  the brits also do appear to have a number of submarines : four ssbns , [ * vanguard * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_vanguard_%28s28%29 ) , [ * victorious * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_victorious_%28s29%29 ) , [ * vigilant * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_vigilant_%28s30%29 ) , and [ * vengeance * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_vengeance_%28s31%29 ) , and seven ssns -- [ * astute * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_astute_%28s119%29 ) , [ * ambush * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_ambush_%28s120%29 ) , [ * artful * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_artful_%28s121%29 ) , [ * trenchant * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_trenchant_%28s91%29 ) , [ * talent * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_talent_%28s92%29 ) , [ * triumph * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_triumph_%28s93%29 ) , and [ * torbay * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_torbay_%28s90%29 ) . 
  carriers do cost a significant amount to operate too , mind -- that is , it 's not just the procurement cost . 
   would note that turkey has been very public in namecalling germany and the netherlands , the us not pointing this out implies lack of loyalty towards the larger west , and/or a weak position of the west . 
  erdogan is running a referendum in which he is seeking a visible confrontation . 
  why would the us have any interest whatsoever in facilitating that ? 
  if erdogan wants to develop media drama , he can do that himself without help from us , and we 've no obligation to help him . 
  personally , i 'd rather his referendum fails . 
  we have a long and illustrious history of being name-called by whatever leader wants to impress his public by threatening/insulting/what-have-you . 
  nobody cares when chavez is off on some anti-american tirade for domestic political reasons , or duterte is doing the same . 
  here , erdogan is doing his thing for his own domestic politics , and germany and the netherlands have foreign services that are quite aware of it . 
  he has n't attacked anyone , he has n't caused any particular harm , and shows no sign whatsoever of doing so . 
  if he 's not polite to other countries , he might run into them being less-polite , but that 's his schtick . 
  `` hispanic revisionist history '' ? 
  why the hell would hypothetical hispanic revisionists want to endorse the california republic in the least ? 
  i 'm glad that your parents have been caring and loving towards you and your siblings . 
  some people have not been as fortunate , or at least do not perceive themselves to have been as fortunate . 
  the person you were talking to did not seem very impressed with their parents , and while i think that it is very , very common for children not to fully understand or appreciate what their parents have done for them ... we do n't really know his or her story , either . 
  i mean , that 's kinda nihilist ... 
  trump likes to maintain an image of being a protectionist , at any rate . 
  china is rapidly-becoming wealthier . 
  [ china 's up to $ 6500 per capita gdp ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-per-capita ) . 
  romania is at $ 9530 . 
  additionally , if romania grants citizenship , people can leave for whatever the wealthiest member in the eu is ... 
  i would note that this approach is not universalizable -- everyone does this , and you would n't have any humanity a few decades down the road . 
   the eu already addresses this via [ fiscal transfers ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/erdf/ ) . 
  romania receives a lot of eu funds and they should be using those funds to develop their economy and discourage people from leaving . 
  for fiscal transfers to * stop * people from leaving , romania would need to be able to elevate wages and standard of living immediately to a level comparable to that in , say , london ( well , maybe not that any more ) or berlin or paris . 
  yes , the eu does provide fiscal transfers . 
  but they are far , far too small to do anything like this . 
  nor do i think that the public would support anything like this , nor do i even think that it is a practical way to fund pensions . 
  the solution to people leaving the family farm and going to the big city for work can not be to convert all the farmland into big city -- it 's just far too expensive . 
  i suppose that if one degraded the standard of living enough in the big city , one might equal them out . 
  but that itself seems horribly inefficient . 
  much cheaper just to pay their pension out ...  i support a state pension but only if its backed by responsible saving and investment rather than being a pyramid scheme which is reliant on new people paying in to be able to afford paying out to earlier recipients . 
  well , i 'm with you as a long-term ideal . 
  but ... we 're talking about an existing situation . 
  there are twenty million people in romania . 
  they have their own obligations already in place to pay for people who have a state pension in place . 
  asking them to support their parents , support themselves , and to do all this alone in one generation , with some of the least resources available in the eu , seems like a terribly-difficult task . 
   elect a government which does n't use what is effectively a pyramid scheme for pensions ? 
  state pensions involve intergenerational wealth transfer . 
  they exist because they replaced the earlier system of having people have a social responsibility to care for their parents . 
  that meant living with them , providing caretaking for them , and paying for them in their old age . 
  ( and , true , enjoying some benefits , like them watching babies . ), 
  this had some drawbacks . 
  children who died meant that their parents lost a way to receive care in retirement , though churches could help fill some of the gap . 
  `` deadbeat children '' were an issue . 
  for a variety of reasons , after people left farms for factories , that sort of thing did n't happen . 
  people moved around a lot , could n't stay on the family farm and work in the city . 
  it was cheaper to have specialized caretakers . 
  things like running water and electricity made it easier for the elderly to get by on their own to a greater extent . 
  so ... people stopped having their aged parents live with them . 
  but to deal with the gap that created in elder care , the state imposed its own solution -- * all * of the younger people pay into a pool , and those funds are used to care for * all * older people . 
  now , i 'm not saying that that is an ideal solution . 
  it obviously causes some harm to the incentives to raise children and simultaneously eliminates a source of childcare . 
  it eliminates something of a psychological support network . 
  but ... insofar as there was an obligation that existed , this is not something new that pension schemes introduced . 
  in fact , it 's not even always new for it to be a new * legal * obligation , as opposed to social obligation -- [ fillial responsibility laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/filial_responsibility_laws ) long predate the state pension . 
  point is , the finances of `` you 're responsible for making sure that the last generation has someone caring for them '' has n't * really * changed that much in that there 's a burden on the younger generation . 
   i wo n't be because i have a private pension i agree that private ( i.e. 
  `` i fund my own retirement '' ) models have some benefits . 
  however : * doing a one-generation shift to that places a lot of financial pressure on people . 
  some generation has to fully-care for their parents and themselves . 
  in the us , this has been a gradual shift towards 401 ( k ) and similar systems and away from pensions .
