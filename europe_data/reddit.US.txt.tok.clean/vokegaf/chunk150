  * there do not appear to be any remaining us land-based ballistic missiles outside of the us . 
  the us does have nuclear weapons that can be used from aircraft available under nuclear sharing in europe , but i 'm not sure how meaningful it is to say that those are targeted . 
  in cooking , do you guys still use imperial units in recipes ? 
  that 's one area where we have n't changed -- teaspoons , tablespoons , cups , pints , quarts , gallons , lbs , etc. 
  you guys also use [ stone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stone_%28unit%29 ) for weight at least some of the time , which is one that we do n't . 
  needs to be a european equivalent to [ wikipedia : category : online real estate databases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:online_real_estate_databases ) . 
  that does n't mean that there 's no monopoly . 
  it means that there are many small markets , each potentially monopolized -- if you 're a customer , you only care whether there are more-than-one providers covering the area where you 're buying . 
  it just means that google got flooded by people trying to find the [ reddit finland conspiracy page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/finlandconspiracy/comments/2y0oog/the_finland_conspiracy_and_all_you_need_to_know/ ) . 
  well , my main point was that the countries were not . 
  there * are * some true socialist parties in europe ( not with much support ) but most of the ones with `` socialist '' in their name only have it because they started out socialist . 
  if they were created today , they 'd have something else in their name . 
  it looks like sp and pvda are your red parties with legislative representation : [ sp ] ( https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialistische_partij_\\ ( nederland \\ ) ) :  ideology socialism , social democracy [ 1 ] [ 2 ] -  the sp originated from the maoist movement of the 70 's . 
  since then , the party has undergone a gradual ideological change towards social democracy . 
  that seems to fit with my point . 
  i ca n't google translate the platform for pvda , and the dutch page does n't talk about their positions on ownership , but the english page : [ pvda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/young_socialists_\\ ( netherlands \\ ) )  js used to be a democratic socialist organisation that promotes the full participation of young people in society . 
  since 2007 however , the js has adapted social democracy as their ideology , calling for `` a peaceful and just world with happy and committed people . '', 
  democratic socialism is socialism , just arrived at peacefully . 
  but social democracy is not . 
  i imagine that you 'd do what ships and things that can have water leaking in do -- have doors that can `` seal off '' a compromised area . 
  also have to stop the pods as quickly as possible , which means immediately tripping emergency brakes all around the system . 
  could probably kill some number of people , but you can get that by using a car bomb or whatever . 
  yes , and you left the very next sentence out of your quote , which shot down your claim and supported mine . 
   the core idea of these currents is that the collective , whether or not embodied by the government / state , has the highest decision-making power over the distribution of power and goods . 
  again , this is * social ownership * , the core element of socialism . 
  the netherlands does not have social ownership , and does not have a socialist government . 
  it 's not entirely clear to me whether it 's spain or the article author that chose to use the term `` manspreading '' . 
  my understanding from / r/ukpolitics is that the fptp structure favors the tories quite a bit , as there are many areas where they win by not-a-huge amount , and few where they are highly concentrated . 
  labour , on the other hand , is more concentrated . 
  so even though the polls may not be far off , the chance of labour winning more seats than the conservatives is not good . 
  also germany . 
  it 's probably dominated by google searches from people here wanting to travel , which is why i wish people would say where they 're searching from , since i believe google uses geolocation to provides search suggestions . 
  or are you talking about not knowing whether a country is a region of another ? 
  denmark , the netherlands , belgium , norway and so forth are not socialist . 
  there are a few parties that have names lingering from back when they really * did * advocate for socialism , but none of the countries today are . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism  socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production ; [ 10 ] as well as the political ideologies , theories , and movements that aim to establish them . 
  [ 11 ] social ownership may refer to forms of public , collective , or cooperative ownership ; to citizen ownership of equity ; or to any combination of these . 
  [ 12 ] in a socialist country , industry is not privately owned , but socially-owned , via collectives or the government or what-have-you . 
  this is the defining characteristic of socialism , and it is not true of denmark , the netherlands , belgium , or norway . 
  the correct term is [ social democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy ) :  social democracy is a political , social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy , as well as a policy regime involving a commitment to representative democracy , measures for income redistribution , and regulation of the economy in the general interest and welfare state provisions . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] social democracy thus aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic , egalitarian and solidaristic outcomes ; and is often associated with the set of socioeconomic policies that became prominent in northern and western europe -- particularly the nordic model in the nordic countries -- during the latter half of the 20th century . 
  if an american is telling you that `` those countries are n't socialist '' , hopefully it 's because they 're aware of what socialism entails . 
  yeah , you can think of the money that the creditors initially put in as being the money injected . 
  i mean , it was n't a gift , but it * was * a subsidized loan . 
  though we got the foot from the british ... ... who got it from europe in general ... ... who [ got it from greece and rome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foot_\\ ( unit \\ ) ) ... 
  not thirty years ago . 
  what on earth is objectionable to you there ? 
  i 'd gave thought that you 'd see pence 's position as a welcome change from trump ... 
  you could move the social security systems to the eu level and avoid all this . 
  the thing is that there are probably things that poland does want in the eu . 
  what if the obligation to join the ez went away ? 
  that creates a two-tier system , which poland does n't want , but also means that poland does n't need to worry about being bound by ez restrictions if it does n't want to do so . 
  yeah , but there 's no reason to believe that poland is applying for us statehood any time soon , whereas as an eu member poland is required to ultimately join the eurozone . 
  i mean , sure , poland does n't have authority there unless it joins -- that 's a chunk of the reason to join -- but you want the ez to * look * like something that poland would ultimately want to be in . 
  we have a couple of territories that do n't have statehood , and thus can not vote in the legislature . 
  one is washington , dc . 
  but they still do bring a non-voting representative in and have her bring up concerns with the rest of congress , even if she ca n't vote . 
   italy and greece needs help to handle the refugee crisis ? 
  poland say fuck you . 
  frankly , that was everyone else up until it started spilling into other countries . 
  well , the liberal democrats * did * throw everything they had into trying to change it . 
  really , the only way it would happen would be a third party in coalition trading everything for a shot at it and than the major party mid-estimating their chances . 
  he was saying that china was a `` shithole '' 30 years ago . 
  first , the market reforms started 40 years ago , and second , china had a lot fewer problems then than africa does today . 
  i 'm not saying that africa ca n't improve , but i 'm saying that comparing china 30 years ago to africa today is n't a level comparison . 
  and china dealt with literacy in the communist era -- that had been in place for decades before the market reforms . 
  well , if you can get an sez with the rules you specify set up , i 'd think that you could make it work . 
  i mean , there 's money to be made there , albeit not immediately . 
  if so , addressing that would be one of the goals of any development effort . 
  china had functioning institutions , literacy , a lack of civil war ... and what do you mean `` by the west '' ? 
  yeah , well , that number 's probably not independent from whether-or-not mandatory genetic testing exists in a society . 
  if you have n't seen it already , [ here 's his written statement ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/james-comey-memos-testimony/ ) . 
  i 'd expect that it 's going to be fairly difficult for a defense attorney to argue that trump was n't intending to obstruct the investigation . 
  he probably still could have gotten away with it ( friendly congress ) if he 'd just * stopped * at that point and shut the fuck up and run a clean presidency from there on out , but then handing over evidence of obstruction of justice privately to the russians -- okay , maybe he could have had testimony there suppressed on national security grounds -- and then in a television interview about his intent is just going to make this hard as hell . 
  i mean , if you were a prosecutor actively crafting a case to favor prosecuting your case , i do n't know how you could manage it to be much better . 
  maybe handwritten orders ? 
  anyway , ianal , and we 'll see what happens . 
  but my guess is that it 's more-likely than not now that he wo n't serve out the term . 
  in all fairness , the comey testimony is a very big deal and may lead to trump being impeached and removed from office -- it probably meets the bar for obstruction of justice , same thing that nixon went down for . 
  i 'd be covering it too before a murder somewhere , unless * maybe * it was a local news source covering a local murder . 
  jeez . 
  norway , clean your act up . 
  edit : also , poland , why the hell were you off letting germany do all that reich stuff in the '40s ? 
  this can be defeated via requiring genetic testing , though . 
  also have interesting social effects on society , since suddenly both women and men would know who the parents of a child are . 
  i think that some of the difference between the roles that women and men historically had -- with women being more-cloistered , staying in the home , etc is because children get inheritance , and obvious who the mother of a child is ... but not as obvious who the father is , so the risk for a guy spending resources raising a kid that someone fathered on his wife is a risk . 
  you get social policies that try to isolate women from interacting with other men in a lot of societies . 
  i 've mused about the possibility of mandatory genetic testing at birth this becoming the norm since genetic testing became available , part of the birth certificate process . 
  that being said , i was expecting abuse like this to happen ever since that recent ruling that mothers of children with eu citizenship could remain in the eu . 
  my guess , though , was that it 'd be via women having one kid by some actual eu citizen guy outside the eu , and then getting in . 
  that is , it 's not tied to marriage , but paternity , so the normal things that restrict `` fake marriages '' to get citizenship do n't apply . 
  that guy would just be on the lam and not paying paternity anyway . 
  after that kid , the woman can go do whatever she wants . 
  but i guess the `` welfare recipients do n't pay paternity loophole '' + `` false claim of paternity '' is an even easier loophole , barring policy changes . 
  gon na give this at least equal weight . 
  trump has a history of going off on all kind of things , muslim - and non - . 
  maybe , but that should be unstable in that it * is * in the interests of the public to shift russia away from a resource extraction economy . 
  like , my understanding was that russia has had a well-educated population . 
  i do n't know enough about it to be able to rank the * quality * of that -- there are some countries out there that have degree mills -- but the data that i have seen looks good : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_russia  the literacy rate in russia , according to a 2015 estimate by the central intelligence agency , is 99.7 % ( 99.7 % men , 99.6 % women ) . 
  [ 4 ] according to a 2016 oecd estimate , 54 % of russia 's adults ( 25 - to 64-year-olds ) has attained a tertiary education , giving russia the second highest attainment of college-level education in the world .
