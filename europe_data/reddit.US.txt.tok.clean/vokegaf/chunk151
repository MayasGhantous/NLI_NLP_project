  highest rates of tertiary education , 24.7 % are recorded among women aged 35 -- 39 years ( compared to 19.5 % for men of the same age bracket ) . 
  [ 6 ]   compared with other oecd countries , russia has some of the smallest class sizes [ 7 ] and some of the shortest instruction hours per year . 
  [ 8 ]   in 2014 , the pearson/economist intelligence unit rated russia 's education as 8th best in europe and 13th best in the world ; [ 9 ] russia 's educational attainment was rated as the 21st highest in the world and the students ' cognitive skills as the 9th highest . 
  [ 10 ]   in 2015 , oecd ranked russian students ' mathematics and science skills as the 34th best in the world , between sweden and iceland . 
  [ 11 ]   in 2016 the us company bloomberg rated russia 's higher education as the third best in the world , measuring the percentage of high-school graduates who go on to attend college , the annual science and engineering graduates as percent of all college graduates , and science and engineering graduates as percent of the labor force . 
  [ 12 ]   in 2014 , russia was the 6th most popular destination for international students . 
  [ 13 ]   joseph stiglitz , a former chief economist of the world bank , states that one of the good things that russia inherited from the soviet era is `` a high level of education , especially in technical areas so important for the new economy '' . 
  [ 14 ] that 's all very promising . 
  that should be grounds for a solid economy , if that education is effectively-utilized , and you can have a clean , law-abiding , and safe environment for running businesses . 
  but instead , you get [ this ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:russia_export_treemap.png ) : a comparatively-poor , resource-extraction economy . 
  compare that to [ germany ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:germany_product_export_treemap.jpg ) or to the [ united kingdom ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:united_kingdom_export_treemap.png ) or to [ france ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:france_export_treemap.jpg ) or to the [ united states ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:united_states_export_treemap.png ) .

  you mean / u/wearebrics ? 
  i assume that he hangs out here because , i mean , russia 's in europe and all that ... 
  i mean , they do compete on the world stage . 
  [ sex tourism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_tourism ) is an international market . 
   the usa should spend less money militarizing the world , starting by islamists dictatorship like saoudi arabia that 's saudi money paying for it . 
  well , norway 's problem is a lack of population . 
  it 's hard for 5m people to be able to pretty much act with impunity on the global stage . 
  the arab world 's got the population ( [ 422 million , still less than the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) ) such that if they * really * hit above their weight , they might get there . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superpower  superpower is a term used to describe a state with a dominant position , which is characterised by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale . 
  this is done through the combined-means of technological , cultural , military and economic strength , as well as diplomatic international relations and soft power influence . 
  traditionally , superpowers are preeminent among the great powers . 
  to do that , you either need a massive population ( like , india + china unified + a more-even distribution of global wealth ) or great technological and wealth disparity . 
  the arab world does n't have that . 
  the technological and wealth disparities of the past less-and-less exist . 
  so i have a hard time seeing it being easy to hit above their weight . 
  and i 'm doubtful that the arab world can * support * an india + china population ( * africa * as a whole is on track to do so , but not just the arab world ... and my guess is that many people will emigrate from africa as population pressures increase , decreasing the number of people available in africa ) . 
  the most-obvious candidate is the eu , in that it 's reasonably-similar to the us in most ways , is pretty developed , etc , or maybe china ( assuming it can continue development and economic growth ) . 
  for the arab world to do it , it 'd have to deal with a lower population than the eu , less-cohesion than the eu , a much-less-developed set of economies than the eu ( though not always less-wealthy , even if less-developed ! ) . 
  if some people on here from the eu get upset about ( imho , unreasonably so ... ) food security , the arab world 's in a far worse position . 
  israel does viable arid-land farming , but it 's * hard * . 
  i could see the arab world forming a great power if some really great leader came along and used the available resources really brilliantly . 
  `` superpower '' , though ... i 'm dubious . 
  if you have many `` superpowers '' , they essentially are just the new great powers . 
  so if the arab world gains clout , but so do the eu , india , and china ... the arab world still is n't a superpower . 
  which did n't rebut my original comment -- that they could return home . 
  i never claimed that australia said that they could come and live and work in australia or anywhere else . 
  and , yeah , they might be stuck sitting around waiting until a war ends . 
  australia 's saying `` i 'll provide you with temporary sanctuary '' ... and that 's what they are doing . 
  they are n't opening a route for economic migration . 
  in my eyes , that 's a pretty sensible thing for them to do -- if they want migration , it 's probably a lot more advantageous to have an immigration policy that favors skilled workers . 
   we were talking about manus , not nauru ... which is in the middle of nowhere with no routes off other than what australia chooses to provide . 
  well , that 's easy to check . 
  i 'm pretty sure that you 're misunderstanding the situation . 
  < checks  apparently not * only * is australia paying for them to go home from manus but is offering substantial amounts of cash so that they do n't have to care for them and can get rid of them . 
  [ exclusive : australia increases pressure , cash offers for png asylum seekers to return home ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-australia-refugees-exclusiv-iduskbn15t317 )  officials at an australian immigration center in papua new guinea are increasing pressure on asylum seekers to return to their home countries voluntarily , including offering large sums of money , amid fears a deal for the united states to take refugees has fallen through . 
    about a dozen bangladeshi and nepalese asylum seekers on manus island told reuters they are being repeatedly called to meet with australian officials and pressured to take amounts of up to $ 25,000 to return to those countries , or face deportation . 
    the men , who have been ruled ineligible for refugee status by papua new guinea , said officials are also acting with urgency on deportation notices filed weeks or months ago . 
  at least one nepalese man was removed from his accommodation in the middle of the night last week , they said . 
    `` they told me and others that if you go back voluntarily you will get money about $ 20,000 , if you guys go in group you will get more money , '' detainee mohammad bilal , a crane driver who says he fled bangladesh for political reasons , told reuters about a meeting with australian officials last week . 
    offering money to failed asylum seekers to return home is not illegal . 
  however , the sums being offered by australian officials have more than doubled since a year ago , and are far above the funds being offered elsewhere . 
    germany , for example , recently announced plans to offer up to 1,200 euros ( $ 1,275 ) to asylum seekers to voluntarily return home . 
    `` substantial assistance packages are available to help non-refugees depart voluntarily , return home and re-establish their lives in their home country , '' australia 's immigration department said in an emailed statement to reuters . 
  `` in cases where non-refugees refuse to depart voluntarily , the government of png has indicated that it will enforce the removal of those individuals , in accordance with normal international practice . '', 
  does n't seem much like the situation being described -- australia seems more-than-happy to pay to ship them back home if they 're willing to go . 
  that 's normally what countries do when they deport people anyway . 
   it 's not a case of australia kindly providing a refuge , a temporary place of sanctuary for protecting war refugees at all . 
  it 's a deliberate cynical ploy to avoid fulfilling the terms of a treaty we signed in the 50s , which requires us to accept any genuine refugees who enter our legal jurisdiction ( un convention on refugees ) . 
  that convention was a way to specifically deal with the aftermath of world war ii -- it was a one-off problem . 
  i 've no objection to it , and i think it was reasonable . 
  i do not think that it 's expansion to the whole world in 1967 was a good idea , at least without other changes , because there are migration pressures that exist in the whole world that did n't exist then , because there are huge population differences , and because the environment is less-known . 
  i think that the issues that we 're seeing in both australia and europe today are good examples of why it would be a good idea to withdraw from the convention-as-revised-in-1967 and update it to block economic migration , which it was clearly * not * intended to provide . 
  nah , `` yewka '' just looks weird . 
  well , get some terrorism so that there can be more cultural commonality between you guys and those other countries . 
  well , `` surplus value '' is a fundamental concept in marxist economics and relies on adoption of the labor theory of value -- it does n't recognize market value as being where wages should be . 
  if you 're going to be in a position of arguing that economic decisions should follow a marxist system , then , yeah , we 're probably going to disagree , as that 's a much larger argument . 
  my best response to that would be really to point to countries that have set up systems based on marxist theory and point out that they really have n't done all that well for their population . 
  i think that i can argue against marxism , but honestly , there are probably much better resources and arguments made along those lines , as this is a long-running argument that many prestigious people have weighed in on , and my ad-hoc position in a reddit comment wo n't have much weight compared to that . 
   but i do n't think the pipeline through ukraine will be closed . 
  it just does not make sense anymore for them to shut it down . 
  no , i agree . 
  but assuming that the government of ukraine does have control of the pipeline , having an alternative route is only really useful if germany wants to collaborate with russia to ukraine 's detriment . 
  so , from ukraine 's standpoint , this is an important signal about german intentions and will probably decrease trust of germany -- and this is also undoubtedly why russia is offering it in the first place , because of the potential for ukraine-germany political schism , and undermining pro-western people in ukraine . 
  sure , germany could value the cost of any political schism as less than the benefits of a more-favorable contract over building the thing . 
  i 'm just saying that there is clearly a political cost . 
  poland 's take is that the political cost is n't one worth paying for whatever favorable terms the pipeline is being built on . 
  germany 's , apparently , differs . 
  i ca n't argue as to the relative weighting being correct in one case or the other , but i do want to point out that there is a real cost that should n't be overlooked . 
   not if you 're a discriminatory psychopath . 
  no , i mean that the concept of globalism specifically does not entail accepting refugees . 
  you can certainly argue that it would be a good thing to accept refugees , but a world in which people can travel more cheaply and trade covers wider bounds and culture spreads more is n't intrinsically tied to refugee acceptance . 
   only if australia chooses to convey them there , they have no agency or ability to do so at their own choosing . 
  my understanding is that people are permitted to leave nauru and that they will be shipped for free -- but the only place that they 're permitted to leave to is home , not to australia . 
  this permits people who are really in fear of their lives to obtain a temporary place of sanctuary -- the rationale for protecting war refugees and the like -- but does n't permit for economic migration . 
  i think that it 's a pretty good filter , frankly , or at least better than any alternatives that have been seriously proposed . 
  you only need to do it with new arrivals to start a disincentive . 
  well , germany did n't want quotas either until it got stuck with refugees . 
  before , germany wanted dublin , which blocked refugees from leaving greece . 
  now that there are refugees in germany , germany is interested in redistributing them . 
  germany has consistently looked out for german issues . 
  ee has done the same thing . 
  it 's just that nobody is coming or wants to come to ee , so they 're in the `` dublin phase '' that germany was in : not wanting other countries to unload refugees on you . 
  fwiw , we are still in the `` dublin phase '' in the us and show no signs of changing . 
  it 's not a prison in that people can always leave and return home if they want . 
   ship them to french guiana or something ? 
  oh yeah , latin america is gon na love you . 
  worked for australia .
