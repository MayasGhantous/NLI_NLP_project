  i should think that they * do * deserve special treatment . 
  good on germany for stepping up !, 
  the brits are still ahead . 
  i bet the french are too . 
  maybe some other countries too ... 
  hmm . 
  i dunno , i 've floated the idea of requiring people who are flagged as at-risk-of-being-a-threat refugees to wear a monitoring cuff . 
  i guess we have n't done so ourselves , but i do n't think that it 's * crazy * . 
  the data does n't match up with the who data from 2014 or 2010 -- lithuania drinks liters a year less in each in those sources . 
   japan is entering some bizarre sexless nightmare , and the europe ... well ... it remains to be seen over the long haul [ speaking of sexless nightmares ... ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2016/02/10/voices/japan-birth-rate-beginning-end-just-new-beginning/#.wtdb8rpsnhe )  according to the world databank , in 2013 ( the latest year for which full data -- not just estimates -- are available ) japan , with its 1.43 tfr , was doing better than south korea and singapore ( both 1.19 ) , hong kong ( 1.12 ) and germany ( 1.38 ) . 
   why would abolishing the rights of people on the basis of their religion be illegal ? 
  for eu member countries ?

  [ i 'm gon na bet on the religious 84 % of the world ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2012/dec/23/84-percent-world-population-has-faith-third-are-ch/ ) in that ensuing fight . 
  i mean ... look , bulgaria , if you wan na be the guinea pig for `` liberal dictatorship '' or `` illiberal one-party rule '' or whatever , go for it , but i 'm gon na watch on the shore while you dive in so that i can see whether you get eaten by a shark first . 
  all about staying power , man . 
  staying power . 
  never let a good crisis go to waste !, 
  the other good perk is claiming that you ca n't tell anyone what you 're spending on or what you 're doing for national security reasons , because * terrorists * . 
  first , you are n't on continuous deployment . 
  second , it still produces state taxes , generates state economic activity ( e.g. 
  buying a car ) , and the family of the soldier is still spending money . 
  third , only about a quarter of the us military budget goes to personnel : the military budget includes a host of private companies . 
   people can march down the street telling you how british democracy should be overthrown and controlled by a violent theocratic caliphate that subjugates anyone who is n't a muslim male , and there 's nothing that can be done . 
  that 'd be protected by the first amendment here . 
  ... what were you expecting , a gameshow ? 
  hmm . 
  which elements are you thinking of ? 
  < doubtfully  well , * maybe * you could sell it to trump on those grounds . 
  i 'm pretty sure that he 's gon na want global warming . 
  it 's * all * federal expenditure , mostly in the form of funding for the poor and elderly but military spending also taking a fair amount . 
  still results in the injection of money into their economy , though . 
  i mean , theoretically poland * is * required to enter , right ? 
  it 's not a random guy on the street talking , but someone who 's going to be expected to put up with it . 
  the precedent is probably more important -- it 's easier to fiddle with budget than to fight an argument over whether it 's done . 
  so , corbyn announced that he 's unwilling to enter coalition with anyone else . 
  is that generally seen as not true -- just a pre-election political gambit -- or is a coalition out of the picture ? 
  because while it seems reasonable for corbyn to * claim * that he would refuse to enter coalition try try to pull voters away from other parties , actually avoiding coalition seems like a really dumb idea to me . 
  yeah , i remember seeing the baby ad , and it was pretty lame , but i kinda expect any campaign to have * some * egregious moves . 
  the idea that the av vote failed predominantly because of trying to protest ld over the tuition fee policy was new to me , though ... and that seemed a lot more horrifying . 
  i think that it was n't successful under hollande because of how it was presented . 
  i think that there are better ways to present it . 
   we got what we deserved when we voted down voting reform in 2010 for the bantz of giving clegg a kicking wait , seriously ? 
  is that why the referendum voted against av ? 
  because people were * protesting tuition fees * ? 
  what i took issue with was that you said that it was because of the surplus that it would `` hurt eu business ( mostly germany ) more than it would hurt us businesses . '', 
  i mean , i certainly do agree that interrupting trade in general hurts , no doubt -- i just have a hard time getting that from the original post . 
  but if we 're just talking about dirsuption of trade in general being a negative , then hey ... yeah , we 're probably violently agreeing !, 
  killing off britain 's status as a nuclear power would be a pretty serious move in my eyes ... and nationalizing industry ai n't too correlated with economic success in countries . 
  honestly , if i were british and i * had * to choose one or the other , i 'd probably take may and then donate money or time to the [ open rights group ] ( https://www.openrightsgroup.org/ ) , which appears to be the uk 's equivalent of the [ electronic frontier foundation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic_frontier_foundation ) , to specifically target privacy laws . 
  i really think that corbyn 's got things wrong on both economic and foreign policy . 
  i 'd * rather * have lds running things , though ... 
   i 'd encourage you to take a deep breath and re-read your first paragraph . 
  germany currently has a trade surplus with the us , and it is much larger as a percent of their current account ( ~ 7 % ) than even china ( ~ 2 % ) . 
  that does n't address the point i raised in my first paragraph , which is that it 's not somehow * better * to have a trade surplus with a country than a trade deficit . 
  people complaining about germany 's trade balance in the eurozone are n't complaining because it 's awful to be on the other side of a deficit , but because the mechanisms that automatically retain that trade equilibrium are less-efficient when both parties are on the same currency ( that is , you have to lay people off and re-hire them at a lower pay or have businesses go under or whatnot ) . 
  the overhead from this results in elevated unemployment in countries . 
  it is not that germany somehow `` wins '' by having a trade surplus . 
   the us runs a trade surplus with the eu when it comes to services , which are harder to quantify and tax . 
  that is irrelevant . 
  the us taxing german exports to the us is throwing up a barrier to trade , just like germany taxing us export to germany . 
  it makes both economies less-efficient . 
  it 's irrelevant who initiates them , and the direction of the trade being taxed is also long-term irrelevant . 
   human rights are human rights . 
  no exceptions . 
  universal ? 
  except when they prohibit the death penalty !, 
  haters gon na hate on the sexy american penis . 
  he 's pretty out there too . 
  how about voting liberal democrat ? 
  same thing we did in the decade after 9/11 , actually -- passed all the law enforcement wishlists . 
  the uk has probably had its lists gathering dust for a while now , just waiting . 
  i 'm not sold that it requires more police funding to arrest someone on `` jihadi next door '' if they did in fact admit to something illegal there . 
  atwixt the bookends of the bi-fortnight . 
   if you continue reading , you 'll see that the us buys around $ 150 billion more in goods from europe than it sells to europe . 
  so a us-eu trade war would hurt eu business ( mostly germany ) more than it would hurt us businesses . 
  < slams head into desk repeatedly  it is not more advantageous to have a surplus with a country than a deficit . 
  in the long term , if you have a persistent surplus with one country , you 've a deficit with another , and visa versa . 
  if germany does n't export vehicles and germany is the best source of vehicles , it means ( a ) that companies that use vehicles do n't have their first choice of vehicle and ( b ) that because people ca n't purchase german vehicles , their wages are lower in terms of the utility it can buy . 
   i think it 's wrong to accept minorities like women , homosexuals , and children women are a majority , not a minority . 
   romania is a strong promoter of the transatlantic connection . 
  as an atlanticist , i agree with the sentiment , president iohannis . 
  we have two options : * [ lower the oceans by about 1km ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/53/drain_1km.png ) , and we 've got a land-bridge connection . 
  * cool things off enough to produce large ice caps that provide a glacier connection between the two , a la the [ solutrean hypothesis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solutrean_hypothesis ) . 
  for the first option , you got ta do something with all that water , and the best choice would be to freeze it , so really , the solutions are pretty much the same -- cool things down , and you just see whether you get ice pack connecting north america and europe or a land bridge first . 
  as we can see , such an ice cap existed during the [ last glacial maximum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/last_glacial_maximum ) , but a land bridge did not , so the way to go is gon na be an ice bridge . 
  there 's only one problem with this , though : to do that , we need global cooling . 
  a lot of it . 
  and trump is enthusiastic about global warming . 
  which means that trump is something of an obstacle to the transatlantic connection . 
  and , you know , also turkish troops , and it 's on another country 's sovereign soil and all that ... 
   i just do n't see any shared values with turkey anymore okay , so maybe that 's an issue for eu membership , which is big on european values . 
  but for nato ? 
  so , as a quick eyeball , summing all the positive net contributions , that looks like about 30 billion euros shifted across member country lines per year . 
  the eu economy is roughly comparable in size to the us . 
  let 's look over here for comparison : http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union these numbers are ten years out-of-date , so they 'll be smaller than they are now , but eh , gives a ballpark . 
  that 's about $ 5,043.2 billion shifted across state lines each ten years , so $ 504.32 billion every year . 
  maybe about 15 times the current annual cross-member-country transfer in the eu . 
  there 's a larger wealth disparity in per-capita gdp across the eu , so maybe there 's an argument for larger fiscal transfers , but that 's the kind of level of transfer that one might expect in a tighter union . 
   a bit more than a bit , i think .
