  you can have both happen simultaneously . 
  https://xkcd.com/1138/ per-capita data would probably be more interesting . 
   macron is overrated out of france well , from my standpoint , he avoided a potential eu crack-up just by being elected , so he could do pretty much nothing from that point on and still be pretty successful . 
  i do n't know much about french politics , but two things i think i 'd try as macron : ** divide-and-conquer ** do n't try to reform labor law affecting everyone all at once . 
  chose a chunk of industry that is on the rise , preferably one with more-liberal members who would object less . 
  create a separate `` class '' for that , rendering businesses in that `` class '' exempt from the stricter labor laws . 
  now you 're not fighting most of the people outside of that `` class '' , and you can choose the size of the class appropriately to be politically-viable for you . 
  not only does that render the problem tractable by reducing opposition , you 'll have a nice successful showcase for any later reforms that you can point at as an example . 
  ** internalize the costs of the labor law , and let the market decide ** i am quite enthusiastic about the merits of liberalism . 
  i suspect that the reason that many workers do not is because they can not see the benefits -- increases in wages are ephemeral , whereas loss of it being impossible to lay someone off for n weeks or a cap in working hours is concrete . 
  they only see the negative side of the policy , not the positive . 
  instead of saying , oh , `` companies have the right to fire people immediately instead of waiting n weeks '' , at least as a transitional measure , say `` companies must offer both options '' . 
  so an employee at a company of at least n people gets two options when being hired , one with those labor laws applicable , the other without . 
  of course , that also means that the employer will price in the cost to him of those protections , so the employee gets to see the dollar value of what they 're giving up . 
  and if that 's * really * what the employee wants , of those two options ... hell , then it is in the employer 's interest to offer it . 
  and it 's in the employer 's interest to accurately price those two options . 
  downsides are that you 'll have some overhead to compute that cost ( hence the `` more than n people '' so that fixed costs never become too great ) , some ongoing administrative overhead in handling two different sets of employees , and you 'll probably wind up with a group of workers who are convinced that all companies in the country are cleverly colluding to falsely-price wages associated with the `` protections '' option . 
  my guess is that the majority of french workers , given visibility into the costs of those laws , will choose not to have them . 
  and if they do , well ... that 's still economically-efficient , as long as workers have the * option * of not taking them . 
  while i suppose that some of this has to be `` right place , right time '' , has france had a tradition of successful centrist parties in the past ? 
  maybe there really was room for a centrist takeover and it just had n't happened ... 
  [ it substantially improved things ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/fertility-rate-germany-rises-33-year-high-births-children-population ) :  the fertility rate in germany has risen to a 33-year high in a sign the country has turned a corner after years of decline in the rate of births . 
    in 2015 the fertility rate in germany was 1.5 children per woman -- 56 newborns per 1,000 women more than in the previous year . 
  the last time authorities recorded a similar rate was in 1982 . 
    no country in the world has had as prolonged a period of sub-1 .5 fertility rates as germany -- a trend that dates back to 1975 in the former west of the country . 
  in the old east , birthrates dropped off a cliff after reunification in the 1990s , leading to germany being nicknamed `` the land without children '' . 
    recent statistical findings show women in the country are having more children than those in mediterranean countries such as greece , italy or spain . 
    the rate still falls short of the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman . 
  according to projections published last april , germany 's population is expected to decline by about 10 million people by 2060 , meaning the country would be home to between 68 and 73 million inhabitants , compared with its current 81 million . 
    immigration was a key factor in germany 's reversal of the declining rates of the 1990s . 
  among women with german citizenship , birthrates rose from 1.42 to just 1.43 in the years 2014 to 2015 . 
  for women with non-german citizenship based in germany , however , rates in the same period rose from 1.86 to 1.95 . 
  ca n't just bleed population off other countries in europe with their own demographic issues forever . 
  have to either have immigration or bring the birth rate up . 
  this did something of both ... 
   when europeans/americans believed that taking refugees was the right and smart thing to do are you complaining about obama ? 
  because he took like 17k people , dude . 
  we 're 330 million . 
  do n't get me wrong -- i think that we can pull in higher-skill immigrants than that . 
  but if you 're all upset about that , i think it 's worth recalibrating the ol' outrage meter . 
  we * normally * have refugee quotas for people from around the world , including per-continent quotas , and i 'm sure that they get filled . 
  they 're just way smaller than the kind of numbers coming in here . 
   but the muslims already here need to be dealt with . 
  i 'm gon na assume that you meant `` illegal immigrants '' and not `` inclusive of legally-residing muslims '' . 
  weeeeelcome aboard !, 
  edit : holy cow , a picture of jens stoltenberg where he 's smiling and looking relaxed . 
  he * always * looks worried in pictures . 
  technically , there was never a 1st , because the [ north atlantic treaty ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/cs/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm?selectedlocale=en ) only became active when all of the founding members had ratified it , so they all joined it the moment that it came into existence . 
  belgium , canada , denmark , france , iceland , italy , luxembourg , netherlands , norway , portugal , the uk , and the us were the dozen countries that kicked it off . 
  well , technically serbia is n't either ... 
   heads of state well , technically the list appears to be of heads of government , rather than heads of state , but , yeah , point stands . 
  apparently the acting prime ministers of the [ estonian government-in-exile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_government-in-exile ) did n't get credit . 
  about eight more months until 100 years !, 
  we do n't have an official language ( some states do ) , but we still apparently have an english language test that applicants for naturalization need to pass . 
  it looks like [ certain people are exempt ] ( https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/citizenship-through-naturalization/exceptions-accommodations ) :  you are exempt from the english language requirement , but are still required to take the civics test if you are :   * age 50 or older at the time of filing for naturalization and have lived as a permanent resident ( green card holder ) in the united states for 20 years ( commonly referred to as the `` 50/20 '' exception ) . 
    or   * age 55 or older at the time of filing for naturalization and have lived as a permanent resident in the united states for 15 years ( commonly referred to as the `` 55/15 '' exception ) . 
   i.e. 
  it 's illegal to strip a person of their only citizenship . 
  well ... technically it 's not , at least that i 'm aware of . 
  was looking at this yesterday . 
  you 've got two relevant things that i 'm aware of : * the universal declaration of human rights states that people have a right to a nationality . 
  this is not binding . 
  * the [ convention on the reduction of statelessness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_the_reduction_of_statelessness ) generally prohibits removing nationality if it would leave someone stateless . 
  latvia is a signatory ( though none of estonia , russia , or ukraine are ) . 
  hmm . 
  yeah , that 's a thought . 
  i dunno how much trust it assigns that , though . 
  i mean , it could purely flag it for a human . 
  translation is a probabilistic process -- it might require a corpus of trusted works to have a reasonably-high alternate probability , given this correction , for example . 
  i mean , google already has to deal with seoers trying to screw up their search results all day -- i 'd bet that they have a lot of people dealing with the `` how much trust to assign x '' problem . 
   just because cash crops are more lucrative ( = more profit ) does n't mean the land is n't best used for agriculture regardless . 
  hmm . 
  i think that we may be talking past each other . 
  * [ agriculture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agriculture ) is all grown things , whether they 're edible or not . 
  * [ cash crops ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cash_crop ) are things that are grown to be sold . 
  food can be a cash crop , and in the modern world , nearly all crops are cash crops . 
  i * think * that your concern is that someone might grow cotton or tobacco or something not-edible instead of something edible . 
  what i meant was that unless there 's some lucrative resort just wanting to build there and attract tourists , i 'm assuming that the land would continue to be used for agriculture . 
  the line i was drawing was n't between food crops and non-food crops . 
   we want agricultural self-reliance and food security without depending on the world market , especially within the context of climate change . 
  well , that 's certainly up to you . 
  in my eyes , that seems like something that farmers would want to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else , something that 's inefficient , and i am not enthralled about subsidies over here ( though i consider them a reality of farmers having disproportionate senate clout ) . 
  further , my suspicion is that the reason that the leadership agreed to it , and not to some other industry , was because there were a lot of people involved in farming , and otherwise they would have been opposed to lowering barriers between member countries of the eu due to fear of a more-competitive marketplace . 
  for the uk , with a smaller number of people involved in farming , the political priorities would be different . 
  but , hey , if you feel that it 's truly a national security concern , regardless of the other points i brought up ( blocking food coming in would require large-scale collusion among many non-eu places , the eu can reduce meat and already feed itself , albeit giving up some exotic imported things and probably out-of-season fresh fruits , the eu can probably outbid much of the world for available food ) , then fair ` nuff -- at the end of the day , there are certainly some differing views on what 's a more-serious national security risk and what 's a less-serious . 
  also because moving them east would violate the agreement that nato signed with russia saying that unless the security situation changed , it would n't move them into new nato members . 
  to put some numbers on this , the largest us deployment is in germany [ at 34k people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_military_deployments ) , where most of the bases were built during the cold war . 
  germany has a military of 178,334 , over five times the size . 
  i bet that most of them are . 
  germany shares two airbases with us in the us too . 
  if you 've already got facilities placed somewhere , which was presumably done with an idea to viability of a base there , it does n't make much sense to go build out more -- instead , just expand what 's already there . 
   and a civil war help things to change . 
  ... are you calling for a civil war in france ? 
   seems like their location could have shifted strongly towards the east by now . 
  [ nato founding act on mutual relations , cooperation and security between nato and the russian federation signed in paris , france ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/official_texts_25468.htm ) :  the member states of nato reiterate that they have no intention , no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members , nor any need to change any aspect of nato 's nuclear posture or nuclear policy - and do not foresee any future need to do so . 
  this subsumes the fact that nato has decided that it has no intention , no plan , and no reason to establish nuclear weapon storage sites on the territory of those members , whether through the construction of new nuclear storage facilities or the adaptation of old nuclear storage facilities . 
  nuclear storage sites are understood to be facilities specifically designed for the stationing of nuclear weapons , and include all types of hardened above or below ground facilities ( storage bunkers or vaults ) designed for storing nuclear weapons ... [ snip ]  nato reiterates that in the current and foreseeable security environment , the alliance will carry out its collective defence and other missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability , integration , and capability for reinforcement rather than by additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces . 
  accordingly , it will have to rely on adequate infrastructure commensurate with the above tasks . 
  in this context , reinforcement may take place , when necessary , in the event of defence against a threat of aggression and missions in support of peace consistent with the united nations charter and the osce governing principles , as well as for exercises consistent with the adapted cfe treaty , the provisions of the vienna document 1994 and mutually agreed transparency measures . 
  russia will exercise similar restraint in its conventional force deployments in europe .
