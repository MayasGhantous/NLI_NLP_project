  now , okay , you could maybe argue that the security environment has been changed by the ukraine situation or something like that . 
  however , until there 's a pretty darn clear argument to be made that there 's a serious threat to nato members that could not have been foreseen in 1997 , it would be a violation of the act to move the bases forward . 
  i , personally , do n't think that that argument can be made today with the information available . 
  that is , i think that the ukraine situation is pretty crummy , but it 's not clear from that that nato members are threatened . 
  to avoid being considered to be treaty violators , i would want most of the world to look and say `` yup , this is clearly something that differs from and could not have been expected in 1997 '' before doing that . 
  i 'm noting how the us navy has successfully managed to establish bases in warm , pleasant , touristy resort places . 
  most of the army is still along the old cold war line . 
  lots of tourist attractions to see when you are off . 
  ditto for the air force . 
  and then there are some poor marines who got dumped in central norway . 
  as i understand it , the latvian and estonian concern is that they might be used as a political tool to re-attach the country to russia -- the soviet union [ forcibly moved people who might break away away from border states to the interior ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forced_settlements_in_the_soviet_union ) . 
  i assume that what latvia/estonia hope is that the people in question will `` give up '' and leave for russia . 
  the people in turn would rather live in the better-off latvia and estonia . 
  let 's suppose that , hypothetically , it would be possible to encourage a sufficient number of the citizens in question to acquire czech citizenship -- that is , that they could receive property , a subsidy , and citizenship in czechia . 
  the remainder could acquire citizenship in latvia and estonia . 
  that would presumably address the concerns of the baltics over security , would permit the status of the people in question , to be regularized . 
  it would not force people to do anything , as the soviet union did , but would use a carrot to firm up borders . 
  assume , for a moment , that the eu were willing to provide the subsidy , to resolve an ongoing human rights issue within the eu . 
  would you be willing to have czechia do this ? 
   tha basic right of a human being is to speak the language of its choose this human chooses klingon . 
  cater to my preference . 
  i 'm sure that european agriculture wo n't * die * -- if land is best used for agriculture , that 's what it 'll wind up being used for -- but i also suspect that the number of people employed on farms fifty years from now will be substantially less than the number now . 
  i dunno if ireland would agree . 
  but i was thinking more about `` who gets the surplus of countries producing that surplus '' rather than `` every single country is running a deficit '' . 
  wow . 
  google translate chokes on that :  which five countries would you call to the most improved , inhumpely configured in connection with russia ? 
  i 'm not even sure how `` inhumpely '' even can come out of their translation engine . 
  it 's not an english word ... 
   you 're assuming a russian nuclear strike which even if we responded with a second strike capability we 'd all be destroyed anyway . 
  the point of a nuclear deterrent is to * avoid * the first strike by * having * second strike capability . 
  destruction in the first strike is irrelevant to the functionality of the deterrent . 
   current threat comes from iran/nk well , iran 's not a nuclear power at the moment , and it 's dubious that it will be , but , okay , add it to the list . 
   it 's all about food security . 
  for what purpose ? 
  that is , what is the scenario that the eu is concerned about ? 
  i 'm not familiar with [ these guys ] ( http://www.ecipe.org/app/uploads/2014/12/food-security-and-the-eus-common-agricultural-policy-facts-against-fears.pdf ) , but they seem to be covering some of the major concerns , so let 's go with 'em . 
   if food prices rose dramatically , the eu could increase the agricultural area used for growing cereals ; in particular , by cutting back on biofuel and livestock production . 
  yeah , that was pretty much what i 'd expect ( though i was n't aware that there was biofuel subsidy ) . 
  going vegetarian significantly increases the number of people you can feed if you need to do so in an emergency . 
   in any case , most eu imports are not staple necessities but luxury items , such as coffee , tea and flowers , or feedstuff . 
  nevertheless , it is worth mentioning that eu food imports are reasonably reliable . 
  world food trade is expanding ; the number of countries with strong food exporting capabilities is increasing ; export restrictions are rare and limited in scope ; and key eu trading partners have stable , liberal trading regimes . 
  furthermore , food is a homogenous good traded on spot markets -- that is , any one supplier can easily be replaced by another . 
  yeah , that 's pretty much what i 'd predict again : that it would be difficult for sanctions from any country to seriously put the eu at risk . 
  plus the eu can outbid most of the world for food even if there were a * global * shortage . 
  and sure enough , they cover that as well :  food prices are so low compared with eu wealth that the eu could afford sufficient imports even if prices rose tenfold the only scenario that i could see is a world-war-ii style blockade . 
  the problem is , this requires ( a ) the eu to lack the ability to ship things in and out , which for the forseeable future would mean being at war with the us , ( b ) the eu to lack the ability to ship things via russia , which would probably mean being at war with russia , and ( c ) loss of control of the mediterranean to lose the ability to trade with africa and ( d ) the eu to lack the ability to ship things to turkey and thereabouts . 
  is that a likely scenario ? 
  because honestly , it seems pretty unlikely to me ( and if it were happening , food security would n't be my top concern in that scenario ) . 
  and the eu would still have the option , even * in * that war , of going vegetarian , say . 
  while i 'm not saying that there 's * no * risk of the eu being entirely cut off from the outside world , it requires a pretty unlikely scenario ( and even in that scenario , i 'm not sure that my main concern would be a blockade at that point ) . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  i ca n't seem to find a measurement of how much usable land is offline ... 
   but it 's not , so it 's not really helping . 
  so you 're saying that the list of experiments being conducted are being chosen in error ? 
  esa , nasa , and so forth are simply approving things that are n't providing a return above-and-beyond the existing knowledge base ? 
  i mean , that seems pretty implausible to me . 
  well , let 's see . 
  * first , while i do n't have a list of what , say , russia would target in the uk , us atomic targets in the early cold war [ * have * been declassified ] ( https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-cold-war-nuclear-target-list-declassified-first-ever/ ) , and they were primarily aimed at destroying military targets . 
  that is , the primary goal was not killing the population , but in neutralizing the other side 's nuclear capability , and the secondary goal was in wiping out its industrial ability to support a military . 
  after that , the us would win any remaining phase of the war , as it would be fighting against a country without industrial capability . 
  obviously , the civilian population would suffer quite a few deaths , but that was more an incidental effect than the main aim . 
  * it does n't take `` thousands '' of nuclear weapons . 
  here 's a list of [ british army installations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_british_army_installations ) and [ raf installations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_royal_air_force_stations ) . 
  a number of these are co-located in the same city . 
  and you do n't need to hit * everything * . 
  * an invasion and occupation of a country requires a functioning country back home to provide support to that military . 
  no country , no functioning military . 
  * of the known nuclear powers out there ( russia , us , uk , france , china , india , pakistan , north korea , israel ) , i do n't know whether the uk would be in a good position to conquer any via conventional force except maybe north korea , israel , and perhaps france , and even for those , she 'd have to build up her military -- she only keeps 153k active military personnel . 
  the others are far more populous than herself . 
   what if the policy is to embark on military-led regime change of any country which nukes you ? 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by `` military-led regime change '' , but i assume a conventional invasion of the country ? 
  conquering it ? 
  if uk came under attack from a nuclear power , they probably are n't going to * have * much of a military to be `` embarking on military-led regime change '' afterwards . 
  and that 's assuming that they 'd have the capability to do so in the first place -- the uk would be in a tough spot fighting a conventional war against , say , russia or china . 
   ideological reasons nuclear deterrence is not ideological ... it 's pretty pragmatic . 
  well , i 've noticed that a couple of the left-wing crowd that i recognize here seems to be advocating for iran , so i think that this might be a left-wing thing -- apparently somewhere along the line , some left-wing folks became enthusiastic about iran . 
   well this whole topic is about who is worse , iran or saudi arabia . 
  that was n't what i was talking about . 
  what 's the relevance ? 
  broadly-speaking , i agree with keeping emphasis on robotic missions ( do n't need to return , lower cost of failure , less life support glop ) . 
  however : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_research_on_the_international_space_station  research on the iss improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body . 
  subjects currently under study include muscle atrophy , bone loss , and fluid shift . 
  the data will be used to determine whether space colonisation and lengthy human spaceflight are feasible . 
  as of 2006 , data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise ( such as the six-month journey time required to fly to mars ) . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] large scale medical studies are conducted aboard the iss via the national space biomedical research institute ( nsbri ) . 
  i do n't think that it 's really possible to do long-term testing of effects of spaceflight on humans somewhere other than on a space station . 
  well , i doubt that gulen cares , since after he lost his power struggle with erdogan , he 's probably not going to be coming back to turkey . 
  i believe this would violate the [ convention on the reduction of statelessness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_the_reduction_of_statelessness ) :  article 8   contracting states shall not deprive people of their nationality so as to render them stateless . 
  ( exceptions : where otherwise provided in the convention ; where nationality has been acquired by misrepresentation or fraud ; disloyalty to the contracting state ) . 
  ... unless gulen has citizenship in another country . 
  however , turkey does not appear to be a signatory . 
  well , the eu can outbid most of the world for food if there 's a global shortage , so that should n't be a huge concern . 
  i do n't see a blockade being likely unless the eu winds up in a war simultaneously with at least russia ( losing transport access to the east ) and the us or whatever other major naval powers there are ( losing transport access to the west ) and loses control of the mediterranean . 
  subsidies just force land that would n't be agricultural to be agricultural . 
  still got ta have enough land . 
  looking online , it looks like [ it takes ~ 1.2 acres per-capita ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1aozn1/how_much_land_does_it_take_to_support_one_human/ ) to support someone at an american standard of living ( in dire situations , where you go vegetarian and all that , you could get it down to under a fifth of that ) . 
  the eu has [ 175 million hectares of utilized agricultural land ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/farm_structure_statistics ) , though i assume that it could convert more over to agriculture if it made economic sense . 
  that 's enough to support about 350 million people at at us level . 
  the eu-28 needs 510 million .
