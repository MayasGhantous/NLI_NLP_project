  mcdonalds uses all beef , but you * can * bulk up beef by mixing it with [ tvp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/textured_vegetable_protein ) -- basically part-soy , part-meat burgers . 
  also somewhat reduces the calories . 
    what the fuck they ruined mcdonalds   mcdonald 's are never the cheapest option . 
  might explain it . 
  as fast food goes , they 're pretty cheap over here . 
  honestly , europe looks pretty similar to my non-drinking eye to even mass-market beers in the us : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer_in_germany  the alcohol-by-volume , or abv , content of beers in germany is usually between 4.7 % and 5.4 % for most traditional brews . 
  http://www.fermentarium.com/industry/beer-industry/canadian-beer-vs-american-beer-the-alcohol-content-battle/ the abv table listed here looks pretty similar . 
  average of the us beers there is 4.81 , which is maybe slightly lower , but not * that * much . 
  ... and just as someone colorizes the black-and-white images on the sub today , someone 3dgram-ifies the image with a depth inference program .

  of course * you 'd * say that . 
  clearly the wrong move . 
  there is youtube views potential here , and he probably has a phone . 
   did you just assume my gender http://www.hackerfactor.com/genderguesser.php#analyze genre : informal female = 578 male = 694 difference = 116 ; 54.55 % verdict : weak male weak emphasis could indicate european .

  i like how this thread is a combination of complaining how expensive beer prices are and talking about stealing the glasses ... 
  the problem in sf is the ability to block housing construction . 
  should be able to say `` you can choose where it happens , but not * whether * it happens . '', 
   in britain , the greys , which were introduced in the late 19th century from north america , appear to be exterminating the reds . 
  clearly our squirrels are * superior * squirrels . 
  that 's not really what the question is -- as i understand it , there 's some dispute over whether he would be willing to say that he 'd * ever * use them , which is kind of necessary to have a deterrent . 
  the reasonable answer for any politician is `` i would seek to avoid things reaching that point with as much energy as possible , but if it became necessary , yes , i would certainly make use of nuclear weapons . '', 
  i 'd guess that he 's said things in the past that would conflict with this . 
  be pretty fantastic for airport bookstores , though . 
   but because usa dream of destroying us oh , for fuck 's sake . 
  before ukraine , [ most of the us public thought about russia in vaguely-positive terms ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/1642/russia.aspx ) . 
  ukraine sent russia into a terminal tailspin into disliked territory . 
  today [ russia 's back in `` enemy '' territory ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/03/upshot/which-country-do-americans-like-most-for-republicans-its-australia.html?_r=0 ) , but that was post-crimea . 
  hmm . 
  that `` asiatic mode of production '' just sounds like a non-industrialized agrarian society , and i am pretty sure that modern russia is n't really any of those . 
  it says that villages are largely autarkic -- he 's talking about decentralized production . 
  there are no more village blacksmiths , and it looks like russia today is ~ 75 % urban . 
  modern russia 's economy is [ heavily dependent upon fossil fuel extraction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:2014_russia_products_exports_treemap.png ) . 
  is n't it normal to permit patenting these ? 
  i mean , i 'm pretty sure that everyone permits you to patent something produced via artificial selection , and that 's driven by simply waiting for mutations and choosing the right ones . 
  my understanding is that the present vote distribution is favorable to the tories : remember , it 's a series of electoral regions voting rather than a popular vote . 
   the battle itself was almost anti-climactic , because the 45,000 men who traveled on 200 portuguese ships caught the defenders of ceuta off guard . 
  by nightfall the town was captured . 
  thousands `` killed or taken prisoner '' . 
  might have easily been that most were taken prisoner ( or killed in captivity ; war is n't pretty ) . 
  it sounds like they might have just sailed up to ceuta and ceuta more-or-less surrendered . 
  calling it a `` battle '' might be a bit ambitious . 
   is it possible to land a relatively `` mid/high paying '' job in western europe ( like spain , portugal , italy , switzerland ) ? 
  define `` mid/high paying '' . 
  could be that he got legal residency via another route ( e.g. 
  married a german citizen ) . 
   if we give people any reliable way to turn a denied asylum application into defacto citizenship , we 'll get fucked sooner or later . 
  also : * it makes asylum denial meaningless . 
  * if you * did * have that happen , you 'd just have policy changes to asylum to eliminate abuse of the system ( e.g. 
  eliminating appeals , creating streamlined processes for summary rejection in some cases , etc ) . 
  that creates room for error where people who should n't have been deported are . 
   if you ca n't make a case in that timeframe it sounds like they had , the family was ordered out , and the family had been burning through appeals to stall . 
  which , frankly , makes sense from their standpoint , but ... look at the other side of the coin : they were using a generous appeals system . 
  were those people planning on going to montenegro ? 
  i mean , not saying that they were n't , but ... 
   seeing as you neither know how much he got or how much he currently has you just do n't know . 
  no , but there have been many folks who have run down estimates , and there 's not that much variation in the numbers . 
   he lives a much more lavish lifestyle than his dad ever did so ? 
  warren buffet lives a comparatively toned-down life , and he 's wealthier than trump . 
  well , an obvious answer would be that in 1916 , there was no independent irish state , and at that time there had been real grievances with the management of the british , like the famines . 
  none of those hold true today . 
  [ < curiously looks at comment history  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/5xzfsk/a_full_list_of_the_names_of_the_796_babies_who/demu4vz/ ) well , you definitely do n't like british people , that 's for sure . 
   both partitionist states are corrupt to the core need to be destroyed . 
    i would be in favour of those who have participated in the government of these states being charged with crimes against the people , among other things , in revolutionary courts . 
  `` first against the wall when the revolution comes '' in a literal sense ... 
  [ wikipedia : red brigades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_brigades ) for anyone else who is n't familiar with them . 
  `` millions '' , yes -- which is very different from `` million '' , and was what you 'd get if you 'd just taken the money and put it in the s&p 500 , which is substantially lower-risk . 
  eh , looks like it was closer to a decade . 
  no , [ 2006 ] ( http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2006/s060608m.htm ) . 
  well , to do that , you 'd have to have a high barrier to entry in steel production ( i guess so ... not trivial to build the infrastructure ) and have a market fully-dominated by china . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_steel_production there are just too many other sources of steel that can scale up . 
  because having domestic steel production can have security implications , countries will tend to subsidize to maintain some domestic production : i 'd say that it 's a bad good to be trying to do that with . 
  i 'm not a guru on chinese politics , but i find the `` the main driving factor is a concern for domestic political stability '' argument pretty plausible . 
  china over-predicted demand , and coupled with the fact that funding steel production is politically-popular in china with important blocs -- just as it is in the us or in the eu -- it becomes politically difficult to scale down , and the idea of eating some losses until demand picks back up again looks like an acceptable tradeoff . 
  i see the present steel overproduction as a decided negative for china , not a profitable industrial strategy in competing with the rest of the world . 
  it exists and someone already submitted this . 
  was n't there just some fight where some people felt that minimum wage was too unequal across the eu , so french truckers needed protection or something ? 
   same thing happened in nazi germany , people did what they believed the furher wanted . 
  well , the phrasing he used sure is n't going to clear up any confusion about what putin wants . 
   `` federal eu '' however is just a pro-eu fanatic 's wet dream , nothing more . 
  * i * think that federation would be advantageous to the eu ... 
   created specifically to antagonise them i do n't think that the us , the uk , canada , france , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , italy , portugal , norway , denmark , and iceland all sat down together seventy years ago and asked `` how can we * really * piss off the russians ? '', 
  why would an eu federation be less-desirable than the russian federation ? 
  well , technically [ trump was only republican between 1987-1999 , 2009-2011 , and 2012-now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_trump ) . 
  he was a democrat up until 1987 and then was reform party between 1999 and 2001 , then democrat again between 2001 and 2009 , and later independent between 2011 and 2012 . 
  he changes political affiliations a lot . 
  i dunno ... i 've read some pretty impressively dumb things on this subreddit . 
   sure it was always an issue , but trump is making it a german specific issue . 
  well , sorry . 
  i do n't particularly like trump 's politics or style or diplomatic approach , but he is what he is . 
  i just did a search to see what 's coming up in twitter , and i see a single comment : `` we have a massive trade deficit with germany , plus they pay far less than they should on nato & military . 
  very bad for u.s. 
  this will change '' . 
   and its not just done for political effect , his tweets are backed by the white house . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean -- he * is * the white house . 
  if you mean that there are press releases that are a bigger concern ... well , i just [ did a search through white house press releases ] ( https://search.usa.gov/search?query=germany&amp;op=search&amp;affiliate=wh ) , and it seems mostly like traditional-for-the-us-outside-of-trump bland , positive things . 
   also we will not go into debt over military spending , that would be political suicide . 
  well , i agree that it would n't make sense to go into debt on a continued spending issue . 
  debt 's useful for one-off spending .
