  no automated battery-swapping infrastructure , little charging infrastructure . 
  charging is much slower than filling a fuel tank . 
  i dunno if europe 's energy grid is capable of supporting an electric vehicle-based transit system -- our own is definitely not . 
  mass transit ? 
  imposes a lot of limitations and makes huge amounts of existing infrastructure not viable . 
  while i give it just about a zero probability of happening , that * is * [ basically what happened in 1969 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sino-soviet_border_conflict#eastern_border ) . 
   they practiced a nuclear attack on our capital as well and we are not even in nato . 
  while i think that this is unwise diplomacy , at the end of the day , i 'd call it diplomacy rather than actual war preparations . 
  if russia really wanted to engage in military action x against country y , they probably are n't going to expose their war plans . 
  when russia invaded ukraine , it came abruptly , not in the wake of `` practice runs '' doing the same thing against the same locations in the past . 
  ditto for all the world war ii-era stuff . 
  i do n't think that there 's any point where russia 's pretended to attack a location and then has actually done so in the same way . 
  rather , the goal here would be intimidation , not preparation for an actual attack . 
   this is just false propaganda , the meassures taken against russia started many years ago any sort of russian aggression , the us started building missile bases for that purpose before any russian aggression . 
  you 're talking about the interceptors used in the anti-ballistic missile shield ? 
  for those , like me , who do n't speak romanian , google translate says that `` un om cu pula mare '' is `` a man with a big dick '' . 
  eh , not really the conventional meaning of the term . 
  increase military spending ? 
  are you just summing all state media budget , not limiting it to international broadcasting ? 
  i mean , if you 're gon na include domestic state-funded russian media , the numbers are gon na go up there too . 
  it [ looks like some launch systems have greater gto capacity than ariane 5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_orbital_launch_systems ) ( long march 5 , delta iv heavy ) , but i assume that they have n't actually put up a gto payload that 's larger . 
   however much trump `` digs coal '' , he can not force companies to build coal-fired power stations if wind and solar are cheaper and executives are smart enough to realise that a billion-dollar bet on a new plant -- likely to be closed by trump 's successor -- is not a winner . 
  that has n't been proposed , and i doubt that it would be . 
  i agree that if * unsubsidized * solar or wind become the cheapest option , there will probably be a shift towards them . 
  it 's not coal that they need to beat at the moment , though -- it 's natural gas , which is extremely cheap and abundant due to hydrofracking and which is replacing coal for power generation in the us . 
  * that 's [ not a full list of caucuses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caucuses_of_the_united_states_congress ) . 
  * i would n't really call caucuses as comparable to parties either , because , for example , a voter would n't directly support a caucus . 
  i suspect that it 's closer to call the ngos that people support comparable to parties . 
  so , for example , there are some [ pirate parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirate_party ) in europe ( well , there 's one in the us , but it 's not really a serious matter ) , whereas the [ eff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic_frontier_foundation ) might be the closest equivalent as an `` interface '' to an issue here . 
  from what i can tell -- i 'm not a poli sci expert -- party disclipline is typically stronger in parliamentary systems . 
  so in the us , the party has a limited ability to force legislators who belong to the party to vote in a particular way . 
  whereas in some other systems , it 's expected in at least some situations that the legislator vote as the party directs him . 
  if that kind of strong party discipline exited in the us , you could n't have groups shifting around within the party . 
  imposing carbon tax requires tracking processes and inputs during production . 
  also , * probably * most us exports do n't have much carbon emission associated with them relative to their value . 
  steel or cement would , but jet engines or movies do n't . 
  i 'm definitely against near-term manned space missions , though not against terraforming and colonization of other planets . 
  sending a man to mars is largely a pr matter . 
  it 's much preferable to use robots instead of humans humans to do most work , and it will be a long time before you 'd want to send physical humans out to a terraformed mars . 
  there 's also a glut of problems that you could solve on earth . 
  for example , are you going to bioengineer organisms to do terraforming ? 
  germany 's [ built a facility to simulate the martian surface conditions ] ( http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/20120515-earth-life-survive-mars.html ) that can handle that . 
  then you need to get consensus that we should do this . 
  right now , the goal is to avoid introducing any terrestrial life to other planets . 
  then you 'd need to construct a ton of hardware . 
  you 'll have all this stuff done in trial form on earth before going through it on mars . 
  sending someone out to mars and then back just does n't do anything particularly useful to advance terraforming , and it consumes resources that could be used for more-cost-effective robotic missions . 
  yeah , it 's tough to `` rise from beneath '' without being focused on some regional issue . 
  that being said , us political parties are more comparable to persistent coalitions , so not having new parties also is n't as much of an impact as it would be if you were only able to take two parties in a typical european party system . 
  possibly , but i 'd still guess that the term 's just being used loosely . 
  that * may * be what he did or intended to do . 
  i suspect that the stories on this are a bit loose on terminology . 
  also , you multiple-replied -- may want to delete the other replies . 
  heh , i wonder if that law about losing ability to hold office for ten years will go through before any charges on this guy take effect . 
  dude , i really think that you 're trying hard to shape my comment into something it 's not . 
  not every comment about trump is endorsing or not endorsing him or needs to be doing so . 
  the [ legal argument being made ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/276668-president-obamas-signing-of-the-paris-agreement-is ) is that the process via which the paris agreement was approved in the us was via a route in us law that is not permitted to bind future administrations . 
  if so , obama would not have had the authority to sign the us up for anything beyond the end of his term . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executive_agreement it looks like the [ argument being made ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/276668-president-obamas-signing-of-the-paris-agreement-is ) is that because it never passed the ratification process required for treaties , it may not bind future administrations -- any binding power ended with obama 's administration . 
  i am not familiar with the basis in law for that , but independent of this agreement , i think that i agree with the trump administration 's reasoning here -- independent of the law , it probably is not desirable to let presidents bind future presidents without the involvement of the senate . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_clause  presidents have regarded the article ii treaty process as necessary where an international accord would bind a future president . 
  for example , theodore roosevelt explained :    the constitution did not explicitly give me power to bring about the necessary agreement with santo domingo . 
  but the constitution did not forbid my doing what i did . 
  i put the agreement into effect , and i continued its execution for two years before the senate acted ; and i would have continued it until the end of my term , if necessary , without any action by congress . 
  but it was far preferable that there should be action by congress , so that we might be proceeding under a treaty which was the law of the land and not merely by a direction of the chief executive which would lapse when that particular executive left office . 
  i therefore did my best to get the senate to ratify what i had done . 
  [ 12 ]   a sole-executive agreement can only be negotiated and entered into through the president 's authority ( 1 ) in foreign policy , ( 2 ) as commander-in-chief of the armed forces , ( 3 ) from a prior act of congress , or ( 4 ) from a prior treaty . 
  [ 1 ] agreements beyond these competencies must have the approval of congress ( for congressional-executive agreements ) or the senate ( for treaties ) . 
  in fact , i 'd argue that `` fast track '' authority probably is n't a good idea either ... 
  anyway , it may come down to a legal fight in the us , i suppose . 
  i 'd argue that it 's a bad move for california -- past restrictions on coal power have been economically-disadvantageous to california . 
  as i said , i 'm not making a statement about whether what trump does is `` good '' or `` bad '' . 
  i did n't endorse trump -- i do n't much like him . 
  but the `` trump is a brain-damaged incompetent '' line of thought is just wrong . 
  i do n't read it , but [ checking wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:online_magazines ) turns up some likely-looking candidates : * [ eurozine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurozine ) . 
  * [ newly swissed ] ( http://www.newlyswissed.com/ ) i ca n't read italian , but [ any of these are potential candidates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_magazines_in_italy ) . 
  i usually think of * the economist * as dealing with the whole world . 
  i mean , i guess it may have more focus on western european politics than it does the rest of the world , but i think it spends more ink following where something interesting economically is happening in the world . 
  if zimbabwe is seeing hyperinflation or there 's a dispute over chinese trade , it 's going to be talking about that . 
   the german transport ministry said it has asked volkswagen 's ( vowg_p . de ) luxury division to recall around 24,000 a7 and a8 models built between 2009 and 2013 eh , that 's a comparatively-small number . 
  i mean , this is n't on par with the earlier scandal . 
  oh , i wo n't call him a great orator . 
  but this clip * also * is n't representative : * this specific quote was chosen specifically because it 's the most-egregious example out there of him speaking poorly . 
  that is , it 's not r representative of what he normally says . 
  bush had similar gotchas : think of `` rarely is the question asked : is our childrens learning ? '', 
  it was a popular nerf bat to beat bush up with , and you had people saying that bush must be brain-damaged or barely-able to function . 
  sure , bush made errors ... but that was n't representative of what he normally says . 
  * spoken english text differs substantially from written english text . 
  if you take a transcript of just about anyone speaking , it 's pretty unimpressive compared to something intended to be written . 
  spoken english uses shorter sentences , not-strictly-grammatically-correct sentences are common , and it tends to look kinda disorganized . 
  conversational english normally looks pretty awkward if you 're reading a transcript . 
  if you try reading closed caption transcripts of , say , a television interview , they tend to look pretty bad . 
  trump is probably one of the worst us presidents as speaking goes . 
  but he 's also not simply brain-damaged and unable to function on a daily basis either -- and that 's the impression you 'll get if you cherry-pick things . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terraforming_of_mars  challenges and limitations   * low gravity and pressure : the surface gravity on mars is 38 % of that on earth . 
    * breathing on mars : current conditions in the martian atmosphere at less than 1 kpa of atmospheric pressure , are significantly below the armstrong limit of 6 kpa where very low pressure causes exposed bodily liquids such as saliva , tears , and the liquids wetting the alveoli within the lungs to boil away . 
  without a pressure suit , no amount of breathable oxygen delivered by any means will sustain life for more than a few minutes . 
  [ 10 ] [ 11 ] in the nasa technical report * rapid ( explosive ) decompression emergencies in pressure-suited subjects * , after exposure to pressure below the armstrong limit , a survivor reported that his ... `` last conscious memory was of the water on his tongue beginning to boil . 
  '' [ 11 ] in these conditions humans die within minutes unless a pressure suit provides life support . 
    * countering the effects of space weather : mars lacks a magnetosphere , which poses challenges for mitigating solar radiation and retaining atmosphere .
