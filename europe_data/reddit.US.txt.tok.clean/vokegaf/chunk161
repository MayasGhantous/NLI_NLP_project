  it is thought that the localized fields detected on mars are remnants of a magnetosphere that collapsed early in its history . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terraforming_of_venus  adjustments to the existing environment of venus to support human life would require at least three major changes to the planet . 
  [ 3 ] these three changes are closely interrelated , because venus 's extreme temperature is due to the greenhouse effect caused by its dense carbon-dioxide atmosphere :   * reducing venus 's surface temperature of 462 \u00b0 c ( 864 \u00b0 f ) . 
    * eliminating most of the planet 's dense 9.2 mpa ( 91 atm ) carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide atmosphere , via removal or conversion to some other form . 
    * addition of breathable oxygen to the atmosphere . 
  well , i have n't read the legislation ( and i assume that it 's in french ) , but i vaguely guess that this is just a summary and that there 's some sort of more-concrete legal definition in french law for `` concern their honesty '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_rates corporate tax , united states : 35 % + 0-12 % state/local https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/corporate-tax-rate  the [ average ] corporate tax rate in the united states stands at 38.90 percent . 
  looks like cameroon comes close , at 38 % , but i think that we 're still world champions . 
   let 's not fool ourselves , the trends point to the right direction already with solar reaching parity with coal . 
  i know that people are irked with trump , but we 've talked about this before : this is probably intentional . 
  most politicians are going to be members of an `` elite '' -- better-educated , better-read . 
  many have a legal background . 
  using wording that they might use on a regular basis personally is not going to be ideal for addressing the public . 
  that 's not specific to politicians -- it 's also true of journalists , authors , and all sorts of other folks . 
  if you 're writing for a general audience , you 're going to need to `` write down '' to them . 
  they 're not going to get your clever allusions to literature that * you * get because you got an english degree . 
  this is a goal that editors actively seek . 
  it 's not a negative -- it requires discipline . 
  trump is trying to sell the general population on something . 
  the swing voters he 's targeting are generally not-very-highly-educated . 
  additionally , trump is frequently aiming for sound bites or twitter comments -- short comments that are broadly-accessible and easy to remember , so you have short comments . 
  the problem is that you 're sitting here in what amounts to a pretty rarefied atmosphere -- a lot of multilingual folks . 
  hell , we 've had * ad hoc * linguistics discussions here . 
  i can throw latin snippits in and be pretty comfortable that people will get 'em . 
  saying that trump is dumb because he does n't aim to sound erudite to the people on this forum is missing the point . 
  he 's not trying to , and if he were , it 'd be a strategic mistake . 
   why empty ? 
  the deal the uk will have with the eu has to be worse than the one it has now : that is what brexit means . 
  why , after all , would the eu offer better terms to a non-member ? 
  so , it will be bad . 
  i disagree with the logic here . 
  okay , first , using `` bad deal '' rather than any specifics means that may is just using political rhetoric anyway , so you 're arguing against fluff -- you ca n't really prove or disprove that a deal is bad . 
  `` more integration is always good '' is clearly not the standard that the british public was aiming for , else they 'd not have voted for brexit in the first place . 
  there is * some * level of tradeoff : they get utility from distance on some things , lose it on others . 
  i do n't know whether * i * would make the tradeoff , but the * prima facie * argument here does n't stand up -- it 's not the case that may * must * achieve a `` bad deal '' . 
   any person convicted of a crime or offence concerning their honesty would be banned from public office for 10 years . 
  i 'd point out that this may sound good , but remember what happens if you ever wind up with abuse of the judicial system -- you can ban politicians from holding office . 
   among religions ? 
  yeah , possibly . 
  bearing in mind , of course , that religion overall is losing ground , no , it is n't . 
  atheism is declining . 
  there is correlation between the beliefs of parents and their children , and atheists have a low fertility rate compared to theists . 
  [ pew research : why people with no religion are projected to decline as a share of the world 's population ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/why-people-with-no-religion-are-projected-to-decline-as-a-share-of-the-worlds-population/ ) . 
    i mean the left-centre . 
    by no estimation is clinton left wing . 
  by us standards , clinton is center-left . 
  relative to the german center , that may not be the case . 
  well ... party changeovers , where a challenging party takes one of the big two slots , are extraordinarily rare . 
  the last time it happened in the us was 163 years ago , when the republican party took a slot . 
  however , when they do happen , the collapse and replacement of the dying incumbent party does tend to be pretty complete . 
  i mean , non-trump-supporting right-wingers [ do read it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_review ) and it does shape public opinion . 
  you were going to expect something like this . 
  it 's not good in terms of moving towards long-term right-wing anti-german nationalist backlash extending beyond the trump crowd . 
  too ill-defined and abusable , imho . 
  trying to purge ownership gets pretty hard in the modern world . 
  you get into the fact that most companies are publicly owned and start considering who who owns shares in the company . 
  or maybe you only do business with privately-owned companies ... but then , do they float corporate bonds ? 
  the capital being used is coming from somewhere too ... 
  [ fight the powah !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xheku5yn2rs ), 
  why do you keep posting that it 's a `` uk/usa '' paper ? 
  that 's not what anything in wp 's history of it has : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_moscow_times  derk sauer , a ** dutch ** publisher who came to moscow in 1989 , made plans to turn his small , twice-weekly paper called the moscow guardian into a world-class daily newspaper . 
  -  until 2005 , the paper was owned by independent media , a ** moscow ** - registered publishing house ... -  that year , independent media was acquired by the ** finnish ** publishing group sanoma . 
  -  in 2015 , sanoma sold moscowtimes llc to demyan kudryavtsev , ** a former director of kommersant ** . 
  i wonder if that round is live . 
  also his using his position to try to block the investigation is probably illegal . 
   instead , they do n't say anything , and when it 's leaked to the press , they do n't remember anything about them . 
  or plead the fifth amendment to avoid self-incrimination via testimony . 
  or try to figure out ways to avoid turning over subpoenaed documents . 
   do you think it 's monaco , luxembourg and the cayman islands that are protecting the world ? 
  < look of disapproval  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_luxembourg  during the korean war , luxembourg contributed a 44-man contingent , attached to the belgian contingent , to the united nations force . 
  luxembourg achieved the dual distinction of deploying the largest proportion of its military force ( 10 % ) amongst all states contributing to the united nations forces , and suffering the highest proportion of casualty ( more than one third ) amongst all united nations contingents . 
   that does n't work because unlike population there 's no relationship between the number of corporations registered in a country and the cost of services needed . 
  if germany ca n't track the revenue involved to the point where it can actually assess the tax in a reasonable way , why not just zero corporate tax and raise an easier-to-track type of tax to make up for it ? 
  well , technically [ soes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state-owned_enterprise ) are . 
  supposing that federal taxes were used to fund a system akin to social security in the us , which provides a bare minimum in retirement or being disabled for everyone in the country . 
  would you favor it under those conditions ? 
   if you do n't play by the rules * is * ireland not following the rules ? 
  the us does not have minimum taxes across states ( and in fact , companies frequently negotiate tax breaks in deciding where to set up ) . 
  that being said , we also charge federal taxes , and you 're kinda stuck with those , so ... 
   tax heavens [ tax havens ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tax_haven ), 
  yeah , i rolled back to the `` parent '' fonts . 
  given that it 's search recommendations in the us , i suspect that it 's someone trying to understand the difference in the acceptability of displaying the flag here and in germany . 
  on a typical drive to work or somewhere , i can see many flagpoles flying the us flag . 
  i can see it on garage doors . 
  i can not infrequently see cars flying little us flags . 
  people wear clothing with the flag . 
  in fact ... i 'm writing this next to a parked car , and i just looked over , and it has some sort of painted wooden american flag in the window about eight feet from me . 
  germany ( and europe in general , as i understand it , but especially germany ) had a post-wwii backlash against nationalism , which included flying national flags . 
  my bet is that someone got a slightly-mangled version of that and was trying to figure out what the deal was . 
  yeah , but that query is in the context of its us usage , where it 's a drop in for `` left '' . 
  `` why is germany ignoring the plight of x in country y ? 
  why is germany so inhumane ? '', 
  and `` why is germany doing thing x in country y which has bad side effect z ? 
  why is germany so inhumane ? '', 
  from california : * why is sweden so liberal * why is sweden neutral * why is sweden not in nato * why is sweden so rich if we use `` why does '' instead of `` why is '' : * why does sweden have an embassy in north korea * why does sweden have high taxes * why does sweden hate denmark * why does sweden have high rape statistics, 
  actually ... i 'm kinda curious . 
  what typefaces * were * developed over here ? 
  germany has a pretty prodigious history here .
