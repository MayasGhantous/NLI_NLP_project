  it was more that a couple years ago it was used as a place where center left policies had been adopted . 
  you had a lot of center-left media in the us publishing only positive points from scandinavia . 
  i think that the cartoon was printed in my high school textbook . 
   [ this cartoon - ' a chain of friendship ' - appeared in the american newspaper the brooklyn eagle in july 1914 . 
  the caption read : `` if austria attacks serbia , russia will fall upon austria , germany upon russia , and france and england upon germany . '' ] ( http://www.johndclare.net/images/alliances.gif ) pretty accurate . 
  also , `` is '' , taking my favorite of the top four instead of the top one ( which is often `` is x a country '' or `` is x safe '' , which appears to be a major concern for american tourists ... ) : * is ireland in the uk * is the uk part of europe * is iceland in the eu * is portugal safe * is spain in the eu * is france a democracy * is belgium part of the uk * is the netherlands dutch * is luxembourg a city * is norway socialist * is sweden socialist * is finland real * is estonia nordic * is latvia part of russia * is lithuania slavic * is denmark socialist * is germany a democracy * is switzerland in the eu * is italy in france * is austria in germany * is the czech republic communist * is hungary a third world country * is slovakia in russia * is slovenia part of russia * is croatia part of schengen * is serbia part of russia * is bosnia in the eu * is albania a third world country * is greece in the eu * is bulgaria in europe * is turkey in the middle east * is romania slavic * is ukraine part of nato * is belarus in the eu * is russia in asia ; is russia communist ; is russia part of nato ; is russia in the un had to put all of them , as the four together made me chuckle . 
  * is poland communist * is macedonia in greece * is fyrom macedonia * is kosovo independent * is malta part of italy and just for good measure : * is catalonia a country ; is catalonia a nation ; is catalonia a state ; is catalonia a city * is sicily its own country * is basque french or spanish * is bavaria in austria * is the sudetenland in czechoslovakia * is holland the netherlands * is northern ireland catholic, 
  hmm . 
  what language was it speaking in at the time ? 
   f one country has problems with tax evasion and other does n't , cheaters get more federal funds . 
  you mean working without reporting the employment , just pretending to be unemployed and drawing welfare ? 
  well , we give the federal government auditing power . 
  so if all your federal tax data goes into a computer and gets flagged as `` unlikely '' , it 's going to be the federal tax authority conducting an investigation , and federal tax evasion laws you 're breaking . 
   iif one country has a lot of corruption and awards contracts to brothers in law , it will spend more to accomplish less . 
  yes . 
  but that winds up hurting people in that state -- voters have a reason to want to avoid that . 
  and it does n't directly hurt people outside the state . 
   the number of things everyone can agree on is pretty low ; military and border security . 
  yeah , but that and foreign policy is pretty much the core of what the federal government does . 
  what was it that you wanted changed ? 
  i mean , i had hoped that the uk would be a force for economic liberalism in structuring the eu , but i 'm not sure that 's where you were coming from . 
  ** why is the united states ... ** * why is the united states an indirect democracy * why is the united states a republic * why is the united states not truly pluralistic * why is the united states in debt, 
  i mean , it * is * kinda odd for it to be called `` the emerald isle '' and be heavily associated with the color green when the uk is n't called green at all . 
  you 'd think that the climate would be similar . 
  in all fairness , i seem to remember some people calling cameron a coward over brexit , so ... 
  or you lot are using vpns terminating in the us ... 
  i 'm pretty sure that people in the us tend to know that spain and mexico are n't the same thing . 
  * nods * probably instincts , if it 's not at the conscious level . 
  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/business/international/unease-after-trump-depicts-tokyo-as-an-economic-rival.html?_r=0  as he does with china , mr. trump accuses japan of taking american jobs . 
    after his victories on super tuesday , he called out komatsu , a japanese manufacturer of construction machinery , saying the weak yen gave it an unfair advantage over its american rival caterpillar . 
  he pledged to use equipment from caterpillar and john deere , another american manufacturer , to build his promised wall on the border with mexico to keep out illegal immigrants . 
  not churchill , eh ? 
  if you speak at the level of the median voter , you 're hard to understand for half of your voters . 
  * reader 's digest * and probably other publications target a comparatively-low grade level in terms of vocabulary . 
  it 's to make what they write accessible to a broad swath of the general public . 
  there was some discussion a while back where there were two phones tweeting to his account with different tones , and it was believed that the android tweets ( mostly negative in tone ) were from trump and the iphone tweets ( mostly positive in tone , more in-line with conventional messaging ) were from his pr team . 
  trump carries an android phone . 
  no , it 's not a matter of interpretation . 
  member countries of nato were in iraq . 
  that is not the same as nato going into iraq . 
  if someone on your swim team independently goes out and swims the english channel , that does not mean that your swim team or you swam the english channel . 
  that 's talking about the eu , not nato . 
   public polices and culture see , this i do n't get . 
  federalization does n't mean homogenization -- members still have their own policies on things that are n't at the federal level . 
  and i have a hard time seeing where the kind of policies that typically show up at a federal level have a lot of tie-in . 
  can you give some examples of where there 'd be cultural or public policy conflict ? 
   how would that work ? 
  i imagine rather lucratively for northern ireland . 
   butter was cheaper on one side -- hide it in the pram and sit the child on top . 
  it was all the sweeter for being illicit . 
  that seems like marvelous potential for an unbelievable mess ... 
  i do n't know the legal specifics , but in general , i 'd think that it 'd be desirable to permit a supplier to fine a customer that does n't purchase a certain amount , since the supplier has to make production decisions based on demand . 
  i guess blocking re-export disallows price discrimination between customers . 
  i 'm split on that -- it permits using monopoly control over gas to economically hammer countries , but on the other hand , i understand that if you 're gon na have a monopoly supplier , permitting price discrimination is more economically-efficient . 
  if ukraine can re-export , russia will probably charge ukraine more . 
   federalization will never work why ? 
   solar is cheaper when unsubsidized power companies are building solar plants instead of coal or natural gas , then yes . 
  not what 's happening today . 
  that 's a problem with particulate matter , not carbon emissions . 
  well ... we do have the [ chicken tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax ) on light trucks . 
  yeah , but those are comparatively small drops . 
  for national leaders that get much visibility here : ** why does theresa may ... ** * why does theresa may want a hard brexit ** why does macron ... ** * why does macron wear two rings ** why does merkel ... ** * why does merkel want refugees * why does merkel hate the german flag ** why does putin ... ** * why does putin back assad * why does putin want ukraine * why does putin like assad * why does putin want assad in power * why does putin like trump for the hell of it : ** why does trump ... ** * why does trump want to be president * why does trump like russia * why does trump talk like a child * why does trump tweet * why does trump wear a long tie,

  `` now the uk ... the uk is normal . 
  the us on the right and greece on the left just need to straighten themselves out . '', 
   the range of these cars should be vastly improved to at least 500-600 km . 
  i am very doubtful that battery technology is going to radically improve . 
  we 've had lots of people banging on it , and we 've seen only small improvements . 
  i 'd suggest that if a country is serious about moving to electric vehicles , that a better route would be to build a robotic infrastructure for swapping batteries at charging stations . 
  stopping is n't as big a deal if all it means is that you have to drive up to a designated area and have an overhead arm swap out your batteries automatically , without you even needing to leave the vehicle . 
  perhaps down the road , self-driving technology would even make it possible to do the process automatically -- have a robotic `` battery swap '' vehicle come out and swap batteries , either while the vehicle is moving down the road , or when the vehicle is parked . 
  but ... that 's much more ambitious , and must be further down the road . 
  `` strive towards '' sounds very much like the terminology that shows up in non-binding us resolutions . 
  do you know whether the resolution is binding ? 
   the united states ' coalition partners in the war against the islamic state are responsible for at least 80 confirmed civilian deaths from airstrikes in iraq and syria , according to u.s. military officials . 
  yet none of their 12 allies will publicly concede any role in those casualties . 
  < shrug  okay , so it 's a political hot topic back home , maybe . 
  in what way would the us benefit from pushing on it ? 
  you know , the uk got a lot of shit on here for having a public that complained about competition on wages and wanted to limit the amount of competition from out east . 
  i realize that they were asking for much broader restrictions , and i realize that there 's a complicated political balancing act with the publics of multiple countries , but it does seem kinda awkward to blame british workers for being unwilling to compete in the open eu market , say that the single market does n't permit for this sort of thing , and then turn around and start passing protectionist policy . 
  climate change would be a concern insofar as it places pressure on agriculture . 
  if a country is already near its carrying capacity and dryer weather would reduce that capacity by n people , it 's easily dominated by several times the existing population showing up . 
   clearly it does something or there would n't be the need to back out . 
  sure , provides subsidies to companies manufacturing renewable energy systems . 
  which is great for china and maybe germany , but ... 
  were n't a lot of people here just complaining about the brexit referendum ? 
  spain and portugal kinda [ violate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( nominal \\ ) _ per_capita ) the `` generally , going westwards in europe means that the country has a higher per-capita gdp '' rule . 
  i mean , i 've probably plugged this into a search engine myself at some point . 
  for `` europe '' , i get : * why is europe called a peninsula of peninsulas not what i 'd expected . 
  after that : * why is europe so expensive * why is europe called europe * why is europe a continent * why is europe so liberal ( stateside , this means `` why is europe so far to the left ? '' ), 
  climate change is not particularly important as a factor producing pressures to migrate out of africa . 
  [ current un population projections are that africa will go from 1,186 million people today to 4,387 million people in 2100 . 
  ] ( https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/files/key_findings_wpp_2015.pdf ) europe will go from 738 million today to 646 million in 2100 . 
  that 's over four times europe 's present-day population that will be dropped into africa . 
  one way or another , europe will need to handle that phenomenon ... that 's going to be inevitable . 
  europe could take in maybe 100 million or so to maintain its population ( though that 'd be a higher rate than the migrant crisis peak rate , which made people extremely unhappy in europe ) , but that 's still a small fraction of the number of people involved , about 3 % of the number of people added to the equation . 
  ( i 'd also add that paris does n't appear to set any binding targets for carbon dioxide reduction . ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate note that germany is almost at the bottom of the list .
