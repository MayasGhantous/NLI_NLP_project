  my understanding is that there are some ways in which homeownership is considered a plus . 
  it does tend to encourage savings ( in the form of home equity ) , which one could argue is a plus ( though things like [ heloc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_equity_line_of_credit ) s , [ second mortgages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_mortgage ) , and similar let people draw from what they 've paid into their house ) . 
  it means that residents have a direct financial interest in their neighborhood not going to shit , since their house loses value ( though this also can manifest itself in the form of overly-restrictive [ hoas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homeowner_association ) ... not sure what the equivalent in europe is , and might just be local councils ) . 
  it means that people have a lot of assets in a form that is hard to hide or vanish overnight with , which helps taxation and the justice system . 
  on the other hand , people may take on more risk than they expect -- people do n't normally expect to see large drops in real estate value in a city , so when they happen , they can be pretty financially-devastating . 
  labor mobility may be impaired -- instead of just not renewing a lease and moving , if you make a long-distance job move , you have to deal with selling ( and maybe fixing up ) a house . 
  because owning real estate frequently involves a highly-leveraged investment with a large amount of money , you can get yourself into a lot of trouble ... and i have a pretty cynical view of how well the vast bulk of homeowners normally understand the financial implications of what they 're doing , whether it 's a second mortgage bypassing a state 's requirement for mortgages to be [ non-recourse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonrecourse_debt ) in the us , whether people do n't understand the total cost imposed by interest , whether it 's people understanding the restrictions that [ rent-to-own ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rent-to-own ) brings ( including the rent-to-buy business popular in the uk ) , or the risks associated with adjustable-rate loans . 
  i 'm increasingly thinking that germany may have it right -- that a lower rate of homeownership may be advantageous . 
  a lot of the financial craziness that has happened in recent years has been associated with homeownership . 
   at the same time , due to many factors like low house ownership rates and a paranoia when it comes to capital markets many germans , while having a good and stable income , still do n't accrue any wealth . 
  i 'd really like to find a good metric for `` wealth '' . 
  many measurements use `` net wealth '' . 
  in * some * cases , that makes sense . 
  if , for example , i have $ 10k in credit card debt and $ 20k in cash , then it 's meaningful to say that i have $ 10k in assets . 
  but if i live in a $ 1m house on which i have paid down $ 500k , i have $ 500k in equity , in `` owned house '' , and $ 500k of debt remaining . 
  it does not make sense to say that i have $ 0 in assets , because i can normally sell the house to get something in the neighborhood of my $ 500k in equity out . 
  i 'd like to have an easy way of comparing countries by `` how much money could the median adult scrape up if they had to liquidate all their assets and pay down their debts '' . 
   the difference is that trump does n't go around insulting countries . 
  this is over a year old now , but the new york times has an article : '' [ the 331 people , places , and things donald trump has insulted on twitter ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html ) '' time : [ all the times he 's insulted mexico ] ( http://time.com/4473972/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-insult/ ) he called trudeau [ `` canada 's worst president yet '' ] ( http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/trump-trudeau-canadas-worst-president-yet/ ) . 
  telegraph : [ donald trump savages japan , saying all they will do is ` watch sony tvs ' if us is attacked and threatening to ` walk ' away from treaty ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/donald-trump-savages-japan-saying-all-they-will-do-is-watch-sony/ ) have you been paying any attention at all to trump ? 
  he 's constantly insulting things . 
   while they define themselves using terms that was cnn using the phrase . 
  that was n't macron or merkel . 
  trump has little personal appeal in europe . 
  neither are likely to want to try to associate themselves with his image to draw public approval . 
  well , you 've got [ petting zoos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petting_zoo ) with sheep . 
  people do pay a premium for things like merino wool rugs or clothing , and i 've seen places make tourist experiences out of manufacturing industry like that . 
  in west virginia , the glass industry was long since whacked by overseas manufacturing , automation , and cheaper labor . 
  but , by converting themselves into a tourist attraction ( you can watch workers hand-blowing glass artworks from viewing areas , go through a tour , be routed through a tourist shop selling the created wares at a premium , go through etc ) , [ blenko glass ] ( http://www.blenko.com/ ) managed to maintain a successful business . 
  i 'd imagine that it 's probably possible to do that with wool goods as well -- convert a business processing wool and producing goods from it into a tourist attraction . 
  at the end of a day , a rodeo is a glamorized spectator sport showing someone just doing work rounding up horses . 
  if you can do it with horses , you can probably do it with sheep . 
  here 's [ mutton busting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oekjceargg8&amp;t=1m41s ) , and while it looks like [ competitive sheep herding ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myue85vp8em ) is primarily of local interest , i suppose that if you can do what happened with [ dog shows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmtems9yrvo&amp;t=4m43s ) you can attract folks . 
  if it 's possible to [ do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go6cpdstksg ) successful [ garlic festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mzn6hk2vq ) , i 'd imagine that it 's entirely-possible to do it with mutton . 
  it looks like some people already do [ mutton barbecue festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx1eyebom5s ) . 
  i mean , i 'd imagine that if you 're looking to do tourism based on sheep and play your cards right , it 's probably viable . 
   in contrast ms may has jokingly suggested [ she and the us president might be attracted to each other ] ( https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/theresa-may-donald-trump-opposites-attract-ahead-of-meeting-with-us-president-a7548141.html ) o_o < clicks on link   theresa may meets donald trump : pm says ` opposites attract ' ahead of meeting with us president that 's a polite way of distancing from him . 
  it 's a criticism hidden in a compliment to soften it . 
  second , what does the title have to do with the article ? 
   policies that put europe 's security at risk there is literally nothing in the article body that has anything to do with europe 's security . 
  it 's entirely about the paris climate agreement . 
   it 's easier to form a government ( and to keep it alive ) with a small number of parties sharing general ideas see , here 's my cynical position on this . 
  the reason that it 's really hard for another party to get going under fptp is that you must `` throw out '' your vote for another party all the way up until it reaches second or third place . 
  that is , you must * actively weaken * the party that you most favor . 
  it is disadvantageous to a voter to permit a third party to rise up and challenge existing parties . 
  let 's say that i 'm far-left , and there 's a center-right and center-left party . 
  i 'd prefer the center-left party of those two options . 
  to vote for a new , far-left party , i have to intentionally strengthen the center-right party all the way up until my far-left party gets a seat . 
  and unless it 's a regional party , i 'll be disadvantaging the left in general until my far-left party actually takes a majority . 
  that 's a system that strongly favors incumbents , because it is in a voter 's interest not to permit challengers to arise . 
  in the us , i would not expect either the democrats or republicans to support moving away from fptp , because it effectively blocks challengers from arising . 
  it essentially requires one to disintegrate or become * incredibly * unpopular for the party to die . 
  pr does n't intrinsically have that characteristic ( well , to a degree , in that you have to get enough votes to earn one seat ) ... * but * thresholds re-introduce it to a degree , because until your party breaks the threshold , your vote is only weakening the party you 'd most-want of those who can win seats . 
  the higher the threshold , the greater the effect . 
  i 'm ( and maybe i 'm just too cynical about this ) kinda suspicious that the reason thresholds exist in pr is more to protect incumbent parties against challengers easily showing up ... 
  okay , perhaps i am using the terminology loosely in my above comment . 
  i was using the term `` other countries '' here to mean `` all other countries '' . 
  it 's possible for china to always export more to japan than it imports , japan to always export more to south korea than it imports , and south korea to always export more to china than it imports . 
  but in that case , you still have a long-run trade equilibrium for each country -- each is exporting more to one country and importing more to another . 
   best case scenario is neither surplus nor deficit . 
  not with individual countries . 
  that 'd constrain trade unnecessarily , be less-efficient . 
  in the short term ? 
  sure , you can have a net surplus or deficit , but that 's not `` bad '' -- and it balances itself . 
  export more than you import , and your currency strengthens , wages rise in real terms , and you become too-expensive to compete with other countries , and your exports slow . 
  import more than you export and your currency weakens , wages fall in real terms , and you become a more-appealing source relative to other countries , and your exports increase . 
  it 's not something that requires active management . 
  really ? 
  they 're not the ones that seem to be complaining . 
  you 're british , and gitarooman87 is american . 
  i do n't see why that is a problem . 
  let 's say we have 100 seats , and nine parties : | party | vote | | - | - :| | a | 30 % | | b | 22 % | | c | 16 % | | d | 14 % | | e | 4 % | | f | 4 % | | g | 4 % | | h | 4 % | | i | 2 % | so , with a 5 % threshold , they get : | party | seats | | - | - :| | a | 48 | | b | 22 | | c | 16 | | d | 14 | without a 5 % threshold , they get : | party | vote | | - | - :| | a | 30 | | b | 22 | | c | 16 | | d | 14 | | e | 4 | | f | 4 | | g | 4 | | h | 4 | | i | 2 | with the threshold , we 're probably going to get a+b , a+c , or a+d . 
  without the threshold , we might get : a+b , a+c+d , a+c+e+i , or a number of other combinations . 
  sure , in the first one , a automatically gets a small party 's seats without having to `` do '' anything for them. , and in the second , they do . 
  but why is that bad ? 
  after all , sure , e is a small party . 
  but , then , having people who represent at least half the people 's interests involved in the ruling coalition would seem to make sense . 
  and even with thresholding , d could potentially be in coalition with threshold , and hold the larger b or c hostage . 
  what 's magic about the 5 % threshold that makes this okay ? 
   gorby because he still called himself a communist i mean , economically , it does n't look like he was a huge change . 
   the purpose of reform was to prop up the centrally planned economy -- not to transition to market socialism . 
  speaking in late summer 1985 to the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the east european communist parties , gorbachev said : `` many of you see the solution to your problems in resorting to market mechanisms in place of direct planning . 
  some of you look at the market as a lifesaver for your economies . 
  but , comrades , you should not think about lifesavers but about the ship , and the ship is socialism . '', 
  if he called himself a communist , i 'm not sure how important that was . 
  i do n't know at what point or how seriously the ussr planned to transition from socialism to communism . 
  i do n't think that economically , he was on the brink of doing market reforms the way deng xiaoping had been in china . 
  why does the threshold make it possible to have a government ? 
  i 'd think that it 'd just make it harder to use smaller parties in coalition . 
  problem is : ( a ) it does n't make sense . 
  you ca n't maintain a persistent positive surplus of trade with other countries , and it would n't be desirable to try . 
  ( b ) i have a hard time believing that low-skill factory workers who support him due to manufacturing concerns are familiar with the trade balances with those countries . 
  ( c ) without looking , a lot of what canada sends us is probably raw resources . 
  the rust belt is n't producing lumber . 
  why would workers there be interested ? 
  i rarely see people write ukranian in latin text , just cyrillic , so i was gon na ask whether there 's a single , works-with-russian-and-ukranian way to do this . 
  then i went looking . 
  there are [ * scads * of ways to romanize ukranian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanization_of_ukrainian ) . 
  in fact , i do n't even know which one you 're using .
