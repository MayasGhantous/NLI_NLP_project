  with what weapons were world war iii fought ? 
  [ wikipedia : turenne , corr\u00e8ze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turenne,_corr%c3%a8ze ), 
  not to mention cameron calling the brexit referendum . 
   t was now clear that the country was heading toward a german-style proportional representation system in which parties must reach a 5 percent threshold to enter parliament . 
  i 'm assuming that italy apparently has 950 seats , way more than the twenty seats that a 5 % threshold would imply . 
  is there any legitimate , not-just-shielding-incumbents-from-challenger-parties justification for the minimum threshold ? 
  well , by that definition -- which , i 'd add , is not what `` the fourth reich '' means to most people -- i would n't find a fourth reich particularly concerning . 
  some sort of union involving germany in which germany is the largest member ? 
  sure , who cares ? 
   to all americans : have you ever told somebody that they 're an asshole , an idiot , a moron ? 
  right , you 're a criminal now . 
  because in europe , politicians ' and people 's with money feelings need to be spared . 
  i 'm not a criminal unless the relevant parties are claiming the jurisdiction in their courts to charge people abroad with speech crimes . 
  let 's assume that they do that . 
  even if so , the united states , as a result of libel tourism in the uk , [ passed an act in 2010 blocking enforcement in the us of any foreign libel rulings unless that country has free speech protections at least as strong as the first amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speech_act ) . 
  and claims like that are n't going to pass in us courts , because they 'll get killed by the first amendment . 
  so i 'm not particularly concerned . 
  edit :  according to a statement from the zurich district court , the 45-year-old defendant accused an animal rights activist , erwin kessler , of racism and antisemitism and hit the `` like '' button under several comments from third parties about kessler that were deemed inflammatory . 
  `` erwin kessler is a thin-skinned racist antisemite * and * files bullshit lawsuits . '', 
   all those european pulse things as well - basically embryonic brownshirts brownshirts were , what , mostly unemployed , at least some ex-military , and kinda desperate in terms of their economic position . 
  they were paramilitary . 
  pulse of europe events do n't really seem to have anything in common . 
  would any sort of union involving germany meet your criteria for being a `` fourth reich '' ? 
  i had suspected [ madman theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madman_theory ) late last year , but thought that if trump would do it , that he would have made some major negotiating push early this year , which he has not . 
  madman theory requires foreign intelligence agencies to believe one to * actually * be erratic or insane , which is not an image that i think could be maintained for long . 
  and so i assumed that his actions had to be for the benefit of publics , either foreign or domestic . 
   there have been some in this country who believe that this is the time to cut the umbilical cord across the atlantic because the americans are the bad guys . 
  that 's classic anti-americanism . 
  it goes back to the vietnam war . 
  ffs , germany , france was in vietnam too and you are n't complaining about that . 
   here is one example : the next german government might wish to start a debate about majority voting in the eu in foreign policy and security . 
  that sounds good for two reasons : * imho , a shift away from veto-based decisions is advantageous to the eu in just about every way . 
  * it combines foreign policy and security . 
  before now , it had been just security . 
  i think that security before foreign policy will likely not work well . 
  maybe holy roman empire ? 
   insists that the death penalty is incompatible with ... freedom fight me . 
  looked to me like a bunch of teens running around with a uv light . 
  ca n't argue there . 
  that getup would work pretty well in anime . 
  the three points i raised were issues that i think that the uk would have with the present eu proposal . 
  i was n't arguing in favor of the proposal . 
  you asked about the eu being willing to accept uk jurisdiction , that this would be reciprocal . 
  my point is that even if we go with your assumption , it really would n't provide the uk with anything meaningful -- by snapshotting at the time the uk leaves , it snapshots a set of rights in the eu where the uk does n't extend any rights . 
  my second point was that even if it * could * , the uk would probably extend a less-significant set of guarantees in the eu than the eu would the uk . 
  my third point was that over the next n years , there will probably be a shift in the direction of more eu citizens in the uk than uk citizens in the eu , based on populations now , since a lot of people who left the uk for the eu are retirees . 
  that would , even aside from the above two points , make the uk having the ability to extend rights in the eu less meaningful . 
  basically , even if one guaranteed equivalent jurisdiction , it would involve a set of no rights for britons in the eu , if rights * were * added then they would probably , by uk choice , be less-extensive than those granted eu citizens in the uk , and finally that the number of britons in the eu would probably decrease ( or at least , one factor would tend to cause that effect ) . 
  all of those would argue against the reciprocity you asked for being meaningful . 
  i was , i think , one of the first people on this forum to flag the guaranteed rights as being something that probably would not be workable . 
  i 'm not arguing in favor of them . 
  if they have a specific goal , like avoiding immediate post-brexit ejection of people via laws , then i think that there are probably alternate mechanisms that would be more-viable and might be acceptable to the uk . 
  the great glowing sea, 
  no , just diplomacy . 
  all those people who studied international relations and culture and cross-cultural etiquette to avoid ever putting a foot wrong , those people who have worked to build a dignified image , have been rendered obsolete by the new diplomacy of twitter shitposting . 
  somewhere , all this is going into history books , alongside famous messages like the [ zimmerman telegram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zimmermann_telegram ) and [ krushchev 's message to kennedy during the cuban missile crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuban_missile_crisis#secret_negotiations ) . 
  honestly , if that combination works for pop music stars , it should be good enough for the nazis . 
  well , yeah , but then , the nazis kept the trains running on time . 
  well , if you do n't have air conditioning and are n't creating an unnecessarily large outer surface for thermal energy to cross , they are n't .

   implying you have any control over who moderates a user-created forum on a private website that 's what you think , until we seize the means of production and empower the proletariat !, 
   just look at / r/punchablefaces as a prime example of how ownership completely determines a sub 's identity ownership is n't real !, 
  it 's a capitalist fiction !, 
  you ca n't own things !, 
  sure , sure -- i 'm not disagreeing with your general point , just narrowing your claim , as i thought that it was a bit over-broad . 
  it does n't look like it , according to wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomatic_mission#extraterritoriality  contrary to popular belief , most diplomatic missions do not enjoy full extraterritorial status and in those cases are not sovereign territory of the represented state . 
  [ 10 ] rather , the premises of diplomatic missions usually remain under the jurisdiction of the host state while being afforded special privileges ( such as immunity from most local laws ) by the vienna convention on diplomatic relations . 
  diplomats themselves still retain full diplomatic immunity , and ( as an adherent to the vienna convention ) the host country may not enter the premises of the mission without permission of the represented country , even to put out a fire . 
  [ 11 ] international rules designate an attack on an embassy as an attack on the country it represents . 
  [ citation needed ] the term `` extraterritoriality '' is often applied to diplomatic missions , but normally only in this broader sense . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extraterritorial_jurisdiction  the u.s. criminal code asserts the following items to fall within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states , much of which is extraterritorial in nature : [ 17 ] [ snip ]  9 ) offenses committed by or against a national of the united states in diplomatic missions , consulates , military and other missions , together with related residences , outside the us so i 'm guessing that that 's unusual to the us . 
  i bet that all this can create glorious legal clusterfucks . 
  for example , let 's say that estonia has an embassy in finland and russia bombs it . 
  if that 's considered an attack on estonia , can estonia invoke nato article 5 ? 
  if i understood the proposal , it `` snapshots '' rights at the time the uk leaves . 
  since the uk does n't ( and ca n't ) guarantee rights to uk members in the eu , this would have no effect . 
  further , my guess is that : * the uk generally will provide people in the uk with more-limited guarantees than the eu will . 
  * many britons who went to the eu are retirees . 
  they will soon die out , ending the impact they have . 
  so unless a briton immigrates to the eu , any guarantees to britons in the eu would be time-limited . 
  on the other hand , many people came from the eu to the uk , and the uk would need to continue to fulfill guarantees to them . 
   in one simple phrase you are admitting uk citizens will lose some of their rights by leaving eu i would expect so , or at least that it may happen in the future . 
  surely you would n't expect the two legal codes to remain in sync for all time ? 
  i mean , unbounded limitations like that are something that seem legally difficult to work with . 
  would you accept permanent externally-imposed restrictions on your own legal code ? 
   and are also admitting uk generally treats their citizens like shit when compared to eu i do n't think that his comment admitted that , unless you believe that * any * person who does n't have eu-guaranteed rights is `` treated like shit '' . 
   what if the usa suddenly decided only it 's supreme court had the right to rule on matters affecting us citizens in france ? 
  how do you think the french would react ? 
  well , technically we do claim extraterritorial jurisdiction on at least a few matters : * the us claims the ability to tax us citizens on income even if they live on french soil ( though the french get `` first cut '' at taxation ... only really has an effect if you 're living somewhere with lower taxes than the us ) * the us claims the ability to punish us citizens anywhere in the world , even if what they 're doing is legal there , if they engage in child sex tourism . 
  * if someone commits a crime against someone in a us embassy , the us claims the ability to punish them , even if it 's on another country 's territory . 
  oh , believe me , it 's possible for leadership to tweet much more embarrassing things .

   the tories plan to replace immigration and european single-market membership with an industrial strategy uh . 
  was this a serious plan ? 
  if so , it went right by me without me noticing . 
   last year , a large majority told surveys they would not pay a single pound to cut european immigration .
