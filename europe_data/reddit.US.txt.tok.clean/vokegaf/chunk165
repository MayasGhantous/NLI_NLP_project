  meh , that 's [ framing effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/framing_effect_\\ ( psychology \\ ) ) . 
  maybe they see it as a `` i should be able to reduce immigration without giving up any money '' question . 
  ask people how much they 'd charge to allow in another n immigrants . 
  yes . 
  in theory , this should be a legal decision , not a political one . 
  it 's just analyzing law and ruling on it . 
  that is , if the eu made a policy error , it should have been back in 2004 when the legislation was passed . 
  that 's not really `` fake '' -- i mean , that * is * logging . 
  it 's just that the story is ( presumably intentionally ) misleading by leaving out information . 
  i mean , may is obviously correct wrt negotiation strategy . 
  committing to getting a deal regardless of its terms does n't make sense -- the other side of the table could simply refuse to hand you a reasonable offer , so you 're signing a blank check otherwise . 
  that being said , i 've no idea whether corbyn 's or may 's statement makes more sense * politically * in the uk ... and at the end of the day , that 's really why they 're making statements like this , to win an election . 
  germany is n't going to get the ability to globally-regulate content , and it 's precisely because there are many countries that can see this , because they 've all got their own positions on content regulation . 
  start that and china wants to block things that it does n't like politically and so forth . 
  not viable for facebook . 
  yeah , germany 's got legal leverage on facebook . 
  but it 's not going to result in germany setting more-restrictive global standards on content , because that 'd make facebook vulnerable internationally when users can go to competitors that do n't apply german standards . 
  so facebook spins off facebook germany and attaches all its german business operations to that and hands the ability to block content in germany and only in germany to it . 
  that sandboxes germany 's ability to act on facebook , and now facebook international can ignore this from here on out . 
  facebook germany only has to be at least as cost-effective as any competitor in germany at responding to content blocking requests . 
  if they have to charge fees or whatever , same is going to apply to any competitors . 
  so it is n't losing out relative to its competitors . 
  maybe germans simply wind up paying for all social media < shrug  . 
  from germany 's standpoint , above-and-beyond facebook , this becomes an unending game of trying to block out bits of content across the internet spanning many , many different companies and services . 
  it 's effectively having to try to block content across the global internet , which is going to invariably be a game of always imperfect success . 
  that 's why i 'm saying that either germany keeps trying to do that -- which is the `` great firewall of china '' style approach -- or just gives up on it and relaxes speech restrictions . 
  no , i mean that germany ca n't go around enforcing german law against * people * outside germany -- / u / _ hopped _ was proposing that german law enforcement act against users rather than facebook . 
  if germany says `` user x in country y is posting something that is illegal in germany '' , and facebook says `` okay , go after the user '' , germany is powerless to do that . 
  what germany would like is to say `` ah , but facebook has a business presence in germany , so i can leverage facebook to deal with things even if a user is outside of germany '' . 
  what facebook would do is create a german subsidiary , ignore german law in facebook international , and have facebook germany give german law enforcement tools to block content 's visibility in germany , but not affect anything else , sandboxing germany 's legal ability to act on facebook as a whole . 
  then facebook complains if any competing company pops up in germany and does n't have the same terms applying . 
  because there 's a ton of forums outside of facebook , like , i do n't know , stormfront , germany has to block on a site-by-site basis , and because of vpns to the outside world probably does n't manage to block all far-right content in germany . 
  no , you trademark the certification logo , not the product 's brand . 
  then the certification authority has the ability to restrict companies from putting it on its side , which is the only power it needs . 
  no , no more than the firemen coming in to do the police 's job because they think that the police are doing a bad job . 
  separate realms of responsibility . 
  this approach can also be implemented entirely via the private market leveraging trademark law , a characteristic of all certification schemes . 
  no government actors need be involved . 
  in fact , much government regulation could be reduced to certification , privatizing this role without relying on the monopoly status of the state . 
  better ? 
  eh , it 's a question of enforcement . 
  germany ca n't go around enforcing the law against people outside germany . 
  germany would like to leverage economic clout to try to dump the problem on facebook . 
  facebook 's business model would probably be wrecked by having to police and be liable for all the content on the thing . 
  they probably want to do what happened with the dmca in the us and give some levers to german law enforcement to pull , which gives germany the job of playing whack-a-mole , which germany does n't want . 
  my bet is one of the following : * germany relaxes its speech restrictions online . 
  * germany tries to do a `` great firewall of china '' approach , mostly driven on its end . 
  limited success , especially for people who specifically want the content , due to vpns . 
  no idea how much political support there 'd be in germany for this . 
  well , that kinda has a moral overtone , though i guess you could look at it like that . 
  i 'd use the phrase `` internalizing a negative externality '' . 
  if you do something , and the market does n't reflect harm that the thing does to the purchaser , you wind up with an inefficient market unless you reflect the negative externality in the price . 
  note that i think that it 's very dubious that policymakers are particularly concerned about carbon emissions , but if you * did * feel that there was a serious problem to be fixed , i 'd agree that a carbon tax would be the right tool . 
  it 'd need to be binding , have enforcement mechanisms , have the funds go to paying for carbon sequestration * or * if you can somehow assess all the costs of carbon simply pay off those impacted by the emissions . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , though . 
  i do n't think that any countries have any real intentions of passing serious carbon emission legislation . 
  this has been going on for ages . 
  i 'm not a poli sci wonk , but i 'd say that the main purpose of most `` green '' policy is political -- to create a never-ending crusade of good against evil , saving the world . 
  the right likes religion or the decay of morals or whatever . 
  before that , i guess it was the looming commie threat . 
  got ta have a crusade to sell your supporters on . 
  we 've been passing carbon-related policy for ages now , and it consistently is structured to ( a ) have little effect on carbon emissions and ( b ) transfer money to particular parties who legislators probably wanted to transfer funds to anyway , like not-very-populated-states agriculture industry . 
  to me , that 's a pretty convincing statement as to the actual views that policymakers hold : this is n't a problem , but it 's a wonderful political tool .

   indians will always vie for a unidirectional advantage , what you are saying is true in the case of both nations either being developed or developing . 
  the property does n't require that a country be developing/developed/whatever . 
   usa india fta wo n't work at all , because us sme sector is brilliant whereas indian sme are nascent . 
  does n't matter how bad or good india is at anything in absolute terms compared to the us wrt trade being advantageous to india . 
  it 's not [ absolute advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/absolute_advantage ) that matters in determining whether it 's advantageous to trade with a country , but comparative advantage . 
  if india can use one unit of labor to produce two socks or one shoe and the us can use one unit of labor to produce ten socks or twenty shoes , both benefit from trade . 
  india 's ratio is 2 socks to 1 shoe , the us 1 sock to 2 shoes , and because that ratio differs , they benefit from trade . 
  obviously , there 's a lot of room for ratios to differ , so pretty much any country is going to benefit on the net from trade . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage  david ricardo developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in international trade ** even when one country 's workers are more efficient at producing every single good than workers in other countries . 
  ** he demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the free market , then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good , provided that there exist differences in labor productivity between both countries . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] widely regarded as one of the most powerful [ 7 ] yet counter-intuitive [ 8 ] insights in economics , ricardo 's theory implies that comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage is responsible for much of international trade .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chilling_effect  in a legal context , a chilling effect is the inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights by the threat of legal sanction . 
  [ 1 ] the right that is most often described as being suppressed by a chilling effect is the us constitutional right to free speech . 
  a chilling effect may be caused by legal actions such as the passing of a law , the decision of a court , or the threat of a lawsuit ; any legal action that would cause people to hesitate to exercise a legitimate right ( freedom of speech or otherwise ) for fear of legal repercussions . 
  and looking at my post history , that * is * chilling !, 
   i only regret that i have but one life to lose for my country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers as of this 2015 approximation , chinese was ahead , 1051 million to 1010 million ( though that ignores the fragmentation in spoken chinese and treats it as a single language instead of a language family ) . 
   for what it 's worth work is disappearing in china and india because of automation too . 
  first , real wages are rising in china ( and i assume india ) and have been doing so for many years . 
  second : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lump_of_labour_fallacy  in economics , the lump of labour fallacy is the idea that there is a fixed amount of work - a lump of labour - to be done within an economy which can be distributed to create more or fewer jobs .

  trade is generally advantageous between countries . 
  if one country has a [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) in its production of a particular good relative to another , it makes sense to produce it there and trade it to another that has the opposite relationship .
