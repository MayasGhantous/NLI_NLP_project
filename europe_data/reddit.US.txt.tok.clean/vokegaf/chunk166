  doing so will increase [ economic efficiency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_efficiency ) , causing each country to be better-off on the net . 
  the benefits are bidirectional , not unidirectional . 
  a relative difference in wealth may be a good argument for trade for both sides , since that likely means that there is great comparative advantage between two in labor-intensive production -- and trade provides more of a benefit the greater the differences in comparative advantage . 
  i remember being on here , listening to you guys in europe complain about ttip . 
  lawsey . 
  trade deals simply lower the barrier to trade . 
  they are not themselves trade . 
  in the sense that `` lowering artificial barriers to trade is generally a win '' , it is true that trade deals are a plus . 
  there are some caveats , like `` do i have externalities related national security concerns that make me want to produce steel domestically '' , but barring that , trade 's normally advantageous to both sides . 
  i looked at india 's tariffs on alcohol a while back , and they have extremely high levels . 
  just remember that it needs to work out better than the last time there was a major wave of immigration from india , when the romani came through . 
  man ... how did ireland and the uk do so badly ? 
  i mean , the other countries are on the mediterranean ... that only gets so much water flowing by . 
  but the british isles have the whole atlantic , and they 're some of the worst-rated spots in europe . 
  https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/the-fog-of-austerity-this-smoke-cloud-is-the-ultimate-symbol-of-greeces-depression/272626/  * you do n't need any statistics to fully grasp the depth of greece 's economic crisis . 
  you only need to know about the smoke . 
  *   utility bills are now so expensive for greek families that some have taken to burning wood to stay warm . 
  the result is an eerie fog of smoke looming above the city . 
  is the smog in op 's picture a development of the last several years ? 
   demirel was reportedly stabbed by his son-in-law cemil yavuz karanfil at his daughter 's residence in the ba\u015fak\u015fehir district following a quarrel . 
  so ... not a political killing . 
  a certification-based system , as i 've described above , is perfectly-compatible with that . 
  italian coca-cola can continue to be formulated differently from german coca-cola ( i was completely unaware that they differed ... huh ) . 
  but if it is , and if people care about that fact , then a competitor can come along and slap their logo on the side of a competing product , and whack the one without the logo in the market . 
  it does n't * force * only one option or the other . 
  i 'd add that it 's not uncommon for vendors to vary based on regional or country preference or use ingredients that are more-affordable or - available in one place or another . 
  i 've used the `` corn syrup in us coca-cola , cane sugar in mexico '' example on here before . 
  turns out that some people cared and were willing to pay a premium for cane sugar ( possibly as a result of anti-corn-syrup marketing efforts from the sugar industry in the us ) , so you can buy [ mexican coke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican_coke ) here now . 
  instead of banning one type or the other , simply permitting the consumer to distinguish between them and letting the market decide was the easy way . 
  and it turns out that here , there 's enough of a market for both to exist . 
  i guess it 's good politics . 
  i mean , if you 're gon na make the argument between west-and-east over homosexuality , then it 's something that matters . 
  if you 're making an argument for group identity ( `` eu ! '', 
  `` slavic brotherhood ! '' ), 
  based on values , you want to promote things that you have in common with the group you 're trying to sell on them . 
  a lot of folks in central europe are not too keen on making homosexuality not taboo . 
  but i 'm also pretty sure that they 're also not too keen on the execution of homosexuals . 
  so if you want to win over a group , you want to promote points where you exhibit common values . 
  for russia , [ playing up some transgender actor in eurovision as being representative of the eu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65swzhabes ) is good politics in central europe . 
  if you 're the eu , you would rather highlight mistreatment of homosexuals in russia . 
  i recall once when ahmadinejad came to columbia university in the united states . 
  i do n't recall what the thing was about , probably trying to build goodwill for iran , but a student -- as i recall , was a member of a jewish student association -- asked something about how homosexuals in iran were treated . 
  he infamously denied that there * were * any homosexuals in iran ... and of course , that quote was what all the media in the country ran on . 
  everyone in the us reads it , thinks `` hey , that iranian group is n't much like me '' , and gets turned off towards them . 
  the positions of iran and the us are pretty different from a values position on the existence and legality of homosexuality , so it makes a good point to split the groups on . 
  is france or is macron deeply concerned about the situation in chechnya ? 
  maybe ... i do n't know . 
  probably not . 
  but arguably , what 's more-useful is to publicly place putin as running a country where homosexuals are being extrajudicially killed , in contrast to france , where this is not the case . 
  's good pr in the eu . 
  hmm . 
  my understanding was that there were definite limitations placed to try to avoid welfare-shopping . 
  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_3.1.3.html  migrant workers ' right to reside for more than three months remains subject to certain conditions , which vary depending on the citizen 's status : ** for eu citizens who are not workers or self-employed , the right of residence depends on their having sufficient resources not to become a burden on the host member state 's social assistance system , ** and having sickness insurance . 
  eu citizens acquire the right of permanent residence in the host member state after a period of five years of uninterrupted legal residence . 
   more than one third of czechs and slovaks think the eu is pushing them to abandon traditional values . 
  i mean , i think that the eu certainly is . 
  you could say that it 's positive or negative . 
  you could say that it 's more a symbol of group identity than anything else . 
  but i think that it 's tough to argue that the eu has not promoted a set of values . 
   `` after investing twenty years and hundreds of millions of dollars in building a ` europe whole and free , ' it is vital that the u.s. recognize the threat of increased russian influence in europe , which has the potential to undermine a key pillar of transatlantic peace and security . '' well , that 's kinda more eu politics than us politics . 
  is n't our place to tell the eu how to do politics . 
  you want to promote messages or whatever , that 's more within europe 's baliwick . 
   thirty-nine percent of hungarians think that their social benefits have more in common with russia than europe huh . 
  their benefits ? 
  like , their welfare system ? 
  any hungarians want to expand ? 
   < do you care about russia-funding  the way this was phrased , assuming that the question is the one that was asked , gives me the impression that they 're asking whether * all * alternative sources of media are funded by russia . 
  i 'd say `` no '' to that too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_navy  ** personnel **   military : 8900   paramilitary : 1000   civilian : 2700   ** equipment **   frigates : 5   submarines : 2   patrol vessels : 21   landing craft : 1   support ships : 1   research vessels : 4   sail ships : 3   auxiliary vessels : 50, 
  apparently , he has an actual red phone too . 
  well , even aside from the fact that flood control is n't an enumerated power and thus goes to the state ... why would a levee that only affects one state be handled federally ? 
  the disadvantages of not having a levee affect people within the state , not at the federal level , so you want the state to handle it . 
  there might be arguments for , say , flood control dams , which might benefit multiple states . 
  maybe funds to keep a river delta dredged or something to keep transport running . 
  but a levee to keep drained land dry ? 
  why would the federal government be the one to pay for that ? 
  the state is the unit that most-directly benefits , not the federal government . 
  please tell me that your anti-semitic ass is not american . 
  < takes a glance  i really have no past familiarity with it , but from what i can see , paris was going to be pretty ineffectual . 
  paris would n't have set binding targets , so you can expect it to be broadly ignored . 
  it would have mandated that wealthy countries subsidize renewable power usage in poorer ones , which i guess would be the meaningful bit . 
  so it 's a handout to , say , solar cell manufacturers and turbine manufacturers . 
  which is great if you 're siemens or chinese solar cell manufacturers , but not if you 're not . 
  even if you feel that the treaty is well-crafted , if carbon emissions have a negative externality , then you do n't address that by subsidizing renewables . 
  iirc germany 's carbon credits in the past were also treated as a state subsidy . 
  let 's assume that global warming is an issue , that everyone is on-board with addressing it , and that it can be cost-effectively addressed . 
  if you do that , you 're going to need the following : * compensation for those who are losing out . 
  countries with fossil fuels are n't gon na want to get onboard with this otherwise . 
  * a carbon tax -- that 's how you address a negative externality , not a subsidy . 
  subsidies are for positive externalities . 
  * tax levels set by auctioning mitigation services , so that there 's an incentive to absorb carbon and so that prices can decline as efficiency improves . 
  * an enforcement mechanism . 
  none of those have happened , ergo members of paris are not truly concerned about the problem . 
  it is domestic politics , not an effort to reduce carbon emission levels . 
  honestly , the people harassing her sound more objectionable than she does . 
  if you 're judging by professions that are stereotypically `` hard '' , [ india recently had an ex-rocket scientist as prime minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a._p._j._abdul_kalam ) . 
  but , then ... `` smart '' is a pretty vague term , and it does n't necessarily line up well with what i think would make a good leader . 
  i think that not being corrupt , and not overriding specialist subordinates with your personal whims are probably two of the more-important things . 
  i think that in general , a leader can fix pretty much any other issues by choosing the right subordinates . 
  but if you 're corrupt or wo n't listen to them , that ca n't be fixed with better advisors .
