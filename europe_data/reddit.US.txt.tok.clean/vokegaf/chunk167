   asked about the right to own arms in poland , he said : `` i think there should be easier access to arms in poland because there are threats to our country coming from the eastern borders and also from third world countries . 
  dude seems pretty cool . 
  grab yourself some flour , oil , sugar , and yeast , and you can feed something like 20-25 people for ( looks online for numbers ) ~ $ 8 - $ 10 . 
  toss some vitamin pills in , maybe some eggs for protein . 
  the french eat plenty of bread , and they are n't particularly obese . 
  ` course , that takes some time to make yourself bread , but if you 're on a limited income , that 's the time when it makes the most sense to trade the labor time off . 
  this story is getting more exciting every time a news article is submitted about it . 
  join any of the other countries that are up in arms about this , create a certification program , and do n't allow vendors to use your logo unless they use identical components/ingredients for all regions in the eu that they sell to . 
  create an office of compliance that can impose fat fines on anyone using the logo that does n't follow said standard and can field complaints about same , and require users of that logo to permit inspections at any of their locations . 
  if it matters to consumers , they will purchase products with the logo . 
  if it does n't matter to consumers , they wo n't . 
  if it matters to some consumers but not others , they ones it matters to will purchase products with the logo . 
  our plans have been slowly maturing for seventy years now , and soon , very soon , when all is revealed , the first mandatory mcdonalds consumption laws will go into place . 
  regardless of whether-or-not it was a good idea , i think that most can agree that it was done much less-well than it might have been . 
  granted , some of that was due to the semi-accidental nature of what was going on and so forth , but ... 
  well , that still does n't let you just move , right ? 
  you have to actually have a means of support in the other member , barring some additional agreement ? 
  iceland only has 332k people . 
  i mean , many european cities are far larger . 
  london has over 25 times the population . 
  you are n't managing * that * many people . 
  i looked online , and apparently there is some legal disagreement about whether the queen is a citizen of the countries that she is a sovereign of . 
  one of those little quirks of monarchies . 
  https://www.quora.com/is-queen-elizabeth-ii-a-legal-citizen-of-the-countries-where-she-is-the-head-of-state answer 1 :  i think that she is a citizen of those nations , yes . 
  but the definition of `` citizenship '' for a monarch is unique -- in a sense she is not a member of the community of people who owe loyalty to the nation ; rather , she is the basis of citizenship for all other citizens ... answer 2 :  this is actually a matter of some debate by constitutional scholars . 
    as the personification of each of the commonwealth realms , and the fount from which citizenship flows , it is questionable as it if her majesty is a citizen as most people think of the word . 
    i 'm of the opinion that she as queen is not a citizen , but rather something beyond that given her role as ( again ) the personification of the state . 
  answer 3 :  by canadian law , elizabeth ii of canada is a canadian -- albeit her legal identity as sovereign is , simply `` canada '' -- as are the members of the canadian royal family . 
  answer 4 :  the clue is in the terminology . 
    historically the term used by citizens of the uk and empire was n't british citizen but rather british subject . 
  this was only changed iirc in 1983 . 
    a subject is a bit different to a citizen . 
  being a subject means your status is reliant on your overlord - namely the queen . 
    it would n't really make sense for the queen to be a subject of herself . 
  could it be she is the only true british citizen and all other citizenships spring from hers ? 
    regardless after the big shakeup in the 80s all of the commonwealth realms are now 100 % completely and utterly seperate entities . 
  you are n't a subject anymore but a citizen . 
  this leaves the queen in a rather odd legal position , holding a status reliant on the old feudal system in a world where that is no longer the way things work . 
  the wh is in [ neoclassical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neoclassical_architecture ) style , which is apparently intended to use themes from greek , roman , and renaissance styles . 
  i ca n't really think of gold in the wh , though i have seen neoclassical buildings that do use gold . 
  well , it 's the norm here ... oohhhhh ... 
  what city in germany do you like ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_parliament  the palace of the parliament ( romanian : palatul parlamentului ) is the seat of the parliament of romania . 
  located on dealul arsenalului in central bucharest ( sector 5 ) , it is the second-largest administrative building in the world , [ 1 ] after the pentagon in the united states . 
  with a height of 84 m , an area of 365,000 m2 and having a volume of 2,550,000 m3 , it is also the fourth biggest building in the world , after the vehicle assembly building at kennedy space center in florida , the temple of the feathered serpent in teotihuacan , mexico , and the pentagon . 
  in terms of weight , the palace of the parliament is the heaviest building in the world , weighing in at around 4,098,500,000 kg . 
  i dunno whether romania 's pm has an office there or if it 's just the legislative headquarters , but that 'd be trouble . 
  this sounds like a glorious opportunity for a furniture company to make a desk for her and establish its name . 
   `` europe is the answer , and stronger cooperation between the european countries at all levels is the answer to donald trump , '' mr schulz said on ard public television . 
  `` and above all else we must not submit to trump 's arms-race logic . '' nato spending has been an issue since long before trump entered office . 
   sipila said there are `` a lot '' of possibilities to strengthen economic ties across the region , including setting up a single `` digital market '' and a bio-fuels market . 
  ... biofuels ? 
  with * norway * ? 
  i mean , i do n't know politics in the nordics , but that sure sounds like it 's aiming at domestic politics ... 
  ... also , what is the actual analogy being drawn ? 
  this is hitler 's failed putsch plus nazi germany having declared war on the uk and on the us , right ? 
  those were all unrelated events , and i 'm reasonably confident that nazi germany was n't declaring war on anyone from a bavarian beer tent . 
  exactly . 
  information is more-valuable the fewer people who know it . 
  in theory , the uk and the eu could boot all of each other 's citizens out , but in practice , i ca n't imagine that happening . 
  it 'd be disruptive to both , and in spain 's case , the retirees are all gon na die off in a few years anyway . 
   the queen and the royal family would still be eu citizens that sounds like it might be up for very complicated legal argument . 
  do that and it says `` my interests are diverging from yours or i no longer intend integration with you , france '' . 
  i do not think that it will happen unless germany and france split . 
  i 'd sooner bet on germany getting them in federalization . 
  this is the only office that looks like the guy is actually using it to do work , with a stack of papers and whatnot . 
  not my area of expertise , but it looks like 100x or 200x telescopes are readily-available . 
  i dunno how high they go . 
  look at something from 600m away with a 200x telescope , and it 'd be the equivalent of looking at it from two meters away . 
   voters have no way of saying : `` we like things from this wing , but also want stuff from that other wing '' like , if you 're a political activist ? 
  associate with ngos that deal with their specific interests in a targeted way . 
  so if you 're into environmentalism , you do n't go to the [ green party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_party_of_the_united_states ) ( you could , but they will never get any seats ) . 
  you 'll go to the [ sierra club ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sierra_club ) or [ greenpeace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenpeace ) or whoever and donate funds or effort to them . 
  that ngo is n't necessarily tied to a party . 
  for example , the [ nra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_rifle_association ) * mostly * supports republican candidates , but ( looks online ) about a fifth of the candidates they 'll endorse are democrats , because those candidates have agreed to support gun rights issues they want . 
   the package is already decided on . 
  if you had a coalition in a pr system , you would n't get to choose either , because voters do n't get to choose the coalitions -- the parties do it , and after they have their seats . 
  in the us , you already have the coalitions pre-made , and choose from a coalition -- you just know what the coalition is that you 're getting . 
  it 'll include some things that you do n't like , and some things that you do , but that was gon na happen with a coalition anyway . 
  notable example of parties acting like a coalition in the us : the transition from the [ fifth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_party_system ) to the [ sixth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) :  the perceived sixth party system is characterized by an electoral shift from the electoral coalitions of the fifth party system during the new deal : the republican party became the dominant party in the south , rural areas , and suburbs ; while the democratic party increasingly started to assemble a coalition of african-americans , hispanics and white urban progressives . 
  that inverted much of the support belonging to each party . 
  that is , they were n't tied to specific issues so much as they are a coalition of interests . 
  the characteristics of fptp versus pr are : * it favors regional parties . 
  * it favors a two-party system ( and at least in the us , and i assume elsewhere , this works like a coalition ) . 
  * the two parties will be centrist . 
  they can not move too far from the center , or they 'll lose a majority . 
  * small numbers of nationwide voters who radically disagree with the status quo ( and will not support either party ) are essentially neutralized . 
  i suspect that fptp is not friendly to radical movements , because you have to vote out all the members of a party and shift control within the party , whereas bringing a new political party to power splits entirely with the existing one . 
  [ iceland 's seat ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/cabinet_of_iceland ) does n't look much different from a house .

  us parties are roughly equivalent to coalitions in a pr system . 
  i think that each us president replaces the chair . 
  i suspect that the same is true of other world leaders .

   we do n't really have a german eagle , like you people have an american eagle . 
  hmm . 
  so , i got this from * spiegel * -- they 're incorrect ? 
   [ majestic white-tailed eagle returns to german skies ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/back-from-extinction-majestic-white-tailed-eagle-returns-to-german-skies-a-498475.html )   germany has rescued its national symbol , the white-tailed eagle , from near extinction in a decades-long struggle against egg thieves , communist spies and farmers using poisonous pesticides .
