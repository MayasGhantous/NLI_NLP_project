  -  the white-tailed eagle , not to be confused with the white-headed bald eagle or american eagle which is the symbol of the us , is the official emblem of the federal republic and is ubiquitous on government buildings and uniforms , on german $ 1 and $ 2 coins and on the shirts of the national soccer team . 
  the reichstag parliament building boasts a giant eagle staring down at members of parliament . 
  [ wikipedia : list of national birds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_birds ) has germany 's national bird being [ * aquila chrysaetos * , the golden eagle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_eagle ) ... which looks a lot more like the one in the coat of arms . 
  ` course , just because it 's germany 's national bird does n't mean that it has to be in its coat of arms , but ... 
  that desk has [ no modesty panel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modesty_panel ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that that 's uncommon . 
  it sounds like time for an `` offices of european prime ministers '' submission stream and karma for all . 
   you get out of touch with reality if you are working in an environment full of gold oh , dear . 
   german eagle okay , i went looking to figure out which species that is . 
  apparently that 's [ * haliaeetus albicilla * , the white-tailed eagle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white-tailed_eagle ) . 
  which is confusing , because [ the german coat of arms does n't show a white tail or lighter head ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_germany.svg ) . 
  i guess maybe that 's in the name of simplified heraldry ... 
   this type of intel needs to be taken more seriously , well , i mean , define `` seriously '' . 
  they opened an investigation on him . 
  it did n't turn anything up . 
  they can not presently -- and i would n't advocate for such a change -- simply jail someone without having evidence . 
  they probably ca n't use information that intelligence agencies pick up as evidence , because it would compromise those sources . 
   the family should n't of been allowed to immigrate to the uk because of ties to libyan islamist extremist . 
  according to your link , they left in 1991 due to being associated with anti-gaddafi efforts . 
  that was , what , three years after the [ lockerbie bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_am_flight_103 ) ? 
  i suspect that he 'd be considered a good guy . 
  ... in front of huge glass windows several stories up and visible to the public ? 
   nice open , the `` nice openness '' with concrete barriers less than a car 's width apart is , i assume , to prevent car bombs from getting too close . 
  as long as curtains themselves ca n't be used as a source , i agree . 
   maybe i should have been more clear . 
  it was n't just a slow down , it was a reversal . 
  yup , aware of it . 
  today it 's about zero on net . 
  still not an argument for permitting immigration that 's disadvantageous to the us . 
   friedman 's analysis does n't apply to the us anymore , because neither are people still coming to it , nor is their any real welfare system to be threatened and there will be even less of one until 2020 . 
  sure it does . 
  the welfare system is no less-extensive than it was when he was around . 
  it may not fit your idea of what a welfare system should be , but that 's an unrelated matter . 
   the brookings institute is one of most renowned think tanks in the world . 
  the brookings institute has a political basis for arguing for a larger welfare system . 
  they are not a neutral observer . 
   congratulations , you 're a person with questionable morals . 
  < shrug  you 're entitled to choose your own moral system . 
  if that involves making economic decisions that might be disadvantageous to your country , that 's your business . 
   you 're a country with minimum wage 7.25 $ where the living wage is between 15 $ -20 $ / h. 
  seems fine to me . 
  my main concern is that it be low enough not to have a major impact on wages . 
  even if you want a subsidy for the poor , the minimum wage makes for a poor mechanism to subsidize the poor , popular as it is with the masses , because wages are n't the only variable involved with labor -- it only acts as a subsidy where ( a ) demand is inelastic , so it does n't produce unemployment and ( b ) where changes ca n't be made to things like working conditions and treatment to recoup money in ways that have a worse ratio of providing-benefit-to-the-employee versus costing-the-employer . 
  and then there 's a whole question of how much subsidy the poor should receive in the first place . 
  and we 're also [ performing better on median income than germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income ) , which i 'd be more-interested in . 
    sure they will . 
  if they ca n't produce competitively , they 'll go out of business and some other country will sell produce instead . 
    until demand rises hight enough , then you can get ready to pay 12 $ for a pack of carrots as the others will just stop competing . 
  that does n't really make much sense . 
  first , i doubt that you * will * see substantial us agriculture go under -- there 's been an ongoing trend of automation anyway , and the [ bulk of the agricultural automation in the world for a long time has happened here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:agricultural_machinery ) , and my guess is that that engineering work will soak up any substantial increase in labor costs . 
  i 'll take cheaper labor if i can get it , but if i ca n't , there are probably also substitutes for much of that . 
  second , say that it does happen . 
  us farms go out of business . 
  we start buying from some other country . 
  that happens as long as labor prices * there * are low . 
  so presumably , you 're talking about * world * demand ? 
  that is , you want the us to force * world * food prices down via providing citizenship and welfare to more workers from latin america ? 
  that the us has the only unused farmland in the world ? 
  the rest of the world would have to be able to bid prices up that high , else the food would just wind up here . 
  for global prices to get up to $ 12/bag of carrots , the rest of the world would have to be able to bid it up that high . 
  finally , if that happened , us agricultural prices would be up , so you 'd just see illegal immigration start up again and farms restart . 
  still would n't need to pay out benefits . 
   if you 're going to go for indentured servitude , the standard in previous centuries was n't a lifetime . 
  people are n't forced to work for an employer . 
  they can leave whenever they want . 
  doctors do n't give information to immigration authorities . 
  mind , that does n't mean that an illegal immigrant could * afford * it , but ... 
  the third point just relies on the windows being optically-clear ( though i 've no idea how practical that one is outside of lab environments -- just throwing it out as an example ) . 
  i 've never been really enthralled with giving people who deal with sensitive information windows out onto a cityscape . 
  * it leaks information if you can see people or people speaking through the window . 
  that 's a lot of room out there to have a telescopic lens . 
  * it opens the possibility of someone hitting the window with a [ laser microphone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laser_microphone ) . 
  * certain visible items in the room [ might be usable as ad-hoc diaphragms ] ( http://www.metafilter.com/141621/the-visual-microphone-passive-recovery-of-sound-from-video ) even without a laser . 
  ( `` for example , the method can be used to extract intelligible speech from video of a bag of potato chips filmed from 15 feet away through soundproof glass . '' ), 
  well , according to the articole , the uk * did * open an investigation ( which happened to have cleared him ) . 
  does `` act on the threat '' mean `` jail without support from an investigation or trial '' ? 
  because i 'm not so sure i want that . 
  sure , if the british reactivate the [ star chamber ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_chamber ) and are willing to make liberal use of it to avoid false negatives due to warnings , i would imagine that more terrorist acts could be avoided . 
  but is the price of doing so worthwhile ? 
  it 's not one that i would pay . 
  i 'm sure that they 'll look at their investigatory process , and probably do what 's possible to remedy it . 
  but if you reduce it to a question of `` political will to do what is necessary '' ... well , i 'm afraid that `` what is necessary '' to avoid any false negatives after such a warning would be deeply concerning . 
  yeah , i considered it as well , but it does n't stand up : * economic pressure was n't actually what produced the ussr 's breakup , but internal political pressures and how they were handled . 
  * the us did not expect the ussr to break up at that time ( and was , in fact , quite taken by surprise when it happened ) . 
  there was not an expectation of economic collapse . 
  certainly the ussr was significantly economically-weaker , but was not in a position of non-function . 
  * if that had happened , it would have probably happened earlier , like under brezhev . 
  * soviet military spending was ( looking online ) maybe 15 % of gdp , vastly higher than anything targeted today . 
  * us military spending had been on a gradual decline as a percent of gdp over almost all of the cold war . 
  * soviet spending rose dramatically under brezhnev . 
  us spending rose under reagan , which came later -- if anyone was responding to a relative shift in spending , it 'd be the other way around . 
   no , do you ? 
  no , other than perhaps budget , which is why i use globalfirepower as a general measure of military strength . 
  there 's nothing wrong with pointing out the limitations of a general index , but saying that it 's `` shit '' kinda implies that there 's some general alternative that 's preferable , and i do n't know of one . 
  obviously , no index is going to capture everything , because militaries are n't purely interchangeable tools . 
  one is nuclear , one is not . 
  one has aircraft capable of avoiding air-defense radars , another does not . 
  one has many infantry . 
  one is positioned well to invade country x. 
  one has the ability to counteract a certain type of missiles from country x.
