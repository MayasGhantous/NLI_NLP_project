  germany may have legit grounds for complaint .

   the more the idea of military spending gets asociated with trump the harder it will be to raise it . 
  it should n't be . 
  the commitment was originally made sometime back under bush . 
  it just got ignored for a long time . 
  he 's not changing the schedule . 
  he 's asking for milestones , which seems reasonable . 
  last time , nothing happened . 
   the point behind this is that a lot of the new defense spending is going to be on us-made equipment there is no obligation to do this , and most european militaries tend to use overwhelmingly europe-sourced hardware . 
  wikipedia maintains lists of equipment and where they are sourced from . 
  [ only a very few things in the german army , for example , come from the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_equipment_of_the_german_army ) . 
  the vast bulk is from germany . 
   if the agreement is 2 % by 2024 then that is it . 
  a decade back , the same commitment was made , and that was n't met . 
   what bugs me the most is that this is just interior politics of trump who does n't acknowledge the fact that nato is first and foremost an american organisation . 
  the us holds the top military post , [ supreme allied commander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_allied_commander ) . 
  the us also currently provides the bulk of the military in nato , and it 's typically the norm for whoever has the most skin in the game in a coalition to get the top command . 
  europe ( no one country , moves around ) provides the [ nato secretary general ] ( https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_general_of_nato ) position , which is the civilian leadership of nato . 
  if europe wants to match the us in spending and wants to , say , have control of those two slots alternate , i would expect that that would be open for discussion . 
  the `` entire top hierarchy '' is not normally american . 
  the second-highest slot is the [ deputy supreme allied commander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_headquarters_allied_powers_europe#deputy_supreme_allied_commander_europe_.28deputy_saceur.29 ) , which is either german or british . 
  there is a second position of equal rank ( though , admittedly , fewer people ) , supreme allied commander transformation , that is responsible for directing where nato goes in the future . 
  this is based over here in the states , and is held by the french . 
   well i am against the existence of nato fine , but that 's a different conversation . 
  and surely you 'd agree that if you want to leave nato , the way to do so is n't by just making commitments and ignoring them , but via the withdrawal process . 
   you will have to agree though , that the 2 % goal is a rather nonesensical one . 
  * a line is needed to avoid the public good problem , when you 've a public good like national defense . 
  the eu itself will face the same issue anyway , as it has independent military obligations but currently no competency to tax for funding military . 
  think of this as the us being willing to take the political heat for fixing an eu issue , if you prefer . 
  * 2 % has the following characteristics : it is about in line with what many countries in the world spend , and it is the result of nato discussions . 
  * any line would be somewhat arbitrary anyway . 
  but nato does not set foreign policy ( maybe one day the eu will ) , and so it does not do purchasing or decide what to buy . 
  the expectation is that the members will independently do this . 
  the assumption is also that member militaries are competent to ise resources if made available . 
  so nato should go no further than drawing a funding line . 
  * it is significantly less than what the us spends . 
  this puts the us in a reasonable position for posing on it . 
  * it is very hard to develop a modern military and weapons industry overnight . 
  it must be done well in advance of any problems . 
  this avoids being caught out . 
  the problem is that when the 2 % commitment was made , what , a decade back , countries not only did n't go to 2 % but instead kept decreasing it . 
  a plan ensures that there are intermediate milestones so that we do n't wind up in 2024 and only then find that things are off-track . 
   alot of spending does n't guarantee that . 
  it 's the way how and on what you spend your money . 
  yes . 
  but the assumption is that the german military is competent and would use resources made available to it effectively . 
  maybe us goals are n't what you think they are . 
  the eu involves some degree of compromise from many states . 
  the greeks probably are n't very thrilled about government reductions . 
  the french are n't too happy about farm and labor reform . 
  the poles probably are n't estatic about social liberalism . 
  is being willing to defend and fight for the eu that unreasonable for germany ? 
  i mean , i appreciate that there are national differences . 
  but germany has asked -- and rightly so , in my eyes -- other members to accept things that might not be their first preference . 
  having a military does cost money and annoys pacifists . 
  but * especially * with the uk leaving the eu ... the eu provides independent security guarantees to non-nato countries like finland . 
  germany is a huge chunk of the eu 's economy . 
  without germany pulling her weight , the eu will be in a difficult place on something that is important . 
   our military is still capped by agreement with foreign entities . 
  hmm . 
  seems like a legit point . 
  has germany raised this as something that also needs to be addressed ? 
  [ germany states that it did n't happen ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-didnt-receive-nato-invoice-from-trump-government/ ) [ ditto for the us ] ( http://m.dw.com/en/white-house-denies-reports-trump-handed-merkel-bill-for-nato-defense/a-38131490 ) the original source of the claim was an `` anonymous german official '' in the brit * sunday times * . 
  other sources picked it up without fact-checking .

   putin had previously hailed global warming for exposing natural resources and transport routes that had long been too expensive to exploit . 
  russia will probably significantly benefit from global warming . 
   the real reason for reunification with crimea was fixing mistake of khruschev who gifted russian region to ukraine for no reason . 
  the fact that soviet leadership had moved land still does not mean that a country can lop off pieces of countries and expect countries to accept it . 
  russia and ukraine had agreed to those boundaries . 
  when russia annexed karelia , she had `` no reason '' either , but russia would object strenuously to nato retaking it for finland , and rightly so . 
  much of europe has historical claims of one sort or another to land . 
  were they to all start seizing bits of each other , it would be a bloody mess . 
  the alternative is to respect state boundaries . 
  russia could have purchased crimea -- the us has purchased land from countries ( sometimes being turned down , like over greenland ) . 
  but marching in and taking the thing was going to result in a shortest , because that sort of thing is n't universalizable , is something that would be catastrophic if everyone did it . 
  the seaport is located on the north-east coast in the ice and is convenient for navigation in tsemes bay .

   you have to trade with other countries in order to actually have a product well , you do n't , but it sure helps . 
   communicate only in french . 
  of all the countries in the eu that i 'd expect to object about having the english-tending eu bring in a foreign language , the uk really seems like it has the least cause for complaint . 
  when he 's not in the us or at the german embassy . 
  maybe he 's gone off the rails .

  i dunno about you , but i 'm part of the insidious american culture spread conspiracy . 
  or at least an anti -- federalist .
