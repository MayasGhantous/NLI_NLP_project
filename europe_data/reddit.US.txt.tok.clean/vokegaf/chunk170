  [ already been done . 
  ] ( http://www.livescience.com/8980-great-white-sharks-stumbled-mediterranean.html ), 
  would be politically-infeasible to change them , and illegal immigrants are net economically-advantageous to the us , since we do n't extend welfare to them . 
  [ youtube : milton friedman : illegal immigration only helps when it 's illegal ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=c52tlpcvdio ) further , i would expect that illegal immigration to the us happens explicitly because the us administration wants it . 
  the us has seen its own population have radical changes in birth rate . 
  has the rate of expected population growth changed ? 
  [ federal projections have it remaining between 0.82 % and 0.46 % until 2060 . 
  to achieve that , you need a substantial chunk of illegal immigration . 
  i remember glancing at canada 's projections , and they 're pretty constant too . 
  the `` want to work '' thing does n't make sense . 
  if it needs to be done , wages rise until someone will do it , if it 's viable . 
  if it 's not , that industry will go elsewhere . 
  there are few reasons to hold a particular industry sacred . 
  the bigger question is whether the us as a whole is economically better-off from illegal immigration , and the answer there is `` yes '' . 
   the tolerant people of / r/europe ( and i do n't say this with sarcasm at all ) will always believe that russian can be rational . 
  they are wrong . 
  i 'd argue that it 's a pretty confident belief that russia 's government is rational that led to most cold war policy . 
  you would n't be using [ game theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/game_theory ) to model what it would do if not . 
  well , shooting down a plane has a pretty good chance of killing those aboard ... 
  in fairness , while i do n't think shooting it down is a good idea ( that is , there is no established pattern of violation that ca n't be handled in another way , and even if it was carrying a nuclear weapon , the uk 's deterrent is at sea anyway ) , if it did violate uk airspace , the uk would have the * right * to do so . 
  i 'd add that the media has plenty of writers who do n't understand the difference between airspace and adiz , so i 'm not sure that the uk 's airspace was actually violated here . 
  to be fair , while turkey and the us both do it to push claims on disputed territory , i do n't think that russia is doing it for that reason -- afaik , there are no territorial disputes around the uk . 
  the us also used to fly reconnaisance planes over russia that intentionally violated airspace , back in the days before satellites and both countries [ signing up for open skies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_open_skies ) to institutionalize the process and let each other fly spy planes over each others ' countries . 
  the uk is a signatory of that , though , so russia can just schedule a spy plane overflight if it wants to do that . 
  it 's * possible * that it was a navigation error , though i do kinda doubt that . 
  well , there was teaming up against napoleon . 
  hmm . 
  we leveraged religion pretty heavily in politics too . 
  i 've joked about how some russian positions look a lot like the us 60 years ago , during the cold war , over the atheist soviet union . 
  most of europe has a pretty extensive history of using religion in politics too . 
  i do n't think that it has much to do with whether-or-not a country has something to be proud of . 
  the black ships on a black background was not the best color choice ... 
  you might not be killed by the blast or fireball , but then you 're also in a burning , radioactive wasteland . 
  at hiroshima , the fires burned for three days . 
  there is no water , food , electricity , transport . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duck_and_cover  instead , the primary life-threatening risk survivors and downwinders could face in the long-term , is the `` nuclear famine '' issue ; the potential continuation of hostilities by conventional warfare and radioactive contamination of the food and water supplies , disrupting the normal distribution and consumption , of these vital goods . 
    continuity of government planners and civil defense organizations in general have always had this distruption , or `` nuclear famine '' issue in mind , as widespread infrastructure destruction producing starvation conditions was also seen during and after wwii . 
  papers such as on reorganizing after nuclear attack , [ 122 ] and survival of the relocated population of the u.s. after a nuclear attack by nobel prize winner , eugene wigner , detail the thought and attention that went into the issue of long-term survival and reconstruction . 
  in all fairness , the bulk of nato nuclear power is not at any of those places , and i suspect that it is at sea -- and as such , could be quite close to russia without russia knowing . 
  there are three countries with nuclear arsenals in nato : france , the uk , and the us . 
  all three have shifted towards the sea : [ ** france ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/force_de_dissuasion )  france has deactivated all land-based nuclear missiles . 
  on 27 january 1996 , france conducted its last nuclear test ( in the south pacific ) before signing the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( ctbt ) in september 1996 . 
  in march 2008 , president nicolas sarkozy confirmed reports giving the actual size of france 's nuclear arsenal and he announced that france would reduce its french air force-carried nuclear arsenal by 30 % , leaving the force de frappe with 290 warheads . 
  [ 2 ] [ ** uk ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_the_united_kingdom )  the uk retains a stockpile of 215 thermonuclear warheads , of which 120 are operational as of 2016 , but has refused to declare the exact size of its arsenal . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 4 ] since 1998 , the trident nuclear programme has been the only operational nuclear weapons system in british service . 
  the delivery system consists of four vanguard class submarines based at hmnb clyde in scotland . 
  each submarine is armed with up to 16 trident ii missiles , each carrying warheads in up to eight mirv re-entry vehicles . 
  [ ** us ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_the_united_states ) it looks like about two-thirds of us strategic warheads are aboard submarine-launched slbms ( trident ) , with most of the remainder on land and a few on bombers . 
  counting strategic weapons only , 481 land-based warheads , 920 sea-based warheads , and however many strategic nuclear weapons 80 nuclear bombers can drop . 
  slbms effectively limit response time to a launch to the distance from the coast . 
  hmm . 
  well , i sure do n't know european politics as well as i 'm sure that this guy does , but i 've been wondering whether the goal is more along the lines of eu federalization , or at least minimum military integration . 
  i 've advocated for eu federalization and written about how much of the drive for us integration was the threat of the british empire in the form of canada looming nearby . 
  had that not been the case , what is the us today could have potentially been many states . 
  it seems to me that it would be politically-useful , when integrating europe , to have a similar looming military threat . 
  politicially , you want the public to feel isolated , and that they need to band together . 
  there are two issues with this : * you need a bad guy . 
  russia would make the best choice , but her star is not rising . 
  the us would make a pretty good bad guy , but the kind of resources required to credibly oppose would be substantial and the us does n't clearly have any aspirations to land in europe ... and you probably do n't actually want to get in a fight with the us . 
  turkey ... maybe in the balkans or greece . 
  not going to look that threatening to , say , france , because turkey does n't have any beef with many countries . 
  the uk is a major power , but too friendly with europe , clearly does n't have aspirations in the mainland ( she just spent a while extricating herself ) , and not really primarily a land power . 
  * nato . 
  you 've got a pretty good argument that nato is gon na tamp down on any major military threat to the eu ( well , maybe barring the us or a nuclear war with russia where russia launches first ) . 
  my guess is that brussel 's view of washington is comparable to the other way ` round -- realistically , they 're some of the few sources in the world that could do major economic harm to each other ( china probably being the other option ) . 
  you probably want to keep 'em on-side , if for no other reason than because you do n't want to wind up on opposite sides . 
  so what you 'd ideally like , if you 're a federalist in brussels , is for nato to politically-vanish for about long enough to get through military integration efforts , then return ( albeit with you unified ) . 
  that 'll let you herd the cats-that-are-the-public in the direction towards policies that make sense . 
  there are some things to support such an interpretation : * i only see english translations , but the sources that i 've seen have pretty-consistently referenced `` trump '' or `` trump 's america '' . 
  an administration acting unreliably would pretty much fit the bill for making the us `` vanish '' politically in terms of european integration . 
  merkel does n't need to do that if her concern is specifically the us . 
  granted , there are other political reasons to do that , but i started looking for references a while back and noticed how frequently that comes up . 
  * this is concurrent with a major franco-german push for military integration . 
  * if there were serious concern about a threat and nato ( or the us , or the uk ) not following through , i 'd expect to have been seeing significant rearmament efforts . 
  that has n't happened . 
  instead , you see efforts along the lines of military integration . 
  * if there were significant concerns , i 'd expect to have seen military changes in nato . 
  the us and the uk are still cruising along as normal . 
  * merkel 's also been doing photo ops with obama . 
  i do n't know how frequently german chancellors do that with ex-presidents , but that supports an argument that merkel 's would want to be blaming `` trump 's america '' rather than `` america '' . 
  granted , there are other potential political reasons for that , but it 's at least compatible with what i 'm talking about . 
  i originally started wondering about this a few months back , when trying to understand trump ( i still do n't ) , i considered that as a possible driver for his actions . 
  trump has made statements about or associated himself with a lot of people who have said negative things about the eu . 
  he has not actually * done * anything , however ( true of pretty much all the things that he 's said ) . 
  if you were really hostile , you do n't want to say so -- you 'd want to take action while sounding nice , and he 's done the opposite . 
  so you need an explanation for something that seems to neither politically help trump nor be in us interests . 
  i suppose that there could be some political popularity there ( paleoconservative protectionists do n't want to have to compete with the rest of the world , and the process in the eu looks to some people like the [ nau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_union ) that they were opposed to , and that 's more-or-less the camp that supports trump . ), 
  but ... well , that 's a pretty indirect link , and generally-speaking , the us public does n't care much about foreign policy . 
  it 's not an election winner . 
  i 'd say that trump has done more to shift images of russia than russia association has done to help trump . 
  there 's the `` trump is an idiot '' explanation . 
  yeah , i believe that he 's made mistakes , but not that he 's simply directionless . 
  for a while , i thought that maybe he 's aiming for a nixon-style [ madman theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madman_theory ) . 
  the problem is that if he keeps threatening things without doing them , he loses his credibility to take extreme action -- he either has to do a few extreme things or he has to leverage his image at the beginning of the administration . 
  and he has n't done either . 
  one possibility might be manipulating eu-side public opinion . 
  if the us wanted eu integration but did not want to drop an alliance , and wanted to leverage the `` join or die '' political process , it * would * make a lot of sense to `` politically vanish '' from nato for a period of time . 
  it 'd explain a lot of trump 's political actions -- malloch 's statements about eu breakup , bannon , etc. 
  i 'm not sold that that 's actually what 's being done . 
  i still do n't understand a number of things that trump has done ( like his bizarre f-18-instead-of-f-35 proposal ) , and i do n't really see any great benefit to the us -- and i 'd expect that it 'd need to be pretty substantial for that kind of choreographed stuff .
