  the actions 'd be compatible , but where 's the motive ? 
  but at the very least , even if it 's not a us goal , it 'd be a good time for those who support eu integration on security to push . 
  russia 's military star is probably waning . 
  i do n't know whether there 'll be a situation where you 'll have a us leader acting more erratically . 
  brexit and turkey happening concurrently is a bonus . 
  nope , i hop accounts periodically . 
  that 's pretty impressive , given trump . 
   they regularly seal the entrances they know with the added benefit of not * only * keeping people from entering , but sealing off anyone who has been fucking around inside within the catacombs . 
  over time , the percentage of people willing to enter the catacombs will presumably drop off . 
  we and canada cooperate on a bunch of things , but we just maintain an fta . 
   this map basically confirms that east germans are of slavic origin i wonder how much difference world war ii rape made . 
  i mean , let 's say that it was `` mean base pairs difference count scaled to constant factor x '' . 
  i 'm not sure that that would be incredibly meaningful , as i do n't think that there 's any external material that it 'd be useful to compare it to -- the thing is just intended to show relative distance . 
  i guess it might be interesting to know whether two isolated populations would diverge at a linear rate or a nonlinear rate using this metric , but outside of that ... 
  go back to / r/the _ donald . 
  you probably wo n't like it here . 
  if france and germany federalize , it will . 
   rearmament and continuous integration . 
  an outside threat can be a potent -- maybe one of the few successful -- drivers for federalization , based on the us 's history !, 
   what he wants is gain votes no doubt . 
   and have us buy american weapons . 
  this target long-predated trump and is n't tied to us-produced weapons . 
  yeah , i pulled it out -- i thought that two chunks that were on the same branch were n't . 
  the [ exclusive club ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_that_border_only_one_other_country ) consisting of brunei , canada ( [ maaaaybe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_that_border_only_one_other_country ) ) , denmark , the dominican republic , the gambia , haiti , ireland , lesotho , monaco , papua new guinea , portugal , qatar , san marino , south korea , timor-leste , the uk , and vatican city . 
  it 's a distance . 
  so to find how closely-related group a is to group b , you walk back up the chart from group a and see how far left you have to go to get to a point where you can descend to group b. 
  huh . 
  i thought that most of the uk 's genetic background was from france , but it looks like i 'm wrong and it was from scandinavia . 
  edit : ah , estonia is more-closely genetically-related to latvia and lithuania than to finland . 
  wow , the finns are isolated . 
  edit2 : the argument that the catalonians have been isolated from the rest of spain sure does n't hold much weight on this graph . 
  the basques , maybe , but not catalonians . 
  edit3 : the peoples on the british isles did a much more-thorough job of intermarrying than the peoples of many other countries . 
  unless they have the plane balancing on the point of a swiss flag , i expect so . 
  maybe so , but presently they 're more expensive and are an input to everything else . 
  we ca n't all be classy , icegrillz . 
  i wish i had an easy way to search newspaper articles chronologically to see the time it took to switch `` rumania '' to `` romania '' . 
  this is more convincing me that the netherlands should change than that czechia should n't . 
  otherwise , it 'd have to be `` the czechlands '' . 
  like `` the netherlands '' . 
  which is again awkward , like the netherlands . 
  kill the article and shorten the thing . 
  i do n't have a strong preference between `` czechland '' or `` czechia '' , but i think that they 're both more-convenient to say than `` the czech republic '' . 
   those seem to be the little jars of fluff . 
  there you go : [ amazon : marshmallow fluff spread 5 pound tub ] ( https://www.amazon.com/marshmallow-fluff-spread-pound-tub/dp/b01mtz071p/ ), 
  the term `` pop '' comes from popping up in the toaster . 
  you 'll want to toast them first and eat them hot . 
  they 're pretty awful cold . 
   no , it means 1000 years , literally . . `` millennia '' is the plural of `` millennium '' . 
  it might mean 2000 years , might mean 3000 years , but it 's not gon na mean 1000 years . 
  dude would keel over from diabetes before he even made it through a fifth of the mcdonalds outlets . 
  they 've got no tolerance built up over there . 
  sometimes they try to go cheap and leave the sweetening out . 
  i 've found that you can pick up [ gallon jugs of corn syrup ] ( https://www.amazon.com/karo-light-corn-syrup-128-ounce/dp/b004ueklz6/ ) from amazon . 
  just drizzle it over whatever it is and it tastes like normal again . 
  wash your mouth out with soap . 
  [ * real * barbecue is cooked quickly over hot fires ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_maria-style_barbecue ) . 
  you can counteract that with insulin injections !, 
  we eat german food too , like [ scrapple ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scrapple ) !, 
  maybe not illegal , but if world war iii happens and the british and french have used up all our missiles and the belgians have purchased all the hershey 's chocolate at the px , there 's gon na be hell to pay !, 
  i think that / u/executivemonkey was talking about the mcrib coming from scotland , based on its name , rather than the shamrock shake . 
   french fries are widely recognised as a gift from * belgium * , in europe . 
  well , whether they 're from paris or europe , they 're damn delicious . 
  even if so , i do n't think that the burkini itself was a dire threat . 
  ahhh ... that explains it , thanks . 
  my mobile client does n't show imgur captions , so i was n't aware that they were there . 
  i can see them fine in a browser . 
  seems like it violates the `` no local crime '' rule . 
  what are your conclusions ? 
  what 's your sorting order ? 
  try sorting by `` top '' on subreddit submissions if you want to see older , more-highly-voted items . 
  yeah , but they 're also inherently anti-microbial . 
  well , that 's a fair point -- sorry about that , scotsmen !, 
  i 'd also point out the possibility of getting french fries , one of paris 's greatest gifts to the world . 
  / r/snackexchange for snack swapping with other regions . 
  you 're ignoring ethnic foods , like the [ st. patty 's day shamrock shake ] ( https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/shamrock-mccafe-shake-small.html ) . 
   not according to the americans , who claim a constitution is a single governing document we do ? 
  honestly , eliminating lingering * casus beli * might be a very sensible thing to do if it looks like someone 's planning to run around taking things over . 
  might not * stop * someone , but at least it makes it a bit harder . 
  if he 's involved with organized crime and there 's a lot of money involved , [ rico ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racketeer_influenced_and_corrupt_organizations_act ) asset forfeiture might show up . 
  unilaterally ? 
  still would n't support it . 
  if russia negotiated or purchased it from ukraine , i would n't have an issue with it -- that 's up to them . 
  the issue is the fact that this generates first-rate precedent for wars of conquest in the future . 
  i 'm pretty happy with the bbc and * the economist * , though the latter is certainly going to have an economically-liberal position . 
  i do n't think that you 'll escape * that * . 
  really , what i object to in , say , * the daily mail * is stuff like : * misleading/clickbait article titles . 
  * finding cases where the author wrote something where * i * am familiar with the situation but know that an obvious interpretation would be to misunderstand what 's going on ... and the thing being written such that the misunderstanding will tend to produce political slant . 
  this is n't inherent to taking a political position . 
  you can describe what 's going on , and then provide your take on it . 
  * use of emotionally-loaded text to get people worked up . 
  for example , want to work someone up against a group ? 
  do n't provide statistics -- instead , flood them with anecdotes about them . 
  * celebrity garbage being thrown in . 
  i guess i do n't object to it * per se * , but every i 've ever read that mixes celebrity material in with what it covers is just godawful . 
  * hufpo * is another good example , on the other side of the political aisle . 
  true , it has to sell to a mass audience . 
  but honestly , if you look at the [ * christian science monitor * ] ( https://csmonitor.com/ ) , that manages to write for a mass audience and put up simple and understandable summaries , but still avoid the unending mounds of crap . 
  you can also express political positions and still make coherent arguments . 
  [ * the atlantic * ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/ ) is center-left in the us , but it is n't just a flood of emotional appeals .
