  the [ cato institute ] ( https://www.cato.org/ ) puts out classical-liberal/libertarian articles , but they do n't have a problem supporting their points . 
  they also tend to separate policy from politics -- even though the things that they talk about have plenty of political associations , they wo n't be normally spending time complaining about people . 
  that 's the kind of thing i 'd prefer to see . 
  and when you consider how solid the bbc is and how the brits are probably the greatest producers of successful literature in the world , it 's just doubly-puzzling that so many british journals would just be frothing-at-the-mouth politics all the time . 
  afaik , it 's neither us nor uk . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_moscow_times  derk sauer , a dutch publisher who came to moscow in 1989 , made plans to turn his small , twice-weekly paper called the moscow guardian into a world-class daily newspaper ... -  until 2005 , the paper was owned by independent media , a moscow-registered publishing house ... -  that year , independent media was acquired by the finnish publishing group sanoma . 
  -  in 2015 , sanoma sold moscowtimes llc to demyan kudryavtsev , a former director of kommersant . 
  dutch -  finnish -  russian ownership . 
  it * is * certainly critical of putin , though . 
  * the guardian * is british center-left . 
  they take swipes at the tories too . 
  you can look back with archive.org and see , but i do n't recall a massive difference . 
  also , trump really is pretty bad . 
  related article [ already submitted as ] ( https://apnews.com/3182a5c895834ca191b12e578f953a5e/trump-'evolving'-on-climate-action,-pressured-by-europeansdu ), 
   are you against self-determination ? 
  i would n't support carving chunks of countries out on a `` if i can occupy it and it votes for it , i can keep it '' basis . 
  i think that that 's a pretty solid way to start generating wars ( as well as producing a substantial incentive for genocides and ethnic cleansing ) . 
  i 'd support not permitting taking countries for an empire without assent -- i think that that 's probably something that few people would be enthusiastic about . 
  well , a couple problems with this theory . 
  * europe 's military spending * has * radically fallen , and there were non-binding agreements to keep it up in the past that were ignored . 
  that is , this is a long-standing issue . 
  * there 's no obligation to purchase anything that the us makes , and in fact most eu members ( the uk possibly being a major exception ) have the bulk of their equipment come from the eu . 
  wikipedia has `` list of equipment of the german army '' and similar pages for most countries in europe , which tends to have the country-of-origin for most equipment . 
  hell , it does n't even need to be equipment -- it 'd be entirely-reasonable to pick up more-skilled people or more people . 
  * the main issue producing russia-eu tensions was a trade agreement that the eu was negotiating and had been working on for some time . 
  * nato already has agreed on this level . 
  this is not out of the blue -- member nations already agreed to this . 
  * because national defense is a [ public good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_good ) -- a classic example of same -- making funding it mandatory is the norm . 
  have to have some kind of level . 
  a rational , self-interested person ( or country , in a group of countries ) * will * underspend if given the opportunity to do so . 
  we sure have a wealth of people deeply interested in total legal immunity these days . 
   he is dealing with a massive trade deficit . 
  that 's not how this works . 
  you do n't need or want to actively push for a trade surplus , * especially * with any one country . 
  * first , trade equilibrium is established itself . 
  as you import more than you export , your currency will weaken , wages will fall , the prices of what you produce become more favorable to overseas countries , and you become a more-favorable source of exports . 
  * second , that is on the net . 
  you can maintain a persistent trade deficit with country b , as long as b maintains a deficit with country c , and then country c maintains a deficit with you . 
  trump publicly saying this is popular with , say , the uaw . 
  same thing as when politicians promote a policy as `` producing jobs '' . 
  they are n't making an economic argument . 
  they 're making a * political * argument . 
   hopefully , the uk will do the same when we leave . 
  i hope the uk does n't , because it will hurt both the uk and the eu . 
   and by friday evening , white house economic adviser gary cohn said trump 's views were indeed `` evolving . ''   `` he feels much more knowledgeable on the topic today , '' cohn said . 
  `` he came here to learn , he came here to get smarter . '' very odd phrasing . 
  normally you 'd think of `` smartness '' as separate from `` being knowledgeable '' . 
  * if you want to adopt this as a universal policy , how do you deal with `` country seizes piece of critical river , offers town on critical river a million dollars a head to vote in favor of annexation , takes country '' ? 
  * russia would not accept this policy for regions of russia , like chechnya . 
  * this was [ hitler 's argument for annexing the sudetenland ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=suxoerkjcey ) . 
  will you similarly support that ? 
  * if russia seizes , say , narva , will you use the same argument ? 
  what about narva-plus-a-select-amount-of-other-land-in-estonia-that-would-result-in-an-affirmative-vote ? 
  uh huh . 
  but that was also because once the country went to the polls , the baathists , who had minority support , were extremely unlikely to be elected . 
  do nothing , and you wind up with the public trying voting against a hostile government , and does not want to go anywhere and has had decades of maintaining its control using force . 
  or , you manage the process , and then if the country chooses to pull the baathists back in ( and it looks like ultimately they [ did permit for re-employment of some of them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accountability_and_justice_act ) ) then the option is available . 
  looking at wp , it looks like the major concerns were not with the idea of debaathification , but rather with the implementation -- that producing major unemployment produced problems . 
  how does it affect you negatively if a british school allows a student to wear a skirt ? 
  like , if you 're gon na ban homosexual behavior , if you see it as a serious concern for society , then fine , do the anti-sodomy laws and the works . 
  that 's at least internally-consistent . 
  but where 's the win in having a world where some guy can have sex with other guys , can wear a dress or whatever downtown , but in school ca n't wear a skirt ? 
  it just seems like an arbitrary restriction . 
  i mean , either guys having sex with other guys is a serious problem for society warranting government intervention or it is n't . 
  if it is , why not go all-in ? 
  if it is n't , why use half-measures ? 
  hmm . 
  that 's not listed as a cause on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_uniform i see : * attempts to produce positive academic or behavioral performance * attempts to reinforce gender roles . 
  * attempts to desexualize students . 
  in fact , the only reference to school uniforms being used was a historic effort to serve * as * a status symbol :  universities , primary schools and secondary schools used uniforms as a marker of class and status , which in turn served as a boundary . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bromance  a bromance is a close , emotionally intense , ** non-sexual ** bond between two men . 
  the goal of trade is not to maintain a trade imbalance . 
  ca n't do that persistently on the net anyway . 
  well , everyone is * couching * their statements in concerns related to the interest of the eu . 
  the `` punish the uk '' crowd says that they aim to discourage other members from leaving . 
  this article has people saying that their concern is budget contributions . 
  this does n't really seem to be very relevant to europe . 
   people of different backgrounds living together just doesnt work . 
  they start blaming each other for each other 's problems . 
  they do not integrate they live separately as tribes within the same space . 
  the us is full of groups that historically considered themselves to have different backgrounds but live together .

   liar , he does n't care about demographics , he uses it as a pretext to unleash his homophobia . 
  i mean , maybe . 
  i do think that hungary * should * care about its demographics if it does n't , and that policy there would be within his scope . 
  if your country 's got an aging and soon-to-be-crashing population , it should be on your radar . 
  i also suspect that any social values he 's talking about publicly have more to do with what sells well that what he personally feels ... 
  the difference here is the percentage of gdp and percentage of the government budget . 
  it is a bit confusing rhe first time you see it . 
  https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-spending.htm in the oecd , the governemnt budget ranges from 29 % ( ireland ) to 57 % ( france ) of the gdp .

   i mean you could ask them how they arrived at the conclusion that the american government wants to kill africans , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_infektion because in the 1960s there was an image game going on for the cold war , and the ussr did n't want the us in africa .
