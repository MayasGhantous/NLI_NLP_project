  i mean , everyone was doing that . 
  well , columbus did n't go to the mainland either ... 
  nah , because the native americans were doing okay until columbus and the follow-up trips from europe showed up . 
  maybe erdogan 's muslim explorers had better hygiene or something , i dunno . 
  well , the uk leaving means that rhe eu will presumably become less-economically-liberal , which i guess would be favorable for people who want to be left-wing . 
  from my standpoint , that comes off as a negative , but obviously the other side of the aisle may like it . 
   elsewhere it 's still not the case . 
  i think that in most of the world , borders are pretty well-defined these days , though . 
  i mean , you have a voice in it . 
  i mean , the nordic population is n't all * that * large . 
  i mean , not that i 've objection to countries coordinating efforts and all , but it seems to me that like the scale difference between a hypothetical nordic union and the eu would be so large as to neuter a lot of what the eu aims to do . 
  i kinda assumed that this was intentional -- that the idea behind eea would be to ease countries into the eu when there is n't the domestic support for eu membership -- that is , it breaks down such a move into two less-dramatic shifts . 
  but if the eea is intended to be a persistent state of affairs , it just seems to me that it 'd make sense to provide the same voice in it to all members who are expected to conform to its rules . 
  i mean , realistically , you 're not talking about all that many people or that much political shift . 
  if russia were in the eea , or turkey , or even the uk , that 's a lot of clout , enough to really shift policy a lot . 
  but at the current level , it just does n't seem like it 'd change much to me , and i suspect that it 'd be more politically-acceptable to members . 
  do you feel that norway would accept eea if they had a voice in it equivalent to that of eu members ? 
  the problem here is that while you can make more-optimal keyboards : * migration requires retraining . 
  * the text output speed gains of dvorak or whatever [ just are n't all that significant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qwerty ) . 
  it may be that some other languages have more-significant gains available , i 'll grant :  economists stan liebowitz and stephen margolis have noted that rigorous studies are inconclusive as to whether they actually offer any real benefits , [ 55 ] and some studies on keyboard layout have suggested that , for a skilled typist , layout is largely irrelevant -- even randomized and alphabetical keyboards allow for similar typing speeds to qwerty and dvorak keyboards , and that switching costs always outweigh the benefits of further training on whichever keyboard you already use . 
  * a really optimal keyboard is gon na need to be language-specific . 
  if you do that , you get overhead from people switching across keyboard-use boundaries again . 
  * some applications have optimized to the existing layout . 
  so , for example , programming languages and various syntaxes have tended to grab symbols in the us layout ( i suspect that the use of '' # '' as a comment in many languages is an example ) even if they are n't really an obvious choice , just because it 's available . 
  honestly , use of the number sign in its original form is pretty uncommon . 
  ditto for the ampersand , the at sign , the backslash , the vertical bar ... but now they 've all firmly embedded themselves into protocols and conventions because they were on a us keyboard and people looking for an unused key grabbed them . 
  well , that escalated quickly . 
  there [ does n't seem to be much letter frequency difference between german and english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_frequency ) . 
  i 'm actually kinda surprised that : * germany uses a different layout * that if germany was going to use a different layout , that it would n't be a more-highly-optimized one than qwerty ( which is n't even all that optimal for english ) . 
  i mean , if you 're gon na have a different keyboard , why not go all out ? 
  i heard you like some bavaria in your bavaria , so i added some extra bavaria .

  just as a reminder to folks using the term `` bankruptcy '' , because i see it misused a lot -- `` bankruptcy '' is n't a synonym for `` being broke '' . 
  it 's a legal process that happens that causes a court to take over control of the finances involved to some degree to sort things out with creditors . 
  countries can not undergo bankruptcy : there is no concept of bankruptcy in international law . 
  mostly because san francisco ( and california in general ) has some really dumb laws that discourage construction , which means that instead of buildings going upwards , prices go upwards .

  there is an across-the-board-shift among publics in favor of defending allies ( yes , including in germany ) , with the exception of the uk ( where i suspect a lot of people are pretty pissed off over bad feelings stemming from brexit ) .

   subcontinent [ unless you 're in russia , japan , or eastern europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent#number ) , continent . 
   hell , i 'd pay through my nose for any service that offers italian westerns . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spaghetti_western  the best-known spaghetti westerns were directed by sergio leone and scored by ennio morricone , notably the three films of the dollars trilogy -- * a fistful of dollars * ( 1964 ) , * for a few dollars more * ( 1965 ) , and * the good , the bad and the ugly * ( 1966 ) -- as well as * once upon a time in the west * ( 1968 ) . 
  looks like flixsearch.io lets you see where netflix has rights to offer a movie . 
  https://flixsearch.io/movie/a-fistful-of-dollars-1964 netflix * does * have * a fistful of dollars * , but only in australia , christmas island , cook islands , new zealand , niue , san marino , and tokelau . 
  https://flixsearch.io/movie/for-a-few-dollars-more * for a few dollars more * is available in france , french polynesia , ** italy ** ( which i guess covers the `` local movies '' thing ) , mayotte , new caledonia , reunion , saint pierre and miquelon , san marino ( not sure how they get all the content ) , vatican , and wallis and futuna . 
  https://flixsearch.io/movie/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-1968 * the good , the bad , and the ugly * is available in australia , christmas island , cook islands , denmark , finland , ** italy ** ( another local one ) , new zealand , niue , norway , san marino , sweden , tokelau , and the vatican . 
  https://flixsearch.io/movie/once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-1968 * once upon a time in the west * is available in anguilla , antigua and barbuda , argentina , aruba , barbados , belize , bolivia , brazil , the british virgin islands , cayman islands , chile , colombia , costa rica , curacao , denmark , dominica , the dominican republic , ecuador , el salvador , finland , grenada , guatemala , guyana , haiti , honduras , iceland , ** italy ** ( another local one ) , jamaica , mexico , montserrat , netherlands antilles , nicaragua , norway , panama , paraguay , peru , saint kitts and nevis , saint lucia , saint vincent and the grenadines , san marino ( someday , someone 's gon na open up a vpn provider there ) , sint maarten , suriname , sweden , trinidad and tobago , turks and caicos islands , usa , uruguay , the vatican , and venezuela . 
  so , of those italian westerns , the only one that is n't available in italy is * a fistful of dollars * . 
  that seems like netflix is more-or-less doing a pretty decent job . 
  well , if that were the goal , i 'd expect the requirement to be that all content be vetted by an eu regulatory commission , not that 30 % of the catalog offerings come from the eu . 
   if you do n't reciprocate , you lose competitivity . 
  in the protected industry , yes . 
  but subsidizing industry via protectionism must happen ( if it has any effect ) via forcing purchases to happen domestically that otherwise would have happened from a foreign company . 
  that amounts to a dollar transfer of funds from other , healthy-and-competitive industries to the protected one . 
  other industries are effectively paying less in buying power in terms of whatever the protected industry produces . 
  so , sure . 
  that industry becomes more-competitive ... but the healthy industries in the country become less-competitive . 
  and now , by distorting the market via adding those artificial barriers to trade , you wind up with a lower level of economic efficiency . 
  that is , you 're worse-off than you would have been by simply leaving the market alone in the first place . 
  yeah , fair ` nuff , and i suppose that in your shoes i might have some similar gripes . 
  it 's still not what i see as being an optimal outcome , though ... 
  i do n't really understand the rationale for lvt . 
  it generates an artificially-high incentive to densely-develop relative to property tax . 
  if there 's some externality to low density , it seems like you 'd want a more-fine-tunable mechanism to assess tax than just `` do n't value constructions on the land . 
  afaik , there 's no major uptake of lvt . 
  i 'm wondering if it might be that since a few large landowners might be those who are most-hit by lvt , that it 's easier to sell politically or something . 
  i do n't think that the decision is a good one , but i 'm glad that it was made via qmv , at least -- no bias against change . 
  poor steve irwin . 
  i do n't know the political history behind cap , but my guess is that it 's to buy off farmers in eu members that have protectionist agricultural policy that became less-protectionist when joining the eu ( at least as regards other members in the customs union ) . 
  it might have been that without that , the political support required to lower barriers to agricultural trade in the eu would not have shown up . 
  yes , it 's not efficient , and in an ideal world , it would n't exist . 
  but at the end of the day , as leader , your job is to sell a herd of cats on going in the right direction . 
  might have needed a carrot . 
  [ muslims discovered america before columbus , claims turkey 's erdogan ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/11/15/muslims-discovered-america-before-columbus-claims-turkeys-erdogan/?utm_term=.cdc64c3fc23e ) and a riveting history it will be , i expect !, 
  yeah , but i 'm pretty sure that nobody cared about it over here because it was based on a notable book in poland , but based on the game 's own merits . 
  i 'd never heard of the book series , but the games got rave reviews all over . 
  now , i dunno , maybe the publisher used proceeds from selling the earlier stuff to fund content for the later ones . 
  but i do n't think that it was a matter of building up mindshare . 
  if you 've got a position that you intend to be consistent with -- and i expect germany did work out a plan for how to deal with terrorist incidents -- might as well be consistent with it . 
   many of the clubs publicly boasted that they had links to russian special forces and used gru or fsb insignia ... ehhh ... is this on par with martial arts studios saying `` i know the techniques of ancient < region  in korea '' ?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reddit  social news and - media aggregation i mean , it 's a semantic argument , but presumably if the eu 's only applying it to social media platforms they 've got some kinda definition , and i would n't be surprised if that definition does include reddit .

  i think i 'd rather not have my government screw with the market , frankly , regardless of whatever the eu gets up to on the matter .
