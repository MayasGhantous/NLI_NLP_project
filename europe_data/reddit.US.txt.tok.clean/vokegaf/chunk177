  you * do * use the metric system . 
  well , some states do , mostly to make some random pissed off nativists happy . 
  afaict , it does n't actually impact anything other than buying some votes somewhere . 
  the country as a whole does n't . 
  we do have puerto rico as a territory ( and maybe , soon , a state ) , and it has both spanish and english as official languages . 
   the saddest part is that , even if they were to produce anything , we would n't know and just think `` that 's american '' . 
  perhaps the us has relatively non-restrictive positions on cultural products coming in , and so what you 'd think of as `` american '' winds up being more-or-less what would show up in any place without many barriers to content showing up that exports a lot of products ? 
  i mean , anime-style work , japanese video games , ninja , samurai , and so forth did n't originate here , but they 've been popular and left their mark . 
  if , say , brazil was the main company that was exporting that content to europe , would it be thought of as brazilian ? 
  i was n't actually aware that greece was deeply into movie production . 
  i 'd have thought that france would have been the major supporter . 
   also all the major studios in america are against netflix so i do n't think the us government would have that much of a problem with this . 
  why would the us government care how major studios feel about netflix ? 
  hell , blockbuster did n't like netflix either . 
  the uk was an economically-liberalizing influence . 
  i 'm gon na be kinda curious how things tend to evolve in the eu from here on out . 
  was one of the major reasons that i 'd hoped that the uk would remain , because i think that economic liberalism is advantageous , but ... < shrug , 
  well , it does help people making cheap filler -- someone 's got ta produce that . 
  i mean , i like subtitled films ( at least compared to dubbed films ) , but i also remember how disruptive it was when i first started watching them . 
  i mean , films are n't made with the intention of being watched with subtitles , so it 's one more thing that competes for attention . 
  i liked * amilie * , * a clockwork orange * , * lock , stock , and two smoking barrels * , and * the professional * from [ this list ] ( http://www.imdb.com/list/ls002611887/ ) . 
  some other things that occur off-the-cuff : * snatch * , * hot fuzz * , * sean of the dead * , * das boot * , * the good , the bad , and the ugly * , * once upon a time in the west * , and * pan 's labyrinth * . 
  edit : oh , you meant specifically art films from europe , not popular films . 
  yeah , well , make a film for a niche , and you 're gon na get a niche audience ... 
  well , there 's three forms of justification i think i could see . 
  i do n't particularly buy any one , but : * ** human culture needs the government 's guiding hand ** . 
  this is not really something that the us goes in for , but some countries in europe ( i think france ? ), 
  we do n't have , for example , a ministry of culture or equivalent , but [ much of europe does ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_minister ) . 
  the idea , i guess , is that the market is * not * efficient for selecting for artistic items , and so the enlightened members in the government should choose what 's best for the public . 
  i 'm skeptical on this one , particularly since if that were the case , i 'd expect the restriction to be that all content must pass some sort of vetting , not that 30 % be from europe . 
  * ** the eu has national security or other concerns in heavy exposure to content from abroad ** i 'm assuming this comes mostly from the us , maybe some from canada and japan . 
  it could be that maybe there 's a worry about some sort of coordinated , subtle effort to influence society by modifying media . 
  i 'm doubtful -- again , if that were the risk , you 'd expect a ban , not a 30 % from europe argument . 
  * ** [ infant industry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infant_industry_argument ) argument ** . 
  some people will argue that an industry requires subsidy until it can reach some scale , at which point it can successfully compete internationally . 
  my understanding , from the few people who are in econ that i 've asked about this , is that the argument is not given much weight , but there are some real , honest-to-god supporters of it . 
  in this view , the idea is that people would n't watch eu-originating movies now , but if those industries are subsidized , they will become large and experienced and make competitive content , at which point the subsidies can be removed . 
  the obvious risk : you wind up with healthy , competitive industries being bled to prop up an industry that did n't develop to be internationally competitive . 
   and i see no reason why , if this is imposed , trump and other foreign players , including the uk , should n't similarly strike back against eu companies . 
  i do n't really think that state involvement is necessary . 
  * amazon goes and forms `` amazon germany '' ( if it does n't already have it ) . 
  * amazon international proceeds to operate as normal . 
  * amazon germany complies with the content restriction . 
  * amazon germany charges higher prices from customers to pay for content that would n't otherwise have broken even . 
  all competitors have to do the same , so they 're on an even competitive footing . 
  it 's not impacting amazon international , which can still simply choose things based on whatever sells the best . 
  it 's not impacting amazon germany in a way that harms it relative to competitors -- all of amazon germany 's competitors will need to deal with the same restrictions . 
  it hurts eu consumers , but they 've got input into the eu . 
  i 'm suspicious that language is something of a barrier there . 
   i feel like trumps blabbering and promises have literally changed nothing nonsense !, 
  any minute now he 's gon na make america great again !, 
  hmm . 
  reddit is social media . 
  this may be interesting ... 
  us free speech standards and eu free speech standards were always going to collide at some point . 
  one possibility might be to flag some areas as `` uncurated '' and some `` curated '' and simply block `` uncurated '' areas in europe . 
  that way , mods become responsible for deciding , for their sub , whether they want to police for content on their sub , and if not , it just is n't available in the eu . 
  this is going to be a general problem -- china will presumably have its own demands , for things like criticism of the government , and so forth ...  the proposals also include a quota of 30 percent of european films and tv shows on video streaming platforms such as netflix and amazon prime video , up from the 20 percent originally proposed by the european commission . 
  i suspect that you 're going to wind up with an `` amazon europe '' and an `` amazon international '' if you do that . 
  i mean , there already * are * country-specific amazon variants , but you get my drift . 
  i 'm not sure that requiring 30 % of ( assuming cataloged , not watched/sold ) videos be from europe really helps much , also . 
  it just means that some niche non-europe videos wo n't be available , since amazon is gon na stock the popular non-europe ones in preference to the unpopular ones . 
  so if it subsidizes european filmmakers , it 's only in low-sales niches -- they 're still about as badly off against blockbusters . 
  property tax . 
  0.5 % property tax , say . 
  we have it , canada has it , ireland has it . 
  it 'd help avoid future bubbles and with a property tax it would n't matter if properties were vacant . 
  it 'd stop a few wealthy britons from tying down land that could be more productively-used . 
  well , i guess you could argue that it has deterrence value ( do n't block me trying to join the eu ) except for the fact that that seems unlikely to cone up again . 
  maybe domestic political support . 
  yes , it is turkey 's right . 
  but it 's also annoying to everyone else in nato to drag in eu disputes , and i 'm confident that it wo n't buy turkey anything in terms of a better relationship with austria . 
  well ... i guess it 's better to have the problem of being so popular and desirable that lots of people want to come than the problem of nobody wanting to stay ... 
  that 's more people than are in denmark . 
  have they not caught anyone ? 
  moritorium on guilt-tripping germany , guys . 
  what does `` western europe '' mean in this context , though ? 
  germany ? 
  france ? 
  the uk ? 
  more german -- strike that , make it eu -- flags are required !, 
  put it in a geographically-central area to maximize ability to deal with submarine-launched missiles aimed at it ? 
  all in favor of summary execution by hanging of / u/low _ discrepancy , say aye !, 
  drugs need to be near the center ? 
  i mean , how much throughput are we really talking about ? 
  i do n't even understand why it would split at warsaw pact lines . 
  at very high level , someone 's got overall command . 
  but i think that the goal is to normally operate along national lines where possible . 
  i ca n't think of many examples where you get , say , a unit of just soldiers from mixed countries . 
  we have some [ exchange officers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exchange_officer ) :  the british and the u.s. armed services have many exchange officers ; for example , a british officer has been attached to the united states military academy at west point for many years . 
  sure , but those countries also are n't going to want them . 
  [ < checks eurostat  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:electricity_and_gas_prices,_second_half_of_year,_2013%e2%80%9315_%28eur_per_kwh%29_yb16.png ) : from 2015 numbers ( which appear to be the newest graphed ) : the eu-28 industry average is 0.119 eur/kwh , but in that table , germany is listed as having the second-highest industry cost , at 0.149 eur/kwh . 
  i 'm not sure whether you have newer numbers as your source , though . 
  the lowest eur-28 price listed appears to be sweden , at 0.059 eur/kwh . 
  not sure if you were asking me personally to beat it or other eu members . 
  the us also [ has data ] ( https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a ) , and there i see numbers up to 2017 : 0.0663 usd/kwh on average , lowest being washington state at 0.0458 usd/kwh . 
  edit : i 'd add that while eurostat does not list industry data for iceland , my understanding is that iceland is the place in the european single market with the lowest industrial energy costs due to abundant geothermal sources -- i read an article some time back about aluminum production and other energy-intensive industry locating there . 
  i 'd rather just fix english 's spelling , but maybe i 'm biased . 
   few to no women ranked highly enough the us secdef does n't need to be from the military or have high rank .
