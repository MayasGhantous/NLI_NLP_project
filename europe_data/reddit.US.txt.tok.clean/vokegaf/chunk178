  so it 's rare to really draw from a pool of high-ranking military officers . 
  rather , someone with some military experience who has also worked in some sort of administrative and maybe having some relevant experience . 
  i 'd be opposed to hiring a woman for the sake of hiring a woman , but i am sure that there are women out there who could do the job . 
  i agree that at least in france , it appears to be the norm that the job go to a politician , someone whose background is in running for offices , rather than a specialist in intelligence or military work . 
  i would guess that that means that they have an appointed deputy or some bureaucrat directly under them that winds up doing more-specialized work , and probably does not change from administration to administration . 
  whether that 's a better approach or not ... < shrug  either way , they 're going to have * access * to someone with expertise . 
  i think that there 's sometimes a tendency to over-attribute how much the head of an organization personally does with their experience . 
  it 's not as if they 're expected to be a better domain expert than everyone in the field . 
  could be true , but what i 'm getting at is that it 's pretty unlikely that global warming is the cause for a dry sweden . 
  to expand further :  chapter vii of the united nations charter   article 51 : ** nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of collective or individual self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the united nations ** , until the security council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security . 
  measures taken by members in exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the security council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the security council under the present charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security . 
  `` if i do n't control debt , other members wo n't be willing to do so either '' ? 
   `` of course we will at some point need many such factories ( to mass produce battery cells ) around the world , '' he said . 
  `` but if energy costs in germany are what they are , then they ( factories ) will not be based in germany . '', 
  whichever member of the customs union has the lowest electricity costs is going to have a not-insignificant industrial edge in the eu , especially for things like steel and cement production . 
  the saudi government probably has not financed the bombing . 
  in the same comment he used `` eu '' , so we know that `` europe '' does n't mean `` eu '' in this context . 
  i assume that it 's not the british sense of the mainland . 
  if it means the continent , should include the uk . 
  oh c'mon , you have n't had a `` k '' there since chaucer . 
  is albania not democratic ? 
  does n't like being near people at what an american would consider normal distance , but entirely comfortable at being nude and sweaty in a sauna with others . 
  a finn started and runs the linux project . 
  wall ... catalonia 's got a point that it 's not just compressing the income scale , which is normal , but making them poorer than other areas that are not taxed as heavily , which is not . 
  obviously , that 's a matter for spain , but i can certainly understand and sympathize with catalonia on that matter . 
  do you have an argument in favor of that other than `` it 's advantageous to non-catalonian regions and no other members want to change it '' ? 
  it does n't really seem like all spaniards are being treated equally on that matter . 
  my manliness has clearly been insulted !, 
  i 'd best react in a hostile way to ensure that i do n't loose respect !, 
  that 's only when it 's unintentional . 
   their terrorist bodyguards beat up protesters in us and now ** turkey ** demand an apology from the us . 
  different issue . 
  they complained about how our people treated the security guys who had been beating the protestors up . 
  apparently , we promised to look into it . 
  just because we 've got a grievance does n't mean that they do n't have one too . 
  because they 're women ? 
  hell , i thought that hillary was getting flak for being a `` warmonger '' . 
  the eu is n't expected to see much precipitation reduction except around spain .

  scottish independence smells of elderberries . 
   michael kofman , russian arms expert at the cna corporation and a fellow at the kennan institute , woodrow wilson international center , notes that this deployment is set to take place over the next two years , though on the face of it `` there is very little special about the iskander . ''   `` because western media is fixated on it , the weapon system has become politically useful -- it 's a self-licking ice cream cone in terms of effect , '' he says , referring to the panic that the mention of the missile often prompts , without russia coming close to firing it . 
  hmm . 
  sounds like it 's time to introduce a new [ nato reporting name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nato_reporting_names_for_surface-to-surface_missiles ) for this new extended-range model . 
  needs to start with an `` s '' , as it 's a surface-to-surface missile . 
  maybe `` schoolgirl '' or `` sparkles '' or `` sheep '' or `` slowpoke '' . 
  could use it in press releases to avoid confusion with the older , shorter range model . 
  if it sounds less-threatening too , well , bonus . 
   havok [ havoc ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/havoc ), 
   europe has moved on beyond petty national interests . 
  ehhh ... i just spent a while digging through a [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6cfx53/brexit_could_have_frightening_impact_on_irish/ ) that consisted mostly of irish and british people flinging shit at each other and [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6cm0ka/catalonia_to_immediately_declare_independence_if/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) with catalonian separatists and other spaniards throwing shit at each other . 
  i clicked !, 
  what exactly would you * do * with it if you had it ? 
   for germany , the idea is to share its resources with smaller countries in exchange for the use of their troops . 
  eh , not unreasonable . 
  probably cheaper labor costs in some other eu members . 
  how exactly would someone find that objectionable or interfering in internal affairs ? 
   people starve to death if there 's food shortages . 
  i mean , i agree , but if your concern is `` there might be a global food shortage and europe would be in trouble '' . 
  i doubt that that 's a concern in europe . 
  you guys can probably outbid most of the world if there were a global food shortage . 
  true , but i would also guess that internationally , tariffs are lower , shipping costs are lower , overland transport costs are lower , and refrigeration is more-widely-available than it was in 1958 . 
   the us however ... you ca n't really compete with their huge farms . 
  yeah . 
  if the us and the uk sign an fta , it 'll tend to clobber british farmers ( well , at least some ) . 
  but it 'll also make britons better-off on the whole . 
  france does not want a us-eu fta on agriculture ( or any other eu-major-agricultural-producer ) -- it 'd be better for france , as a net agricultural exporter , to not have competition in that market and to have high agriculture tariffs . 
  france would prefer to have many net agricultural importers in the customs union or with ftas with the eu . 
  but the opposite applies to the uk , which is a net agricultural importer -- the uk would want low agriculture tariffs and ftas with many agricultural exporters . 
  uk * farmers * do n't , agreed . 
  but uk processed food manufacturers -- got ta have inputs to make jaffa cakes -- and food consumers do . 
  / u/pindar _ mc is correct , at least when it comes to agriculture . 
  if you 're a net exporter of something , it is to your benefit and the other party 's loss like to be in a customs union with a net importer of that thing and high tariffs on that thing . 
  given that the eu tends to have tariffs that protect agriculture for its own internal political reasons ( still modernizing agriculture ) , and that i 'd assume that the uk would drop tariffs , no -- i think that british farmers will probably take a whomping in brexit . 
  but i think that it will probably also increase the buying power of britons as food goes and on the net be advantageous to the uk . 
  i mean , i do n't see why anything would have changed * vis-a-vis * exports . 
  yeah , ftas require negotiation . 
  but the uk does n't need an fta to import beef at any tariff rate it wants to set . 
  the only time that a nation would prevent a country from buying its products would be if it 's embargoing it , and i doubt that any country in the world is likely to be embargoing the uk . 
  well , canada 's pretty close to the us , [ but australia is our # 1 source of foreign beef , and new zealand our # 3 ] ( http://beef2live.com/story-beef-imports-country-2015-vs-2016-0-155400 ) , and neither are very close ... looks like about as far away as they are from london . 
  i dunno if the shipping distance is the most critical factor for beef . 
  i mean , i agree that there are some goods for which that 's the dominant cost , and maybe , say , south america would make more sense if the uk winds up doing that . 
  but i suspect that high eu food costs outweigh that , or else the us would be importing more irish beef -- it looks like we only import about half-a-percent what we do from ireland . 
  ` course , i agree that the uk might have different preferences as to standards -- some countries might be unacceptable , or some country that we do n't do business with might be preferable . 
  but i would not gamble against the potential for the beef market to go abroad . 
   there are plenty of food sources outside of the eu that will be both cheaper and have high quality . 
  from canada , australia and new zealand i would imagine . 
  canada , australia , and new zealand ( and mexico ) [ are actually the top sources from which the us imports beef ] ( http://beef2live.com/story-beef-imports-country-2015-vs-2016-0-155400 ) . 
  oh , oh , he 's talking about the other country , not catalonia .
