  aight , fair enough . 
  i imagine that the constitutional court of spain would rule on the extent to which article 155 is necessary , of course ... 
   other countries to just ignore national laws , international laws and decades of diplomacy i am pretty sure that there is n't any international law prohibiting secessions . 
  i do n't agree . 
  in any voting system , you want a high bar for modifying the power to vote or extending that power to new members . 
  if it 's merely a majority required , the first time you have a majority , you pass changes to get it forever . 
  note that this account is one day old and is pretty clearly trolling for bites . 
  [ some countries never recognized the baltics as anything but independent . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#western_non-recognition_of_annexation )  most of the countries in the western bloc refused to recognise the incorporation of the baltic states de jure and only recognised the soviet governments of estonian ssr , latvian ssr and lithuanian ssr de facto or not at all . 
  [ 27 ] [ 28 ] such countries recognized estonian/latvian/lithuanian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in the name of their former governments . 
  these aging diplomats persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of baltic independence . 
  [ 29 ]   during the period 1940 -- 1991 the us continued to receive baltic diplomats , first appointed in office by the baltic governments before 1940 , after 1980 by the baltic diplomatic services senior members . 
  [ 30 ] the soviet foreign ministry issued formal protests against the baltic diplomatic missions remaining open in washington dc and elsewhere . 
  [ 31 ]   in 1947 a joint communication on the occupation of baltic states to the un was sent by the estonian , latvian and lithuanian diplomats abroad . 
  the baltic appeal to the united nations ( now `` baltic association to the united nations '' ) was formed in 1966 . 
    on march 26 , 1949 , the us state department issued a circular stating that the baltic states were still independent nations with their own diplomatic representatives . 
  [ 32 ]   in canada the official list of diplomats included the offices of the baltic states : estonia , latvia and lithuania that in the early 1960s caused the soviet embassy in canada to refuse to receive the lists distributed by the canadian department of external affairs . 
   thing is , we already tried that , in 2012 , and we got a big `` no '' at anything we proposed . 
  there is no way we can go back to that now , it 's too late and we 're commited to this people who might say `` yeah , catalonia 's got some reasonable grounds for a reduced tax load '' like myself feel a lot less sympathetic to a `` well , we decided that we crossed a line when it comes to secession , so the other options are n't available now '' . 
   this is speculation after all , but even in a worst case scenario we come out winning , even if it 's just beacause we actually can invest our full gdp . 
  so what happens when cities and regions around the eu start thinking about seceding so that they can retain more money and avoid having to transfer funds to poorer areas ? 
  scottish oil was a selling point in the scottish referendum campaign , for example . 
   it has no competence over it . 
  i was curious whether the [ icj ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_court_of_justice ) could theoretically rule if both parties agreed to it . 
  nope . 
  they explicitly avoid these , as they want no part of these sorts of things :  in contentious cases ( adversarial proceedings seeking to settle a dispute ) , the icj produces a binding ruling between states that agree to submit to the ruling of the court . 
  only states may be parties in contentious cases . 
  individuals , corporations , parts of a federal state , ngos , un organs and self-determination groups are excluded from direct participation in cases ... 
  without the famine , though , i suspect that there would n't have been a split . 
   phasing out the horse did result in decline in horse population , dramatically . 
  but it did n't result in a persistent decline in the number of people employed . 
   if less people will be needed what would the rest do for a living ? 
  there is n't a fixed number of jobs out there -- this concept is the [ lump of labor fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lump_of_labour_fallacy ) . 
  you 'd wind up reshuffling , and they 'd be doing whatever 's next down on their preference list -- you 'd have businesses that did n't exist before . 
  quite potentially for less money or a job that they 'd less prefer , mind , but it does n't imply unemployment . 
  society as a whole winds up paying slightly lower prices for transported goods , and thus is better off on the net . 
  it 's not a new process -- this happens every time economic needs change and demand shifts . 
   the biggest thing for the irish people is not to be stopped at the border between the north and the republic . 
  okay : that requires not just a turkey-style less-comprehensive-customs-union agreement , but remaining entirely within the customs union , since there ca n't be differences between tariffs on either side ( at least on any physical good that might be smuggled ) . 
  i 'd imagine that that 'd be a pretty tough sell to both the uk and the eu . 
  * the customs union does n't give the uk the economic access to the eu that it wants for its businesses , which is the single market , but would require it to accept significant restrictions ; i 'd imagine that the uk would object to that . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the eu would object to extending single-market access paired with customs union membership ; after all , that 'd essentially be what the uk had originally been trying to get . 
  * the tariff schedule that the eu chooses are probably not the ones the uk would choose . 
  if the uk gets the ability to influence eu customs union tariffs without having to join the eu -- which would be a pain in the rear for the eu going on into the future -- i suspect that eu members would object . 
  if the uk simply has to accept whatever trade rules the eu hands down -- which would be a potent power over the uk -- i suspect that the uk would object . 
   the uk has also said that one of there objectives is that there would be a seemless border . 
  i am suspicious that what 's been said amounts to `` we will not impose a border , and if the eu wants to do so , let it be on their heads '' , but i doubt that it 's a blank check to doing things that would make life convenient for the eu and be harmful to the uk ( like ceding ni , accepting eu customs union restrictions , or imposing internal customs borders ) . 
   they are n't just * de facto * independent , they are republic of china . 
  this is one subject that i * really * do n't want to argue semantics on , but can we agree that at least in the eyes of the prc , they are not * de jure * independent ? 
  no , i mean that if you object to the constitutional tribunal having power in catalonia , where that body is responsible for interpreting the spanish constitution , you 're asking to be exempted from the spanish constitution . 
  i 'm not aware of any countries exempting portions of the countries from their constitution without those portions no longer being considered part of the country . 
  what 's slovakia going to say when parts of estonia and latvia decide that they want to split off and be annexed by russia ? 
  sure , they are n't whole countries , by you 've already established that that 's not important . 
  how many countries are going to want to join the eu if the eu supports parts of them leaving and joining the eu as independent members ? 
  i mean , hell , it 's probably good for eurofederalism if it splinters up member countries enough , but i 'd think that it 'd be pretty alarming to member countries . 
  asking for exemption from spain 's constitution sounds pretty much like leaving the country to me . 
  well , there 's the `` i want to pay less taxes to the poorer parts of spain '' thing . 
  taiwan is * de facto * independent . 
  for china , taiwan going * de jure * independent would be a massive political loss -- it 's at the core of prc politics to not let it do so . 
  it could go to war over that . 
  if it does so , the us could go to war over that . 
  neither china nor the us nor taiwan particularly wants a china-us war in taiwan . 
  it would also quite potentially produce one hell of a large global economic spat . 
  so you have to ask just how much the us cares , how much china cares , and how much taiwan cares about that seat . 
  add that to the fact that taiwan 's politically-split on the issue . 
  i 'm pretty sure that nobody else is going to involve themselves in the situation . 
  those three governments have been sitting on the * status quo * , so ... edit : given the response , i should probably point out that i 'm using the term loosely and should probably have explicitly said `` taiwan does n't have a un seat '' rather than '' * de jure * '' , since that implies that there 's an across-the-board accepted status and i imagine that that 's gon na piss off some people . 
  summary from wp : back in the day , taiwan never pushed for independent recognition , since it hoped to take over china and re-establish itself as running it . 
  later , taiwan cut a deal with china as to an intentionally-ambiguous wording , the next taiwanese administration disagreed as to the legitimacy of that deal , the us said `` we have n't taken a position '' , and china blocks the un seat . 
  taiwan has very low support for unification and probably would n't permit it outside of force , the us has said that it 's free to get involved militarily if china tries forcible reunification , china has said that it 's free to get involved militarily if taiwan declares that it is independent , and for the moment , i doubt that anyone wants to change that . 
  result : china uses ambiguous status to claim that taiwan is part of china , taiwan uses ambiguous status to ( depending upon party ) claim that china is part of taiwan or taiwan is not associated with china , the us has n't made any claim one way or the other , china does n't have control of taiwan . 
  [ switzerland appears to be okay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romansh_language ) :  romansh is a romance language spoken predominantly in the southeastern swiss canton of grisons ( graub\u00fcnden ) , where it has official status alongside german and italian and is used as the medium of instruction in schools in romansh-speaking areas . 
  romansh has also been recognized as a national language of switzerland since 1938 and as an official language along with german , french and italian since 1996 . 
  ah , okay , so it 's not just `` i want to trade without barrier '' a la fta but `` i want there to be a barrier to the uk trading with other parties who might undercut the roi ? '', 
  the uk has already said that it 's not staying in the customs union when it brexits , but let 's say that it could cut some sort of limited , two-party customs union agreement , like turkey or some other countries have . 
  it only applies to agriculture , say . 
  if the roi gets the uk to enter into a turkey-style agreement , it would be effectively getting the uk to agree to paying higher agricultural prices . 
  the uk 's not going to do that without something else from the eu in exchange . 
  that would presumably have to be something of at least equal value to the uk , and probably is more-or-less zero-sum with the eu . 
  if so , it 'd just be an eu subsidy to roi agriculture routed through the uk . 
  i just do n't see it making sense for the eu -- if the roi has enough clout to get the eu to do that , it might as well just demand the subsidy directly from the eu . 
  if it does n't , it 's probably not going to get funds routed through the uk . 
  this is fifteen minutes of recorded audio and video showing text that should have just been text . 
  all right , but i was responding to / u/an _ craca_mor . 
  nah , because / u/an _ craca_mor was talking about * replacing * a language . 
  modern psoe is n't socialist . 
  but it has `` socialist '' in its name , and once upon a time , it * was * a marxist party . 
  it clearly became less marxist . 
  the thread was arguing over whether a nazi party could become less-so , or a marxist party less-so . 
   what 'll happen uh , nothing ? 
  if that is true , then you must believe that the swedish justice system does not work , since if the standard of proof can not be met , his name gets cleared . 
   ecuador wants britain to grant safe passage to assange . 
  the uk has already said that if he comes out , he 's being hit with his british charges . 
  was n't aware that it originally had lyrics . 
  [ classical liberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_liberalism ) is what people mean when they say `` neoliberalism '' . 
  they just want to attach a negative connotation . 
  not a union of countries , though . 
  back when the united states was a confederation under the [ articles of confederation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/articles_of_confederation ) , it was pretty dysfunctional . 
  europe has some parties with `` socialist '' in their name that , over the decades , as economic views have shifted , have stopped advocating for socialist policies and become social democrat parties . 
  [ psoe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_socialist_workers%27_party ) would be an example .
