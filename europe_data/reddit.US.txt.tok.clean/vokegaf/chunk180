  this was originally marxist . 
  i could imagine parties in other areas having positions that shifted too . 
   uk should stay in customs union , farming and food bodies tell seanad committee i do n't really see the point of having roi industry groups say that brexit sucks for them . 
  obviously it does , but it sucks for the roi as a whole , and if the roi had any way to reverse it , it would have done so already . 
  saying `` we need policy x as part of a brexit deal '' would be different . 
  if they 're trying to get beef and fish included in an eu-uk fta , which might be achievable , why not just advocate for that ? 
  could be that german and greek leaders agree on what is to be best done , but that it 'd be politically-unacceptable to one or more publics at the moment . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_area  turkey, 
  well ... i mean , i do n't think * impossible * is the right word . 
  you could pass a law that speaking english is illegal . 
  ban the teaching of english . 
  eventually ban the import of goods containing english . 
  i think that it 'd be inefficient and not in ireland 's interests , but if there was sufficient political will to do so , you could presumably do it . 
  wait a lifetime , and you have a gaelic ireland . 
  is it right to call english latin-based ? 
  i mean , it obviously pulled in a ton of vocabulary from romance languages ( from wikipedia , it looks like the majority ) , but does that make it latin-based ? 
  i 'd think that a `` latin-based language '' would be a romance language . 
   a country without a language is a country without a soul . 
  gee , thanks , ireland . 
  what 's your beef with ryan ? 
  what i know of him seems pretty decent . 
  and i do n't think that pence would be * nearly * as embarrassing as trump . 
  just as phasing out the horse did n't result in the economy shutting down , so , i expect , reducing the number of sailors will not either . 
  this is not a new process . 
  every time we moved to larger and faster ships , we reduced the number of workers required to ship a given piece of cargo . 
  when we [ containerized ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/containerization ) , we did so again . 
  this will just continue the process . 
  when canada and australia and new zealand left the british empire , did they pay , did the british empire pay them , or was it kinda considered a wash ? 
   as many brits pointed out at the time , raising the bill to a 100bn makes the 60bn even less likely to be handed over . 
  when you insult someone they are less likely to give you what you want , and that 100bn is an insult . 
  given the amount of money at stake , i suspect that both sides have done a pretty thorough analysis of their positions and are n't going to make basic errors . 
  the uk already is not on the hook for bank bailouts , as it 's not an esm member , yes ? 
  well , okay -- iirc it was guaranteed before that the uk would have no liability for bailouts , and that guarantee was admittedly violated by the eu , but they gave something that the uk agreed to , which was seniority on the loan of money that the uk extended . 
  let 's say that german banks got in trouble , and germany had to bail them out . 
  why would the uk 's presence or absence make a difference ? 
  what 's wrong with the uk 's economy ? 
   the payment has absolutely nothing to do with trade or regulations . 
  the amount either side demands may not be reasonable . 
  given that the starting points are 100 billion eur and 0 eur , my guess is that these are the starting points . 
  the real question is whether that gap can be bridged . 
  i 'd argue that reducing requests to money would make sense , though . 
  if one insists on regulations on each side that are related , it 's easy to get into a rat 's nest of bogged-down negotiations . 
  money is fungible , so if each side can agree how much x is worth and y is worth , they can determine these two numbers in parallel . 
  honestly , there is n't * that * much money in the eu budget . 
  maybe it 'd mean that subsidized members are going to be getting less money , but i am confident that germany wo n't go bankrupt . 
   britain wo n't immediately be in the wto if there is a crash-out brexit . 
  it currently is a member through the eu . 
  i think that you are incorrect -- the article you linked to says that the uk is a wto member in its own right . 
   ours ( croatia ) are doing on old propeler planes , probably because we cant afford jets . 
  afaict , demonstration teams rarely use the fastest planes an air force has available . 
  canada 's [ snowbirds ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=tkwbuvvhoxk ) use jets , but not swept-wing aircraft . 
  which is pretty much what rural anatolia has done to turkey by voting for the constitutional amendment to grant more powers to erdogan , i 'd say . 
  some of them do , though , italy seems to be more-prominent than many , given that i 've seen clips of them multiple times before . 
  i 've also seen the british red arrows and the french team in clips . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_flight_demonstration_teams the us has the navy [ blue angels ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=atgjbmczb5q ) , and the air force [ thunderbirds ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=web4ofmso9i ) . 
  west coast . 
  based on history , money paid to them by someone who extracted it from farmers one way or another . 
  smaller delta between areas . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage luxembourg has about six times bulgaria 's wage . 
  the rural anatolians voted for a constitutional change that i think is a pretty profoundly poor idea for turkey , so i 'd be kinda annoyed with them too . 
  presumably this would n't involve someone who bombs airliners . 
  my guess : that is presumably what this is . 
  oh , here are no bricks and mortar , but it 'd have the same effect . 
  it 's not really a `` cause africa to economically-develop to discourage untoward political developments '' * a la * marshall plan , despite the article 's reference . 
  i doubt that the eu could afford it : africa 's going to have * billions * of people showing up in the next eighty years . 
  if you wanted to subsidize development , you 'd probably do it somewhere south of the sahara , not at the point closest to the eu . 
  what the eu * could * do is to bankroll and support someone in libya and keep them friendly with the eu and willing to accept intercepted shiploads and detain people . 
  if all you get after making a long and dangerous journey is a libyan detention camp ... kinda kills support for making the trip . 
  some strongman in libya dependent upon eu goodwill to stay in power probably also wo n't feel the need to keep kid gloves on in dealing with people . 
  and it provides the eu with political distance from whatever happens . 
  so , just to be clear -- are you saying that the russian invasion and annexation and continued occupation of part of ukraine is the us 's fault , or are you saying that it 's the eu 's fault ? 
  you 'd take the modern-day akp over the modern-day chp ? 
  most of the turkish posters on here nine months back were confidently telling me that the us wanted to overthrow erdogan and was supporting a gulenist plot via the cia . 
  well ... 
  the thing is , venezuela 's a [ banana republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_republic ) :  banana republic is a political science term that describes a politically unstable country in latin america with an economy dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product , e.g. 
  bananas , minerals , etc. 
  typically , the banana republic has a society of stratified social classes , usually a large , poor working class and a ruling-class plutocracy , composed of the business , political , and military elites of that society . 
  [ 1 ] such a ruling-class oligarchy controls the primary sector of the economy by way of the exploitation of labour ; [ 2 ] thus , the term banana republic is a pejorative descriptor for a servile dictatorship that abets and supports , for kickbacks , the exploitation of large-scale plantation agriculture , especially banana cultivation . 
  [ 2 ] here 's [ venezuela 's export treemap ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:venezuela_export_treemap.png ) . 
  the country 's economy , where the money comes from , depends on control of that oil . 
  in a case like that , having population die or even be angry and upset does n't matter , as long as you can squash uprisings -- what matters is control of the oil sources and that they remain secure . 
  much of the population * wants * a chunk of that oil money -- they are resource competitors with you . 
  that 's not what [ turkey 's export treemap ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:turkey_export_treemap.png ) looks like at all . 
  turkey 's exports are similar to those of portugal -- lots of manufactured goods . 
  you have to have a society functioning well-enough for that to work , and a population skilled-enough to do the work , or you lose the bulk of your economy . 
  you could maybe get a soviet union ( you block workers from leaving and the standard of living is n't all that great ) , but i do n't think you 'd get a venezuela . 
  anything like venezuela happens and your population is n't working and/or leaves and you lose . 
  not deputy prime minister of the united kingdom . 
   for days the attendees are reported to engage in private adult activities , including `` gay '' encounters , according to radio talk show host alex jones . 
  well , if alex jones confirms it , i do n't see how anyone could really question it . 
  fair enough , though i have to say that i 'm a little suspicious that if there is no official set of lyrics written , that someone will write unofficial ones , they will catch on and be sung at pro-eu events , and potentially ultimately be officially-adopted if they enter common use . 
  there may be some benefit to having an anthem that you can sing along with when it 's being played , though i agree that introducing any language creates some intrinsic problems for what is fundamentally a multilingual union ... 
  what would you prefer ? 
   but what a coruscatingly boring place !, 
  insert large numbers of britons with the two following characteristics : * gobs of money * desperate for entertainment ... and i suspect that you 'll have entertainment providers showing up pretty much anywhere before too long . 
  i mean , okay , it 's not gon na be london , but if people want sushi and nightclubs , i imagine that they 'll show up . 
   do you think that if they were able to think in a way you think , they 'd ended up building north korea ? 
  the current generation of north koreans ? 
  they were born into it . 
  i was born into the * status quo * , and they were born into the * status quo * .
