  there 's inertia to that , i think . 
  the first generation of north koreans ? 
  they got pulled into communism . 
  did that first generation have worse critical-thinking skills than south koreans ? 
  does eastern europe exhibit worse critical-thinking skills than western europe ? 
  sure , * eventually * the ussr split up ( after many attempts in eastern europe to rise up ... and some of that was that gorbachev was gorbachev ) . 
  but it could potentially have been going for some time . 
  i think it 's more that the societies were structured around specifically * stopping * people from altering what was going on , and that that was a hard barrier to surmount . 
  nk goes to pretty extensive lengths to control people ( including encouraging people to have families and using them as hostages ) , and it seems to work . 
   that is why , i think movie worked pretty well there , at least for ordinary citizens . 
  well , no way to know , but i remember reading the autobiographical [ * the aquariums of pyongyang * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_aquariums_of_pyongyang ) , and one of the first things that the author seemed pretty adept at noticing was how well-fed people were -- it pretty commonly came up in his descriptions of them . 
  when obtaining food is the center of your existence and determines survival , knowing who is successful at getting it and who is n't can be useful . 
   both are inadequate . 
  if british journalism is in trouble , one of the chief reasons is surely that it is so reckless with trust . 
  put it another way : if they were doing a better job maybe more people would be ready to pay for their product . 
  nah , subscriptions are heading downhill here too . 
  also , there are some british publications that i consider pretty impressive , like * the economist * . 
  also , one of the initial calls to , for example , subscribe to the * new york times * as a result of trump 's election , and to say that journals would have to be even more vigilant came from the british-born john oliver on * last week tonight * . 
  i agree that you have some * staggeringly * biased newspapers that walk outside of what 'd be the norm here , but , then ... most of the staggeringly-biased websites ( breitbart , huffpo , etc ) that i run into seem to originate over here . 
  so , maybe that 's something of a wash . 
  they do make a valiant effort there ( `` your task is to present the us as having a worse standard of living than north korea '' ) , but i do n't think that it 'd work in north korea . 
  * nk has seen actual famine recently and has a people that know what people who have been food-deprived look like . 
  showing a film full of normal or overweight americans ( particularly the guy at 3:10 ) and saying `` these people are suffering from dire famine '' is probably gon na be tough . 
  * they did try to angle the camera shots to include a limited amount of background in most shots , but you still had tons of vehicles , and thus plenty of fuel available . 
  i * would * say that the prominence is much greater in the current victory day parades , though . 
  i mean , it 's currently plastered on the sides of the tanks and whatnot , whereas in that example it was a bit of one of the backdrops . 
  i think that it might be reasonable to say that it * has * acquired a different meaning today . 
  the [ gadsden flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gadsden_flag ) was a pro-secession flag in the american revolution . 
  today , it 's often used by libertarian and other small-government types ( referring to the government in the us ) . 
  the fact that it had a pro-revolutionary use then does n't mean that the modern associations do n't exist . 
  for a lot of british usage , `` european '' means the mainland . 
  i 've commented on it before . 
  it 's confusing when the us uses `` europe '' to talk about the continent , the uk uses it to refer to the mainland ( actually ... the uk uses `` the continent '' to refer to the mainland too , just to make it worse ) , and eurofederalists use it to refer to the eu . 
  all three uses intermingle on this forum . 
  well , there 's surgery , i suppose : [ metafilter : what percentage of male-to-female transsexuals are lesbian in their sexual orientation after their transitions ] ( http://ask.metafilter.com/47902/what-percentage-of-maletofemale-transsexuals-are-lesbian-in-their-sexual-orientation-after-their-transitions ), 
   these things are symbolic of denigration of women . 
  hmm . 
  if i force a woman to wear a particular type of clothing , is that uplifting her ? 
  it seems to me that in one case , religion creates soft , social pressures , and in the other , the country 's law creates hard pressures . 
  but both * still * seem to be telling women what to wear . 
  and i 'm not really convinced that women 's status is the primary concern , given that it does n't seem to dominate the conversation . 
  it 's not `` in what ways are women denigrated , what can we do ... oh , perhaps there are clothing laws we can pass ? '', 
  it seems to me that it 's more `` how can we pass a law that would discourage islamic behavior ... how can we justify it ... oh , how about concern over women being oppressed ? '', 
  have any of these women been , say , privately-interviewed to see whether they felt denigrated or needed assistance ? 
  hell , there may be good reasons to ban face-hiding garments . 
  there may be good reason to discourage immigration from mena/pakistan/sub-saharan africa . 
  but if so , i think that it makes sense to raise the actual concerns , not this ... which looks suspiciously like a fig leaf for the real concerns . 
  a similar ( perhaps more-cynical , since i do n't know the connotation of the german idiom ) english idiom : [ make a virtue of necessity ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make_a_virtue_of_necessity ) . 
  probably not on syria , though . 
  incirlik is ~ 50 miles ( 80 km ) from syria . 
  souda bay is ~ 500 miles ( 800 km ) from syria . 
   you should read more let 's look at your page :  a 2008 review of all relevant articles appearing in the peer-reviewed journals on medline through to the end of 2007 , including multiple cohort studies of veterans , found no consistent evidence of excess risks of neoplasms that could have some link to du , and that '' [ t ] he overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of gulf war and balkans veterans '' . 
  -  the u.s. department of defense claims that no human cancer of any type has been seen as a result of exposure to either natural or depleted uranium . 
   that 's probably why the army has such high rates of cancer when using du munition they do n't . 
   the only `` clean energy '' is geothermic , solar and windpower . 
  eh , you get manufacturing wastes there as well -- part of the reason that china 's big in solar panel manufacturing is because it has weak environmental restrictions . 
  keeps the vengeful spirits at bay . 
   r/unitedkingdom might as well be r/momentum i thought that momentum was mostly older left-wingers , people more like corbyn . 
  / r/unitedkingdom seems to be mostly really young people -- people talk about school and whatnot . 
  yeah , but ceta did n't have the benefit of being the * status quo * , either . 
  the people who were yelling about it were people like farmers worried about competing with agriculture from overseas . 
  those same people will be on the other side of the matter here -- the uk is a * consumer * of agricultural products produced elsewhere in the eu . 
  if i understand the current positions of both the uk and the eu correctly , the aim of both is to have a `` transition '' or `` implementation '' period during which everything continues as is presently the case but the uk is not in the eu . 
  unless it means that new eu laws might be passed that are highly disadvantageous to the uk and to which it might be bound with no say ( e.g. 
  `` you must accept all migrants that we do n't want '' , etc ) , i 'd assume that this would happen , as it 'd be pretty unreasonable to simply implement everything immediately . 
  so from a legally-a-member-of-the-eu standpoint , yeah , it might be two years , but i 'd say that there are good odds that most business continues as it is today for up to another seven . 
  i suspect that the meaning is kinda tied to context . 
  that is , if you live in latvia , it may be used to the effect of a `` russia shall-re-incorporate this land into a new empire '' symbol because those are the folks who are showing russian militarist symbols ; if you are in russia , as / u/wearebrics is , i imagine that it 's just a patriotic symbol of the military . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ribbon_of_saint_george  in ukraine and the baltic states ( estonia , latvia and lithuania ) , the symbol has become widely associated with russian nationalist and separatist sentiment . 
  well , he 's got a portuguese flair ... 
   however if one can replace nuclear by renewable ones there is just no reason not to , especially since one gains some protection against a however unlikely meltdown . 
  i 'm sure that it 's * possible * , but the question is what the impact on electricity prices will be . 
  electricity is an input to just about everything ... 
   have you got a plan how to safe store the depleted uran for centuries and centuries ? 
  depleted uranium is the non-radioactive stuff . 
  it 's not an issue . 
  you 're probably thinking of nuclear waste . 
  you use [ geomelting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geomelting ) so that it ca n't get into the water table and store that somewhere it wo n't show up again . 
  i think that concern over waste handling has more to do with the visibility to the public than anything else . 
  you did n't see the same concern over , say , mercury emissions from coal power . 
  some of the countries with [ substantial reserves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_uranium_reserves ) include czechia , spain , and ukraine . 
  ... the [ korean-war-era prototype tank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t95_medium_tank ) ? 
  edit : ah , no , the originally-identically-named prototype [ world war ii superheavy tank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t28_super_heavy_tank#surviving_vehicle ) :  in 1974 the last prototype was discovered abandoned in a field at fort belvoir , virginia . 
  it is unknown where it spent the intervening 27 years . 
  it is the sole remaining example of these tanks and was exhibited at the patton museum of cavalry and armor in kentucky . 
  that * does * seem kinda like an odd thing to go missing . 
   there is a finite amount of people one can feed of a given area of land the uk has not been self-sufficient in food for a long time now . 
  it imports food from other places , like france . 
  if it became essential , the uk could increase production , but simply importing is more economically-efficient . 
   actually most of the world outside of the arab world , pakistan , afghanistan and sub saharan africa will see a massive population decline in the coming decades . 
  it 's really mostly europe , at least in percentage terms . 
  i believe that this incorporates projected immigration : https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/files/key_findings_wpp_2015.pdf  population in millions :   | major area | 2015 | 2030 | 2050 | 2100 |  | - | - :| - :| - :| - :|  | world | 7,349 | 8,501 | 9,725 | 11,213 |  | africa | 1,186 | 1,679 | 2,478 | 4,387 |  | asia | 4,393 | 4,923 | 5,267 | 4,889 |  | europe | 738 | 734 | 707 | 646 |  | latin america and the carribbean | 634 | 721 | 784 | 721 |  | northern america | 358 | 396 | 433 | 500 |  | oceania | 39 | 47 | 57 | 71 |, 
  a what now ? 
  yeah -- i 'm sorry , but at the end of the day , there will be unrest in the world . 
  people in the countries that are unsafe are going to , for refugee convention signatories , have a legal right to claim asylum . 
  i do not think that the refugee convention in its current form is a good idea . 
  i think that countries have tended to exploit loopholes ( sometimes unsuccessfully ) , and that a better fix would be to place limits into the convention . 
  if i were in the position of a number of countries in europe , which are in close proximity to africa and other routes up , i would probably want a revised refugee convention . 
  but if you sign on for it and you can not successfully exploit a loophole ( physical difficulty of reaching the country directly , for example ) , then i do not think that it it is reasonable to complain about the fact that there is now and will continue to be in the future international military involvement . 
  that being said , i will add one major point .
