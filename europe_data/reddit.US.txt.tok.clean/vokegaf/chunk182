  germany and many other countries in the eu * did * try leveraging the direct-from-an-unsafe-country thing . 
  the uk is not really doing anything all that substantially-different . 
  it 's just that in the uk , there was some degree of success because of the english channel and because france is n't letting people mass-launch inflatable boats from her coast . 
  similarly , it works to some degree in the us because we have a huge ocean on each side , and some deserts and unpleasant terrain to the south . 
  it is n't so much because there 's a brilliant policy that differs much -- it 's just that the geographic realities differ . 
  germany would probably prefer to do exactly what the uk is doing -- and tried to do so early on in the crisis . 
  it simply is n't an option , however . 
  yelling at germany over that seems pretty unreasonable . 
  it might make sense , at some point , to have users need to rewrite headlines and have a moderator approve the rewritten headline for clickbait . 
  i agree that clickbait is a problem , but i do n't think that the best option is entirely-banning sources if the issue is headlines . 
  and at the end of the day , well ... voting does handle some of it . 
   why do n't you keep in mind that the french do not have any international obligation to stop refugees . 
  in fact , as far as i know , there are only two countries in europe who have made a sustained effort to halt people in their countries to `` shield '' others : * turkey , near greece * france , at calais obviously , both have their own reasons for doing so . 
  but i would not treat it as an entitlement -- the agreement that the uk and france signed is what structures things like that . 
  presumably either would pull out if it became as a bad deal . 
  i 'd say `` thanks '' for as much as it does , and not beat up on the french for not doing more . 
  i 'd add that i think that the same is true of turkey . 
  many people on this forum have treated turkey holding back illegal immigrants as an entitlement . 
  while i understand their concern over the problems those immigrants would cause and the fact that they 'd like to not deal with them , at the end of the day , turkey is holding illegal immigrants back only as a political favor to the european union -- it 's not bound to do so , and the turkish public would probably very much rather have them leave turkey and head on into the eu . 
  if the country or countries being `` shielded '' from illegal immigrants want the country `` shielding '' them to do so , like any agreement , it has to be mutually-advantageous -- both countries have to be happy with what they 're getting out of the matter . 
  beating up on france and turkey because they are simply the closest country `` able '' to stop movement is , i think , particularly unfair given that many , many other countries in the eu have done far less to try to protect other countries from illegal immigration . 
  i think that the british government is aware of this , and has offered to cover the costs of fencing , for example . 
  but i think that some members of the british public are not putting themselves in the shoes of the french . 
  british-french relations aside , a bunch of sketchy people cruising around in the potential-terrorism-target channel tunnel would n't be a good thing for either of you . 
  the deal did n't cause you to be unable to expel them , though .

  edit :  the report said that in 2015 , the bundeswehr had lost three g36-type assault rifles , two g3 rifles , and one p8 pistol .

  there really needs to be a solution to clickbait titles ... they 're really becoming quite frequent . 
   trump is visiting the city next week ... all examples of why a local might feel a warm fuzzy feeling when thinking of the eu . 
  since / u/executivemonkey seems to be off peeling a banana or something , i 'll fill in and note that we understand how prestige-enhancing such a thing can be . 
  maybe he does it a lot and so benefits from practice ? 
  and cheaper food . 
  and we got cheaper manufactured goods up north . 
  i do n't think that germany and france * do * decide about every important matter . 
  i think that they often wind up doing things that i think it would politically make more sense to have people from brussels doing from a political standpoint , but that 's more a question of image . 
  what 's an example of a situation where germany and france were in opposition to the rest of the eu members and prevailed ? 
  well , there 's the [ old swiss confederacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_swiss_confederacy ) , which * was * a confederation .

  huh . 
  keep in mind that we do n't have an `` opposition '' , so someone at fox may have heard the phrase but not known what it meant . 
   farage : we british are not allowed to have our own foreign policy . 
  that 's really not true , at least at the current level of eu integration . 
   we are not allowed to have our own trade policy true , but that 's part of being in a customs union .

  according to [ british flag rules ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/15438/flying_flags_guide.pdf ) , this should not be done . 
  and of * course * it 's you ;-p, 
  yeah , i 'm not that sympathetic . 
  if you ca n't be bothered to identify yourself to vote , i 'm pretty sure that you 're not going to be rising up to install a new government any time soon via force . 
   the government already knows who you are , how ? 
  to be honest , though , if you 're in the us and do n't have any form of photo id , you really should think hard about the decision to not have one . 
  most serious things you can do require photo id , from doing anything financially to picking up a package at the post office to buying alcohol to renting an apartment . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of surveillance laws , but it 's not like you need to carry the thing with you most of the time unless you 're operating a motor vehicle . 
  i can think of really few reasons not to have one . 
  it looks like it runs from $ 5 to $ 23 for a state id card ( not driver 's license , which is what most people use ) . 
  that 's just not enough of a meaningful barrier to complain about not getting something that 's important for all sorts of things . 
  the only people for whom this is really a problem would be those not legally in the country , and they would n't be voting anyway . 
  what would be a terrible deal , in your eyes ?

   `` in our view the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) is an agreement that does n't just serve canada and mexico , but also the united states , '' gabriel said at a news conference with his mexican counterpart , luis videgaray , on friday . 
  seems like a reasonable assertion !, 
   `` so we 're trying , also via our visits to the united states , to make clear that a fair agreement is n't just in the interests of german companies , but also the united states of america , '' the minister commented . 
  thanks , germany , though i think we 've got this !, 
  i pulled out all the flags that had other colors , even if they were in relatively-small amounts -- croatia 's coat of arms includes colors other than red , white , and blue . 
   claiming he has been detained without charge for 7 years . 
  that 's not how this works . 
  you chose to stay in an embassy for seven years . 
  police are not permitted to seize people for unlimited amounts of time without charging them with something ; this is so that the justice system can become involved . 
  the swedish government * specifically wanted the justice system to become involved * ; you chose to remain where they could n't access you . 
  being a fugitive from justice is not `` being detained without charge '' .
