  there 's only one way to get serious about domestic social problems : declare war on them . 
  * [ war on poverty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_on_poverty ) * [ war on drugs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_on_drugs ) * [ war on terror ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_on_terror ) i 'm thinking `` battle of the bulge ii '' . 
  your way sounds like it would involve me eating less bacon cheeseburgers . 
  i remain unconvinced . 
  upvoted for sounding scientific .

   in an address to european leaders on friday , the pope said the eu faced a `` vacuum of values '' and was losing its `` sense of direction '' . 
  sounds like a job for a pope !, 
   trade block trade * bloc *, 
   relatively homogenous nation , geographically and in spirit . 
  maybe . 
  southern aristocratic planters , some rather sketchy criminals booted out of england , religious reformers ... 
  normally you do n't get to just move somewhere unless you can support yourself . 
  but if you 're worried about a substantial number of folks from the us showing up in the eu , not working , getting a subsidized education and returning , you 're certainly free to strengthen those or modify your laws on who gets a subsidized education . 
  i 'm not aware of a significant number of people doing this . 
  well , i think that stabilizing the population is a bit different from population growth . 
  i work with an iranian engineer , and have a turkish engineer as a buddy . 
  would be hard to say that they `` do n't really provide anything to the society besides the burden '' . 
   the problem lies in the fact that no european country has a fertility rate higher than the 2.1 france is close enough , at 2.07 in 2016 ( partly helped by higher birthrates from immigrants , so it 's possible that a reduced amount of immigration is all that is required to get tfr back up to par ) . 
   impossible to raise higher than yeah , but getting tfr just up to 1.9 for the eu -- about where the us is -- would eliminate a * lot * of the issue . 
  you 'd still have your native population falling and need some immigration to stabilize total population , but remember that the numbers here are exponential -- the rate of decline increases very rapidly as you move further away from 2.1 . 
  at 2.0 , you 'd have each generation being ( 1-2 .0 / 2.1 ) x100 = 4.76 % smaller than the last . 
  four generations later , your population would still be at ( ( 2.0 / 2.10 ) ^ 4 ) x 100 = 82 % of the current -- is a rather-more manageable decline . 
  at a tfr of 1.5 , each generation is 29 % smaller than the last , and after four generations , you 're at only 26 % of the current population . 
  that 's falling like a stone : imagine three-quarters of europe simply becoming deserted , or three-quarters of europe 's population being wiped out by a war or plague . 
  it 's getting up near the kind of loss levels that disease inflicted on the native americans when european settlers showed up . 
  `` lie back and think of england ! '', 
  if you use immigration instead of domestic births , there is are two significant benefits that i 'd raise : ** if you use a skilled immigration policy , you can choose the profession of your populace . 
  ** so , for example , if you need people in a particular field , having more kids does n't guarantee that they wind up studying something that you need in twenty years . 
  if you use skilled immigration , you get to select and pull in someone who is expert in the particular field you want and can already definitely do it . 
  plus , you enjoy the benefit that they 've already been educated and raised ( maybe not with exactly your norms and other stuff , but that 's a big expense that you 're offloading to the source of immigration ) . 
  now , okay , getting skilled immigration in * massive * numbers -- the eu needs a lot -- is not necessarily practical . 
  but it 's something that i think is very successful for the us . 
  and much as i 'd hate to have to compete with the eu for skilled workers , i have to admit that i think that it 's a sensible policy . 
  from what the uk has been saying , they want to also shift to a more skill-based immigration policy . 
  ** births have a twenty-year lag on moving people into the workforce ** i can pull in a worker via immigration immediately , and it has immediate effect . 
  if i have a kid born , it 's going to take another twenty years or so until he 's in the workforce . 
  a lot of eu members have n't been * having * many kids for a long time , so if only births are used , you 're talking about letting another twenty years effectively go by . 
  if people immigrate , you start filling up the workforce immediately . 
  well , what did you want him to say ? 
  that would have accurately been the us 's concern . 
  ttip was a much larger trade agreement , and it was the larger concern . 
  if he let the impression that it * would n't * be the primary concern dominate and leave was sold based on the idea that it would be a way to get to a us trade agreement faster because ttip was bogged down , that would have been misleading . 
   and once they run away for germany , well germany will probably rage quit at some point and start mass-deporting them , because they 're perfectly * illegal * there . 
  to croatia ? 
  * bad faith and dishonesty is gon na make for more pain in the long term . 
  if it 's * honestly * something that you 're not willing to do , then say so . 
  * they 'll be recorded as being poland 's legal responsibility , i strongly suspect , and that might wind up having a significant impact down the line . 
  while i agree with the general point ( and bare breasts on television !, 
  ) , my understanding is that * the sun * had stopped with this some time back . 
  there were people making statements about what the us would do vis-a-vis trade via the uk . 
  people were making voting decisions based on that . 
  obama making a statement about us policy is legitimately within his role . 
  he did n't say `` do n't vote leave '' . 
  he said that ttip was going to be a higher priority than a us-uk trade deal , which i think is probably a pretty accurate description of the us trade concerns . 
  i will bet that ten years from now , there is an fta in place between the eu and the uk , regardless of the political path it takes . 
  makes too much sense not to happen . 
   if estonia asks for article v against russia the us wo n't be there .

   the guy who sold alaska to the u.s. because the dollar value of resources later exploited exceeded the price ? 
  russia 's concern was that they would n't have been able to hold it . 
  looking at [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alaska_purchase ) , russia 's expected outcomes were one of : * scary and hostile british empire jammed up against a part of russia in the asian continent that russia had limited ability to defend . 
  * us annexes canada and takes alaska anyway , which results in the same outcome but without russia getting money . 
  * weaker , more-friendly-than-the-british-empire us as a buffer in place , and due to separation by canada from the rest of us territory ; russia at least gets paid . 
  russia 's infrastructure and population is almost entirely in the western part of russia . 
  russia has never been a great naval power , and holding a huge amount of wilderness that was isolated by sea and thousands of miles of land from centers of russian strength and had almost no russian population would have been difficult . 
  why did france sell the land involved in the [ louisiana purchase ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louisiana_purchase ) ? 
  similar idea -- it 's doubtful that they would have been able to hold it , they expected ultimately either the british or the us to seize it anyway , and this way they wound up with funds . 
   nato is more than juste a strategic military organization , or at least , it should be . 
  -  what is happening is abuse of nato for internal power projection all right , i 'm lost . 
  you 're advocating for using nato as a sort of political lever to try to whack members doing what other members do n't like , then complaining that it 's used for internal power projection . 
  is n't this precisely the opposite of your argument ? 
   turkey , on the other hand , is hated by pretty much the entire world . 
  the us and europe are literally funding groups that are enemies of the turkish state . 
  are you seriously claiming that * iran * is more aligned with the us than turkey ? 
  with the next sentence `` israel is n't going to do shit either '' , presumably relating to iran getting nuclear weapons ... okay , even aside from alliance issues , israel already [ bombed iraqi nuclear production facilities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_opera ) * after * iran tried to bomb the same iraqi facilities and fucked it up . 
  if you 're confident that iran wo n't get clobbered if it tries going nuclear , i 'd call that a very , very risky bet . 
  if it holds , it wo n't be because of iranian strength , but because there 's a credible abm shield up and because people have decided that the risk of alternate delivery mechanisms is not significant . 
  lol . 
  i did n't read the bit you quoted . 
  i thought that it was :   the opinion polls have them polling at 49 % of the vote   and how much of that is due to tory policy and how much due to labour or eu policy ? 
  and i was going to say `` well , corbyn will hopefully leave after the election , and probably someone more centrist start rebuilding labour ... '' did n't catch it until i was thinking `` wait , why is he criticizing the eu ? '',
