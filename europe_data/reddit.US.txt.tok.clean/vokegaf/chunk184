  you 're totally missing out here , germany . 
  c'mon , * france * is doing it too . 
  break out the frock coats and let 's * get * those chicken-killing bastards !, 
  edit :  in germany , hunting with hounds ( which tended to be deer or boar hunting ) was first banned on the initiative of hermann g\u00f6ring on july 3 , 1934 . 
  [ 15 ] in 1939 , the ban was extended to cover austria after germany 's annexation of the country . 
  bernd ergert , the director of germany 's hunting museum in munich , said of the ban , `` the aristocrats were understandably furious , but they could do nothing about the ban given the totalitarian nature of the regime . '', 
  it 's france or goering , germany !, 
  do it !, 
  unleash the hounds !, 
  it was a good movie , but it really was n't what alan moore originally intended with * v for vendetta * as a graphic novel , if you 've ever read that . 
  the original v was not just opposed to totalitarianism , but was anarchist . 
  by removing the anarchism , the movie arguably was made appealing to many more viewers and thus set up for a lot more commercial success , but kinda changed the political message . 
   with them out of nato , it would be much easier to right the wrongs of wwi . 
  what do you mean by * that * ? 
   they even threatened europe with immigrants . 
  turkey is under absolutely no legal obligation to hold back illegal immigrants from the eu . 
  they are n't abusing their position and violating expectations . 
  there really is no requirement . 
  in fact , arguably what the eu has asked them to do in stopping people from leaving turkey is a violation of the [ un universal declaration of human rights ] ( https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ ) , article 13 : '' ( 2 ) everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own , and to return to his country . '', 
  turkey is doing so as a political favor to the eu , not because they 're bound to do so . 
  yes , they tried seeing what they could get from it ( which i 'd argue is n't a lot ) -- but the eu 's asking them to do something that they do n't want to do . 
  eu members did even less for each other along these lines than turkey did -- how many eu members stopped illegal migrants from passing out of them and into another ? 
  many did everything they could to facilitate movement into a neighbor as quickly as possible , to avoid being stuck with migrants . 
  i appreciate that migrants are a concern , sure . 
  and that it would be convenient if they 'd stop coming , and that it 'd be helpful from the eu 's standpoint if turkey would just contain them all . 
  but that alone does n't establish an entitlement to expect turkey to block them . 
  the `` closest safe country '' just means that the eu does n't have to grant refugee status to 'em , not that turkey has to block movement . 
  * there is no mechanism to expel members from nato . 
  starting this would be a terrible precedent anyway -- who would want to rely that other members would n't force them out if it were convenient ? 
  what if the baltics became a liability , say , why not push them out ? 
  no , that sort of thing is at odds with having made a commitment to a country . 
  * turkey is not militarily-opposing nato members ( well , there 's a difference-of-opinion with the us in syria , but that 's not a fundamental issue , and the us is n't complaining ) . 
  this is not raised for military reasons , but to drag in other issues . 
  i want to keep nato separate from political disputes among members . 
  * nato is n't a lever to use to press for values in members . 
  europe probably would n't like it if the us tried using it to lever for us-specific values in europe , and rightly so . 
  you want to use the eu to do that , go for it . 
  you want to establish a new organization to do that , like the echr , go for it . 
  but it 's not what nato 's for . 
  * i personally am more-than-a-little suspicious that a substantial number of people promoting this either ( a ) would like to decrease nato 's ability to counteract russia or ( b ) have a beef with muslims . 
  * the same military calculus that has applied with turkey in the past continues to apply .

  all right then , dude . 
   switching to linux will be a money save in the long run ( disclaimer : i 'm a linux developer as well . ), 
  maybe . 
  retraining is a * major * cost . 
  how many hours of retraining and reduced productivity are required to pay for forty years of licenses ? 
  your long term may be longer than the working lives of employees . 
  i think that it is a very good thing that people are taking into account lock-in . 
  it is very , very common for vendors to sell products that leverage lock-in . 
  make it easy to get in , but hard to leave . 
  once that happens , the vendor can extract money * up to how much it would hurt you to you to switch * . 
  then they make their money over the long term . 
  among some examples of things designed to obtain longer-term money from you when it 's harder to switch : * student discounts on software . 
  get them over the initial training hump on your product . 
  * locking someone into a document format that is hard to convert away from . 
  * getting workers experience in a piece of software , an investment which goes away if there is a switch away from that software . 
  * giving free services and worrying later about how to monetize -- a favored tactic for web companies . 
  * initially providing interoperation with other systems and then removing that interoperation once other users have migrated to your system ( e.g. 
  google chat having xmpp federation support removed ) . 
  * providing a `` platform '' or something that can be hooked into other software . 
  then , any work that is done by your developers in , say , excel macros increases the cost of switching from excel . 
  i think that the real paradigm shift that needs to happen is something very much like `` instead of treating the price of software as $ upfrontprice , treat it as $ upfrontprice + $ costtomigratetoanalternative '' . 
  because that vendor * will * be able to charge up to $ costtomigratetoanalternative in the future . 
  and remember that $ costtomigratetoanalternative may rise over time as , for example , more documents are stored in the format . 
  linux is not , frankly , all that critical , other than that windows is good at being a `` platform '' -- you buy more windows software , and it locks you in further . 
  what is important is taking into account those lock-in costs . 
  open source helps with those in that it permits a program to be forked and have someone else develop it at any one time . 
  that reduces the lock-in . 
  make a stupid decision in a program that users do n't like , and if the program is important enough , someone will fork it . 
  ca n't normally do that with proprietary software . 
  when you feed the trolls , they only get bigger and healthier !,
