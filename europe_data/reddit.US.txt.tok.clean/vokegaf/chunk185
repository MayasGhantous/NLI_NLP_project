  responding here because i do n't actually want to mod , but * do * want to respond to the questions : | question | answer | | - | - | | where are you from ? | ` murica ! | | what languages can you speak fluently ? | english . 
  plus a sprinkling of google translate . | | what is your usual timezone ? | ... variable . | | have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit ? | nope | | what do you like the most about / r/europe ? | the discussion here is pretty impressive . 
  i actually originally showed up some time back because i was completely fed up with the us political discussion on reddit , which was dominated by people yelling at each other . 
  i was vaguely-interested in europe , but it was n't the driving factor . 
  i was ( many accounts back ) one of the very early reddit users , back before subreddits existed and when almost all the articles were submitted by the a handful of developers who started reddit , and back then , there was a heavy dollop of people familiar with their field who liked volunteering informed opinions and who could discuss all sorts of things calmly . 
  / r/europe 's got people who have some familiarity with the field talking about law , about policy , about military matters , politics , language and linguistics , technology , you name it -- it looks something like that , even though the sub is large . 
  i 'm not sure * why * that 's the case , but i 'm suspicious that it 's because it 's a ( mostly ) english-language sub populated mostly by people who are from countries that are not majority english-speaking -- my guess is that the folks here tend to be well-educated and possibly a bit older than the norm , since there 's effectively a `` gate '' to get in . | ** people ** | question | answer | | - | - | | do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone ? | too general of a question -- depends on the job . 
  most things i work on are best done alone . 
  in moderation ? 
  for moderating individual comments , which i suspect is the bulk of the time , i think that there 'd be too much overhead to have a lot of interaction with other mods -- minimizing that is more-efficient . 
  for dealing with bans or questionable cases , maybe asking for a second opinion . 
  for setting rules , probably should involve as many mods as possible . | | in general , how would you evaluate / r/europe 's rules ? | well ... they seem to work reasonably well , and at the end of the day , ca n't beat empirical tests . | | what change would you make in / r/europe if you could ? 
  | see below . | | why do you want to join / r/europe 's mod team | i do n't !, 
  but i do want to say why i do n't -- because it 's very often a thankless job that 's less-fun than commenting . | | do you think politically neutral moderation is achievable and/or desirable ? | well , i do n't think that it 's truly achievable in the same way that i do n't think that it 's possible to be truly objective . 
  it 's possible to reasonably-closely-approximate it for the range of politics that covers most of society , and i think that that is * generally * a good idea -- for example , removing comments that advocate for communism would probably be unacceptable . 
  i do n't think that moderation with the goal of guiding the politics of users is a very good idea . 
  on the other hand , if a user is a hardcore french nationalist who thinks that the sub should be using french and reposts each comment translated into french , his political position is a pain in the rear . | looking at the rules , some thoughts : ** local crime ** i believe that this was adopted because a number of users who wanted to advocate against immigration kept posting every crimestory from anywhere in europe that involved a migrant . 
  this was annoying -- the content was not very interesting , made people dig through piles of garbage , and the only goal was to provide disproportionate coverage of migrant crime to provide a negative image . 
  it was n't being submitted by users who thought `` wow , this particular item is interesting ... people should read it '' . 
  it was being submitted by users who wanted to engage in political advocacy by affecting the * aggregate * of what people read . 
  and , frankly , just as with / r/politics and other advocacy forums , reading what people want you to read rather than what they find interesting , * particularly * in bulk , is really not fun . 
  i think that a better fix would be to temp-ban certain topics -- say , impose a three month ban on non-notable to europe as a whole migrant crime stories -- and have a list with an explanation . 
  some forums ( for example , / r/polandball ) simply temp-ban overused topics to keep content fresh and interesting . 
  the issue was n't really the topic -- had there been * one * post , i do n't think anyone would care -- but the spam . 
  ** racism , bigotry and other offensive content . 
  includes but is not limited to : hate speech , genocide denial ( holocaust , armenian genocide , holodomor , etc ) , homophobia , endorsement of violence or other criminal activity . 
  ** there is regularly bigotry . 
  i see plenty of people complaining about turks or british or russians or ... shoot , you name it . 
  i do n't think that this rule actually reflects what the current moderation permits and disallows . 
  i do n't think that it necessarily * should * be . 
  honestly , i think that the core of this is best reduced to `` be civil '' and that being civil be more-heavily-enforced . 
  there are lots of ways in which one can be uncivil , which is inclusive of personal attacks , flaming , insulting nationalities or races , and so forth . 
  i think that it 's rare that people ca n't rephrase a worthwhile comment to be polite and still include their ideas . 
  i also think that it 's usually pretty clear when people are n't being civil . 
  i am not really happy with the hate speech restriction , and i think that `` be civil '' more-effectively-addresses the concerns . 
  i 'm also not really enthusiastic about the genocide denial restriction . 
  i have , on multiple occasions here , responded to statements that `` the native americans suffered genocide '' and citing sources to give differences between ethnic cleansing and genocide and covering different incidents . 
  i 've not had comments deleted or been banned , and i do n't think that it would make sense for that to happen . 
  i think that there 's room for reasonable discussion about genocide that does n't either devolve into insults or conspiracy theory . 
  ** what do you know about ... ** i do like the `` what do you know about ... '' post series , but i think that i 'd like to see it changed a bit . 
  i think that one thing that helps build a community is making people feel liked and appreciated . 
  instead of `` what do you know about ... '' i think maybe it 'd make sense to have a `` what do you like about < country x  ? '', 
  series . 
  that way , there 's always some submission up with some positive comments talking about something new in europe . 
  for example , at the moment iceland is up . 
  the sub could introduce users to neat and pleasant things about iceland , but the current comments have things like `` it 's cold '' or `` i heard that they 're racist against turks '' . 
   prosecuted i think that you might want `` persecuted '' -- `` prosecuted '' would be where someone is held to answer under law for their actions , whereas `` persecuted '' is closer to being constantly harassed and mistreated . 
  i can imagine that someone could have posted something like `` libyans are animals and should be killed at night by us before they infect europe with their taint . '', 
  or something like that , had mods delete their post , and then complained about it . 
  but i have seen plenty of criticism on pretty much every point you can imagine , and if someone 's acting level-headed and engaging in criticism , i do n't think that there 's been any problems in getting ideas out . 
  well ... if it had been * ode to joy * ... 
  clearly britons who have dated a spaniard and now have spanish fever . 
   at the end of the day , you cock suckers are looking for excuses to hate russia , so it would be ok for you to start a war with them uh . 
  * ukraine * is looking for a reason to start a war with russia ? 
  russian soldiers are occupying part of ukraine . 
  ukraine did n't engage in a surprise attack on russia -- russia surprise-attacked ukraine . 
  ukraine * cut a trade deal * that russia did n't like . 
  go back to 2014 or so and i remember russian material saying that the us was trying to figure out how to start a war against russia because the us was economically-failing and had to come up with a pretext to cancel its debts . 
  ffs . 
  well ... it 's not * really * diplomatic immunity . 
  if you get a parking fine , say , you do n't get to say `` i 'm a diplomat , does n't count ! '', 
  diplomatic immunity just means that you ca n't be sued or arrested . 
  you can be fined . 
  however , if your home country does n't care , it becomes hard to actually do much to you if you just ignore the fines . 
  looking at the us department of state website , it looks like countries can refuse to reregister the vehicle or remove the driver 's license , though . 
  apparently the us -- which sends foreign aid to a lot of countries out there -- passed the clinton-schumer amendment , which says that if a local fine does n't get paid , the locality can deduct 110 % of the fine from the foreign aid being sent , which creates an incentive for many countries to make their diplomats pay . 
  i 'd ask two questions . 
  is that inflammatory ? 
  is it likely to further the conversation ? 
   the police figures also show the number of sex offences has hit its highest level in northern ireland for nearly two decades . 
  apparently brexit gets people all hot-and-bothered . 
  what , exactly , is a `` paramilitary-style shooting '' or `` paramilitary-style assault '' a euphemism for ? 
  i mean , do they shoot them and then gouge out the eyes or what ? 
  what makes it `` paramilitary-style '' ? 
  maybe there 's a feeling that the population movement will be large enough that other countries will hit political unrest and they need more employers . 
  or maybe the idea would be to long-term re-knit the uk into the eu again , if enough people move and get citizenship ? 
   because they do n't have to obey the traffic laws . 
  well , they do , but making diplomats from abroad pay fines is hard . 
  nah , just started going down google results for `` ussr liberation withdrawal '' until i found an area that the ussr captured but did n't retain . 
  we were substantially-better on per-capita count , but not innocent either . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_germany#u.s._troops  * in taken by force * , j. robert lilly estimates the number of rapes committed by u.s. servicemen in germany to be 11,000 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_japan#u.s._military_rapes  there is no documentary evidence that mass rape was committed by allied troops during the pacific war . 
  there are , however , numerous credible testimony accounts which allege that a large number of rapes were committed by u.s. forces during the battle of okinawa in 1945 ... although japanese reports of rape were largely ignored at the time , academic estimates have been that as many as 10,000 okinawan women may have been raped . 
  it has been claimed that the rape was so prevalent that most okinawans over age 65 around the year 2000 either knew or had heard of a woman who was raped in the aftermath of the war . 
  military officials denied the mass rapings , and all surviving veterans refused the new york times ' request for an interview . 
  -- the major sources were the wehrmacht on the eastern front , the red army , and the imperial japanese army : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht#rapes_2  other sources estimate that rapes of soviet women by the wehrmacht range up to 10,000,000 incidents , with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children being born as a result . 
  [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 91 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_germany#soviet_troops  the majority of the assaults were committed in the soviet occupation zone ; estimates of the numbers of german women raped by soviet soldiers have ranged up to 2 million . 
  [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] according to historian william hitchcock , in many cases women were the victims of repeated rapes , some as many as 60 to 70 times . 
  [ 13 ] at least 100,000 women are believed to have been raped in berlin , based on surging abortion rates in the following months and contemporary hospital reports , [ 10 ] with an estimated 10,000 women dying in the aftermath . 
  [ 14 ] female deaths in connection with the rapes in germany , overall , are estimated at 240,000 . 
  [ 1 ] [ 15 ] antony beevor describes it as the `` greatest phenomenon of mass rape in history '' , and has concluded that at least 1.4 million women were raped in east prussia , pomerania and silesia alone . 
  fair enough . 
  [ continued from parent ]  according to early postwar studies the soviets had a considerable conventional advantage over american , british , and french forces and could easily overrun major portions of western europe . 
  but the studies showed that they would avoid a major conflict with the united states for several years . 
  if war did occur it would be due to soviet miscalculation of the risks . 
  -  it was not until after august 1945 that , because of the revolutionary nature of atomic weapons , war deterrence was adopted as military policy . 
  american war planning , however , does not support this assessment . 
  planners continued to place primary importance on fighting and winning wars . 
  if atomic capabilities could deter war , all the better . 
  but the priority was still on using the preponderance of strategic airpower to destroy soviet war-making capability . 
  -  admiral ralph ofstie , a director on the u.s. strategic bombing survey and a senior board member for operation crossroads ( atomic tests at the bikini islands in 1946 ) , had no problem with `` knock [ ing ] hell out of moscow with atomic bombs . '' america should also use the weapons on other urban and industrial areas .
