  okay , uk .

  i saw something about the early 2020s . 
  it wo n't be immediately . 
  / r/ukpolitics was talking about the basis for filing immediately -- apparently , there 's some political advantage to sturgeon in filing early , since then she can keep complaining about how the requested referendum has n't happened yet for a long time . 
  their take was that she was n't expecting a near-term referendum either -- it 's just part of the politics involved . 
  i wonder if this will pop the uk housing bubble .

  yes -- i 'm saying that he 's hoping for the uk to split , not forcibly-splitting it from the outside . 
  i realize that the uk uses `` country '' a bit oddly -- here , i was referring to `` the country of the uk '' . 
  so , here 's my problem . 
  i 'm open to the idea that the referendum was poorly-designed , because i wholeheartedly agree on several flaws with it . 
  but i 've seen a lot of complaints that only came up after the referendum that mostly involve moving the goalposts just enough for a pro-eu result . 
  i 'm very skeptical of that , because my first question regarding a proposed procedural change is `` if i took that same outcome and used it to make the vote produce an anti-eu result , would that generally be accepted around these parts as an improvement '' ? 
  i have a hard time believing that it would . 
  let 's say that the referendum was 52-48 remain and the government says `` no , we 're leaving anyway '' . 
  i am absolutely certain that this sub would object intensely to a result like that . 
  * i 'd * object . 
  when i 've suggested that a procedural change would have been an improvement , like `` use ranked-choice voting and split up the leave option between hard and soft '' , i would n't have objected to the same being done for the remain option ( e.g. 
  remain and accept ever-closer union , remain and avoid ever-closer union being options ) . 
  i think that that 's an important test for whether a change is a real procedural improvement , or simply something that would alter the result to something seen as being more-favorable . 
  that says that there 's a sunday telegraph article . 
  i do n't see it . 
  i see this : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/russias-deadly-plot-overthrow-montenegros-government-assassinating/  the planned montenegro coup , scheduled for oct 16 last year , was one of the most blatant recent examples of an increasingly aggressive campaign of interference in western affairs , whitehall sources told the telegraph . 
  that 's unnamed sources , not an intelligence agency . 
  there 's no reason for this to be limited to an anonymous source . 
  i 'm not saying that raw intelligence has to be released -- * that * may be an unrealistic bar -- i 'm saying that no intelligence agency is standing behind a statement that russia did this . 
  that happened with the democrat breakins . 
  that has not happened with the montenegro situation , and an honest-to-god coup attempt against a european government seems very unlikely to simply be ignored by intelligence agencies over here . 
  [ and there are so many other examples close-to-hand ] ( https://ssl.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170207195854-erdogan-trump-split-super-169.jpg ) . 
  or just using the masculine as the generic , as was historically the norm . 
  or , if someone feels oppressed , the feminine . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  i will stand by the overall point , though , that the referendum was not supermajority-weighted in favor of the uk not entering the eu , and that it 'd be a bit awkward to have the exit vote use a different standard . 
  well , friedman does specifically address jobs in the linked talk , but in all honesty , he 's over-simplifying the argument . 
  it 's certainly true that one group or another could benefit more than another -- if latvia exports gobs of fish to the us , it might increase the buying power of a typical us worker slightly in that they could get more fish , but put some fishermen out of work . 
  i do n't think , though -- or at least i have n't seen a serious argument -- that there is a general complaint that `` chinese policies are making one group less-well off than we want '' . 
  let 's say that they did , though . 
  it 's still possible to subsidize people , to redistribute wealth within the society -- one just taxes and then hands off money to whoever . 
  that is essentially all that protective tariffs do -- just not terribly well , since they have the same issue with money not necessarily going to whatever worker you want to subsidize . 
  and ... what is special about dumping , in that case ? 
  i mean , predatory pricing might be a concern ( pricing below cost specifically to drive an industry out of business and hoping that it will not spring back so that one could then charge more afterwards ) , or a strategic industry being lost ( no steel , no tanks ) . 
  but if it 's merely people losing jobs ... that happens with or without dumping . 
  when china manufactures t-shirts and ships them here , people who manufacture t-shirts will lose their jobs . 
  i 'd imagine that they 'd be about as happy about that as people who manufacture steel being in the same position , regardless of whether it 's due to a state subsidy or not . 
  yeah , sorry , was n't trying to claim that you personally were -- `` you guys '' was intended to be all of the eu , not just the non-uk bits . 
   isnt there an argument in the us that the 2nd amendment was only meant in a sense of a civilian militia that replaces a national army to ensure the independance of states and communities by limiting the power of the federal goverment ? 
  yes . 
  when you hear people talking about it being a `` collective right '' instead of an `` individual right '' , that 's what it refers to . 
  the supreme court ruled that it was an individual right in [ * district of columbia v. heller * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_of_columbia_v._heller ) . 
   in practice , no citizen is ever going to `` defeat '' the state/military in a contest of arms these days the us military is fantastic at fighting a conventional army . 
  it is much less-fantastic at dealing with guerilla warfare -- vietnam was a loss for both france and the us , despite seemingly overwhelming disparity in resources and technology . 
  additionally , the us military has great ability to project force , but depends on having an infrastructure to supply it . 
  securing all the things that it relies on for effectiveness , like fuel and electrical infrastructure against the civilian population that operates it would be difficult . 
  in that sense , a roman army with donkey carts and swords would probably be better-off than a military equipped with stealth jets and aircraft carriers . 
  i mean , i imagine you 're saying `` but a rifle bullet will bounce off a tank '' . 
  sure . 
  but ... look at cuba , for example . 
  soldiers do n't just sit in tanks . 
  they ca n't . 
  for a late roman empire type situation , you 'd have to have the military be able to compel the civilian population to support it and block it from resisting it . 
  i do n't think that that 's all that viable . 
  that 's really more of a policing job than a military one , and if it were viable , it 'd be a matter of monitoring technology , the * stasi * rather that a question of military ability . 
  yes , it is mutually beneficial , but ... so is trade . 
  heck , so are most things in a relationship . 
  you guys are talking about ending a whole range of mutually-advantageous cooperation . 
  i do n't know what you want cited -- that reducing the cost of an expenses to steel-using companies benefits them ? 
  that 's not exactly controversial . 
  the definition of profit , i guess ? 
  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp  profit is a financial benefit that is realized when the amount of revenue gained from a business activity exceeds the expenses , costs and taxes needed to sustain the activity . 
  i can link you to a [ milton friedman lecture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em ) talking about the same issue -- people wanting protection against claims of subsidized steel to protect steel jobs , but with japan exporting steel to the us . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're getting at . 
  surely they were done for the same reason , but there 's no way in which the us benefits from the uk doing this . 
  showing that they were associated does n't show what you 're claiming . 
   right , so when the us tries to push a form of ttip again , we can also bend overt to them if they threated a nato pullout ? 
  for starters , let me say that this sort of thing is the reason why i am not enthusiastic about deals on nato -- the us did n't bring it up in ttip , and all members already committed , so things related to nato verge on or are backing out on a commitment already made . 
  and further , i have n't seen anything that clearly says that the brits are talking about military rather than intelligence ( like , antiterrorism issues ) . 
  but . 
  it is not free for them to gather intelligence . 
  i dunno what the brits spend , but the us spends as much on intelligence as the entire british military budget it 's something that they do bring to the table . 
  like the french bringing nuclear weapons , it 's a difficult thing to bring up diplomatically ( so you 'd just stand there and watch us die ? ), 
  it 's like talking about , oh , setting healthcare budgets and thereby deciding how many people do n't get what healthcare . 
  i think that it is a hard chip to use , because it is hard for them to offer concrete commitments in terms of intelligence . 
  what , are you going to keep europol intelligence above some level ? 
  what kinds of information are you guaranteeing to turn over ? 
  a trust-us-we 've - done-well-so-far is obviously a weak promise . 
  but it 's something that they do n't normally provide to countries .
