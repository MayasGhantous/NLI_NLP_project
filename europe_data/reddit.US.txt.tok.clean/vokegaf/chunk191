  oh , yeah , and ttip . 
  god * damn * , people are panicky as hell at competing directly with business in the us . 
  you 'd think that people would care more about low-wage countries , but maybe there are just a lotta farm workers on here or something . 
  and there 's a whole slew of people who have it in for turkey . 
  erdogan 's exacerbated that quite a bit recently . 
  and then there 's one crowd or two crowds that alternate between complaining at germany for `` not showing leadership '' and `` ignoring and oppressing other countries '' . 
  oh , yeah , and most people have it in for / r/the _ donald . 
  oh , yeah , and saudi arabia . 
  god * damn * . 
  let 's see , what else ... oh , yeah , the romani catch a pretty heavy cloud of flak when they come up . 
  and if the french are trashing other countries ' trucks , that tends to go over poorly . 
  ireland if ireland is off facilitating exploitation of eu tax loopholes . 
  why do you want single market access but to avoid eu membership ? 
  we put a ton of money into re-stabilizing iraq after the war . 
  yes , they can . 
  any eu citizens can enter the roi , and becuse of the cta , can then enter ni . 
  the roi not being in schengen means that people who are * not * eu citizens but somehow got physical access to the eu and have no legal right to be in ireland -- like , say , some eritrean who illegally hopped across the mediterranean -- will be caught at the roi 's border check and wo n't be let through . 
  the fact that the uk keeping no borders with the roi up will , after brexit , permit eu citizens to easily ( albeit illegally ) get into the uk is something that the uk will probably just put up with . 
   rich countries want the goods and services part limiting immigration , poor countries want the contrary . 
  well , i 'd say that both countries would benefit from no restrictions . 
  the question is what substantial chunks of the publics want . 
  if you 're in a wealthy country working a low-skill job that relies on having physical access to the country you 're in , you quite potentially do n't want competition . 
  but that does n't mean that it is n't in your country 's interests . 
   thats just a basic free trade deal though . 
  well , not quite . 
  you can have an fta and have incompatible products . 
  i mean , the us and the eu can sign an fta , but eggs prepared to eu-sellable standards still could n't be sold in the us , because they 'd violate us standards ( insufficient cleaning , may harbor bacteria ) , and eggs prepared to us-sellable standards still could n't be sold in the eu , because they 'd violate eu standards ( no protective coating , spoils quickly ) . 
  < eyeroll  somehow we manage without rules about `` predatory undercutting '' from state to state . 
   after brexit , germany , france , italy and spain have qualified majority this means slovakia has no veto power anymore , eh , no bloc is permanent . 
  go hook up with some of spain 's concerns , say , and do a new bloc . 
  well , he 's not super enthusiastic about the us , either . 
   it 'd be like , idk , saying that usa is `` xenophobic '' because it does n't get along with russians , and vice versa . 
  well , there 's been a long-standing geopolitical spat with * russia * . 
  [ i dunno about russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_americans ) . 
  do n't recall ever hearing about any kinda friction ( but then , there was never really mass russian emmigration to the us , and normally friction seems to be associated with really rapid movement ) . 
  need to put a backslash before your closing parenthesis in the url . 
  having one country footing the bill and another country choosing how to spend that : * produces a negative externality : the one deciding how to spend is not exposed to the losses . 
  this will naturally tend towards overspending . 
  * any wealth transfer that happens would happen via lenders assigning a lower risk than would be appropriate for the spending country to default risk . 
  that means that a transfer of funds would involve countries running up a bill with france and germany and so forth on the paying side , and then sporadically defaulting . 
  that is n't predictable -- whenever there 's a default , a lot of wealth effectively shifts from france/germany to the defaulting company -- or good for ez stability . 
  * you ca n't argue that the us does it , because while the us has treasury bonds , states do n't get to issue them . 
  the federal government does n't back states issuing debt even in the us . 
  i mean , i think that it would probably be a net positive -- assuming that it 's politically viable -- for the eu to subsidize poorer states . 
  but it ca n't be a blank check or encourage poor spending decisions . 
  and afaict , eurobonds being issuable by member states would do just that . 
  also , on top of that , unless something more has come out about the plot , i do n't really see how denazification , whatever its merits , has anything clearly to do with some anti-immigrant plotters . 
  the plotters were not , afaik , secretly trying to revive anything from the third reich . 
  sure , they were a risk , but is there any real link than both nazis being right wing and these guys being anti-immigrant and thus right-wing ? 
  i mean , i 'm a little suspicious that there 's just a knee-jerk reflex to denazify no matter what the problem , because that 's something that was done in germany in the past , so it 's safe and convenient . 
  but it 's a pretty poor solution if it 's being chosen simply because it 's safe and familiar . 
  for this to be a cultural problem in the military , i 'd expect the following to be true : * there should be multiple examples of such plotting within the military -- this is n't an individual , but a social problem . 
  * the same thing should not exist among people of the same age and economic background outside the military in germany . 
  * the same thing should not exist outside of germany , where similar environments do not exist . 
  is there any evidence at all that this is widespread within the military ? 
  there were no other plotters found beyond this group of three people . 
  is there reason to believe that anti-immigrant positions or violence against politicians are specific to the military ? 
  i recall [ henriette reker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henriette_reker ) being stabbed by some guy who was pissed off about immigration . 
  i do n't recall news stories at any point saying that he was associated with the military . 
  if violence against politicians over migrants is an issue , then perhaps it 's a society-wide concern , and not a military one . 
  is it even specific to germany ? 
  when thomas mair [ killed jo cox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_jo_cox ) in the uk , he was angry over non-white immigration , and he explicitly * did * reference naziism ... and the uk is hardly a place with bunkers named after rommel . 
  neither the lack of other cases in the military or the presence outside the military nor the existence of similar actions elsewhere in europe seem to me to support an argument that the problem is one of german military culture . 
  further , as you point out , removing rommel from a building seems like an odd action to take . 
  i watched [ * the desert fox * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_desert_fox:_the_story_of_rommel ) , which is a us movie on rommel ( which is pretty critical of the regime at the time , i might add ) . 
  if the us in 1951 , full of people who had just finished a war with nazi germany and in some cases fought directly against rommel , were totally fine with and happy to buy tickets to watch a sympathetic movie about rommel , i * really * have a hard time seeing how objectionable referencing the guy could be . 
  afaik , rommel is not used as a banner for anti-immigrant positions . 
   the best way would be to focus on a shared european approach against china and the united states -- in the telecommunications infrastructure , for example . 
  then we will no longer be talking about investments of $ 100 billion but of $ 1 or $ 2 trillion , and germany 's export surpluses will then be pumped back into the economy . 
  < tiredly rubs eyes  i do n't even get what he 's proposing here . 
  the eu can already have mncs that cross member country bounds , so i assume that his aim is either to mandate purchasing from some particular favored domestic-to-the-eu mnc ( people are n't purchasing from just one , and companies refuse to merge ! ), 
  or to establish some sort of eu-level soe like * deutsche bundespost * ne * europa bundespost * . 
  in either case , if you 're subsidizing it via purchases that would n't otherwise have happened , it can only be done via pulling funds from otherwise-successful export industries . 
  sure , you can put money into an industry , but only at the cost of another . 
  i have no idea what he 's talking about wrt throwing '' $ 1 or $ 2 trillion '' into telecom infrastructure . 
  that seems like a * lot * of money . 
  the us has apparently [ spent about $ 1.5 trillion on all broadband infrastructure combined over the past twenty years ] ( https://www.ustelecom.org/broadband-industry/broadband-industry-stats/investment ) . 
  this is from the time that the personal computer -- often not connected to networks -- was starting to become common in homes to now . 
  if he 's talking about spending 1-2 trillion more euros on telecom in a shorter time period than that , i think i 'd want a much-more-explicit description of what he 's planning to do with it . 
  if he 's talking about sending it to a single eu mnc , it 's not clear to me where a really-substantial benefit comes from . 
  like , let 's say that all of the telco companies in the eu are forcibly merged ( the opposite of what antitrust normally does ! ), 
  and eu telco spending for some period of time into the future is directed to this company . 
  where is the win for the eu ? 
  the us 's center is to the right of anyone else listed there . 
  / r/unitedkingdom seems to have a much lower age ( e.g. 
  many people there are students ) and is much further-left than / r/ukpolitics . 
  works okay for us states . 
  as a baseline , peak solar output ( sun directly overhead , clear sky ) is ~ 800w per square meter . 
  [ horst ehmke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horst_ehmke ) was apparently center-left . 
   nick griffith of the bnp also said he 's going to leave for hungary . 
  i dunno , how are the hungarians on immigration ? 
  east asia is n't in great shape either . 
  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html for reference : * france ( high end of europe ) is at a tfr of 2.07 * germany is at 1.44 * poland and romania , at the low end , are at 1.34 . 
  * the uk is at 1.89 * the us is at 1.87 * the eu-28 is at 1.61 * 2.1 is required to sustain population if you also want zero immigration . 
  for east asia : * china is at a tfr of 1.6 * japan is at 1.41 * south korea is at 1.25 . 
  * vietnam is 1.82 * hong kong is 1.19, 
  sure you can . 
  i sure as shit do n't want the us to start holding direct votes on things . 
  what if you did n't want the referendum in the first place ? 
  there was some interesting article a while back on / r/ukpolitics on how it 's easier to get someone to do something and then afterwards change the person 's mind about why they did it than to change their mind to get them to do something .
