  did he say that in some comment ? 
  it was n't in the one that i was responding to . 
  i mean , i ca n't think of anything like that in the us . 
  there are some privately-established scholarships for , say , blacks or women , but that 's a private program , not a government one . 
  hmm . 
  by that standard , institutionalized gaelic classes are racist . 
   that have lived in europe for 3-5 generations to have babies and immigration not from the mena region but rather from east asia . 
  hmm . 
  you start institutionalizing second-class citizens , and i think that you 're gon na produce huge friction and devalue your citizenship . 
  like , if you 're gon na not let someone in , okay , whatever . 
  but once they 're in ... well , that 's kinda internationally where ya draw the line to commit , to `` hiring someone on '' , and trying to not * really * treat someone as being a citizen seems like trouble . 
  eu directive 2017/8 .15 : settle a ton of australians in hungary to culturize it !, 
   applied solely to green , unripe bananas , rather than those destined for the processing industry . 
  well , that 's not totally honest either . 
  the bananas that go to the processing industry are converted to mush or powder or whatever . 
  they 're for low-value misfits . 
  bananas sold whole are typically picked unripe to let them be stored longer and then ripened whole with ethylene gas . 
   these standards should improve the quality of bananas produced within the community i mean , i guess . 
  i 'm kinda sympathetic to the `` there was n't really a problem to begin with in the curvature of bananas '' argument . 
  but , if you have product standards , someone 's gon na shove * something * objectionable in there , and if someone goes looking to cherry-pick objectionable parts of the standard , they 're gon na find something . 
  the brexit crowd did n't say `` okay , the banana standards have outraged many british consumers and need to change and if we ca n't we should leave '' , which i could support . 
  it did n't say `` the process that produced these banana standards is broken and needs to be fixed and here is how and if we ca n't we should leave '' . 
  it said `` the eu just does n't work -- look at this flaw -- and so we should leave '' . 
  that 's just looking for a rationale , and if you 're looking hard enough , you 're gon na turn something up . 
  every eu member is gon na have some laws or regulations that are probably kinda dumb . 
   and you shall refrain on making silly comments on the twitter from now because * that 's * going to happen .

  too bad the ss destroyed the [ compi\u00e8gne wagon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compi%c3%a8gne_wagon ) ( this was the wagon where germany surrendered to france in in world war i ; then germany intentionally reused it for france 's surrender in world war ii , with both sides using it as a symbol of trying to dominate the other ) . 
  would have been a symbolic place to sign a friendly ez integration treaty or something and endcap the whole affair .

  many of the crusades were associated with also killing off a buncha jews because they killed jesus . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_antisemitism  the earliest recorded instance of an accusation of deicide against the jewish people as a whole -- that they were collectively responsible for the death of jesus -- occurs in a sermon of 167 ce attributed to melito of sardis entitled peri pascha , on the passover . 
  this text blames the jews for allowing king herod and caiaphas to execute jesus . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_and_the_crusades vatican ii finally put the kibosh on this in the 1960s :  one of the more controversial documents [ 34 ] was [ * nostra aetate * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nostra_aetate ) , which stated that the jews of the time of christ , taken indiscriminately , and all jews today are no more responsible for the death of christ than christians . 
     true , the jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of christ ; still , what happened in his passion can not be charged against all the jews , without distinction , then alive , nor against the jews of today . 
  although the church is the new people of god , the jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by god , as if this followed from the holy scriptures . 
  all should see to it , then , that in catechetical work or in the preaching of the word of god they do not teach anything that does not conform to the truth of the gospel and the spirit of christ . 
  furthermore , in her rejection of every persecution against any man , the church , mindful of the patrimony she shares with the jews and moved not by political reasons but by the gospel 's spiritual love , decries hatred , persecutions , displays of anti-semitism , directed against jews at any time and by anyone . 
  no , no , no .

  sure , why not . 
  [ revelations 20:1 -3 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev+20&amp;version=niv ) :  when the thousand years are over , satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth -- gog and magog -- and to gather them for battle . 
  in number they are like the sand on the seashore . 
  they marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of god 's people , the city he loves . 
  but fire came down from heaven and devoured them . 
  -- the * book of revelations * , on the end times [ wikipedia : gog and magog : modern apocalypticism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gog_and_magog#modern_apocalypticism )  in the early 19th century , some chasidic rabbis identified napoleon 's invasion of russia as `` the war of gog and magog '' . 
  [ 111 ] but as the century progressed , apocalyptic expectations receded as the populace in europe began to adopt an increasingly secular worldview . 
  stupid euros !, 
  -- vokegaf ] this has not been the case in the united states , where a 2002 poll indicated that 59 % of americans believed the events predicted in the book of revelation would come to pass . 
  [ 113 ] during the cold war the idea that russia had the role of gog gained popularity , since ezekiel 's words describing him as `` prince of meshek '' -- rosh meshek in hebrew -- sounded suspiciously like russia and moscow . 
  [ 15 ] even some russians took up the idea , apparently unconcerned by the implications ( `` ancestors were found in the bible , and that was enough '' ) , as did ronald reagan . 
  [ 114 ] [ 115 ]   post -- cold war millenarians still identify gog with russia , but they now tend to stress its allies among islamic nations , especially iran . 
  [ 116 ] for the most fervent , the countdown to armageddon began with the return of the jews to israel , followed quickly by further signs pointing to the nearness of the final battle -- nuclear weapons , european integration , israel 's seizure of jerusalem , and america 's wars in afghanistan and the gulf . 
  [ 117 ] in the prelude to the 2003 invasion of iraq , president george w. bush told jacques chirac , `` gog and magog are at work in the middle east '' . 
  `` this confrontation '' , he urged the french leader , `` is willed by god , who wants to use this conflict to erase his people 's enemies before a new age begins '' . 
  [ 118 ] chirac consulted a professor at the faculty of theology of the university of lausanne to explain bush 's reference . 
  [ 119 ] russia 's in syria , and we are too , right on the doorstep of the levant , and iran 's backing israel 's enemies . 
  * now * we 're gon na see whose side jesus is * really * on !, 
  edit : the anecdote about bush was probably made up by a french journalist opposed to iraq . 
  but the point still stands !, 
  `` jesus '' was not historically a common name in the united states . 
  however , it * is * a common name in latin america , even moreso than in spain . 
  in the us , having someone you interact with on a day-to-day basis named `` jesus '' came off as vaguely blasphemous or just ridiculous , so there are a variety of jokes that involve someone misinterpreting `` jesus '' used in the context of jesus christ as jesus in the context of jesus-the-mexican-landscaping-worker or someone similar who is named jesus in the modern day from latin america . 
  in recent history , most immigrants to the us from latin america have been from mexico , to the point that `` mexican '' has been used as a drop-in for this . 
  apparently , the joke has subsequently made its way over to cyprus . 
  cyprus flair , dude . 
  [ matthew 22:15 -21 , kjv ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+22%3a15-21&amp;version=kjv ) :  then went the pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk . 
    and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians , saying , master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of god in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men . 
    tell us therefore , what thinkest thou ? 
  is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar , or not ? 
    but jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ? 
    shew me the tribute money . 
  and they brought unto him a penny . 
    and he saith unto them , whose is this image and superscription ? 
    they say unto him , caesar 's . 
  then saith he unto them , render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesar 's ; and unto god the things that are god 's . 
  jesus commanded it , and caesar wants some goddamn intercontinental thermonuclear weapons . 
  no , colonialism kicked off hundreds of years before that . 
  i 'm not sure whether you 're just politically-invested in the position that `` if europe did well and other places did not , it must have been because europe somehow cheated other countries '' or what , but your claim just does n't hold up , sorry .
