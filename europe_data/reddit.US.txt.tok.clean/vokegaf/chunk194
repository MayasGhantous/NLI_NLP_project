  well , the robes are a matter of per-religion tradition . 
  but i think that the catholic world , at least , has been there too when it comes to pre-battle rites : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/absolution#general_absolution  general absolution , where all eligible catholics gathered at a given area are granted absolution for sins without prior individual confession to a priest , is lawfully granted in only two circumstances : [ 2 ] :961   * there is imminent danger of death and there is no time for a priest or priests to hear the confessions of the individual penitents ( e.g. , to soldiers before a battle ) , [ snip ]  an historical example is the absolution given by [ fr . 
  william corby to the irish brigade during the battle of gettysburg in 1863 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_corby ) : -  he is perhaps best known for giving general absolution to the irish brigade on the second day of the battle of gettysburg . 
  of the brigade 's original 3,000 men , only about 500 remained , and more than a third of them were killed or wounded in the battle . 
  the scene of fr . 
  corby blessing the troops was depicted in the 1891 painting absolution under fire by paul wood , [ 1 ] and dramatized in the 1993 film gettysburg . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_gleeson_%28priest%29  father francis gleeson ( 28 may 1884 -- 26 june 1959 ) was an irish roman catholic priest who served as a british army chaplain during irelands ' involvement in the first world war ... on 8 may 1915 , on the eve of the battle of aubers ridge , gleeson addressed the assembled battalion at a roadside shrine and gave the general absolution . 
  the battalion suffered heavily in the battle and when paraded again afterwards only 200 men were assembled . 
  father george zabelka apparently blessed the airmen who dropped the atomic weapons on hiroshima and nagasaki before their missions ( later in life , partly as a result of that , he went pacifist ... ), 
  ah , but if you go outside the canonical-to-the-modern-church books of the bible and look at the [ infancy gospel of thomas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infancy_gospel_of_thomas ) :  the text describes the life of the child jesus , with fanciful , and sometimes malevolent , supernatural events , comparable to the trickster nature of the god-child in many a greek myth . 
  one of the episodes involves jesus making clay birds , which he then proceeds to bring to life , an act also attributed to jesus in quran 5:110 , [ 1 ] although jesus 's age at the time of the event is not specified in the quran . 
  in another episode , a child disperses water that jesus has collected . 
  jesus kills his first child , when at age one he curses a boy , which causes the child 's body to wither into a corpse . 
  later , jesus kills another child when jesus curses him when he apparently accidentally bumps into jesus , throws a stone at jesus , or punches jesus ( depending on the translation ) . 
    when joseph and mary 's neighbors complain , they are miraculously struck blind by jesus . 
  europe was the first place for the industrial revolution to kick off . 
  it was the transition to fossil fuels and mechanization that made europe wealthy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution  gdp per capita was broadly stable before the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy , [ 11 ] while the industrial revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies . 
  [ 12 ] economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the industrial revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants . 
  boycotts are where you personally agree not to buy something . 
  those are not illegal . 
  trashing spanish produce trucks and wine trucks passing through france is illegal . 
   you ca n't have workers ' rights without asserting them personally , i do n't think that this sort of thing is accomplishing anything other than making it less appealing for businesses to set up shop there . 
  and as for helping the workers ... would you ever hire someone who had previously rigged a former employer 's factory to explode ? 
  i sure would n't . 
  this needs to be the top comment . 
  stormfront , for those not familiar with it , is a white nationalist forum . 
  it is not a news source , and is * definitely * not going to be an objective source . 
   america lite because economics ? 
  military clout ? 
  before the us started being the poster child for market capitalism , it was the uk . 
  and the brits were a superpower before we were . 
  how sure are you that what you 're thinking of as a similarity originated here rather than there ? 
  hmm . 
   the league is very well when sparrows shout , but no good at all when eagles fall out . 
  -- benito mussolini , on the league of nations i 'd say that this was a pretty valid point , and mussolini was pretty fascist . 
  seriously , why the do n't you guys in the uk unify your banknotes ? 
  i ca n't see any benefit of maintaining tied-but-different-looking bills . 
  ` course , we 're off issuing quarters for every us state for fun , so , but then , we do n't have an issue with people taking those . 
   ~ ~ neoliberalism ~ ~ liberalism . 
  possibly `` classical liberalism '' if you want to be explicit . 
   ignore the fact that tens of millions of them were wiped out because of the us and european settlers ? 
  there were about [ 50 million native americans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas ) * in total * pre-columbus . 
  most of that , aside from a few million , was wiped out in the diseases that arrived during the [ columbian exchange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/columbian_exchange ) . 
  the settlers did n't kill anything remotely like tens of millions . 
  i guess that you could blame the settlers for being the source , but given the understanding of biology and medicine at the time , and the resources available , even if they wanted to , it 's very unlikely that they could have saved the bulk of native americans once afro-eurasia 's diseases started spreading . 
  hell , i 'm not sure that we could do it today . 
  native americans were boned by many thousands of years of biological separation from a larger population , not by being shot . 
  the americas today -- [ even just latin america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_latin_america ) -- are mostly genetically european , with a decent dash of africa thrown in . 
  basically , either you survived long enough to have kids with some afro-eurasian and your kids got lucky in the genetic lottery and got the right set of genes for disease resistance to afro-eurasian disease , or you died or your descendants did . 
  eh , that 's really * on * a rock . 
  i 'll go with repurposed ex -- world war ii tunnel fortifications . 
  the brits play the long game . 
   `` the fake news media ( failing @nytimes , @cnn , @nbcnews and many more ) is not my enemy , it is the enemy of the american people . 
  sick ! '' trump tweeted . 
  the post was deleted shortly after . 
    he revised his tweet 16 minutes later to include more news organizations in his category of so-called fake news : abc and cbs . 
  actually , it 'd be cool to do a `` reading rooms of european libraries '' too . 
  they tend to look different from the places that have the books , but impressive in their own right . 
  yeah , i was trying to joke -- may not have been clear . 
  good real answer , though !, 
  i 'd give odds that tribal conflict -- maybe not war in the large-scale , organized sense -- predated religion . 
  the newer [ satan 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rs-28_sarmat ) is supposedly about to go active . 
  i dunno ... i mean , a mobile icbm is one of the very few vehicles that probably * can * do their job pretty much wherever they are . 
  i do n't know anything about the solid fuel used , but i would n't be surprised if it is stable and not very vulnerable to crashes . 
  you can have a lot of potential energy , but require reaching a certain temperature for it to start going off . 
  like ... diesel has more energy-per-volume than gasoline , but gasoline will ignite if you toss a match into it , whereas diesel will simply put out the match . 
  edit : i do recall reading that it 's the norm for model rocket motors to not ignite even if you throw them into a wood fire ( though they can easily be ignited via electricity ) . 
   what sort of person burns their own wife ? 
  india , you 've got a bit of a history there too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bride_burning  bride burning or bride-burning is a form of domestic violence practiced in countries located on or around the indian subcontinent . 
  a category of dowry death , bride-burning occurs when a young woman is murdered by her husband or his family for her family 's refusal to pay additional dowry . 
  the wife is typically doused with kerosene , gasoline , or other flammable liquid , and set alight , leading to death by fire . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] kerosene is most often used as the fuel . 
  [ 3 ] it is most common in india and has been a major problem there since at least 1993 . 
  [ 4 ] also , going a bit further back : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sati_%28practice%29  sati or suttee [ note 1 ] is an obsolete hindu funeral custom where a widow immolates herself on her husband 's pyre or commits suicide in another fashion shortly after her husband 's death . 
    like `` set on fire '' ? 
    yes . 
  i thought that you meant in the metaphorical sense of having enraged her . 
   ` and i 've heard tell that elves are moving west . 
  they do say they are going to the harbours , out away beyond the white towers . ', 
  sam waved his arm vaguely : neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the sea , past the old towers beyond the western borders of the shire . 
  but it was an old tradition that away over there stood the grey havens , from which at times elven-ships set sail , never to return . 
    ` they are sailing , sailing , sailing over the sea , they are going into the west and leaving us , ' said sam , half chanting the words , shaking his head sadly and solemnly . 
  -- samwise gamgee , * the fellowship of the ring *  [ go west , young man , go west . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/go_west,_young_man ) -- horace greeley, 
  i mean , the point of building taller housing * is * that there will be more housing and property prices will come down . 
  compensate how one wants , but if the aim is `` maintain a shortage of housing and benefit from the cachet or value of the apartment '' , that ca n't be the goal . 
  the reason you have mobile icbms instead of static ones is so that they can keep moving to unexpected places so that the other side ca n't figure out where they are and whack them all in one big first strike . 
  that relies entirely on their position being unpredictable . 
  it 's clearly the case that nobody expects an icbm at media markt . 
  ;-) wikipedia says that the [ topol-m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt-2pm2_topol-m ) s have n't been built in about a decade . 
  which makes me wonder whether these launchers are getting a booster shot of blessing , whether they were just heathen icbms until the rufed government decided to improve the sanctity of its arsenal across-the-board , or whether the picture is old . 
  the oldest shot tineye can find of this is from 2015 , so it clearly at least did n't happen in the last month . 
  yup -- but my point is that the uk * will * probably have at least the relationship that sk does with the eu . 
  the us knocking out air defenses was kinda expected -- the us has put a lot of resources into stealthy aircraft intended to be resistant to air defenses . 
  i disagree that that 's a concern -- that 's more-or-less leveraging a specialization . 
  against * most * opponents , not having it would just mean the loss of some aircraft . 
  it would n't mean an inability to operate .
