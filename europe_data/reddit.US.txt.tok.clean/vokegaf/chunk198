  if by `` poverty '' , you mean `` relative poverty '' aka inequality rather than being poor , it 's always gon na be tough to compete with `` we 'll take less of your money '' . 
  [ the soviet union tried not letting people leave ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_bloc_emigration_and_defection )  eastern bloc governments argued that strict limits to emigration were necessary to prevent a brain drain . 
  the united states and western european governments argued that they represented a violation of human rights . 
  despite the restrictions , defections to the west occurred . 
  now , while * i * think that the best answer is to be okay with inequality and limit how much one redistributes , if one is hell-bent on avoiding it , some options : * establish a language barrier . 
  standardize on , say , german . 
  stop teaching english . 
  disallow sale and distribution of english-language material within the eu to avoid learning it via media . 
  this will make it harder for people to leave , since a 30-year-old engineer would not only face the costs and difficulty of relocating , but also a huge language barrier . 
  * obtain a monopoly on some amazing new efficiency ( new technology , or what-have-you ) and use relative gains from * that * efficiency to subsidize the poor . 
  i dunno , cheap energy from fusion reactors or something . 
  that reduces the problem from `` do n't let people emigrate '' to `` do n't let one technology go overseas '' . 
  kinda fragile , of course , since all you need is someone else to rediscover it ... * establish an international agreement that is inclusive of the us and * every other country * to limit inequality . 
  i suspect that this is gon na be an uphill battle ... 
  also a number of video game companies . 
   because it would amount to germany having joined liability for the debts of other ez countries , countries that have shown to be fiscally iressponsible . 
  i 'd add to this that i think that many people on the left see this as a good way to move wealth from germany to poorer countries -- having those countries spend and then potentially default one day . 
  whether-or-not more redistribution in the eu is a good idea , i think that eurobonds are a poor way to do this -- they 're unpredictable and germany would have no input . 
  well , there are two concerns i have there : * `` one man , one vote '' is a rough approximation of ability to project force . 
  a `` one man , one vote '' democracy is stable because , well , if someone decides to have a war , it 's just going to have more-or-less the same outcome as a vote , and the vote is a lot more pleasant for everyone involved . 
  ( the us also helps maintain that equation by guaranteeing that citizens may bear arms . ), 
  that means that whatever else the merits or flaws of the system , it 's hard to have someone kick off a revolution . 
  move away from that , and you lose stability . 
  * who determines who is meritorious ? 
  because that 's a glorious situation for regulatory capture , for some group to decide `` well , * i * am clearly the most-meritorious '' . 
  i can give you very real-world situations where this sort of thing has happened -- imperial china , where only the wealthy had time to study ancient canon , had a test that one had to pass to be given any government office . 
  the tests had a hard time being updated and pulling in new knowledge : everyone who * could * change them was deeply invested in having learned the old canon . 
  or eugenics -- the idea that we can artificial selection on humans rather than just plants is a straightforward-sounding one , yet the nazis clearly felt that * they * were the * ubermensch * , and few people seem to feel that * they * are the ones who should n't make the cut . 
  you 'd probably like plato 's * the republic * , though . 
   if the parliament was proportional to population , smaller eu states may as well not show up , because they 'd be absolutely steamrolled by germany and france . 
  if there are concerns common to many small states , what about their votes in aggregate ? 
  yeah , but they keep polling and i think that they 've got the support for it . 
  the referendum this year is expected to pass . 
  if it does , they got ta get congress to agree ( which will be republican and not necessarily enthusiastic about that unless they can split a state or something to get another republican state ) , and then they become a state . 
  ... what do you mean that the ep was overruled on puerto rico and d.c. ? 
  if you think of `` the slow lane '' as avoiding eea-type situations , where some countries can vote and others ca n't but just have to follow the rules , it looks a lot more appealing . 
  you * could * also convert the veto to qmv and maybe kill a50 instead of going multispeed . 
  that 'd also unblock things . 
   that entire system does not work without a federal state though . 
  which * does * suggest a possible solution !, 
  ~ ~ fake cheese ~ ~ competitive cheese, 
   the eu is sold as ` how things are ' . 
  there 's no grand revolution or national identity to bind people to its cause on an emotional level . 
  thus the eu comes off as centrist . 
  tusk clearly needs a beret and and to sound more radical . 
  edit : actually , i was joking , but that 's not totally crazy . 
  movements tend to have clothing to identify them . 
  secular turks had the fez ; leftists in latin america the beret , mao had his suit , etc. 
  what 's europe 's symbolic apparel ? 
  who associates fraktur with nazis ? 
  i just think of germany when i see it . 
  okay , let 's say that you do n't go multispeed . 
  in that case , can you sell the eu on : * elimination of the veto-based vote , and move to qmv * possibly eliminating a50 . 
  those would be huge changes . 
  my own take is that selling the eu on this would be difficult , more difficult than multispeed . 
  but without that , almost any move will be blocked by * some * member that objects to it . 
  a selling point behind multispeed is that it breaks up that bloc that requires unanimity to make decisions . 
  once countries in the `` top tier '' can integrate without anyone else blocking them , they do n't need to worry about vetos from anyone not in the `` top tier '' . 
  so allowing multispeed is probably the easiest way to accelerate integration towards federalization . 
  i do not believe that the eu is at its `` very last chance '' in france . 
  [ 72 % of french people support remaining on the euro ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/04/majority-of-french-voters-want-an-eu-referendum-citi.html ) . 
  it may be a good idea to * claim * that france is about to do so as a bluff and hope that other members extend something to france . 
  but i do not think that the french actually want to leave the eu , when it comes down to it . 
   then the next french elections will be a disaster for the european union because we will just feel like germany holds all the power in the union and that it became hopeless since germans are not gon na accept change towards more social integration . 
  how would germany vetoing something show that germany has `` all the power in the union '' ? 
  france has a veto of equal strength . 
  in the us , states and the federal government have independent taxation systems . 
  would giving the eu the ability to tax be as objectionable ? 
  it 's not really a question of being left or right . 
  the man 's been rude to a lot of people and organizations and at least given the impression of supporting things that normally us presidents have refrained from doing . 
  nor has trump sold a particularly right-wing image , as republicans go , at any rate . 
  he 's no moral exemplar for the social conservatives -- he had to choose pence as vp precisely because it was a weak point for him . 
  he has at least given the impression of being against ( though perhaps not followed up on ) opposing international trade , which is a left-wing position . 
  honestly , the only thing i can think of where trump stands out in any way as being right-wing is in taking a nativist stance . 
  fair enough ; i would n't argue that ireland does . 
  that being said , the canucks are a loveable lot . 
   always loved their long dead commonwealth the [ commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) is n't dead . 
  it 's the [ british empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_empire ) that 's dead -- the commonwealth is a follow-up organization . 
  ehhh ... i guess that there 's some ambiguity to `` wealth '' , but normally i think of `` wealth '' as being `` well off '' , not `` big '' -- that is , monaco would not be poor , but wealthy , albeit with a small population . 
  india would not be wealthy , but poor , albeit with a large population . 
   then you 'll see all your farmers out of jobs because everything is cheaper on the world market . 
  so , some of the issue that french farms face is that they 're still small on average , and iirc british farms are n't as small . 
  but i will bet that you 're right that the uk will see less farm protectionism and that brexit will * tend * to be disadvantageous for british farmers . 
  that 's not a negative for the country as a whole , though -- food prices will drop , so effective wages of everyone else rise . 
  the uk is a net food importer -- for it , high food prices make the country worse-off , and low food prices make the country better-off . 
  the eu 's cap and other policies to protect agriculture are not done for the interests of the uk -- in fact , they 're rather against the interests of the uk . 
  my guess is that they 're primarily done to buy political support for the eu in farmers in eu members that have a lot of small farms , with the eu taking an eye to gradually phasing out and consolidating a lot of those small farms into larger farms , improving the efficiency of the eu 's agriculture industry . 
  for the uk in isolation , cap or other similar policies does n't make much sense . 
  you 're right that it 'll probably be disruptive , though . 
  okay . 
  but that 's clearly not a fundamental concern for the uk , as they 've been cheerily going along with it thus far . 
  my guess is that both the uk and the roi try to get each other to make non-eu migration policy as similar-as-possible to reduce headaches , kinda like canada and the us have pretty similar policy . 
  well , i doubt that the roi will complain about getting something extra . 
  the rest of the eu could probably swap the uk something for that access , but i assume that it 'd be substantial . 
  my guess is that the uk will hold off creating them and that the eu will fold to the roi on having them , since the roi will presumably veto any agreement that involves having them . 
   the uk is decades away from lower tariffs than the eu not tariffs charged by other countries on things being imported by companies from the uk . 
  tariffs charged by the uk on things being imported to the uk . 
  that does n't require time -- countries can do that unilaterally . 
   on the eu border with the uk in ireland the only way for the uk to control who comes into their country is by setting up physical border controls . 
  the only way to get absolute control , sure .
