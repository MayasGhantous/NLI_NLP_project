  ooooh , that sounds like grounds for an asylum claim . 
  you maintain multiple sources so that it would require collusion among all providers to increase prices . 
  same thing as being a company with a single provider . 
   his discourse has been shifting towards a better integration between french-speaking countries hmm . 
  [ well , here 's a map of the francophone world . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:new-map-francophone_world.png ) did he go into more detail about which french-speaking countries he 's talking about ? 
  he 's talking about european countries that speak french , like belgium ? 
  or the quebec portion of canada , madagascar , and west africa ? 
  or is he talking more about island countries ? 
   after which , the plan would be to ( try to ) found a new cooperation with european countries , possibly with a new common currency . 
  non-eu members like norway , switzerland , albania , and the uk , or would he try to break up the eu and `` take '' countries from it ? 
   i think disobeying the treaties right away is the only way to be taken seriously . 
  let 's say that he gets what he wants . 
  would members start saying `` hey , * that * seems to be a good idea ... i should do the same thing ? '', 
  because with 27 members playing absolute hardball with each other ... it does not seem like a promising situation . 
  or what happens when the next french administration wants something different and repeats the process ? 
  thanks , but how about making a statue to a * romanian * democracy advocate ? 
  reagan 's got plenty of visibility already . 
  i think that more people , including myself , are concerned about the `` let 's pull a cameron and say that if i do n't get what i want from the eu , i 'm calling a referendum on leaving the eu '' bit . 
   because the uk has made itself irrelevant by leaving the eu and putting a buffoon in charge of foreign affairs . 
  the bureaucracy stays the same . 
  just the public face at the top changes . 
  no , but it 's a common image , the blind and lame people are clearly indicated , and the halo thing is a standard way to signify jesus in art . 
  that 's not how sanctions work -- when you use them as a lever , you commit to hanging onto them and the other side tries to outlast you . 
  [ much more common in ireland and scotland than in italy ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/25/mapping-redheads-which-country-has-the-most ) . 
  probably jesus healing the blind and the lame . 
  look , world war i and ii were pretty unpleasant for australia too . 
  i dunno about you , but i 'd rather we not do that again . 
   no more than having hawaii makes the united states part of oceania . 
  [ * au contrair * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nations_of_nineteen_eighty-four#/media/file:1984_fictitious_world_map_v2_quad.svg ) . 
  that text is not making the argument that you are making . 
  it is saying that the us is bound by but not correctly implementing part of an article in the 1951 refugee convention that it became bound by by ratifying the 1967 refugee convention . 
  the modification made by the 1967 convention was to expand the scope of the 1951 convention to eliminate the time and location restrictions . 
  if you want to go back and read the text of the 1951 refugee convention -- it 's not all that long -- you 'll find that it applied only to world-war-ii-and-thereabouts europe . 
  it has no legal effect on anyone other than maybe some very-old-but-still-alive people . 
  it is inapplicable to the current refugee crisis in europe . 
  for the purposes of the present convention , the term `` refugee '' , shall apply to any person who :   ( 1 ) has been considered a refugee under the arrangements of 12 may 1926 and 30 june 1928 or under the conventions of 28 october 1933 and 10 february 1938 , the protocol of 14 september 1939 or the constitution of the international refugee organization ; decisions of non-eligibility taken by the international refugee organization during the period of its activities shall not prevent the status of refugee being accorded to persons who fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 of this section ;   ( 2 ) as a result of events occurring before 1 january 1951 and owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable , or owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . 
  in the case of a person who has more than one nationality , the term `` the country of his nationality '' shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national , and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of his nationality if , without any valid reason based on well-founded fear , he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national . 
  ( 1 ) for the purposes of this convention , the words `` events occurring before 1 january 1951 '' in article i , section a , shall be understood to mean either :   ( a ) `` events occurring in europe before 1 january 1951 '' ; or   ( b ) `` events occurring in europe or elsewhere before 1 january 1951 '' ; and each contracting state shall make a declaration at the time of signature , ratification or accession , specifying which of these meanings it applies for the purpose of its obligations under this convention . 
  well , let 's do a back-of-the-envelope . 
  assume that you need something comparable to the us dhs ice . 
  ice 's budget is [ $ 5.3 b dollars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._immigration_and_customs_enforcement ) . 
  according to this [ anti-immigration-detention group ] ( https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/uploads/pdfs/immigration-detention-fact-sheet-jan-2013.pdf ) , the portion of that budget for immigration detention is $ 2b/year . 
  we 're assuming that you actually have to hold these people , and ca n't just quickly process them ( i mean , if you spent sufficiently on processing capabilities , maybe you could ) . 
  you need something like 50 times ice 's peak capacity ( 1.5 m ) if you want to keep everyone who came in illegally in 2015 behind bars . 
  so you 're talking $ 100b . 
  that 's doable , but it 's not cheap -- the entire eu budget is only ~ $ 150b . 
  thus far , how many people have migrants killed ? 
  i mean , sure , we like to , in the abstract , treat human life as having infinite value , but in practice , government has to place a value on it all the time . 
  it does so when it weighs the cost and benefit of safety regulations , decides how much to spend on policing , and so forth . 
  it 's unlikely that unless attacks become much larger and more-damaging than they are now , that this is a cost-effective way to deal with the migrant crisis . 
  it meant that it did n't apply to the us until 1967 . 
  the very first item includes the 1951 convention . 
  the 1967 convention took something that was specific to post-world-war-ii europe and made it global . 
  yeah ... it just seems amazingly us-centric to be popular in poland . 
  take a look at your map . 
  it was signed at the time that the 1967 revision went through . 
  well ... nato might stop the * immediate * cause , in that any outsider or member who attacks another member is an aggressor . 
  but ... well ... i think that you 'd agree that europe would be unstable-as-hell if every country were standing around waiting to whack the other european countries at the first opportunity . 
  that 's a fragile sort of peace . 
  there 's more to peace than just not being able to shiv someone at the moment . 
  the eu is n't the only mechanism for that , of course , but it has done many things that have brought the peoples of europe closer together , and i 'd say far more than anything else . 
   then the us start an attack on a syrian airport anyway , after they faked a chemical attack . 
  there 's a certain amount of irony in complaining about standards of proof and then asserting that a chemical attack was faked . 
  why would n't landlocked states be able to colonize ? 
  wait , you guys have people in poland who buy into that nwo stuff too ? 
   the prison systems are already grossly overcapacity solvable . 
  we need more prisons !, 
   impose penalties on refugees who entered illegally in search of asylum if they present themselves ( article 31 ) if they have refugee status . 
  which has not yet been determined . 
  also , you cut out the bit about coming * directly * from the unsafe country being a requirement for this exception to apply , which is almost certainly not the case for any refugee in either germany or sweden . 
   that 's literally what you 're saying here not all muslims in europe are applications for refugee status . 
   piss off to russia or north korea then . 
  russia is a signatory of the [ convention related to the status of refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) . 
  north korea would be okay , though . 
  well , i 'm not very familiar with tunisia , but : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_turkey  the politics of turkey takes place in a framework of a secular parliamentary representative democratic republic , whereby the prime minister of turkey is the head of government , and the president of turkey is the head of state who holds a largely ceremonial role with substantial reserve powers . 
    turkey 's political system is based on a separation of powers . 
  executive power is exercised by the council of ministers . 
  legislative power is vested in the grand national assembly of turkey . 
  the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature . 
  its current constitution was adopted on 7 november 1982 after the turkish constitutional referendum . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_tunisia  the politics of tunisia takes place within the framework of a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic , [ 1 ] with a president serving as head of state , prime minister as head of government , a unicameral legislature and a court system influenced by french civil law . 
  between 1956 and 2011 , tunisia operated as a de facto one-party state , with politics dominated by the secular constitutional democratic rally ( rcd ) under former presidents habib bourgiba and then zine el abidine ben ali . 
  however , in 2011 a national uprising led to the ousting of the president and the dismantling of the rcd , paving the way for a multi-party democracy . 
  october 2014 saw the first democratic parliamentary elections since the 2011 revolution , resulting in a win by the secularist nidaa tounes party with 85 seats in the 217-member assembly . 
  [ 2 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tunisian_parliamentary_election,_2014  legislative elections were held in tunisia on 26 october 2014 . 
  [ 2 ] campaigning started on 4 october 2014 . 
  [ 3 ] they were the first free regular legislative elections since independence in 1956 , and the first elections held following the adoption of the new constitution in january 2014 ... -  initially , the elections authority decided to sanction nidaa tounes in kasserine electoral district by withdrawing one seat following reported irregularities conducted by partisans . 
  [ 70 ] however , the decision was overturned by the administrative court after an appeal by nidaa tounes . 
  the ruling took away the only seat obtained by democratic forum for labour and liberties leaving the party with no presence in parliament . 
  [ 71 ] a low youth voter turnout was recorded with over 80 % of 18 - to 25-year-olds boycotting the vote . 
  tunisia does n't sound too hot . 
   your people have history of incredible arrogance , close mindedness and bigotry . 
  could probably have made the point without the nazi allusion . 
  what / u/bristlerider said * is * true , and the us refugee processing system depends on exactly this being legal . 
   it 's an example to illustrate what happens with collective punishment , there are plenty of other examples but the holocaust is something that we all know . 
    if you want another example , try the seizure of property and subsequent internment of japanese americans and canadians during ww2 . 
  * this is n't collective punishment . 
  collective punishment is where many people are punished in response to one person committing a crime to deter that person from committing a crime . 
  this has no such intent .
