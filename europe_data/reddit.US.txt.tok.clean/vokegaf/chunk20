  given that everyone is putting the relationship on a ledger and deciding what everyone contributes , it should probably show up . 
  if you did n't see the follow-up articles , the trump invoice thing was something originating with the sunday times that a bunch of news outlets picked up without verifying . 
  both germany and the us said that it did n't happen . 
   `` a very overt effort as well as covert in germany and france , already been tried in montenegro and the netherlands . '', 
  was the montenegro incident ever actually classified as something russia did from any eu intelligence agency or us intelligence agency ? 
  i have n't seen that . 
  i mean , if it was legit , that 's a serious matter . 
  but i have n't seen anyone but montenegro saying so yet . 
  oh , come * on * . 
  i 'm not enthusiastic about the referendum , but add a law requiring a supermajority immediately beforehand ? 
  there was n't a supermajority on the referendum on joining the european community . 
  leavers would reasonably complain about a double standard . 
  if supermajority votes for major * status quo * changes are a good idea , they should be a good idea in the abstract . 
  they should n't be paired with a referendum . 
  the scottish independence referendum that had * just * happened had been a majority vote . 
  anyone would say `` well , you just raised the bar on this one because it looked a bit dicier '' . 
  the campaign promise , wise or not , had already gone through . 
  if you were going to propose a change that might make it ineffective , that should have been part of the campaign promise or happen ahead of it , not `` wait until i win based on the promise '' . 
  i think that there were plenty of problems with the referendum , but a last-minute shift to a supermajority bar just does n't fix the issues and is downright objectionable . 
  i 'm not enthralled that the government did a referendum when it clearly felt that it was not a good idea . 
  i 'm not enthralled that debate was low-information and that the vote dealt more with people choosing who to believe than on consensus information as to the effects . 
  i 'm not enthralled that all the leave options were merged , when only one could be taken . 
  but a supermajority vote is simply not a fix for any of those . 
  finally , i would be willing to bet that any other eu members that permit for calling a referendum on eu membership * also * require only a majority in that referendum to change things . 
  it seems unreasonable to single out the britons for what is probably a pretty common mechanism in the eu . 
  the dutch referendum on the ukraine association , for example -- that was a majority vote ( with the low-turnout modification ) . 
  i assume that the same bar would apply to a dutch referendum on eu membership ? 
  i doubt that this is some sort of abstract procedural objection of that sort . 
  rather , that the british negotiation team sees something advantageous to the uk in conducting both at once and the eu negotiation apparently agrees with them . 
  i do n't know what it is , though . 
  maybe the uk is seen as being as in a stronger position for the brexit negotiation than for a future trade arrangement and this would , and this would prevent points in brexit from being used to negotiate a favorable trade agreement ? 
  i did see a rejection of parallel talks with * other countries * being treated as absolutely unacceptable during the brexit process . 
  given that it was attached to an implementation period , my layman 's guess there is that the goal is for the eu to take first shot at establishing eu-favorable trade terms in the uk post-brexit , rather than having the us do so ( `` wisconsin-made feta for everyone '' ) . 
  ah , yeah , it 's got one of those letters with the little sticky-down things , thanks . 
  nazi terrorism defeated confirmed !, 
  i see it in english and one other language ( german ? ), 
  i assume that they failed to post it in dutch ? 
  i do n't think that federalism providing for separation in the judicial system is very specific to civil or criminal law . 
  that property is present under civil law too . 
  it affects how much of a relative role the legislature or the judiciary with jurisdiction play , but i do n't know of anywhere that has shared legislatures but separate judiciaries . 
  hell , sometimes canadian courts ( common law ) use us ( common law ) precedents , where the law is similar . 
  [ international association for the protection of civilian arms rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_association_for_the_protection_of_civilian_arms_rights ) members in europe : * national arms association of spain * pefop ( greece ) * practical shooting association ( moldova ) * protell ( switzerland ) * right to arms ( russia ) * sport and practical shooting club ( austria ) * ukrainian gun owners association * unpact ( france ), 
  there is no eu-wide gun-rights-advocacy organization , but there are numerous country-level organizations that have affiliated internationally under the [ international association for the protection of civilian arms rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_association_for_the_protection_of_civilian_arms_rights ) . 
  is gun ownership a right in switzerland ? 
  i mean , it 's * legal * , but does the swiss constitution mandate it or anything like that ? 
   and it 's not the business of the eu to get involved in such matters . 
  i would not want such a law in the us , but ... why is it clearly nation-level , rather than eu-level , business ? 
  i mean , what document states that this is clearly not in the eu 's realm ? 
  the eu * does * handle matters related to international security in the eu , things like frontex , and presumably this is seen by gun ban advocates as a tool to achieve that security . 
  i think that the point is there are already serious laws in place against killing people , and anyone who has elected to kill a bunch of people is very unlikely to be dissuaded by the additional prospect of a weapons possession violation . 
  i mean , yeah , it does act as another basis to jack penalties up , but let 's be honest -- have there realistically been any cases of actual mass killings or attempted mass killings where the prosecutors have n't been able to produce severe-enough charges ? 
  i really can not see the bataclan guys , had they survived , walking off with a slap on the wrist , gun bans or not . 
   compare north hollywood shooting where the robbers used semi-auto rifles converted to full auto and breivik who used regular civilian semi-auto rifle . 
  to clarify : the [ north hollywood shootout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_hollywood_shootout ) had nobody get killed other than the shooters ( though people were wounded ) . 
  [ breivik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_behring_breivik ) killed 77 . 
  i do agree that an emphasis on `` scary '' features is common -- suppressors , folding stocks , full-auto , etc. 
  the purpose of a fully-automatic weapon is n't to allow mowing down masses of people . 
  that being said , the eu also does n't , as a whole , have the second amendment rationale -- that is , one could say that the * point * of having a gun in ( much of ) the eu is only to hunt , whereas in the us the rationale was very clearly to allow shooting people who would have military equipment . 
  so in the us , saying `` you do n't need a fully-automatic weapon to hunt deer '' would really not be a legitimate objection , but in ( much of ) the eu it potentially could be . 
  also , i 'm not sure that the type of weapon was a dominant effect . 
  in the north hollywood shootout , police saw the robbers entering the bank . 
  the intent of the robbers was not to kill anyone but the police -- they simply wanted to escape . 
  there were armed police on the scene immediately , swat en-route very-early on , paramedics staging nearby , and so forth . 
  breivik was in a remote area . 
  police did not show up for over an hour . 
  his goal was to kill as many people as possible . 
  finally , while automatic weapons are n't really all that hot for mowing down a crowd of people -- people scatter , and if you 've got a crowd , you 're better-off with a bomb anyway -- they * are * useful for suppressing people who are trying to shoot you . 
  use of automatic weapons * was * effective in suppressing police in the north hollywood shootout -- the police radio transmissions had officers calling out that they were `` all pinned down '' -- though it 's likely that the robbers ' use of heavy , head-to-toe body armor that the firearms that the regular police carried could not penetrate was a more-important factor . 
  that 's probably a fallback for some . 
  one drawback is distance -- you wo n't be able to see your grandkids or whatever as much . 
  you may find that trump is n't very popular around europe . 
   i suppose common law influenced the us constitution a great deal ? 
  i 'm not sure how relevant common law was to the us constitution . 
  the constitution mostly sits above the court system . 
  the sixth amendment reads :  in all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence . 
  [ 1 ] you have a right to a [ jury trial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jury_trial ) in the us , which is guaranteed by the constitution . 
  that 's important to common law , but not in civil law . 
  and common law has the [ adversarial system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adversarial_system ) , where a witness is called specifically by the prosecution or defense -- i am not sure that the inquisitorial system does this , and so i guess that saying a `` witness for '' or a `` witness against '' might not be as meaningful there . 
  not nuts , just willing to lie to his voters to get something he wants . 
  there 's a lot of that going around . 
   and one guy manged to fuck it up within a few years . 
  where it goes is up to you . 
  relationships take two to tango . 
  seems legit . 
  i knew that this eu gun restrictions thing was a bad idea . 
  [ pope francis to engage europe 's future post-brexit ] ( https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2017/03/24/pope-francis-engage-europes-future-post-brexit/ ), 
  `` the government tax check process was not effective in identifying tax-delinquent contractors . '', 
  germany has some familiarity with the logistics of crossing the english channel . 
  it ... it feels so dirty ... but ... all the same ... 
  what would they say in response to federalism being proposed ? 
  if a policy of social subsidy actually works to make a country better-off and you truly believe in this , then you should n't need tariffs . 
  it should be the case that the healthy , well-educated , content french public produce more than the american one , and thereby set an example , yes ? 
  ;-) but , seriously , aside from that -- one does not need to be the most-productive member in trade for trade to be advantageous . 
  that * would * be the case if [ absolute advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/absolute_advantage ) were what drove the benefits of trade -- what economists would have said hundreds of years ago . 
  but that 's not what modern-day economists see as being the mechanism driving trade -- rather , it is [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) . 
  with comparative advantage , trade is mutually-advantageous , regardless of what the relative efficiency of the of industries are . 
  if the french are less-productive than americans , then it will simply mean that the french will be able to purchase less international production . 
  it does n't mean that france will enter some sort of economic spiral of doom . 
  france can retain social policy and subsidy and distribute wealth within her society as she pleases without concern , including when trading with the us . 
  teresa may has avoided the trend of `` world leaders posting stupid shit on twitter '' thus far .
