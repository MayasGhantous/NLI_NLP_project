   what does uk have to offer that would make other countries bend over backwards to trade with it ? 
  i do n't think that countries would generally `` bend over backwards '' , but trade ? 
  sure . 
  they 're a large service economy . 
  why would n't you ? 
   i already said this , it 's delusional to think that any country would suddenly have increased interest in trading with the uk now that they 're no longer in the eu . 
  i mean , my guess is that we 'll probably wind up establishing an fta with the uk , whereas before the eu did n't want an fta . 
   `` our weapons suit them perfectly because they are of old and simple soviet design , '' the official added . 
  `` you can take any person from the street and teach him to use it in a matter of hours . '' i am curious why they can teach someone to fire a dshk `` in a matter of hours '' but not an m2 browning . 
   the us , for example , still has a joke of an election system and 2 of their last 5 elections were won by the person with the least votes . 
  no , they were won by the person who would have won second place * if * the vote were popular * but * there were not voting or campaigning differences . 
  the us system tends to produce centrist governments with a powerful executive , for good or for ill . 
   so basically , usa . 
  i am not sure if that 's socialism on a supra-national scale . 
  [ yes , comrade ] ( http://img07.deviantart.net/ad57/i/2014/248/8/3/national_and_state_flags_of_communist_america_by_regicollis-d7y2g4y.jpg ) . 
   the us was sort of looking the other way for most of the conflict . 
  well , shit , spain , at least we were n't trying to cut a deal with both sides . 
  and i do n't think that we were [ sort of looking the other way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqvc7kdtv_m ) . 
  and how many countries entered without a direct threat to themselves or a defense alliance ? 
  was n't as if anyone in europe was going to go to war to bail out czechoslovakia or finland . 
  ` sides , i guarantee that if the us had promptly jumped in , people on here today would be complaining that the us was an aggressor . 
  hell , discussions about the us in world war ii on here have a habit of focusing on whether-or-not the us engaged in war crimes by dropping the bomb instead of trying a bloody amphibious assault first . 
   in a war they started themselves as allies to nazi germany ah , but the soviet position was that there was no world war ii , but rather the [ great patriotic war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_patriotic_war_\\ ( term \\ ) ) , which did * not * include any alliance with nazi germany !, 
   the term [ great patriotic war ] is not generally used outside the former soviet union ( see eastern front ) . 
  there is a significant difference between this phrase and world war ii or the second world war , as the soviet term does not cover the initial phase of world war ii during which the ussr , then still in a non-aggression pact with germany , occupied six european countries , namely poland ( 1939 ) , finland ( 1939 ) , the baltic states ( 1940 ) and bessarabia and northern bukovina ( 1940 ) . 
  [ 2 ] [ 7 ] the term does also not refer to the soviet union 's 1941 invasion of iran alongside britain , the war with japan ( which included the soviet -- japanese war ( 1945 ) ) nor the war on the western front . 
  [ 2 ]   on 9 april 2015 the ukrainian parliament replaced the term `` great patriotic war '' ( velyka vitchyzniana viina ) in the national lexicon with `` second world war '' , [ 8 ] as part of a set of decommunization laws . 
  quit pussyfooting around and federalize , euros !, 
  http://www.people-press.org/2016/05/05/6-nato-u-s-allies-the-eu-and-un/  views of the european union also more positive than negative ( 53 % favorable , 27 % unfavorable ) , although the share of the public with a favorable view of the european union is down slightly from 58 % in 2014 to 53 % today . 
    there are wide partisan differences in views of both institutions . 
  large majorities of democrats hold a positive view of the un ( 80 % ) and the eu ( 64 % ) . 
  by contrast , only about four-in-ten republicans ( 43 % ) report having a favorable opinion of either institution . 
  two-thirds of independents ( 64 % ) have a favorable view of the un , and 54 % say the same of the eu . 
  i suspect that there 's significant overlap with the crowd that wants nafta destroyed . 
  i mean , the same is true of the un . 
  i 'd like to add that that fucker called while i was in the shower . 
  username checks out !, 
  you might ask why one would think that macron would be balling his female ex-teacher if he 's gay . 
  obviously she was selected simply to give him a non-controversial cover image !, 
   the transalls are ancient , nearly as old as my parents in their early 60s . 
  the [ b-52 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_b-52_stratofortress ) , the us heavy strategic bomber , was produced between 1952 and 1962 , and those planes have been flying in combat ever since , up to this day . 
  the [ kc-130 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_kc-135_stratotanker ) is still the us 's primary tanker for air-to-air refueling , and was produced between 1955 and 1965 . 
  obviously , a lot depends on what component production is like and the particular needs of the aircraft , and i 'm not saying that the transalls make sense , but i would n't rule something out purely because it dates from the 1960s . 
  i do n't really have a great handle on all the implications . 
  on one hand , it might be good politically ( compared to other forms of subsidy ) : * it will not draw lines between eu members . 
  buy europe , not buy france . 
  * while it 's hard to know what this will do in terms of * political * currents ( people may associate government spending with domestic industrial subsidy and job security ) , i suspect that it creates a large financial incentive for privatization . 
  any public transportation provider , electrical utility , etc * must * use only things from companies in europe . 
  any private form of these may use things from any company in the world . 
  that will make private services in a strong position to outcompete public services . 
  i also like the idea that it can probably be rolled back at some point in the future . 
  that being said , it also creates a number of other issues : * it 's not clear to me that this is compatible with ftas that the eu has signed . 
  nafta , for example , * explicitly * prohibits favoritism by any member in public procurement . 
  * i suspect that this will violate [ gpa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agreement_on_government_procurement ) , to which the eu is a member . 
  * it might create routes to corruption . 
  i suspect that it 's easier to craft a purchase requirement that fits a particular company in the eu than one that fits a particular company in the world . 
  * while i 'd like to see a breakdown , my guess is that a significant chunk of government procurement dollars go towards transportation spending . 
  this is probably advantageous to countries or companies in the eu that manufacture trains and the like . 
  * ditto for power production facilities . 
  * not sure how military procurement is normally handled today . 
  it may mean that the eu will effectively commit to sourcing military equipment from manufacturers within the eu . 
  this means , among other things , that it will not be purchasing us-manufactured weapons systems . 
  there may be a solid argument for the eu building its own arms manufacturers , but not gon na lie , hate to see a hard ban . 
  * different cultures do wish people good health at different times . 
  * i do n't know what the succession rule is for france 's presidency , but i suspect it 's set up to put someone very similar in place . 
  * threatening france would be idiotic . 
  russia is n't going to do that unless they 're serious , and the occasion is n't going to be a presidential election . 
  * threatening an assassination would be doubly-stupid . 
  countries mostly do n't go around knocking each other 's leaders off because they know that they 're also vulnerable . 
  if you wanted to assassinate a leader , you 'd be gambling that they do n't know that it was an assassination . 
  russia is overwhelmingly unlikely to threaten an assassination , in * any * situation , including in some hypothetical situation where it did intend to conduct an assassination . 
  there 's nothing here . 
  i mean , not that i have a huge problem with it , but the whole organ donor mess is just because we have n't finished building artificial growth of human organs . 
  i fully expect that to be completed at some point in the future , at which point this shuts down -- organ donation is a stopgap measure . 
  well ... exterminate , no . 
  deport ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union  after the soviet invasion of poland following the corresponding german invasion that marked the start of world war ii in 1939 , the soviet union annexed eastern parts ( known as kresy to the polish ) of the second polish republic . 
  during 1939-1941 1.45 million people inhabiting the region were deported by the soviet regime , of whom 63.1 % were poles , and 7.4 % were jews . 
  [ 18 ] previously it was believed that about 1.0 million polish citizens died at the hands of the soviets , [ 19 ] however recently polish historians , based mostly on queries in soviet archives , estimate the number of deaths at about 350,000 people deported in 1939-1945 . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ] from the newly conquered eastern poland 1.5 million people were deported . 
    the same followed in the baltic republics of latvia , lithuania and estonia ( see soviet deportations from estonia and soviet deportations from lithuania ) . 
  [ 22 ] more than 200,000 people are estimated to have been deported from the baltic in 1940-1953 . 
  in addition , at least 75,000 were sent to the gulag . 
  10 % of the entire adult baltic population was deported or sent to labor camps . 
  [ 23 ] [ 24 ] in 1989 , native latvians represented only 52 % of the population of their own country . 
  in estonia , the figure was 62 % . 
  [ 25 ] in lithuania , the situation was better because the migrants sent to that country actually moved to the former area of eastern prussia ( now kaliningrad ) which , contrary to the original plans , never became part of lithuania . 
  there are lighthouses where that 's necessary -- a rocky point surrounded by water that gets pounded in storms . 
  but given that there are trees there , i doubt that storms actually hit that tower . 
  note that this is * not * any countries making the statement . 
  this is a couple of independent security companies . 
  that does n't mean that they do n't have something valid , but this is not yet on par with a formal assessment by an intelligence agency . 
  france has said nothing officially yet . 
  the problem is that if i go looking for anyone who is willing to commit to an analysis that this is the case , i 'm going to wind up with some people who will support the argument , simply by virtue of talking to a lot of security folks . 
  there may be something real here . 
  but i 'm going to wait for france to take an official position . 
  france has every interest to look into this and every reason to make an official statement if it stands up to their investigation . 
  if it does n't , then they wo n't . 
  if someone does n't like macron 's policies , fine , but not voting for someone because they 've worked for a bank seems inane . 
   our freedom of speech is slowly dying to the globalist agenda speech laws being incompatible across countries and those colliding in the shared space that is the internet has nothing to do with `` globalism '' .
