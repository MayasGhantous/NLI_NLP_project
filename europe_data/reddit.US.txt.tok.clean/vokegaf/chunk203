  well , some of africa and quebec . 
  i think that `` most important language '' did n't necessarily mean thr one used in diplomacy . 
  i do n't think that either of them is a problem . 
  i think that the uk and eu are quite capable of coming to a mutually-advantageous decision with both of them in place . 
  hungary is a surprise . 
   he 's considered too catholic by dutch officials , by the way . 
  drinking wine during meetings and such . 
  this is a catholic thing ? 
  in all fairness , seems unreasonable to ask people not to give their own country ( well , supranational confederation , whatever ) a special status . 
  the us has a no-first-use against non-nuclear states . 
  but honestly , this is just policy statements . 
  if it actually got to the point of an existential fight , i would n't bet on any country not using nuclear weapons . 
  increase salaries ? 
  trump has been mostly running a stock republican set of policies , once he got his supporters to vote him in . 
  i was worried at first too . 
  people not of european descent are n't making people of european descent not have kids . 
  the oddball here is the native french , who are n't having enough children to maintain their population . 
  blaming someone from africa for that seems unreasonable to me . 
  they 're just doing what native french should be doing . 
  if the french leave a population vacuum , even if they do n't care about decline of gdp and stability of the pension system , sooner or later , someone else will come to fill that vacuum . 
  maybe not today , but tomorrow . 
  i remember that article up from a mayor the other day who was penalized for criticizing the baby demographics , saying that the ratio of babies of immigrants in the hospital was high . 
  my mental response was `` he 's shooting the messenger here in demanding that immigrants be thrown out . 
  the only thing that maternity ward visit that showed him birth ratios did was make it plain and clear to him that you are n't sustaining population . 
  an unpleasant truth , perhaps , but hardly the fault of migrants . 
  they 're just showing him a baseline for what 's normal , and he does n't like that . '', 
  hell , if it looks like the us , birth rates among migrants will fall within a couple generations to a low level too . 
  the issue is that society as-structured is a machine that kills off its population . 
  this is per-capita ? 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  the mongols rise again !, 
  he should let regions of france opt in or out of it . 
  suck it , fat , materialistic pacifist zulus , steeped in safety and luxury . 
  when you 're lean and hungry , ascetic again like your british counterparts , * then * you 'll have a civilization for the ages . 
  macron : just not on par with pinochet . 
  pretty hardcore conservative land . 
  congrats , france . 
  not insofar as `` suit '' or `` suite '' go . 
  `` were a suit '' should be `` wear a suit '' , but i assume that that 's not what you 're asking about . 
  `` suite '' is pronounced as `` sweet '' and `` suit '' as `` soot '' . 
  according to the wiktionary link i provided ( and i had not known this prior to this ) , `` strong suit '' comes from `` suit of cards '' . 
   strong suite '' [ strong suit ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strong_suit ) '', 
  no , it 's not . 
  [ european union ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/region/european-union ) : $ 16.315 trillion [ united states ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/region/united-states ) : $ 18.037 trillion, 
  i 'm pretty sure that being murderous and corrupt is not a sign of virtue in russia . 
  if i had to make a bet , i 'd say that : * there 's nothing real and significant there , or ( as people have pointed out ) it would have been released earlier . 
  * macron 's campaign has n't verified anything , but had already produced a plan for any leaks like this coming out within a day or so of the end of the campaign -- to state that there was a mix of true and false ( which * could * be the case ) and just used their pre-planned counter . 
  that 's the only thing they really could do . 
  there would be no other reasonable response . 
  if they * could * have provided an example of a false document , they would have . 
  the us has the largest economy in the world and has only a short sea border with russia . 
  us intelligence has already said that russia was involved . 
  that happened early-on . 
  there would not be evidence produced in many cases , as it 'd tell people how they 're being monitored . 
  the fbi investigation is not for the purposes of determining whether russia was involved . 
  it 's not going to be an issue this time around , i think -- it 'd have to produce too much of a swing . 
  however , if the margin had been smaller , it could have been a real concern . 
  hard to know how things will look next election , or the next . 
  deploy french guiana !, 
  i am pretty sure that there are more-effective counters to things like this than war . 
   there are more chinese that speak english than americans . 
  i am kinda skeptical about this . 
  [ this source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_english-speaking_population ) does not support it . 
  do you have a source that does ? 
   spanish there are a lot of spanish native-language speakers , more than [ any other language except english and chinese ( and that 's merging chinese into one ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers ) . 
  not many speakers in the eu , but massive in latin america . 
  i ca n't remember what the ratio is -- i get portuguese and spanish confused -- but for one ~ 80 % of the speakers are in the americas , and for the other ~ 90 % are in the americas . 
   there are more chinese that speak english than americans . 
  i am kinda skeptical about this . 
  [ this source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_english-speaking_population ) does not support it .

  just `` choose a word '' or `` how do you feel on policy x , policy y , etc '' ? 
  because i think that someone in the us saying that they 're `` left `` is very different from someone in greece saying that they 're `` left '' . 
  given that no poorer countries are on the brink of leaving or unwilling to join ( except turkey ) , but that multiple wealthy countries are unwilling to join ( norway , switzerland ) and the uk left , i 'm guessing that any policy changes intended to maintain eu integrity will tend to be those popular with the electorate in wealthy eu members . 
  the g7 represents economic clout ; the unsc military . 
  * every member on the unsc has nuclear second-strike capability and the ability to clobber most countries in the world even if surprise-attacked . 
  germany does not . 
  * germany has no apparent will to become a comparable military power . 
  if the unsc stopped reflecting ability to project force , it 'd turn into another ignorable league of nations ( and you 'd get a * de-facto * new unsc representing major military powers ) . 
  the unsc represents formalized military clout -- you want the political clout , got ta build the military that represents it . 
  let 's put it this way -- let 's say that all countries in the world want to do something other than one of the unsc members and the unsc member says `` that happens , it means all-out war with me '' . 
  for all existing unsc members , that is a major deterrent for any country on the planet . 
  that is not presently the case for germany . 
  * because ( like the eu ) a veto-based structure means that addition of members significantly-weakens the clout of existing members , it 's likely that all existing members would be opposed . 
  * france may publicly support it for political reasons , but probably would prefer to continue to provide something major of value to germany . 
  that way , either ( a ) france provides something major to germany or ( b ) germany and france union and it becomes a non-issue . 
  from france 's standpoint , germany getting a permanent seat pretty much only makes france 's position worse , since it allows germany to do things that france does not want it to do . 
  * india might be added , depending upon what happens , but barring some major shifts in clout and direction that clout is heading , i 'd be dubious about other additions . 
  the analogy does n't make sense . 
  the uk does n't really gain anything that i can see by leaving early even if the eu were to split up . 
  what are the circumstances you 're predicting that produce this ? 
  this is correct . 
   uk could be soon 6th or 7th largest economy . 
  yeah , but it 's still not a substantial shift in real terms . 
   it does n't really matter anyway , everyone is small after china and the us . 
  there * are * things that happen in the world outside of those two countries . 
  yeah , head-to-head economic clubbing matches with 'em would n't go well , but that leaves a lot of room . 
   they are not in 1890 anymore . 
  second-strike nuclear capability , significant for any country in the world . 
  the only country other than the us than can deploy stealthy aircraft anywhere in the world .
