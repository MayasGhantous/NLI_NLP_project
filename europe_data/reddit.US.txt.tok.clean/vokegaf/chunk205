  edit : well , okay , there is one situation where you might have to `` pay '' : if you just made a ton of money and are about to renounce citizenship to avoid taxes . 
  there are laws where you have to effectively realize gains * before * renouncing citizenship rather than after if you have a ton of stock options . 
  was in response to the comment :  thatcher is n't nearly as unpopular as people who dislike her think she is . 
  i would n't have a problem with the eu having a treaty that defines things to work that way . 
  then it 's the state where the people involved hold citizenship that agrees to it . 
  but if individual states started unilaterally leveraging the power of votes of foreign expats in their country , the way this does , it becomes a lot more-concerning . 
  what if germany says `` no polling allowed on < issue x  that romania is voting on from germany because that issue would violate german laws '' ? 
   [ margaret thatcher : `` the iron lady '' admired by most americans ] ( https://today.yougov.com/news/2013/04/18/margaret-thatcher-iron-lady-admired-most-americans/ )   lady margaret thatcher , the first female prime minister of great britain , and a friend of president ronald reagan , is thought of favorably by most americans . 
  and in the latest economist/yougov poll , conducted after her death , finds that popularity extending across all demographic groups . 
    53 % of the american public views thatcher positively , and just one in five holds a negative view . 
  republicans , perhaps because of her friendship with president reagan , the most popular of recent gop presidents , are overwhelmingly favorable . 
  72 % of republicans are favorable , only 6 % are not . 
  but even democrats have a favorable rating of mrs. thatcher , 43 % to 25 % . 
  men and women hold similar views of the former prime minister . 
  four in ten of those under the age of 30 have no opinion about her ; 83 % of those 65 and older are positive . 
  not mutually-exclusive , mind . 
  this is a difficult problem , and one that has not ( that i 'm aware ) been common . 
  several points : * turkish citizens in the netherlands and germany do , in turkish legal terms , possess the right to vote . 
  normally , voting has been seen as something for the country where citizenship is held 's right to decide . 
  i think that there are severe problems associated with removing rights granted citizens by another country . 
  what if , for example , other eu members were to withhold the right to vote of people in other eu members ? 
  or , worse , did so with an eye to affecting policy ? 
  or turkey tried stripping german citizenship of germans living in turkey ? 
  i do n't like the idea of that at all . 
  * i do see some ways in which particularly multigenerational multiple citizenship might be problematic -- you could have very large diasporas dominating those back home . 
  maybe there 's room for a treaty . 
  still , i see unilateral action to reduce citizenship as more-dangerous than multiple citizenship . 
  * germany and the netherlands do have an accepted solution -- disallow multiple citizenship . 
  a possible modification might be to do so across generations ( e.g. 
  unless someone receiving german citizenship at birth chooses to renounce foreign citizenship at 21 or something , they must give up german citizenship . ), 
  both of these involve only these countries making decisions about their own citizenship . 
  * it would be possible to establish an international treaty on citizenship . 
  signatories might agree to give people the right to renounce citizenship at no cost , and to extend non-resident multiple citizenship no further than two generations without active effort by the person in question to maintain it . 
   a related scenario is heat death , which states that the universe goes to a state of maximum entropy in which everything is evenly distributed and there are no gradients -- which are needed to sustain information processing , one form of which is life . 
  not so amazing now , are you , immortals ?!? 
  i have n't known about it until now !, 
  i dunno whether the typical european resident from somewhere like , i dunno , lithuania , would know about it . 
  but to give you a baseline , the total number of pieces of architectural works in europe that i could recognize and name would probably be , oh : * the [ * arc de triomphe * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arc_de_triomphe ) * [ big ben ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_ben ) * the [ eiffel tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eiffel_tower ) * [ neuschwanstein castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neuschwanstein_castle ) ( probably could n't spell it right ) * [ the colosseum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colosseum ) * [ the parthenon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parthenon ) * [ the claw ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49287.htm ) * [ the leaning tower of pisa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leaning_tower_of_pisa ) * [ * the motherland calls * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_motherland_calls ) * [ 10 downing street ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_downing_street ) i 'm sure that there are some that just do n't come to mind , but i 'd bet that you could probably name and identify at least 50 architectural works in europe with ease -- just pointing out that some people wo n't know about it . 
  no more excuses , italy .

  pizzagate 2.0 fails hard . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultimate_fate_of_the_universe  the big freeze is a scenario under which continued expansion results in a universe that asymptotically approaches absolute zero temperature . 
  [ 10 ] this scenario , in combination with the big rip scenario , is currently gaining ground as the most important hypothesis . 
  [ 11 ] it could , in the absence of dark energy , occur only under a flat or hyperbolic geometry . 
  with a positive cosmological constant , it could also occur in a closed universe . 
  in this scenario , stars are expected to form normally for 10 ^ 12 to 10 ^ 14 ( 1 -- 100 trillion ) years , but eventually the supply of gas needed for star formation will be exhausted . 
  as existing stars run out of fuel and cease to shine , the universe will slowly and inexorably grow darker . 
  eventually black holes will dominate the universe , which themselves will disappear over time as they emit hawking radiation . 
  [ 12 ] over infinite time , there would be a spontaneous entropy decrease by the poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem , thermal fluctuations , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] and the fluctuation theorem . 
  [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   random quantum fluctuations or quantum tunneling could produce another big bang in 10 ^ 10 ^ 10 ^ 56 years . 
  [ 17 ] [ dubious ]   a related scenario is heat death , which states that the universe goes to a state of maximum entropy in which everything is evenly distributed and there are no gradients -- which are needed to sustain information processing , one form of which is life . 
  the heat death scenario is compatible with any of the three spatial models , but requires that the universe reach an eventual temperature minimum . 
  [ 18 ] let 's go with `` many more '' . 
  there are a few exceptions . 
  the us claims the ability to prosecute us citizens for engaging in child sex tourism anywhere in the world , even if they go somewhere where it 's legal , and against us citizens who do n't pay their taxes , regardless of where in the world they are . 
   and while the theory works , in practice it only does for those who have enough money to gamble with . 
  the efficient market modelling the real world effectively does n't rely on anyone having a lot of money . 
  basically , the us has a requirement for visa waivers that include a visa rejection rate below a certain level . 
  it also requires reciprocity -- a country must extend waivers as well to the us for the us to extend waivers . 
  last i looked , poland is fairly-close but still not low enough , romania is not near being low enough , and bulgaria was not near * and * getting worse . 
  currently , all eu members extend visa waivers to the us , but the us does not extend waivers to all eu members . 
  the eu adopted a policy that says that other countries that get waivers to eu members must in turn extend waivers to all eu members . 
  if you take the two policies at face value , the us and the eu should terminate visa waivers to each other . 
  there are probably two concerns from people about the eu not following through and terminating visa waivers : * cuts off the possibility of using other eu waivers to leverage waivers for romania , bulgaria , and poland . 
  * hurts eu credibility -- if the eu says that it will do something but does not follow through , it might make people think that future eu commitments wo n't see follow-through . 
  well , the us probably would care , but not enough to want to start a precedent of countries seeing who could try strong-arming the us on border policy . 
  `` visa '' is a credit card company . 
  you want `` visa '' . 
  real world markets are * approximated * by an efficient market . 
  in the real world , people are n't * perfectly * rational , for example . 
  but as long as the real world is closely-enough modeled by the model , it 's a useful predictive tool . 
  there are no perfect spheres in the real world either . 
  but it 's still useful in physics to model things as spheres , because it produces a simpler problem that provides a good-enough prediction . 
  that 's just how modeling works , and it 's true of any field of science that uses modelling -- nothing unique about economists using efficient markets . 
  also , there are points where it 's * not * a good model , where the error is significant . 
  human preference between choices is not-always transitive , for example . 
  variable-ratio reward schedules should n't have a greater effect than fixed-ratio reward schedules . 
  where that becomes an important factor , people work to produce alternative models that effectively model those scenarios . 
   turns out that it 's possible to bet on bad harvests in brazil , and make millions without even touching a single grain . 
    but some people keep believing that 's for the greater good . 
  sure , and count me among them . 
  if investors predict a bad harvest in brazil , they drive up commodity futures , which make it more-favorable for other farmers to start growing that thing , for prices to rise in advance and cut consumption to deal with limited supply , for businesses to start using alternative inputs . 
  that 's what investors are doing . 
  resource allocation . 
  it 's a plus for the long-term health of the economy , in that people who should have been able to move to london were n't , and this will eliminate barriers that blocked business from functioning , but it 's still going to clobber a lot of people . 
  the ideal would have been to have never let the bubble inflate by just permitting more housing creation back when . 
   the developer , jamm , insists that sales are robust and that `` this is absolutely not a sign of desperation '' . 
  impressively altruistic , then !, 
  it 's meaningless politics , anyway . 
  money is fungible . 
  once upon a time , people said the same about merchants . 
  investors allocate resources where they should most-efficiently go . 
  in all honesty , trump is pretty damn crass . 
  no hard data . 
  i can cherry-pick quotes to create whatever narrative i want . 
  thanks !, 
  i assume that she 's comparing the uk to , say , france in the ez . 
  i do n't think that she 's trying to compare old uk to new uk . 
  i really hope that behind the political front on all this ( `` muh politicians are standing strong for me '' ) , your respective bureaucrats are actually getting things done .
