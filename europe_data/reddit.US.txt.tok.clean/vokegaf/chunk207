  native-born people in lincoln , nebraska , might well be worse-off ( though i 'd also add that * any * large economic change would be exceptionally unlikely to benefit anyone ) . 
   i also have beef with the gouging of h1b 's in the us . 
  i used to be a research scientist but got out because of the flood of chinese immigrants in research who work 12/16 hours a day . 
  i am sorry , but that is just not the american way . 
  intellectual labor does not work well under slave conditions , and it shows in the resulting papers . 
  if there is such a problem , that should be something that the market already takes care of . 
  an employer has every interest in hiring people who act effectively -- they 'd be foolish to get a poor return on their money . 
  now , you could say `` well , employers of h1-bs are making a grave error by hiring them instead of native-born workers !, 
  they 're incorrectly evaluating the costs and benefits ! '', 
  that * could * be the case , but there 's no externality there , not something that requires outside intervention in the case . 
  if they 're wrong , they 're at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that do not hire h1-bs and will go out of business . 
  this is just on-par with every other business decision that a company might make , like advertising in a newspaper or choosing to expand to a new location . 
  it * will * tend to decrease wages of skilled workers in the field in question and thus increase wages in terms of the buying power of workers not in the field in question . 
  naturally skilled workers are unenthusiastic about this in much the same way that a native-born farm worker is unenthusiastic about having an immigrant farm worker competing in his field . 
  the ideal for any worker would be to have a bunch of competition in fields that they are n't in , and none at all in * their * particular field -- then i could get everything else cheaply , and buy more stuff . 
  but i think that if anything , pulling in skilled workers is a particularly-advantageous thing , as it tends to compress the income range of workers in the us ( highly-paid workers tend to make less , low-pay workers tend to make more , and * generally * this is seen as having some benefits ) . 
  [ continued in child comment ], 
   half of my family was destroyed when goodyear tires moved their factories into mexico for slave labor . 
  but it was n't just that part of my family that was destroyed , but the entire community , and for the most part all of lincoln nebraska was devastated . 
  this was thanks due to nafta , a globalist trade policy - that says `` companies should have the right to the cheapest labor , while benefiting from societies whose jobs they export . '', 
  mexico does n't use slave labor . 
  but , okay , let 's take a look . 
  i certainly agree that areas do see decreased economic demand . 
  but this is not new , and it 's part of a continued process that countries have undergone for a long time . 
  most undeveloped economies have many resources in the [ primary sector ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primary_sector_of_the_economy ) . 
  at one point , the us looked like this -- when the country was created , about 70 % of labor was involved in agriculture . 
  over time , countries see agriculture become automated , reducing demand for labor on farms , and move to being an [ industrial society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_society ) . 
  the most resources shift into the [ secondary sector ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secondary_sector_of_the_economy ) -- manufacturing , factories . 
  this process is disruptive . 
  it involves [ urbanization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization ) -- moving the bulk of the population from farmland to cities . 
  people will have farms that go out of business , as they are outcompeted by larger , more-automated-and-efficient farms . 
  small towns and villages in the countryside become ghost towns . 
  some people become poor , others wealthy . 
  social and religious practices developed for small communities do n't really function . 
  the us [ has been seeing this process since it was founded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization_in_the_united_states ) , with much of it happening in the last century . 
  however , despite the fact that there was great disruption , i think that pretty much everyone would recognize that the country is better-off for having made that leap from a primary-sector-centric economy to a secondary-sector-centric economy . 
  we are n't working on small farms any more , and we 're on the whole better-off for it . 
  countries around the world have worked to make that same transition . 
  it required a higher level of education than had been the case , created a new set of challenges to deal with , but the end result is advantageous . 
  after countries make the leap to become secondary-sector centric economies , they tend to make another leap , to be [ tertiary-sector centric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tertiary_sector_of_the_economy ) economies , or service economies . 
  doctors , actors , retail workers , graphic artists , lawyers , engineering , hvac installation . 
  these economies are still better-off . 
  they tend to have an even-more-highly educated and trained population . 
  this * also * creates disruption . 
  i 'd argue that the disruption is not so great as the jump from primary sector-centric economies to secondary sector-centric economies -- people are still living in a similar fashion to the way they were before -- but areas and businesses that were devoted to the secondary sector go into decline , and those devoted to the tertiary sector rise . 
  the rust belt , as well as the area that you apparently live in , are areas heavy in the secondary sector -- they did manufacturing . 
  and those have seen decline , as people have moved away and businesses have shut down . 
  that 's not a bug . 
  those factories were expected to shut down -- with the realization that it would create disruption , but also to produce a more-highly-developed economy . 
  without nafta ( or another fta ) , there are tariffs between countries . 
  this makes it artificially-more-expensive to trade across borders . 
  barriers to trade * can * let some industries exist domestically that would not otherwise exist ( just as they block some industries from existing that would otherwise do so ) , and the goodyear tire factory may well be one . 
  but they do so by making the country worse-off on the net , because they are siphoning money away from would-normally-be-stronger industries and moving it to industries that would n't normally exist ( and that 's zero-sum ) * plus * introducing economic inefficiency , in that you are n't using the most-underused labor or other resources . 
  if that is * not * done , over time , those other strong , healthy industries wind up weakened , and competing poorly against industries overseas . 
  now , it strengthens the country on the net . 
  but that does n't mean that some people and businesses do n't lose out , and others win . 
  it 's great if you 're making a movie that can spread to mexico , or you are making something that can use components made in mexico . 
  it 's not so great if you had been manufacturing something to serve primarily domestic demand . 
  some areas will become poorer , or abandoned , and when that happens , you will wind up with the same sorts of crime issues in that you 're concerned about . 
  that 's true . 
  there 's a conscious decision not to try to freeze population where it is in the country , but to let areas grow and areas shrink . 
  now , that 's an argument for trade . 
  nafta lets goods move cheaply between the us , canada , and mexico . 
  but it does n't permit for illegal immigration . 
  illegal immigration is a separate concern . 
  in practice , illegal immigration is on-the-net economically advantageous to the us . 
  it is also unpopular . 
  what it effectively does is to create a second class citizen who does not receive benefits , something that would be very unlikely to sell well either with people who are opposed to competing with that labor * or * with people who have an ideological attachment to the idea of all citizens being treated equally ... however , because the us provides [ * jus soli * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) immigration policy , it effectively creates an immigration policy where someone 's children can receive citizenship . 
  people who do this do so understanding the tradeoff , and expecting to make it . 
  if [ illegal immigration were legal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c52tlpcvdio ) , that option would not be available for political reasons . 
  again , this makes some people worse-off -- it 's not advantageous for low-skill labor in the us . 
  * but * on the whole , it again makes the us better-off . 
  the idea is that the level of education in the us should steadily rise , and that we should constantly be shifting people out of the kind of low-skill labor that people are doing here -- and [ for the past century , we 've been successful in steadily ramping that up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/educational_attainment_in_the_united_states ) , albeit perhaps not as fast as we 'd like in an ideal world . 
  if education ca n't keep up , some of that can be offset by importing high-skill immigrants , as we do via skilled worker visas ( normally done legally , one of the few ways outside of family reunification to get us citizenship ) . 
  that drives down labor cost of high-skill workers , and thus drives up relative buying power of low-skill workers , and helps to decrease income divide . 
  if one is concerned about an increasing gap , one * can * limit it by pulling in more high-skill workers . 
  i am not entirely-sold on the practice of illegal immigration ... but i also ca n't deny that politically , it permits for a system that is net-advantageous both to the us and to immigrants . 
   all that i ask is that trade be fair to the people , `` fair '' is ill-defined -- what one person would call fair , another would not . 
  to keep active a manufacturing area by restricting access to the domestic market to foreign competitors is to make a different export industry worse-off , as you reduce the buying power of its workers . 
  what claim does that manufacturing area have that the other export industry does not ? 
   and that immigration allow for assimilation - not microcosms that take over and replace the natives . 
  that has been a concern through the history of the us , and it 's never wound up being an issue . 
  across generations , spanish-speakers [ have steadily shifted to english ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/24/a-majority-of-english-speaking-hispanics-in-the-u-s-are-bilingual/ ) , and my expectation and government projections are that that will continue to happen . 
  past immigrants to the us have always blended in , and similar complaints were raised when they showed up -- about the germans , the irish , the italians , the chinese , and so forth . 
  i doubt very much that there will be any great difference this time ` round . 
  certainly immigrants will leave an imprint on the country , just as past generations have -- things have changed from 1776 . 
  but by most standards , the outcome has been pretty good , even after all those waves of immigration , and my expectation is that it will continue to be so . 
  the uk will presumably establish lower tariffs over the long run than the eu will . 
  smuggling * into * the uk probably wo n't be a concern . 
  ehh ... to be fair , the downtown reykjavik bit is not a travel warning . 
   globalists i 'm all for international trade . 
   hungary isnt important at all . 
  even aside from everything else , hungary wields a veto on many issues . 
  i really do not think that having the leadership of eu members using each other as targets is a good idea . 
  orban will surely respond , and just means that you have french and hungarian nationalists snipping back and forth . 
  someone posted an article a while back pointing out that orban only started trying to undercut the eu to try to damage its credibility in hungary after it started trying to politically-pressure him . 
   search and destroy , and body counts , were an integral , official part of us high command 's strategy . 
  body counts were used as a somewhat-dubious pr tactic -- but arguing that someone who was killed was potentially an enemy combatant is different from taking a prisoner and executing or raping them . 
  remember , the helicopter crew that intervened did not do so because they felt that a body count in a report was dubious , but because they saw non-combatants being executed . 
   for abu ghraib , drastic measures including `` advanced interrogation '' were communicated by the us executive branch , as being appropriate and acceptable - look up the john yoo / alberto gonzalez torture memos .
