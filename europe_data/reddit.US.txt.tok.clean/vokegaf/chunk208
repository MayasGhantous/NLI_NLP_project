  but * not * all of what was done . 
  if this had only been , say , sleep deprivation , i doubt that any soldiers in question would have been punished . 
   and the consequences for private ivanovich would most likely be dire if he disobeyed ( but that 's okay , because i hate ivanovich , fuck that guy , seriously . 
  he ate my yoghurt from the break room fridge last week ) . 
  i 'm not asking anyone to love private ivanovich or to hate him . 
  it 's not even that he might be punished . 
  i 'm just saying that most countries do not have an interest in adopting a system where private ivanovich is subject to international law for failing to second-guess his leadership , because that would compromise their own military capabilities . 
   you 're referring to an invasion like that of the russians in ukraine - i 'm talking about the fundamental idea of disobeying individual orders , particularly in the militaries of developed countries with civil societies ( you mentioned germany ) . 
  oh , you 're right , sorry -- i missed where the thread moved over to germany . 
  * foreign affairs * [ thinks that it was mostly a gamble that got into a difficult-to-escape political situation ] ( https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/why-putin-took-crimea ) . 
  i do n't think that those examples are comparable . 
  -- ** my lai ** did the national leadership sign off ? 
  the national leadership probably was unaware of what a particular company was doing . 
  were the actions in violation of that country 's rules or military code ? 
  yes . 
  the soldiers in question were pretty-clearly violating rules that the us had agreed to . 
  was there any argument that the actions had a legitimate , even if extreme military basis ? 
  extremely unlikely . 
  was this something that a soldier in the field could judge ? 
  probably yes ( or at least decide that there was a high-enough likelihood of a violation of rules to intervene ) . 
  -- ** abu ghraib ** did that national leadership sign off ? 
  the national leadership was unaware of what was being done at the prison . 
  were the actions in violation of that country 's rules or military code ? 
  at least some cases were . 
  was there any argument that the actions had a legitimate , even if extreme military basis ? 
  well , sleep deprivation or some other tactics might , as an interrogation tool . 
  but much of this was simply purposeless abuse , of the sort that would not be acceptable in any prison . 
  and if anything , it was counterproductive -- it would produce poor pr . 
  was this something that a soldier in the field could judge ? 
  well , maybe not some elements of interrogation . 
  but some were clearly not acceptable . 
  -- so , how does this compare to ** russia invades ukraine ** ? 
  did the national leadership sign off ? 
  yes . 
  the national leadership was directly involved and made a `` this is what the country is going to do '' call . 
  were the actions in violation of that country 's rules or military code ? 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  was there any argument that the actions had a legitimate , even if extreme military basis ? 
  sure . 
  seizing strategically-useful things in a country is a big part of what armies do . 
  was this something that a soldier in the field could judge ? 
  for all private ivanovich knew , russia was about to be attacked . 
  and his assumption * should * be , where possible , to give the benefit of the doubt to his leadership . 
  -- if russia had a my lai , i 'd hope that they -- same as other countries -- would do something similar . 
  but one ca n't say `` us soldiers acted independently at my lai , so russian soldiers should have deserted when ordered to invade ukraine '' , as the two situations are really not comparable . 
  i do not excuse russian leadership for the decision to occupy parts of ukraine . 
  they are responsible for that . 
  but i do not blame russian soldiers for carrying out the orders that they were given to attack a country -- that 's what soldiers in any country should have done . 
  to ask them to desert would be ask them to second-guess their national leadership , to do so without basis in their country 's rules , to ignore potentially-legitimate military reasons for their orders , and to do something that they did not have enough information to make a clear evaluation on . 
  for countries to adopt a system where private ivanovich was liable would be to make maintaining and using a military impractical . 
  countries simply will not do that ( and before someone says `` yes , they should all do that !, 
  '' , asking them to do so would be a highly-unstable system , where all would be helpless against the first country to establish an army ) . 
  so putin is to blame , and because he is head of government and acts officially , russia receives pain in response . 
  but private ivanovich ... no . 
  no particular blame attaches to him . 
  if he rapes or loots in ukraine , well , that might be a different story , but not simply for invading , as that 's in line with what any military would be expected to do . 
   the treaty is mutually advantageous . 
  you have n't supported that claim in your post . 
  how does the united states ( or china , etc ) benefit from granting the icc jurisdiction ? 
  those countries , including the united states , have no incentive to commit to the icc . 
  if you want a treaty to be successful , it must be mutually-advantageous . 
  i mean , may catered juncker 's dinner . 
  i know that sch\u00e4uble is famously thrifty , but you 'd think that the eu could manage at least sandwiches during negotiations . 
   `` just following orders '' isnt a thing anymore . 
  i would hope that soldiers would refuse to engage in a holocaust part two ( though i 'd add that the same was probably true of many german soldiers in world war ii ) . 
  but that is a high bar to ask -- only in the most-extreme circumstances should or could we ask soldiers to refuse orders . 
  german soldiers were not punished for invading poland , for example , and i do not think that it would be reasonable for them to be punished in the aftermath of the war for doing so , regardless of what legal calls were made on the legitimacy of the invasion . 
  this is within the scope and responsibility of the leadership to make a call , and because we recognize that , we refrain from punishing the soldier for this . 
  nor do i think that refusing military service under the supposition that someone * might * be asked to invade a country is reasonable . 
  russia 's not asking for their soldiers to * en masse * execute russian civilians or ukrainian civilians . 
  they are n't asking them to kill the russian legislature to establish tsar putin i. 
  they 're telling their soldiers to invade ukraine . 
  and that does n't cross the kind of boundary that i 'd expect a soldier to be bound to desert over , where we could expect to make it an international norm that they * should * desert . 
  i do n't agree with russia 's leadership on the decision , but i do n't view that as something one can reasonably hold a soldier to account for . 
  the information and responsibility for all the factors involved is outside the scope of a rifleman on the field . 
  i can reasonably say `` the leadership is always clearly wrong if it tells you to execute your populace '' ; i can not say `` the leadership is always clearly wrong if it tells you to invade a country and a number of countries object to that '' . 
  nah , you cool off the fridge , dump heat to the outside , and then it increases the rate of [ black-body radiation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black-body_radiation ) that earth sends outwards . 
  then you flip off the fridge and let it suck heat away from the rest of earth . 
  you just need the subsidies to be large enough to get a really large , well-insulated fridge . 
   i mean those soldiers were not only willing to become soldiers , they also participated in what is essentially an invasion . 
  neither of those seem very objectionable to me . 
  those alone are n't some sort of objectionable or ideological decisions . 
  you should be able to serve as a soldier , and as such be involved in invasions if the state orders such , without being considered some sort of ideological extremist . 
  the issue is n't one of `` soldier fighting in a conflict '' , but that the russian state was willing to order an invasion of ukraine . 
  would that make it more-acceptable to you ? 
  i remember getting in an argument with a left-wing french guy on here about whether-or-not [ this was okay or not ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqb1-sijexi ) . 
  the level of what the french consider acceptable in terms of attacks by rioters is quite different from what 's considered acceptable over here . 
  i really doubt that this was a high-level decision , that anything above local law enforcement was involved . 
  protesters protest in unrelated parade , get detained . 
  you could probably see something similar happening in plenty of countries . 
  as i understand it , there are three things referenced in the article . 
  * extrajudicial killing of homosexuals in chechnya . 
  in my eyes , that 's objectionable , but the russian federal authorities have no involvement other than in not coming in and blocking it . 
  frankly , if they could push a button to stop it at no cost to themselves , i suspect that they would . 
  * russian `` gay propaganda '' laws . 
  i think that this is stupid , but not all that concerning on its own . 
  the reason it comes up is probably more because support for gay rights has been used in europe as a cultural signal of progressiveness . 
  it 's something like what the [ fez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fez ) was for turkish reformers two centuries ago -- it 's not so much the hat itself that matters insofar as what it signals . 
  both sides have used gay rights as a sort of cultural flag to identify themselves . 
  * gay rights protesters jumping into a parade being detained .
