  this is really a local event , and the only reason this is in the news is probably because of the above two things . 
  oh , come on , dude . 
  he 's 2 % of the us presidencies done under that system . 
  that being said , i do think that there 's some argument for separating state and government . 
  maybe it was a hack for ex-monarchies , but it means that you can have someone who represents the `` spirit '' of the country without having to also swallow their policies ( which many people wo n't agree with ) . 
  a striking contrast between the natural tone of the landscape and the geometric ship . 
  * / r/football : 36,404 subscribers * / r/soccer : 605,202 subscribers the prosecution rests its case . 
  is that logo actually federal tv ? 
  they blurred out the face of the person who did it running away and left everyone else 's faces unblurred , which seems kinda screwed up . 
  if someone threw a bomb at police again today , i 'd be quite happy to see the police shoot back yet again today . 
  we celebrate [ labor day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labor_day ) instead , which predates international workers day . 
  also , according to wikipedia , international workers day was chosen to [ commemorate a labor protest that turned violent in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_workers'_day ) , which does n't seem like something that we should celebrate . 
  yeah , they 're an actual overseas territory . 
  that being said , it 's a military base , which probably has even more restricted access than a country . 
  i suspect that they can work something out . 
  it 's not a federation , not yet , so it 's still a confederation .

  well , there was that one time when everyone else was and we joined in ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polar_bear_expedition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_expeditionary_force_siberia realistically , though , if you had `` rogue soldiers trying to steal a nuclear weapon '' , there 's a vastly better fix : tell whoever 's running the thing . 
  bad precedent to set , though . 
  i 've got plenty of tv shows that i do n't like , but i sure as hell do n't want the government banning them . 
  what happens down the line if banning tv shows has now become acceptable ? 
  kinda kicking turks when they 're down , yes ? 
  yeah , i really think that low education voters being in favor of leave might be because they did n't believe that they could compete effectively in the labor market against people from poorer eu members at their wage level and so hoped to fall back to isolation and trying to pull off what resources they could from the well-to-do in their own country . 
  i think that both blair and clegg made reasonable moves given their positions at the time , and your media really worked them over for it . 
  i think that the issue is n't so much term limits -- though perhaps people would have objected to the avoid-term-limits prime-minister-to-president-and-retain-power switcheroo that putin and erdogan did . 
  it 's that the german state is n't using administrative harassment of rivals , control of media , and violence to keep merkel being re-elected . 
  fair ` nuff -- i 'm not able to find the original source of those requirements , but i 'll give you the surplus violation . 
   politically germany is dominant . 
  so germany is popular , could command the support of the public in many countries , and the leadership of those countries can be influenced by that ? 
  like , this is kinda vague and hand-wavy . 
  i mean , you 've made a pretty strong statement -- `` hegemony over the eu '' means a great deal of power over the eu . 
  i 'm asking , in concrete terms , what you feel this translates to . 
   the same rules that prohibit excessive deficits and excessive debt ratios . 
  well , the two treaties that i linked to above , the stability and growth pact and the fiscal stability treaty , address the government debt limits . 
  neither , as best i can tell , prohibits trade surpluses . 
  can you direct me to the text that you 're thinking of , or at least something discussing how it violates eu rules ? 
   in theory yes , in practice germany holds all the political cards because it 's the strongest economy . 
  i do n't really see how much that provides germany . 
  i mean , eu states have not sanctioned each other ( macron 's statement aside ) . 
  germany could potentially offer money to a state to get it to do something if it really wanted to , and if it offered enough could probably get it to do many things , but that 's nothing relevant to the eu -- any country with a large economy could do that . 
   see how the greeks got fucked in the negotiations into accepting terrible terms that are ruining their country even more because of germany 's insistance on ordoliberalism . 
  that 's not because of german eu control , but because germany was one of several large lenders ( directly or indirectly ) to greece . 
  that is , greece took out a lot of debt that it could n't afford and which it did not use in ways that were useful to greece , and then defaulted . 
  greece would like lenders to write the debt off ; germany wants to get as much of it back as possible . 
  germany 's position of strength here is that it is a creditor , not via eu routes . 
  any country -- the us , china , brazil , you name it -- or bank who was willing to lend a large-enough amount of money to greece could require more-favorable terms if greece wanted debt forgiveness . 
  and germany is not the only country exposed . 
  here 's [ the table of exposure that countries in the ez have to greek debt ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/league-table-of-greek-debt-exposure-2015-7?r=uk&amp;ir=t ) . 
  germany * is * the largest creditor , but france , italy , spain , and other countries also have a large chunk of money on the line . 
  i suspect that germany is the most-willing to be the public face on this in that it is unpopular to be the guy cramming reforms in and germany has a secure political leadership ; in comparison , hollande was very politically-insecure , and would have had limited room to do unpopular things . 
  however , that does n't mean that those creditors do n't feel pretty similarly on the matter . 
  ( i 'd also add that at least the intent of the reforms that have been asked for seem likely to resolve a number of problems in greece . 
  of course , the proof is in the pudding , and we 'll have to see how it all works out , and none of that really matters for your point ; could be that germany would be right or wrong . ), 
  some of those angry young men are wearing blue jeans . 
   the former head of russia 's investigative committee claimed in 2015 that yatsenyuk had fought alongside separatist rebels in 1994 and 1995 , during the first chechen war . 
  hmm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arseniy_yatsenyuk  after yatsenyuk began studying at chernivtsi university in 1992 , he set up a student law firm . 
  [ 29 ] yatsenyuk graduated from the university in 1996 , and later attended the chernivtsi trade-economics institute of the kyiv national trade-economics institute in 2001 . 
  [ 30 ] in addition to holding a law degree and a master 's degree in accounting and auditing , yatsenyuk also earned a ph.d. in economics from the ukrainian academy of banking of the national bank of ukraine . 
  [ 31 ] if he was off fighting in chechnya concurrently with running a student law firm and getting a law degree , and graduating on schedule , that guy is quite the go-getter . 
  hmm . 
  that 's a good question . 
  i do n't know for sure how that works . 
  could be a legit exception ( at least at private colleges ) . 
   it is germany that dictates monetary and financial common policy . 
  i do n't know all of the material involved in eu finances , but the [ stability and growth pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact ) and the [ fiscal stability treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_fiscal_compact ) was created by all eu members combined . 
   no measure can be taken against germany 's will i assume that you 're talking about veto-based votes ? 
  sure , but that 's true of any eu member . 
   and germany is generally immune to the regulations i agree that germany ( as well as some other states ) have violated eu debt requirements . 
  i think that that * probably * means that the eu requirements should be relaxed , but i do n't think that germany is unique here . 
   such as the one prohibiting excessive commercial surplus ) . 
  hmm . 
  you mean a trade surplus ? 
  what eu regulation prohibits a trade surplus ? 
  that 's not what people were saying in march of 1941 !, 
   given their hegemony over the eu specifically what are you claiming when you say `` hegemony over the eu '' ? 
  he was n't really the one that started ... 
   those `` refugees '' are portrayed in press as women and children , the scope of disinformation is shocking for me . 
  i am just against spreading disinformation . 
  fair enough . 
   seriously , what the are you implying in here ? 
  i 'm assuming that the reason you object to primarily-male immigrants is due to competition on the dating market -- i 've seen plenty of people suggest that they 'd be more-amenable to female migrants . 
  my point is that focus on that kinda misses the other side of the coin . 
   it was expected as this kind of experiment has never been done before . 
  not at anything like that kind of scale , but there [ have been confederations before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_confederations ) . 
   as long as the union was weak , they would force their stand on the rest , and do all they could to keep it that way , otherwise they would leave . 
  the problem with this theory is that the british leadership was pushing for remain . 
  it was the british public ( by a small majority ) that supported leaving . 
  the route to referendum was the conservatives making an offer that * probably * would n't have to be fulfilled , and making a promise pre-migrant-crisis , when people were n't as up-in-arms about people coming to the uk . 
  i mean , le pen has a pretty active `` screw you , we 're going to go sit in an isolated corner and keep out low-cost labor from eastern europe '' contingent too ( and melenchon 's got some people along the same lines ) that mirrors ukip , but that 's not the position of the french government . 
  and i am * damn * confident that the public in both countries have labor competition as a primary concern , not geopolitics . 
   now go ahead and call me racist but i think eastern europe in general should have waited to join the union . 
  none of your objections are race-based . 
  why would i ? 
  that being said , i do n't agree with the waiting bit -- i mean , politically it might be more `` comfortable '' for the public of western countries , but it 'd just prolong economic divergence . 
  maybe the entry process should have differed ( focus on shifting industry east rather than shifting workers west ? ), 
  but simply `` i 'll do it tomorrow '' does n't seem like it would help eastern europe or the uk . 
  if you wanted , say , ten years , would things be much different with people wanting to move to the uk ? 
   also this adds tensions with russia ehhh ... but russia also wants control of said countries ? 
  i mean , let 's say that the eu had said `` no , you guys stay over there '' and we 'll let russia whack you around when they want .
