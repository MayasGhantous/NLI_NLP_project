   its not like the us bordered ireland , nevertheless it welcomed the irish during the great famine . 
  well , technically we did n't have federal immigration control during the 1840s and 1850s , when the irish famine happened .

  their presence provoked a strong reaction among certain native-born americans , known as nativists , who denounced the irish for their social behavior , their impact on the economy , and their catholic religion ... nativists launched a sustained attack on irish immigrants because of their catholicism . 
  in 1834 a mob burned down the ursuline convent in charlestown , massachusetts . 
  in 1836 nativists in new york published the awful disclosures of maria monk . 
  an emotionally troubled young woman , monk claimed to have witnessed debauchery and infanticide during her stay in a convent . 
  the book became a huge best-seller .

  [ they ] believed that native-born americans were superior to the newly arrived immigrant groups on the basis that irish and german immigrants tended to be poorer and catholic , which know-nothings took as traits of cultural and economic backwardness . '', 
    `` in national politics , the know-nothing movement reached its climax in 1856 ... 
  the know-nothings demanded an end to pauper and criminal immigration , the repeal of state laws which permitted foreigners to vote before they had completed the naturalization process , and the repeal of congressional land grants to unnaturalized foreigners . 
  they opposed the ` aggressive policy and corrupting tendencies ' of the roman catholic church , favored filling public offices with americans by ` birth , education , and training , ' opposed exclusion of the bible from the public schools , and advocated a 21-year residence requirement for naturalization .

  [ 9 ] enforcement of the page act resulted not only in the reduction of prostitutes but also the `` virtually complete exclusion of chinese women from the united states '' . 
  [ 30 ] in 1882 alone , during the few months before the enactment of the chinese exclusion act of 1882 and the beginning of its enforcement , 39,579 chinese entered the u.s. , and only 136 of them were women . 
  [ 31 ] therefore , chinese were unable to create families within the u.s. [ 31 ] the page act was so successful in preventing chinese women from immigration and consequently keeping the ratio of females to males low that the law `` paradoxically encouraged the very vice it purported to be fighting : prostitution '' . 
  [ 32 ] not until after world war ii was an appropriate gender balance established , because between 1946 and 1952 almost 90 percent of all chinese immigrants were women .

  the flip side , though , is that i 'd guess that people who choose to immigrate to the eu are those most-likely to have learned a foreign language . 
  nigeria has english as an official language . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_nigeria ) that it 's only used much in the urban areas , though , which are about a quarter of the population . 
  and i assume that ukraine is doing okay . 
  well , all eu members , as far as i know , permit for family reunification , and i assume that migrants will eventually bring in spouses or marry someone and bring them back . 
  also , while it cuts the market value for men in europe on the dating scene , it increases the market value for women , so it kinda evens things out .

  well , okay ... you could say that security service companies amount to a replacement for police in some situations , so i guess that one 's a partial substitute for the other , but i think that most people would n't think of having security service companies present as having police be privatized .

  i was n't raising the prospect of extending an fta to the eu , but simply providing a counterexample to your claim that ftas do n't involve finance or services . 
  sure , the eu and the uk * could * create an fta that does n't if they wanted to do that , but the fact that it 's an fta does n't intrinsically mean that services are excluded . 
  well , you 're using a definition of `` free trade deal '' that differs from what countries and economists normally use , then . 
  can you provide some examples of real-world ftas that would meet your definition of fta ? 
  perhaps we will get a `` brexit '' tag in the sub .

   rolls-royce motor is the only british brand worth mentioning and that the eu might miss . 
  well , brands and the location of production do n't have to be the same thing -- i mean , there are a lot of us brands where the bulk of the manufacturing work has been shifted overseas to wherever it makes the most economic sense . 
   how the hell could a free trade deal take more than like a single page , how that even possible ? 
  the free trade deals that i 've seen are hundreds or thousands of pages .

   in other words , she wants a fta or else they 'll go for `` no-deal '' . 
  both the eu and the uk probably want to have an fta ; otherwise , they simply cut off industry from each other . 
  i mean , they probably want different things attached to it ( an obvious question is `` are financial services involved , and if so , on what terms '' ) , but an fta being desirable is one thing that probably should n't be terribly controversial .

  -- neil degrasse tyson, 
  the right for every eu citizen , and of his or her family members , to live , to work or to study in any eu member state is a fundamental aspect of the european union . 
  along with other rights provided under eu law , it has shaped the lives and choices of millions of people . 
  agreeing reciprocal guarantees to safeguard the status and rights derived from eu law at the date of withdrawal of eu and uk citizens , and their families , affected by the united kingdom 's withdrawal from the union will be the first priority for the negotiations . 
  such guarantees must be effective , enforceable , non-discriminatory and comprehensive , including the right to acquire permanent residence after a continuous period of five years of legal residence . 
  citizens should be able to exercise their rights through smooth and simple administrative procedures . 
  this is not clear about what is being asked . 
  if it is temporary or has as its aim simply preventing people from being booted out , i wholeheartedly agree . 
  if it is not , i wholeheartedly disagree . 
  to combine and repost my earlier comments on the point :  the eu has a legit concern here . 
  one possibility would be that the uk , if it gets a super-anti-immigration government starts passing laws that effectively force out guest workers from the eu . 
  just as the uk would n't want spain to do that to its retirees , so the eu would n't want that for people from the eu . 
    that being said , what 's being asked for sounds too expansive . 
  in the past , the uk did extend some special privileges to organizations that they split off from ( overseas dominions and whatnot ) , but i do n't think that they were in perpetuity -- they only lasted one generation from some deadline . 
  i think that bounding those rights might be more-reasonable . 
  while it might make sense for the uk and the eu to set up some sort of visa arrangements , i 'm not sure that betting the entire arrangement on it is a good idea . 
    also , i could see this applying to , say , permanent residency rights . 
  but to all eu rights , even if frozen at the time the uk leaves ? 
  no , that would be like what the uk did to china back in the day , with extraterritorial jurisdiction and special rights for british citizens in china . 
  for example , the eu might decide ( not that this would be contentious in the uk , but as an example ) , that eu citizens are exempt from the death penalty and the uk decide that it wants to impose the death penalty . 
  at that point , the uk would only have the ability to apply the penalty to people who did not hold citizenship in an eu member . 
  i do not think that that is something that a modern-day state would normally accept without coercion . 
    going beyond equal treatment to guaranteeing unequal status to eu citizens in the uk that is advantageous to eu citizens simply does not seem reasonable to me , especially in perpetuity ( `` i maintained polish and british citizenship , like my great-granddad , so you still need to give me special rights x , y , and z that welshmen do n't get '' or `` i 'm a student in the uk , but because i 'm also belgian , you need to grant me special rights '' ) . 
  i can understand a special status during a transition period , but it 's something that 's got ta end at some point .
