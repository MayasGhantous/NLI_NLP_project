  in my eyes , the big concern is `` let 's let people who are in the uk and in the eu know that they are n't going to get booted out at brexit '' . 
  that lets them continue on with their lives . 
  on one hand , that 's pretty bonkers . 
  on the other hand , i feel like any situation in which someone needs to say `` your moon is on fire '' would have enough context to avoid confusion with the other statements . 
  and as such , atypical !, 
  i really hope this kind of flame-fest is n't what we see on this sub for the next two years . 
  it 's really not very interesting as discussion goes . 
   as long as they say `` strong and stable leadership '' over and over , i acknowledge they may well be a shoe in . 
  i 'd give corbyn more credit for that than anything that the conservative party has done . 
   i read parts of that finnish think tank report about leaving the euro , they seemed very worried about capital flight from the leaving nation ... the think tank recommended introducing the new currency by surprise so nobody would have time to flee with their capital , or to impose restrictions on those trying to take capital out of the country . 
  i believe that that 's the norm for currency devaluation . 
  it 's moments of shared culture , a canon of social knowledge , that link together and form a people . 
  hahaha , is that an infrared tricolor flag on his helmet ? 
  the other day , when we were talking about everyone using tricolors , i was thinking `` okay , the us [ uses infrared flags ] ( http://cdn1.evike.com/images/large/tmc1903-dk-2.jpg ) so that people operating with night vision can still identify each other . 
  but ... the us flag shape is pretty unique even without color , and you 'd think that it would n't work with tricolors . '', 
  at the time , i just assumed that countries with tricolors would use a [ war flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_flag ) . 
  but maybe they do n't . 
  if not ... man , a war between tricolor countries would be confusing . 
  i wonder what percentage of their economy that is . 
  might be exceedingly unpopular to limit it in places that have economies that rely upon it , to the point of territories having major problems without some other path forward created for them . 
  looking at wikipedia , the ones that have financial services as significant chunks of their economy : * [ anguilla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anguilla ) : `` anguilla has become a popular tax haven , having no capital gains , estate , profit or other forms of direct taxation on either individuals or corporations ... anguilla 's thin arid soil being largely unsuitable for agriculture , the island has few land-based natural resources . 
  its main industries are tourism , offshore incorporation and management , offshore banking , captive insurance and fishing . '', 
  this one might be trouble . 
  * [ bermuda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bermuda ) : `` bermuda is an offshore financial centre , which results from its minimal standards of business regulation/laws and direct taxation on personal or corporate income . 
  it has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system ... having no corporate income tax , bermuda is a popular tax avoidance location . 
  google , for example , is known to have shifted over $ 10 billion in revenue to its bermuda subsidiary utilising the `` double irish '' and `` dutch sandwich '' tax avoidance strategies , reducing its 2011 tax liability by $ 2 billion . '', 
  * [ british virgin islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_virgin_islands ) : `` as a tax haven with an opaque banking system , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] the british virgin islands enjoys one of the more prosperous economies of the caribbean region , with a per capita average income of around $ 42,300 ( 2010 est. 
  ) ... financial services account for over half of the income of the territory . 
  the majority of this revenue is generated by the licensing of offshore companies and related services . 
  the british virgin islands is a significant global player in the offshore financial services industry . 
  in 2000 kpmg reported in its survey of offshore jurisdictions for the united kingdom government that over 45 % of the world 's offshore companies were formed in the british virgin islands ... in the april 2016 panama papers leak , the british virgin islands was the most commonly used tax haven by clients of mossack fonseca . '', 
  * [ cayman islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cayman_islands ) : `` the territory is often considered a major world offshore financial haven for many wealthy individuals ... the government 's primary source of income is indirect taxation : there is no income tax , capital gains tax , or corporation tax ... the cayman islands are a major international financial centre . 
  the largest sectors are `` banking , hedge fund formation and investment , structured finance and securitisation , captive insurance , and general corporate activities '' ... the cayman islands are the fifth-largest banking centre in the world , [ 54 ] with $ 1.5 trillion in banking liabilities ... since the introduction of the mutual funds law in 1993 , which has been copied by jurisdictions around the world , the cayman islands have grown to be the world 's leading offshore hedge fund jurisdiction ... starting in the mid-late 1990s , offshore financial centres , such as the cayman islands , came under increasing pressure from the oecd for their allegedly harmful tax regimes , where the oecd wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace ... the cayman islands were ranked as the world 's second most significant tax haven on the tax justice network 's `` financial secrecy index '' from 2011 , scoring slightly higher than luxembourg and falling behind only switzerland . 
  [ 65 ] in 2013 , the cayman islands were ranked by the financial secrecy index as the fourth safest tax haven in the world , behind hong kong but ahead of singapore . '', 
  * [ gibraltar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar ) : `` today , gibraltar 's economy is dominated by four main sectors : financial services , online gambling , shipping , and tourism , which includes retail sales to visitors . 
  the two ships had comparable displacement . 
   these would almost certainly offer worse terms than the current economic partnership agreements , could well be !, 
   ... which are more generous than the world trade organisation 's `` most favoured nation '' status arrangement . 
  given that wto rules prohibit offering * less * favorable terms to any individual wto members , this is misleading -- the same would be true of any agreement that the uk signs independently .

   look up how and why we fell . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fall_of_the_western_roman_empire  alexander demandt enumerated 210 different theories on why rome fell , and new ideas have emerged since . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] historians still try to analyze the reasons for loss of political control over a vast territory ( and , as a subsidiary theme , the reasons for the survival of the eastern roman empire ) . 
  well , the idea behind the education is that there 's a positive roi -- that people are producing more than the resources expended on education and the time they spend being educated .

  well , it does make it easier to avoid putting it upside-down , i suppose , but it has one substantial drawback . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distress_signal#inverted_flags  for hundreds of years inverted national flags were commonly used as distress signals . 
  [ 4 ] however , for some countries ' flags it is difficult ( e.g. , spain , south korea , the uk ) or impossible ( e.g. , japan , thailand , israel and denmark ) to determine whether they are inverted . 
  other countries have flags that are inverses of each other ; for example , the polish flag is white on the top half and red on the bottom , while indonesia 's and monaco 's flags are the opposite -- i.e. , top half red , bottom half white . 
  the us flag is easy to see an inversion of , so it 's used with that flag ; people living in countries where an inversion is hard or impossible to see may not be accustomed to the practice . 
  i think that being able to detect an inversion is a useful property for a flag . 
  yes . 
  halal meat is obtained via cutting the throat of an animal with a knife -- that 's what i was getting at in my comment . 
  i really do not think that this is a good idea . 
  as i understand it , it is politically taboo to establish a law prohibiting immigration of immigrants or people from africa or the near east or whatnot . 
  ( also , in the case of refugees , there would need to be eu and refugee convention level changes . ), 
  given that people can not pass such changes , i think that there is a backdoor effort to make the country unwelcoming , to encourage undesirables to simply move on or not enter . 
  this can at least have a fig leaf of unrelated concerns , like animal mistreatment ( bleeding in halal butchery potentially being painful ) or child mistreatment ( genital cutting ) or abuse of women ( hijab-wearing ) . 
  whatever the merits of discouraging muslims from living in a country , i think that if one must do it , it is * vastly * better to pass a law preventing entry than to try to make people unhappy-enough to leave or avoid coming . 
  this is a poor man 's form of ethnic cleansing . 
  the first problem : it promotes the idea that individuals should do whatever is needed to get people to move on . 
  that sort of thing , if it leaves the realm of the state , is not easy to keep under control -- private harassment or violence have few checks on them . 
  certainly jews were subject to it in the run-up to the holocaust . 
  second , it tends to promote an environment of dislike and hate , and on both sides . 
  third , it leaves many people in a difficult place . 
  a child born in france has no say over whether-or-not her parents immigrated to france , and running into difficulties established by society in practicing her religion does not endear her to them . 
  fourth , it does not separate between those-who-have-not-immigrated and those-who-have . 
  treating would-be immigrants in the outside world as not on par with the citizens in your country is at least not producing divisions in the society itself . 
  but harassing muslims who have immigrated breaks down trust and produces anger within society -- and if you choose to be an enemy , well , then people will choose to be an enemy to you . 
  my own take is that if europe is to refuse refugees or immigrants , it would be vastly-better to have a law prohibiting entry in the first place . 
  having laws passed that try to make muslims unhappy is , in my eyes , a very unwise move , and i do not think that these sort of laws should be passed . 
  * bgp is a protocol used by major telco companies to propagate routing information updates . 
  bgp updates can cause traffic destined for one ip address to go somewhere else on the internet . 
  normally , this is useful , but an incorrect change can cause traffic to not reach the computer in question . 
  a bgp change could send traffic that is intended to move from computer a to computer b to actually pass through computer c . in such a situation , it 's rather-like computer c is computer a 's isp -- it can see traffic that it is sending . 
  this does not decrypt any traffic , nor does it let a host cryptographically pretend to be another . 
  so while c could maybe see http requests from a to b , it could not see https requests , which are increasingly-common online . 
  for things like financial transactions , it would be expected for communication to be encrypted . 
  that being said , there 's a lot of software out there that may-not propertly verify that a host is what it claims to be or may communicate over non-encrypted channels . 
  with insecure or buggy software , there might be a way to exploit problems on the client . 
  additionally , it 's possible to block functionality from working . 
  one other risk would be someone being in possession of a widely-used certificate-authority 's signing certificate ( certificate authorities being operated by companies like verisign , who are trusted by software like web browsers to say `` if someone has this secret key , then they really are www.hsbc.com '' ) . 
  if so , they can fake and read encrypted traffic . 
  if someone can intercept and modify traffic ( that is , they are your internet service provider or they have used this sort of bgp attack to route traffic to them ) * and * has such a signing certificate , they can almost-silently read and modify traffic .
