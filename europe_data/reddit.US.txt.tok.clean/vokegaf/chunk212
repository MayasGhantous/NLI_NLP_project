  such an attack happened at one point in the past , when someone illegitimately in possession of [ the dutch certificate authority digitnotar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diginotar ) 's certificate began attacking the email accounts of iranian citizens . 
  anyway , this sort of thing is rather noisy -- bgp updates are visible to many telcos -- so if it was an attack , i doubt that it would have gone unnoticed for long . 
  additionally , there is no guarantee that the company that propagated the bgp update intentionally let it out . 
  someone may have broken into that telco 's systems and tried exploiting them . 
  i do not like le pen at all , but this article 's author is attempting to be misleading to produce a more anti-semitic image of le pen than is the case . 
  there are two incidents being described here . 
  the first is twelve years ago , with a different person being described , who was involved with holocaust denial . 
  the second incident is recent , and involves le pen talking about halal butcher restrictions ; these appear to be targeting islam , but the author notes that they can also affect jews . 
  the title is ambiguously-phrased and the two incidents described in conjunction so it appears that le pen is involved with attempting to target jews at the moment . 
  whether-or-not the halal butcher restriction is reasonable , i do not like this piece -- i do n't think that it 's worthy of an objective discussion . 
  wikipedia has information about most things . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_of_austria https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_austria  the president of austria ( german : \u00d6sterreichischer bundespr\u00e4sident , lit . 
  `` austrian federal president '' ) is the federal head of state of austria . 
  though theoretically entrusted with great power by the constitution of austria , in practice the president acts , for the most part , merely as a ceremonial figurehead who acts mostly on the advice of the chancellor and the cabinet . 
   a peace deal made in a different place than our own country which involves our own country . 
  that 's not actually * that * uncommon . 
  if side a and side b have a fight , having the peace treaty on neutral ground may be a way to help sides save face -- neither side is `` crawling to the other '' . 
  the [ russo-japanese war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-japanese_war ) was ended with the [ treaty of portsmouth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_portsmouth ) , which was negotiated in maine , in the us . 
  on one hand , yes . 
  on the other hand , india today is the result of a [ colossal clusterfuck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partition_of_india ) involving religious relocation , and my understanding of the balkan 's issues is that they 're still substantially along ancient religious ( muslim/catholic/orthodox ) lines . 
  i 'm not sure how much one can hold up india as an example to emulate for them ... 
  this dispute seemed to be about some ethnic albanian getting an influential position , not an anti-corruption protest . 
  well ... the first flag of the united states , used during some of the american revolution , was the [ grand union flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_union_flag ) . 
  this was pretty much identical to the [ then-current corporate flag of the british east india company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_india_company#/media/file:flag_of_the_british_east_india_company_\\ ( 1707 \\ ) . svg ) . 
  hah , that one i know . 
  roman emperor . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_milvian_bridge  according to chroniclers such as eusebius of caesarea and lactantius , the battle marked the beginning of constantine 's conversion to christianity . 
  eusebius of caesarea recounts that constantine and his soldiers had a vision sent by the christian god . 
  this was interpreted as a promise of victory if the sign of the chi-rho , the first two letters of christ 's name in greek , was painted on the soldiers ' shields . 
  the arch of constantine , erected in celebration of the victory , certainly attributes constantine 's success to divine intervention ; however , the monument does not display any overtly christian symbolism . 
  -  lactantius states that , in the night before the battle , constantine was commanded in a dream to `` delineate the heavenly sign on the shields of his soldiers '' ( on the deaths of the persecutors 44.5 ) . 
  he followed the commands of his dream and marked the shields with a sign `` denoting christ '' . 
  lactantius describes that sign as a `` staurogram '' , or a latin cross with its upper end rounded in a p-like fashion . 
  there is no certain evidence that constantine ever used that sign , opposed to the better known chi-rho sign described by eusebius . 
   entirely godless act of aggression by estonian tribes technically [ jumal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jumala ) made them do it . 
   ... eu sanctions against poland , which `` violated all eu rules '' . 
  * all * eu rules ? 
  seriously , though ... man , i know that he 's got political issues to play to , but that ca n't make poles feel really happy . 
  think about people here getting furious about erdogan 's statements about various eu countries over the past month . 
  think it wouldst been better from an eu standpoint not to play off inter-eu differences and leave anyone other than french workers as vague and undefined , as long as he could have gotten the same political effect domestically . 
  not that that is n't a perfectly-appropriate reaction for all occasions , mind . 
  before russia attacked , ukrainians were quite opposed to nato . 
  they wanted eu membership and what that entailed , not nato . 
  now , i can understand an argument that in the long term , that might be bad for russia -- maybe an eu army becomes a concern , say . 
  but nato did not pose any serious threat over ukraine . 
  and the actions that russia took made little sense if that was the real concern -- taking control of just part of ukraine . 
  [ this * foreign affairs * article ] ( https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/why-putin-took-crimea ) makes what i 'd call a pretty good case against the idea that crimea was over nato . 
   de-civilizing never been that comfortable with `` civilized '' since it seems that peoples have a tendency to think of themselves as civilized and other people as barbaric , regardless of who they are . 
  well , russia 's got one big stumbling block . 
  the eu * does * compete for influence with russia in europe . 
  thing is , `` hang out with us , the pay is good and the conditions do n't suck and you can leave if you want '' is considered kosher competition -- and the eu has been successful there , moreso than centuries of attempts at unification by force -- whereas `` how about i take some land from you '' is n't . 
  also , russia 's presently well behind in that ballpark . 
  so telling russia `` how about we play using these rules which are pretty favorable to me '' is probably not gon na sell too well . 
  still , i do n't really see how russia winds up better off the way putin is heading . 
  he might stem population loss if relations are frigid , but it 's not improving russia 's relative position , and that 's where he would want to get . 
  togo-flagged . 
  sounds like it was just in an area that turkey was responsible for . 
   fast forward to 2004 , and the mantle of anti-americanization is appropriately taken up by rammstein , who present a dark and almost dystopian image of globalized americanization , the world saturated by fast food and us television . 
  in a particularly-ironic note , here 's [ footage of rammstein 's * made in germany * north american tour playing * amerika * live in the us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlj6g57xe64 ) ; rammstein 's met with commercial success in the us . 
   in the netherlands , dutch authorities counted paper ballots in a recent election by hand to prevent foreign governments -- and russia in particular -- from manipulating the results through cyberattacks . 
  many of us were arguing to retain paper ballots precisely for rigging concerns . 
  electronic voting does n't offer really valuable new properties and gives up some properties that are really important . 
  ca n't really show that you 're there with a stinger short of shooting the thing , though . 
  and if you 're gon na take down the plane , $ 90k/hour is probably beneath a lot of other concerns . 
  also , while stingers are a threat for low-flying aircraft like attack helicopters , fighter jets can just fly over them if they know that that 's what they 're facing . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fim-92_stinger  effective firing range 5.0 miles ( 8 km ) ( fim-92c stinger-rmp ) [ 1 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_dynamics_f-16_fighting_falcon  service ceiling : 50,000 + ft ( 15,240 + m ) could put non-man-portable sams there , though , true , if your goal was to actually kill the thing . 
  [ indonesia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_indonesia ), 
  the [ tricolor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tricolour_\\ ( flag \\ ) ) was a symbol of republicanism , and i bet they all showed up when the monarchies were falling . 
  the tricolor does have some nice characteristics -- very simple and easy to see at a distance . 
  timeless . 
  not too many colors . 
  but ... some drawbacks too . 
  requires color to be identified . 
  some of them ca n't be inverted . 
  the hell with it . 
  go balls-to-the-wall and just repurpose sweden 's flag for the eu . 
  maybe it 's a blurry flag of [ northern ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_northern_ireland ) , which has a star ? 
  if it 's not , should have both england and northern ireland up ther . 
  i was about to say that normally , even aside from navigation rules , smaller vessels are kinda expected to manuever out of the way of larger , less maneuverable ones , and particularly given that the spy ship presumably had plenty of detection equipment , it 's surprising that it would n't have maneuvered out of the way of a cargo ship :  according to state-backed russian media outlet rt , the 1,560-ton vessel was commissioned in 1970 and is `` mostly unarmed '' but is equipped with a radar system , sonar , and other equipment designed to track ships and submarines . 
  however , it looks like the two are about the same size . 
  looks like [ this ] ( http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:765985/mmsi:671371000/imo:7611547/vessel:youzarsif_h ) is it : 2282 t in displacement . 
  so the ships are actually about the same size . 
    `` a third-party state can not enjoy the same advantages or be better positioned than an eu member state , '' merkel said . 
    merkel is merely stating the obvious . 
  it 's a non-statement -- for politics . 
  not necessarily a bad idea to say it , because there are regrettably a lot of politicians being less-diplomatic , but she did n't say anything interesting in hard terms . 
  obviously countries ( e.g. 
  in an fta with the eu ) can enjoy * some * of the advantages of being an eu member state without joining the eu . 
  it 's equally-obvious that the eu will not extend all such advantages to a non-member . 
  the question is simply where the lines are drawn . 
  it also does n't exist in the us , then , either . 
  because while free speech guarantees are quite strong in the us , and the limitations comparatively-weak , they still are n't absolute . 
   all he did was worry about the existence of his own demographic fine . 
  but * muslims do n't make non-muslim french people not have children * . 
  maybe it was the ratio that made the fact visible to him , because he suddenly had a baseline , but the blame 's still in the wrong place if that 's his concern . 
   on 1 september 2016 , france 's first day back at school , he tweeted that he was witnessing the `` great replacement '' . 
  muslim fairies are not flying into your bedroom at night and rendering you sterile . 
  france has sub-replacement fertility , even * with * muslim immigrants included ( unless the statistics change a whole darn lot in one year ) . 
  if you do n't have children sufficient to sustain the population , you 're have a dwindling population-excluding-immigration , regardless of what some random muslim guy and girl are doing . 
  your population is shrinking * just as quickly * if they have no kids or ten kids .
