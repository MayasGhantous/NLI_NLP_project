  blaming them for having kids after you choose to not have kids seems pretty unreasonable . 
  if the mayor was off saying `` hey , we should change our source of immigration -- we should have more buddhist mongolians , because i do n't much like islamic eritreans '' , i can see running with that argument . 
  probably would need some sort of * reason * for it for it to be very convincing to me , but whatever . 
  if the mayor was saying `` french people need to have more kids '' and was promoting policies to encourage that , hey , i 'm fine with that . 
  but if the mayor is saying `` french people are n't having as many kids as i want ... so we should blame some muslims who are having more '' seems pretty indefensible . 
  well , ignoring the uk for a moment , i would think that the eu * should * have this resolved anyway so that countries understand fully what a50 involves . 
  i mean , post-brexit , a50 is still gon na be there , with undefined behavior otherwise . 
  i mean , i do n't know how much of an issue [ standing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standing_\\ ( law \\ ) ) is in the eu for a challenge like this , but if it could n't make it through british courts , it 's something that is important enough that i think that it 'd make sense to have it resolved for future situations . 
   guys shilling for robots that 's not what `` shilling '' means -- it 's not a synonym for `` advocating for '' . 
  if you `` shill '' for something , you pretend to be an unrelated , disinterested observer who approves of something to make it seem to others that disinterested people are enthusiastic about it . 
  if i 'm the head of pr for nike and put on a disguise and say `` i just heard of nike for the first time yesterday , but when i tried them , i loved the shoes !, 
  '' , you 're shilling . 
  if you 're the head of pr for nike and you just talk about how great nike shoes are , you might be advocating for them , but you 're not shilling . 
   i would really love it if we would try to make single income families possible again . 
  you can do it now , but you sacrifice half your country 's economy , cut your standard of living in half ( well , okay , having someone at home in turn raises standard-of-living in many ways , but i mean in terms of ability to consume goods ) . 
  i dunno whether people want to make that tradeoff -- that 's a really big hit . 
  realistically , commercial child care * should * be cheaper than having every woman caring for her own children , just because of the increased children : carer ratio . 
   i honestly just do n't find the average european family structure to be healthy and it obviously has n't been very conducive to making families doable ( see bithrate decline despite number of children wanted staying consistent ) . 
  there i do n't feel like i can raise much of an argument against you . 
  i do n't know whether a move to dual-income households is a good idea in terms of the social changes it produces . 
  that 's much harder to measure ... and i would say that the effects are pervasive through society and sometimes subtle . 
  i assume that ireland 's high court can choose whether-or-not to hear the case , though , so they 've some agency it the matter being heard . 
  no , i do n't agree there . 
  i mean , it may-or-may-not be interesting from a standpoint of the uk leaving , but it is a major question for the eu -- the fact that it was never defined seems like a significant oversight . 
  a50 might be used or be considered again one day , and leaving important parts of its operation undefined adds risk . 
  someone might try doing a tsipras-style gamble but while in a50 withdrawal , for example , and discover that he ca n't pull out .

  highland clearances ? 
  to be fair , it was via omission , not commission . 
   they should have gone to a neighboring safe country , not europe . 
  `` should '' in what sense ? 
  i mean , the refugee convention permits european countries to penalize people for illegal entry if they do not come directly from an unsafe country , sure . 
  but in practice , eu members do not appear to be enforcing that . 
  and if they are n't , you 'd be a fool to set up shop in < checks map  sudan , ethiopia , or djibouti if you had a shot at getting into europe . 
  also , while it may be okay to penalize them , if ethiopia is not safe , an eu country still can not deport them there . 
  so even if , for example , germany decides to just stuff everyone in a detention center ( which it does n't seem enthusiastic about doing ) , it 's still responsible for them unless they willingly leave , which they are unlikely to do . 
  the thinking was the other way around when it was sold . 
  russia was worried about the canadian threat encroaching . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alaska_purchase  the russians decided that in any future war with britain , their hard-to-defend colony might become a prime target , and would be easily captured . 
  therefore , the russian emperor , alexander ii , decided to sell the territory . 
  perhaps in the hope of starting a bidding war , both the british and the americans were approached . 
  however , the british expressed little interest in buying alaska . 
  in 1859 the russians offered to sell the territory to the united states , hoping that its presence in the region would offset the plans of russia 's greatest regional rival , great britain . 
  liberalism , but with a negative connotation . 
  i do n't see any tariff reduction agreements that are not ftas that the eu has established . 
  are you aware of any ? 
  i mean , i 'm not saying that it 's expensive as fighter jets go ( and maybe they can operate 'em more cheaply than the usaf , i dunno ) , but if they 're just doing a show-the-colors exercise , they could agree to not do them and both go buy a bunch of flags instead . 
  europe has lots of land disputes , but they do n't normally need to have people dicking around with fighters over it . 
  i am not particularly rabid about it , and do not normally read it , and i 've seen material in it that i really disagree with , but it 's had solid content as well . 
  it 's right-wing , american publication , but it 's not , say , a tabloid . 
  it will be looking at the situation from rhe outside in , sure , but i do n't think that inherently makes it less-worth reading than , say , dw on an issue in the uk . 
  it looks like this is a small-government take and saying that neither is particularly small-government . 
  while i agree with the `` france should liberalize '' point , the argument that they 're making seems pretty disingenuous . 
  it runs like this : 1 . 
  voters are not voting for the establishment . 
  therefore , voters want change . 
  liberalization is change and needed . 
  therefore , france should liberalize . 
  however , that 's not really what voters are voting for . 
  or might be what 's * good * for them ( youth unemployment * would * be less ) , but le pen and melenchon are hardly a route to liberalization .

  [ mmmmhmmm ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/22/france-exiting-the-euro-would-be-the-largest-default-in-history-with-serious-contagion-effects.html ) :  this french exit from the euro would also mean the collapse of france 's pension and social security systems , which are mostly invested in sovereign bonds , the destruction of the savings of millions of citizens , and the bankruptcy of thousands of french small companies . 
    let us remember that more than 40 percent of france 's government debt is held by the french savers , pensions and institutions , who would suffer the bulk of the losses from the default . 
  no , there is not an `` orderly exit '' . 
    banks ' outstanding home sovereign and sub-sovereign securities represented 6.4 percent of total assets in the eu , according to standard & poor 's . 
  a credit event of this magnitude , and the subsequent contagion risk throughout the euro zone , would lead french and european banks and smes ( small - to medium-sized businesses ) to collapse . 
   walking into one of the knife boutiques in the french town of thiers was like walking into a watch store in switzerland . 
  there were so many dazzling choices : rare folding knives with real mammoth-tooth handles and hand-forged damascus steel blades that sell for thousands of euros beside handsome pocket knives and hunting knives priced anywhere between $ 50 to $ 500 . 
  i was a kid in a candy store . 
    thiers is widely known among those of us afflicted with chronic knife-geekery as the european capital of fine , locally made folding knives . 
  that 's why i had come . 
  my thing is artisanal pocket knives with a corkscrew . 
  the corkscrew requirement helps restrict my knife-purchasing urges that might otherwise spiral out of control , and makes the knife a more practiced accomplice in my joie de vivre . 
  i never leave home without choosing a knife from my little collection and dropping it in my pocket . 
  and i never miss a chance to use it , even if it means ridiculously cutting the top off a banana . 
    i 'd been drawn to this small auvergne town ( population 11,600 ) by its long history of craftsmanship . 
  knives were being made here at least as far back as the 15th century , and probably as early as the 13th , according to the ancient grindstones found just below town by the durolle river , which powered the mill paddlewheels . 
    and knives have been made here ever since . 
  in fact , the man showing me the knife in his shop , his fingertips cracked and blackened , had made many of them himself . 
    dominique chambriard , wearing a traditional blue workman 's tunic , proudly led me to a version of the area 's iconic knife , ` le thiers ' , which was designed in 1993 , when the confrerie du couteau le thiers ( brotherhood of the thiers knife ) was set up to make a knife distinctive to their town . 
  fifteen local master knife-makers ( including chambriard ) , over a period of months , designed a simple , subtle , organic design for ` le thiers ' , based on ideas from their 16th-century guild forefathers . 
    `` we had two priorities : beautiful , simple design , and excellent function , '' chambriard told me in french . 
    today , the proof of those priorities is evident in the many subtle variations -- perhaps a proportionally longer blade or embellished handle - -- upon the approved graceful design . 
  these fine modern folding knives are assembled usually by one artisan , mostly by hand , using a hammer , metal snips and electric belt grinders and polishers . 
    currently , there are more than 200 coutelleries , family-owned knife workshops , in the brotherhood , including coutellerie robert-david , which has been operating under different family names since 1919 . 
  the shop offers a variety of knives in many styles , including a version of the iconic le thiers . 
    before i arrived in town , i called and asked if i could come to the shop and order a le thiers knife , choosing in person the exact piece of material for the handle , the blade and the folding spring .
