  `` oui , certainement , '' said monsieur st\u00e9phane brossard , a great-grandson of the founder . 
    brossard showed me knife after knife with various handles and blades . 
  did i want a wooden handle ? 
  or maybe animal horn ? 
  bone ? 
  what about the blade ? 
  stainless steel with a satin finish perhaps ? 
  or did i want to splurge on intricately patterned damascus steel ? 
    i finally chose a handle of polished , orange-and-green tinted camel bone and a beautiful damascus steel blade , all for $ 407 . 
  after all , one does not make the pilgrimage to thiers every day . 
    st\u00e9phane renard has been a coutelier ( knife maker ) in thiers for 25 years . 
  i watched as he assembled the six pieces that make up most folding knives : two handle pieces , the backbone of two steel liners , the spring and the blade , plus the additional piece that is obligatoire for me : the corkscrew . 
  during the 90 minutes renard spent assembling , grinding , tapping , polishing and otherwise fine-tuning my knife , he happily answered my questions , clearly delighted to meet the person for whom he was making this fine knife . 
    my beautiful new knife is a classic le thiers . 
  but as steeped in tradition as knife-making is in this town , not every local artisan bows at that altar . 
  roland lannier , who grew up near paris in a family that had nothing to do with knife making , has been a coutelier in thiers since he was an 18-year-old apprentice . 
  later he worked for perceval , a respected thiers atelier , and now makes knives under his own name , which has quickly gained him a following among connoisseurs as kind of a beloved bad boy . 
    lannier got into the trade thanks to his misspent youth in medieval role-playing games while listening to a lot of heavy metal music . 
  his knives are decidedly not traditional le thiers . 
  sharply bevelled handles are cut from colourful resins or old vinyl records layered with anything from tartan designs to album labels . 
    did he ever apply to become a member of the venerable confrerie de couteau de thiers ? 
    `` hell , no ! '' he said in perfect english . 
  one of his most popular knives is named ` why so serious ? ' , a tribute to the late actor heath ledger in his role as the joker in batman . 
    indeed , why so serious ? 
  in thiers knife shops , i often saw customers with furrowed brows , trying to decide which of hundreds of exquisite knives they might choose . 
  of course , i was one of them during three days of window-shopping , drooling , seeing so many beauties i could have happily brought into the family . 
  instead , with a big smile , i bought one stunning knife . 
  which i got to watch being made . 
  just one knife , one le thiers . 
   tons of people have shot air guns , but those are n't really that letal eh . 
  not a typical air gun , maybe . 
  [ here 's a 20mm air rifle using helium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dajz8gydqx8 ) putting out more muzzle energy than a [ nato-standard rifle round of 1325 foot-pounds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muzzle_energy ) . 
   the motorcyclists are n't really willing to change to cars either . 
   i think a centrist two-party system may inherently be what the turks want .

  * hipster * weebos , `` i did it before it was cool '' . 
  well , many do . 
   [ reformism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reformism ) is a political position that posits that gradual changes within existing institutions can eventually change a society 's fundamental aspects , such as its economic system and political structures . 
  within the socialist movement , reformism as a hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to revolutionary socialism , which contends that some form of revolutionary upheaval is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur in society . 
  in contrast , reformism posits that a capitalist economy can be gradually transformed into a qualitatively different socialist system through political and economic reform . 
    reformism is to be distinguished from pragmatic reforms : reformism is the assumption that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the emergence of an entirely different socioeconomic system than the present-day forms of capitalism and democracy , whereas pragmatic reforms represent attempts to safeguard the status quo from fundamental and structural changes . 
  < shrug  hillary wore a hijab . 
  i mean , frankly , refusing to do so seems like a pretty lame move to me -- you 're playing for domestic politics points ( `` you show them muslims ! '' ), 
  and letting it interfere with foreign policy on a visit to a different country with different rules . 
  i expect diplomats visiting the us to follow us rules . 
  why would n't people in other countries expect us diplomats visiting to follow rules in the country that they 're visiting ? 
   one thing is comforting though : if we are heading east , it means we were n't really in the east in the first place . 
  also , if you go far-enough east , you eventually get to japan . 
  that seems like a weird demand . 
  if you 're visiting a country , normally you do n't violate their dress requirements .

  why ? 
  strange thing for the uk to say -- the uk has voluntarily granted independence over the past hundred years to probably more lands than anyone else in human history . 
  i think that in this context , `` socialist '' is a legacy party name from an era of different politics , because they 're clearly talking about center-left parties . 
  they probably mean social democrats , not socialists . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/28/eu-stalls-pledge-independent-checks-car-emissions  but no other action has been taken to fix the millions of excessively polluting vehicles on the continent 's roads , 69 % of which were sold in the uk , germany , france and italy . 
    france is the only one of these countries to support independent emissions tests in meetings of the relevant eu working party , according to t&e . this is about six months old , but at least at that point , germany was n't the only party opposing independent testing . 
  if you have a fptp system , you 're gon na tend towards two major parties , and if either deviates from the center , they 're gon na get hammered . 
  same thing would happen if the tories moved away from the center . 
  and that 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
  that means that you get policies that more-or-less represent what the british people * as a whole * want . 
  if the only thing that you 're interested in is corbyn policies , then there just is n't currently support among the british people for them . 
  maybe you could choose * one * and manage to get a more-centrist candidate to pass it , but i do n't think that corbyn 's entire collection is going to be accepted . 
  actually , the fillon results in the us were n't all that far off those in france .

   the men had denied the charges , saying the woman had given consent to having sex with them . 
  however , the court said the woman had been heavily intoxicated by alcohol and drugs and was in a very vulnerable situation . 
    `` it is not possible for a person in that situation to give consent . 
  they should therefore be held accountable for rape , '' said nils palbrant , chairman of uppsala district court chairman , said . 
  hmm . 
  that sounds like a fairly broad standard for rape . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_in_sweden  the sexual act can be intercourse , but also other sexual acts because of coercion or other circumstances are serious offensive can lead to a person convicted of rape . 
  anyone who exploits someone who is asleep , unconscious , drunk or under the influence of another drug , mentally disturbed , sick or otherwise is in a particularly vulnerable situation , was also convicted of rape . 
  i 'll certainly grant that `` unconscious '' is rape , but i 'm pretty sure that swedes are n't obtaining recorded consent to have sex before throwing down a bunch of alcohol on a date . 
  that sounds rather like a recipe for selective enforcement . 
  britain , if * that 's * what you get by way of newsworthy executive mis-speaking , i would be very happy with it . 
  i * would * point out that that argument is one with a long history of being claimed : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maxim_gun  the maxim gun was first used by britain 's colonial forces in the 1893 -- 1894 first matabele war in rhodesia . 
  during the battle of the shangani , 700 soldiers fought off 5,000 warriors with just four maxim guns . 
  it played an important role in the swift european colonization of africa in the late 19th century . 
  the extreme lethality was employed to devastating effect against obsolete charging tactics , when native opponents could be lured into pitched battles in open terrain . 
  as it was put by hilaire belloc , in the words of the figure `` blood '' in his poem `` the modern traveller '' :    whatever happens , we have got     the maxim gun , and they have not . 
  [ 8 ] we had a similar argument going into vietnam . 
  the soviets had a similar argument going into afghanistan . 
  the french had a similar argument in vietnam . 
  i do n't have my copy of [ * war in the shadows : the guerrilla in history * ] ( https://www.amazon.com/war-shadows-guerrilla-robert-asprey/dp/0595225942 ) , but they 've got a long and extensive history of armies walking into occupations thinking `` i could win any straight-up battle that i get into , so i will win the war '' , and then proceeding to lose the war . 
  the bulk of the weaponry existed in world war ii -- tanks , light armor , aircraft ... though i 'll give you better monitoring tools , that could be important . 
  i 'd be more interested in policing tools like gunshot locators and security cameras than in any major changes in the military , though . 
  the goal of a guerrilla conflict is n't to stand in a line and halt an enemy at the border -- that is the thing that is to be avoided above all . 
  it 's to ensure that any occupation is untenable , to ensure that you alienate rather than befriend the population , and that your support is not accepted .
