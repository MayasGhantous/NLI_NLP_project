  but immediately after the american revolutionary war , if you had asked people , they primarily saw themselves as citizens of their state . 
  that is , it took active effort to establish `` america '' as a cohesive unit and a national identity . 
   not with the current leadership and course . 
  what would be the objections that would block it for you ? 
  specific leadership seems like a pretty ephemeral thing to be a fundamental issue -- tusk and juncker are n't going to be around for all that long . 
  so if i understand correctly , you want to roughly maintain the status quo ? 
  some of the problems are arguably due to not being a federation . 
   every federation in history broke apart germany , the us , canada , and switzerland are all federations . 
  confederations have , i 'd say , [ generally had a rockier history than federations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_confederations ) -- they have n't usually had a lot of staying power . 
  middle point between what and what ? 
  i 've no idea whether you 're talking about completely-dissociated states being at one end and the current eu at the other , or whether you 're talking about the current eu at one end and a single country at the other , or something else . 
  unification to what extent ? 
  you mean to a confederation , like the present eu ? 
  or further ? 
  more to the point ... what is the practical benefit of dividing europe ? 
  i mean , sure , people in the uk are upset about polish labor competition at the moment , and that is at least a pragmatic concern -- `` cash for me '' . 
  but ... that can happen within a country too -- it 's not nationalism . 
  i do n't see many ways that , say , keeping finns from retiring to spain makes spain or finland better off . 
  nobody 's ever gotten to ( or claimed to have reached ) communism , but communists got to a socialist system `` on the way to communism '' and so one expects that communist movements would tend to continue to do this . 
  so , a competitive labour market with romania ? 
  because that 's what they 're objecting to . 
  goddammit , britain . 
  you 're doing this on purpose , are n't you ? 
   also atlantic archipelago sounds ridiculous . 
  but alliterative , and that counts for something !, 
   just as there were sections where the `` line '' was six to ten people deep , there were also undoubtedly many breaks in the chain . 
  however , enough people participated that if an average of all the participants had been taken and spread evenly along the route standing four feet ( 1.2 m ) apart , an unbroken chain across the 48 contiguous states would have been able to be formed . 
  not entirely sure that counts ... good positive movement , though . 
  seems like there 's a lack of 'em in the world . 
  2016 is finally over . 
  because opposing movement within the eu comes with a lot of baggage . 
   lard-munching banderophile nazis `` lard-munching '' ? 
  [ not that much ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_milk_consumption_per_capita ), 
  looks like it was ad-hoc -- that is , there 's no `` gridmap ( ) '' or something like that . 
  because states have political power in the federation . 
  the most-similar language to english is ... afrikaans ? 
  sounds like they 're talking about airlines , not aircraft manufacturers . 
  i 've never seen a visualization of this sort before , but i really like it . 
  i wonder if it 's got a name . 
  actually , france , it 's rising for you . 
  hell , just because someone attends church weekly does n't mean that they 're a christian . 
  got ta have some kinda of approximation based on measurable behavior , though . 
   should a politician , who has been formerly convicted of a crime , be allowed to run for office ? 
    learn more   the u.s. constitution does not prevent convicted felons from holding the office of the president or a seat in the senate or house of representatives . 
  states may prevent convicted felons candidates from holding statewide and local offices . 
  see public opinion that does look rather-suspiciously like the case . 
  not that i 'm gon na complain about us hardware being purchased , since it helps reduce us r&d costs , but the eu as a whole has an economy as large as ours and can support military production . 
  maybe germany alone ca n't , but in coordination ... 
  political affair , i guess . 
   if you actually knew what blitzkrieg was at the time you could easily counter it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blitzkrieg  despite being common in german and english-language journalism during world war ii , the word blitzkrieg was never used by the wehrmacht as an official military term , except for propaganda . 
  [ 9 ] some senior officers , including kurt student , franz halder and johann adolf von kielmansegg , even disputed the idea that it was a military concept . 
  kielmansegg asserted that what many regarded as blitzkrieg was nothing more than `` ad hoc solutions that simply popped out of the prevailing situation '' . 
  student described it as ideas that `` naturally emerged from the existing circumstances '' as a response to operational challenges . 
  [ 11 ] the wehrmacht never officially adopted it as a concept or doctrine . 
  [ a ] in 2005 , the historian karl-heinz frieser summarized blitzkrieg as the result of german commanders using the latest technology in the most beneficial way according to traditional military principles and employing `` the right units in the right place at the right time '' . 
  no military has a 100 % readiness ratio for its equipment -- you 're always doing maintenance of some sort . 
  however , some of the listed items seemed to be at about 25 % readiness , which does n't look so good -- that 's not just ordinary rotation . 
  globalresearch is a pretty poor source . 
  kinda luck of the draw , though . 
  at the time , nobody knew how communism would work out . 
   but saying the ussr did n't succeed the russian empire is like saying the french republic and the kingdom of france are two entirely different entities . 
  we claimed that to avoid paying war debts to france ', 
   thatcher , despite being a horrendous leader , she strengthened the british economy , which had a ton of zombie mines economically-draining it , despite the fact that doing so was very politically unpopular . 
  managing to build political capital and make the country better-off even by doing unpopular things seems like solid leadership . 
   did i mention we are selling hungarian ( and so european ) citizenship to thousands of russians ( and to chinese by the way ) without any background checks ? 
  concern about this sort of thing ( not specific to hungary ) is a major reason why i think that the eu needs , if not a common immigration policy , at least some form of mutual control over immigration . 
  people are , after all , being given access to * all * eu members . 
  the garden shed requires ... * sanctification * . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norse_rituals#human_sacrifice  sagas occasionally mention human sacrifice at temples , as does adam of bremen . 
  -  according to adam , the temple at uppsala was the centre for the national worship of the gods , and every nine years a great festival was held there where the attendance of all inhabitants of the swedish provinces was required , including christians . 
  at these festivals men and male animals were sacrificed by hanging . 
  adam recounts from christian eye-witness accounts that up to 72 corpses could be hanging in the trees next to the temple during these sacrifices . 
  [ falkland islands broadcasting station from when argentina invaded the falkland islands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agx45iq1lp8 ) for a real-world example . 
  wow , the danes are such dicks . 
  iceland announces '' [ we 're gon na build the first heathen temple in a nordic country in almost 1,000 years ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31437973 ) '' , and * sure enough * , denmark says `` oh , i do n't think so ! '', 
  and hurries up and squeezes one in first . 
  clearly , a millennium back , fire codes were not what they are today . 
  many of your compatriots seemed to object . 
  everyone should have stayed in africa !, 
  seriously , though , you do need an eu-wide pension system . 
  not joking . 
  otherwise you 're going to have an utter catastrophe . 
  i wish that the `` eu '' had been called `` europa '' or something that would let it be used in names and distinguished from non-eu european institutions . 
  `` europe '' the continent and `` europe '' for `` european '' is overloaded . 
  hmm . 
  i get why eu treaties are named after the town where they 're done , but ... honestly , i do n't like it much . 
  several reasons : * a town name is n't particularly tied to the thrust of the treaty , so it 's harder to remember what it 's attached to . 
  `` lisbon treaty '' or `` dublin treaty '' or `` schengen treaty '' is n't all that useful . 
  suppose it was `` europa founding treaty '' or `` europa migration treaty '' or `` europa borderless treaty '' . 
  * it * can * occasionally be ambiguous whether the speaker is talking about the town or an area defined by a treaty , like `` i need to enter schengen '' . 
  name areas explicitly . 
  * if you ever have a treaty written in some parts of france , it 's gon na be awful : `` saint-laurent du maronite treaty '' ? 
  too long . 
  czechia switching from `` the czech republic '' was awesome . 
  get the dutch to do the same thing . 
  oh , and while we 're at it , `` dutch '' and `` netherland '' ? 
  totally unrelated . 
  how about `` netherish '' or something ? 
  nobody calls germany anything similar .
