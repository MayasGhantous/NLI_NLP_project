  c'mon , that 's just confusing . 
  it 's not a matter of people being unable to make the right sounds in their language . 
  one more-or-less identical name !, 
  according to wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_law#england_and_wales  the [ sunday trading act 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sunday_trading_act_1994 ) relaxed restrictions on sunday trading . 
  this produced vocal opposition from bodies such as the keep sunday special campaign , and the lord 's day observance society : on religious grounds , on the grounds that it would increase consumerism , and that it would reduce shop assistants ' weekend leisure time . 
    the legislation permits large shops ( those with a relevant floor area in excess of 280 square metres ) to open for up to six hours on sunday between the hours of 10 am and 6 pm . 
  small shops , those with an area of below 280 square metres , are free to set their own sunday trading times . 
  some large shops , such as off-licences , service stations and garages , are exempt from the restrictions . 
    some very large shops ( e.g. 
  department stores ) open for longer than 6 hours on a sunday by allowing customers in to browse 30 minutes prior to allowing them to make a purchase , since the 6 hour restriction only applies to time during which the shop may make sales . 
    christmas day and easter sunday are non-trading days . 
  this applies even to garden centres , which earlier had been trading over easter , but not to small shops ( those with an area of below 280 square metres ) . 
  [ 10 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_law#northern_ireland  shops with a floor area of over 280 square meters may only open from 1 to 6pm on sundays . 
  [ clearly op is korean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue%e2%80%93green_distinction_in_language ) :  many languages do not distinguish between what in english are described as `` blue '' and `` green '' .

  oh , [ nice ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/russia-mp-valery-seleznev-plotted-son-escape-us-custody ) . 
  apparently dad was busy during the justice process :  us prosecutors have alleged that a member of the russian parliament spoke to his son in a secret code over a federal prison telephone as they discussed plans to tamper with a witness , delay the son 's trial and possibly devise an escape . 
  -  in the conversations , the older seleznev referred to people he brought in to help roman in his federal hacking case as `` magicians '' or `` doctors '' who could `` create a miracle called ` the patient got into the hospital in a wrong way , so he needs to be released from the hospital ''' , prosecutors said in a document filed monday . 
  -  in november , the seleznevs began talking about who might appear at the trial , and roman seleznev said : `` did you understand who said bad things about me ? 
  all those lies . '' valery seleznez assured his son that he would `` have a serious talk about it '' . 
    `` something has to be done about it , '' the senior seleznev later said , according to the documents . 
    prosecutors said they have reviewed the recordings and coordinated with law enforcement to ensure the safety of witnesses . 
  not making things any better . 
  the maldives , where he was apparently arrested , were probably not an unintentional choice . 
  they 're one of a few higher-income places in the world that do not have an extradition treaty with the us ( which is probably what his dad is angry about -- presumably his son expected that us law enforcement would n't be able to do anything there ) . 
  however , simply having no extradition treaty does n't mean that it 's impossible to have a government turn someone over . 
  it just means that there 's no pre-arranged system in place for it , and needs to have diplomats work something out . 
  i really do n't see what the big deal is with nuclear waste , as long as it 's undergone [ geomelting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geomelting ) . 
  short of a volcano , it 's not becoming a risk again other than being in close proximity to it , and there are plenty of non-radioactive substances for which that 's true . 
  i 'd add that aside from national security applications , this probably has commercial uses , as in automated trading . 
  that is a huge obligation . 
  it means that most people in greece are primarily operating off a government pension at the moment . 
  they 've got italy . 
  on what issue ? 
  russia does n't consist of two boxes of people , one of which is noble , good , and very much like people in germany and thereabouts and the other of which is awful , criminal , and best buddies with putin . 
  you 're asking for a simple , binary classification of the people in society . 
  think about what you would say if someone asked `` are you a dissident ? '', 
   do you even understand what 30 % reduction of gdp means ? 
  it 's worse than the 30 's in us . 
  and after all that it 's not over . 
  the previous level of economic activity was debt-fueled -- it was n't the norm . 
  now , if the rest of the eu wants to subsidize greece 's standard of living , there might be some argument for that ( though i think that bulgaria and romania probably come earlier in the line ) , but i doubt that they want to maintain the level of activity that was happening . 
  http://www.ekathimerini.com/205692/opinion/ekathimerini/comment/why-pensions-are-the-new-flashpoint-in-greeces-crisis  a recent study found that pensions are the main source of income for 52 percent of all greek households -- up from 40 percent in 2011 . 
  i do n't really understand why the state does n't . 
  the parties that were in power no longer are . 
  presumably syriza does n't have links to the current bureaucracy , so what 's the objection to cutting them off ? 
  i was going to say `` yeah , this really does not seem like an issue to me -- as long as * all * truckers pay more , there 's no pressure on him '' , but to try and consider all angles : * could be that there are other regulations or contracts in place that do not take into account the tax system . 
  * could be that truckers are partly-competing with rail or shipping ( in which case it 's * good * that some go out of business , but still understandable that he 'd object ) . 
  * could be that demand for shipping is pretty elastic and the amount paid drastically reduces how much demand for shipping there is ( which seems unlikely , but who knows ) . 
   sentence of 27 years -  roman valeryevich seleznev , 32 , was convicted in august for stealing credit card data from us restaurants , causing nearly $ 170m ( # 132m ) in damages . 
  -  seleznev made millions by selling the data on the dark web , us officials say . 
  i 'm not particularly seeing ground for objection . 
  his son stole a ton of money and damaged businesses -- he was a major white-collar criminal . 
  he had a trial and pled guilty . 
  he 's got no special status that would excuse him in any way . 
  the sentence will take some time to serve -- it was a federal crime , and [ the federal government does not parole prisoners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_parole_in_the_united_states ) , so he 'll be imprisoned until he 's 59 , unless he dies before then -- but that 's a risk that he chose to take . 
  by committing crimes against companies outside of russia , he meant that he was operating outside of an environment where he might have leveraged political connections to bail himself out . 
  it 's expensive at least in part because it subsidizes the elderly . 
  obamacare has a 6:1 ratio from young to old in prices -- so you 've got an intergenerational wealth transfer . 
  if the young were just mitigating risk ( what insurance really * should * do ) , then , yeah , it 'd be cheaper . 
   lol so much currency manipulation that the euro is worth more than the dollar . 
  the absolute ratio of one currency unit to another is n't interesting -- just the amount of change . 
  japan 's yen in something like 100:1 to the us dollar , but that does n't , by itself , mean that the yen is `` weak '' and the dollar `` strong '' -- if the yen had been 150:1 ten years ago , the yen would be `` strong '' relative to the dollar . 
  all presidents deport people . 
  obama deported people . 
  it 's possible that the bureaucracies are operating , just outside of the high-profile political sphere . 
  look at , say , the ttip negotiations . 
  politics was just a pain in the rear to people doing the negotiation . 
  i 'm assuming that the people involved would rather not having a ton of press blowing for the next two years every time they say something . 
  seriously , though , if they are n't using their degree , it 's super-wasteful . 
  like , if they 've got useful job skills and nobody has made a business that can bridge the language gap , europe 's simply passing up a lot of productive capacity . 
   change nothing but hey he hates russia which makes all the eu federalists his fanboys i think that it 's more that he supports further integration in the eu that makes eu federalists like him . 
  ahhh ... okay , the back pay business in greece suddenly makes more sense then , thanks . 
  when i read stories about people not having been paid in six months , my response was `` are they insane ? 
  i would have quit ages ago , not continued to work and hope for eventual pay . '', 
  buuutt ... if they were operating off-the-books , they would n't have had legal recourse , and the employers might be leveraging back pay to retain the employees . 
  they [ still are ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/15/health/china-beijing-smog-tale-of-two-cities/ ) -- just not in the uk . 
  unless the funds are being used for carbon mitigation ( probably not ) they are n't internalizing the externality . 
  i suspect that this exists for the same reason that [ sin taxes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sin_tax ) like tobacco , alcohol , and gambling tax exist in the us -- it 's a politically-acceptable way to pass a regressive ( because it 's a consumption tax ) tax . 
  preparation for reunification ? 
   the uk even needed help from the us and france to defend this village thirty years ago . 
  the uk had some help , but not in the form of military might , and the fact that it did does n't mean that the uk could n't have handled it single-handedly . 
   without doubt . 
  a pan-european , pro-eu right would be a force to be reckoned with . 
  wo n't work , at least with the current political pressures -- a complaint is the processes leading to economic convergence , like having to compete with eastern european labor . 
  i mean , i guess it will let people work out some aggressions . 
   shitty `` harsher sentencing '' concept of the us that works so great ... you try and murder a cop in the us , you are n't going to be getting another shot at doing so anytime soon . 
  the us does n't really have an issue with employee rights being violated . 
   partially understandable maybe so , but still not very nice . 
  i mean , you want to be pissed at erdogan , fine . 
  but slagging on every turkish dude living in , say , the netherlands for it seems pretty unreasonable . 
  i mean , if i lived in , say , wyoming ( which had a majority vote for trump ) , even if you did n't like trump , i 'd be pretty pissed if you started slagging on wyomingites . 
   frequent stiffing of employees in smaller businesses does turkey not have laws against this , or are they just not enforced ? 
  does n't mean that male immigrants ca n't drive up the fertility rate , if they marry and have more-than-average children . 
  i mean , tfr happens to track women , but every child is a product of both a woman and a man .

  https://www.ft.com/content/cd5d7f46-e77c-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39  when police stormed turkey 's top-selling zaman newspaper last week , global news organisations expressed outrage at what they said was an assault on press freedom . 
    but one english-language outlet took a more cautious view .
