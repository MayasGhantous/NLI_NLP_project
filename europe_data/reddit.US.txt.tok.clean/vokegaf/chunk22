  i 'd also point out that the uk itself has some responsibility here itself -- the british leadership believed that eu membership was advantageous to the uk , but did not successfully sell it to the british public . 
  no , i 'm saying that the uk will be unlikely to try to bring gibraltar 's status into brexit discussions at all . 
  if may wanted to make a gesture towards gibraltar or similar , i 'd think that she 'd visit or something like that , not raise it in the context of brexit discussions . 
  well , fine , but most of those were even earlier -- i mean , i think that the point still stood . 
  let 's imagine a hypothetical world in which immigration were phased in ( which i am comfortable with ) . 
  here are the things that should have happened that did not : * the agreement should be made before the country joins , not fifteen years later . 
  * the agreement must be temporary . 
  even a twenty-year agreement seems long to me , and i 'm not sure that five more years of delay would sell brexiters . 
  * part of this should probably be encouraging economic development in the country that would otherwise be moving -- people are moving to where the economy has demand . 
  i 'm not convinced how much money britons would have been willing to swap for less immigration . 
  at the end of the day , the eu is expecting to see economic convergence . 
  the uk is definitely high compared to the eu-28 as a whole , but there are [ other countries that had a higher percentage of immigrants coming in in 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:immigrants,_2014_%28per_1_000_inhabitants%29_yb16.png ) -- luxembourg , malta , ireland , austria , sweden , denmark , belgium , germany , and cyprus . 
  i think that it 's more than the uk sees -- accurately or not -- a viable * alternative * , using water to limit immigration , whereas for germany , being an island in the middle of europe is just impractical , and that english brings in people from a wider area ( that is , i bet that german-speakers find it easier to move between austria and germany , and that both probably notice immigration between each other less ) . 
  given that writing that would not serve uk interests , i do n't see why . 
  my understanding is that the final vote on this is qmv , though , not veto ? 
  if so , that really changes the math . 
  in a veto-based system , you 've got things like spain deciding that this would be an awesome time to try to move in on gibraltar , and wallonia deciding `` hey , let 's extract something from some random other eu country that cares about trade with the uk '' . 
  why would westminster bring it up ? 
  the only thing that could happen would be spain exerting an increased degree of authority over it . 
  there 's no reason for the uk to want to be the one to bring it into brexit discussion -- it would only hurt the uk . 
  it did not explicitly mention military , though -- it as-easily could refer to intelligence-sharing on terrorism . 
   and allows arbitration in the form of isds . 
  all of the existing eu ftas that i have looked at the text of use isds . 
  [ there are currently a bunch of these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) . 
  isds was brought up as a thing against ttip to sell a public not familiar with trade agreements -- i disagree that it 's a real point of concern . 
  since an eu-uk fta including financial services ( and the financial services that the uk wants to offer ) is something that the uk will very , very badly want and the eu is not particularly harmed by withholding , my guess is that it will very much be part of the negotiations , with the eu using it as a lever to get things it wants from the uk . 
  the eu probably will also not give it away cheaply . 
  * i 'm not familiar with the `` handwritten salutation '' format . 
  * much less-formal than i had expected -- uses `` i '' and acts as a person-to-person rather than organization-to-organization letter . 
  * `` national-self determination '' seems a bit dubious but was qualified with `` as we see it '' . 
  * places focus on future relationship . 
  seems good to me . 
  i like the phrase `` little disruption as possible '' . 
  * the letter states that the uk will be negotiating the post-brexit economic arrangement concurrently with the brexit terms ( which seems reasonable to me -- unless someone on the eu side reasonably expected to cancel brexit , i do n't see an objection ) . 
  * states intention to continue using existing eu law in the uk where possible . 
  not a surprise -- this just made sense . 
  * states that there will be no direct negotiation between the eu and scotland in the negotiations , which is legit . 
  * states intention to devolve more authority to wales , scotland , and northern ireland . 
  this is presumably for domestic consumption , to deal with the snp . 
  ( i should add that i personally think that the uk itself would benefit from being a federation , but that 's its own mess of worms . ), 
  * the uk makes a warning that if no trade agreement is reached , cooperation on crime and terrorism ( which i assume refers to intelligence-sharing ) will also be curtailed . 
  * explicitly says that the uk will not be in the esm . 
  * states intention to , early in the process , resolve the status of citizens of other eu members living in the uk and uk members living elsewhere in the eu . 
  [ i personally agree with this , as i think that it is the most-difficult for people planning their lives . 
  there may be some particular advantage to the uk here in having it resolved early , as the uk has repeatedly brought up getting this done early and the eu as not , but in general it seems to me to be something that should go through early -- business can more-easily adapt to sudden pivots than people trying to figure out what 's happening with their retirement or whether they can buy a house . ], 
  * the uk again repeats that it intends to negotiate an economic arrangement as part of the brexit negotiations . 
  * it is proposed that any changes from the status quo not happen immediately at the completion of brexit , but be phased in with implementation periods . 
  * the uk says that it wants to ensure that there is no hard border between norther ireland and the roi . 
  [ i should add that i 'm cynical here -- for me , it seems that this is not a primary concern , and rather that simply ensuring that the eu would be responsible for imposing any politically-unacceptable-to-ni-and-the-roi harder border be on the shoulders of the eu . 
  the uk has had to ram into this problem extensively and is aware of how awful it is . 
  my guess is that this is one of the bigger levers that the uk has against the eu . ], 
  * the uk explicitly says that it wants an fta with the eu [ no surprise ] negotiated during the brexit negotiations [ no surprise ] . 
  it explicitly intends to get financial services as part of this [ no surprise -- this is part of nafta . 
  my guess is that withholding financial services will be one of the bigger levers that the eu has against the uk . ], 
  * there is discussion of cooperating on regulation going forward . 
  this may mean that the uk will propose joint control of product regulation . 
  [ it is to the uk 's advantage to continue to use eu product standards , as it is already doing so and that is a large market . 
  however , it is disadvantageous to be forced to use them without control over them , since this is a potent tool for future lobbying eu companies to block uk-produced goods . 
  if i were the uk , i would try to gather up other eea countries and as a bloc , require equal authority on product regulation . 
  if i were the eu , i would try to avoid having a bloc of eea members aiming for regulatory authority . ], 
  * no explicit raising of military clout as a bargaining chip . 
  that seems to me likely to be good from a us standpoint -- it 's probably a pain in the ass for the us to have nato members trying to horse-trade on military clout after committing to nato . 
   if a hard brexit is gon na happen ( and the uk says it will ) , then these negotiations for a new fta will only start after brexit . 
  i suspect that `` hard brexit '' is being used loosely here in referring to not being a member of the esm and not permitting freedom of labor . 
  any fta with the eu would presumably be part of the brexit negotiations themselves . 
  there 's no restriction on the uk arranging ahead-of-time to switch over immediately to an fta with other parties at the time that the process completes , and my guess is that they will do that if possible , even if only in the form of some sort of provisional arrangement . 
  the top british non-eu trading partners other than switzerland today all lack an fta but still do trade with the uk already : * united states * china * canada * hong kong * japan those five are [ still only half of the uk-eu trade in pound terms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_united_kingdom ) , but then , they 've also historically had more-restrictive trading terms , and i 'd assume the ratio would shift somewhat . 
  if i had to guess : * the uk will probably lose esm membership . 
  * the uk will very probably retain an fta on goods with the eu without interruption . 
  * the uk may retain some form of fta on financial services with the eu , probably more restrictive than the * status quo * . 
  the us and canada and mexico permit financial services as part of nafta , which is only an fta . 
  i would guess that this will be a point of intensive negotiation in the brexit negotiations . 
  * the uk will probably sign trade agreements as soon as possible after brexit completes with several other countries . 
  they will probably negotiate them -- whether formally or not -- during the brexit process . 
  i 've never heard of an fta done on a provisional basis , but that might even happen . 
  the only reasons the us had for waiting were ( a ) not encouraging brexit and ( b ) the expectation that ttip would go through , and ttip was not accepted , so ... < shrug  . 
  unless there 's a realistic prospect that brexit will be `` canceled '' , which at this point seems unlikely , the article 50 submission probably is the line at which it becomes diplomatically-acceptable to start making arrangements with the uk without giving offense to the eu or encouraging an eu-uk rift . 
  * the uk will probably finish the brexit process still using eu product standards -- just not legally-bound to do so . 
  i do n't know how practical it would be for the uk to agree to continue to use eu product standards on a mandatory basis , but in turn also demand a chair at the table in setting them ( might happen down the road , in conjunction with other eea countries that individually did not have the clout to require that ) . 
  edit : i had n't read may 's letter , and aside from the `` sign ftas as soon as possible with other countries '' point , all of the above were indeed either stated as given or as goals for the uk in the letter she put out . 
  including , i might add , reference to cooperating on product regulation , which was definitely speculation on my part . 
  good job , me !, 
   shaking up the status quo , while planning to run away if it does n't work out ? 
  [ reminds me of the * iron giant * scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/v/tdjkig3oo8w?end=80&amp;autoplay=1 ) . 
  yes . 
  but had the eu permitted immigration restriction , it would have had a number of serious restrictions : * all eu members would have had a veto on this . 
  selling poorer members on the prospect of being rendered second-class citizens would have been a difficult sell . 
  * population movement itself tends to build a common identity . 
  blocking it works in the opposite direction of , say , erasmus . 
  * it sets a bad precedent if the more-core principles of the eu become negotiable , because then it hurts credibility in committing to core principles in the future . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i think that * temporary * immigration restrictions are a good idea , to limit the disruption of members joining -- the eu is joining large , existing populations . 
  but ... putting in place persistent controls just is n't going to happen . 
  the largest group in the uk is polish immigrants , right ? 
  poland joined the eu thirteen years ago . 
  this is n't an immediate shock . 
  if the eu were going to establish an even slower merge ( a twenty-year-long set of brakes seems really excessive to me , but ... ) , it seems to me that that should have been done * before * joining , not after-the-fact . 
  the rate of movement [ had peaked in about 2007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migrations_from_poland_since_eu_accession ) , and in fact , the pressures producing emigration were leveling off :  with better economic conditions and polish salaries at 70 % of the eu average in 2016 , the emigration trend started to decrease in the 2010s and more workforce is needed in the country , so the polish minister of development mateusz morawiecki suggested poles abroad should come back to poland . 
  [ 25 ] that is , this is more-or-less things working the way they had been designed to work . 
  there were not bureaucrats saying `` this did not work the way i had planned '' .
