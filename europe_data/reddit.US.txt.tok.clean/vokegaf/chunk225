  frexit can cause an eu collapse . 
  an eu collapse could have major international effects . 
  i would be very surprised if trump is ideologically-driven in any way . 
  at first , yeah , i was worried when he did n't tone it down after the campaign . 
  but since then he has , and the people who were ( bannon and flynn ) that he brought in got the boot . 
  $ echo zsh is $ ( ( 3/1 .7 ) ) times as good because it understands floating-point zsh is 1.7647058823529411 times as good because it understands floating-point $ - $ echo bash just fails at things like $ ( ( 3/1 .7 ) ) bash : 3/1 .7 : syntax error : invalid arithmetic operator ( error token is '' .7 '' ) $, 
  what is this obsession with world war iii ? 
  i mean , maybe he could ( though it 'd be interesting to sell the secdef on it ) but it 's in the same sort of sense that you could smash your mother in the head with a brick . 
  it 's * possible * , but there 's no particular reason to think that it 'd happen . 
  you oughta hang out with greeks and israelis too . 
  $ delete system 32 zsh : command not found : delete $, 
  [ looks like wikipedia includes them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/populist_party ) !, 
  no , it 's that the rest of the world sees the economic benefits to trading with the rest of the world , and if you do n't do that , you 've ruled out pretty much all countries but north korea . 
  north korea 's just about the only place on the planet that is n't experiencing increasing economic interchange with the rest of the world . 
  that seems extremely unlikely to me . 
  eh , trump came after brexit in the comic . 
  if trump actually implemented what he promised , which seems pretty unlikely at this point , he * might * do a fair amount of economic damage to the us and screw up alliances , but as it is , it does n't look like he 'll do much other than the stock republican stuff . 
  aside from being kinda insulting , he 's not likely to cause all that many changes to the us . 
  it 's also temporary . 
  i 'd rather do four years of trump than do a brexit in terms of impact . 
  i agree that turkey 's got much-more-serious problems , though . 
  `` reply '' , afaict . 
  the us and the eu are n't full free trade zones -- just large parts of free trade zones . 
  it should be comparing the european single market ( eu plus a couple of other countries ) to nafta , though , and currently nafta is larger , so it 's not quite right . 
  `` isolating myself like north korea will permit me to achieve * true * prosperity ! '', 
  nafta is larger than the esm at the moment . 
  the us has primary elections followed by a second , general election . 
  well , / u/cloudbarrage is n't being entirely-honest in that melenchon wants to make ( a ) a set of demands that are unlikely to be accepted , and if they are not , followed by ( b ) starting to ignore the treaties with the other eu members , and ( c ) hold a referendum on leaving the eu -- so he winds up being a risk . 
  well , hollande is at 4 % approval . 
  would hollande beat le pen ? 
  she has a better shot against fillon than anyone else ( still not good ) . 
  however , melenchon and le pen both run the risk of frexit , which filllon and macron will not . 
  so if your main concern is eu integrity ... < shrug  . 
  from the standpoint of an outsider , that 's quite potentially the biggest issue -- i mean , not that it does n't matter to france itself , but frexit could have a major international effect . 
  it 's definitely what bothers me the most . 
  if congress were really worried , they 'd have appointed a [ special prosecutor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_prosecutor ) . 
  oooh , you 've already got a marketing schtick too , i like it . 
  create bot that listens for / r/polandball submissions . 
  use code that identifies objects surrounded by whitespace , and isolates a minimum rectangle containing them . 
  use a fuzzy-image-hashing library like [ this ] ( https://pypi.python.org/pypi/imagehash ) to find any past similar images . 
  set up list of artists who accept commissions in sidebar of / r/polandball who can now actually get business due to all those infringers being out of the picture . 
  take 5 % cut of commissions obtained via sidebar . 
   turkey 's problems are pretty small compared to france 's i doubt it . 
  france 's election may be more-important to the rest of the eu than turkey 's referendum , but i think that turkey 's got more problems to deal with . 
  well , not * anyone * , or the turkish contingent would be damned thin on the ground around here . 
  completely took the joy out of linking to it , too . 
  why ? 
  i could see fantastically unlikely , but impossible ? 
  is n't it a popular vote , with no guarantee on an odd number of votes cast ? 
  i wonder if france 's constitution defines what happens if le pen and melenchon tie in the second round . 
  no , he can not . 
  though he could try [ fdr 's almost-attempted scotus court-packing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judicial_procedures_reform_bill_of_1937 ) and we hit constitutional crisis . 
   the death penalty in the us is horrible . 
  horribly * awesome * . 
  it 's often used with a negative connotation today , but not always -- some parties have intentionally used the term : [ people 's party ( united states ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people's_party_%28united_states%29 ) :  the people 's party , also known as the populist party or the populists , was an agrarian-populist political party in the united states . 
  for a few years , 1892 -- 96 , it played a major role as a left-wing force in american politics . 
  it was merged into the democratic party in 1896 ; a small independent remnant survived until 1908 . 
  it drew support from angry farmers in the west and south and operated on the left-wing of american politics . 
  it was highly critical of capitalism , especially banks and railroads , and allied itself with the labor movement . 
  [ populist party ( united states , 1984 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/populist_party_%28united_states,_1984%29 ) :  the populist party was a political party in the united states between 1984 and 1996 . 
  it was conservative and often white nationalist in its ideology . 
  the party was unrelated to the original american populist party or other american parties that have used the same name . 
  willis carto helped found the populist party , which eventually served as an electoral vehicle for ku klux klan member david duke . 
  as of this writing , the us has a more-even distribution between all four options than any other country that i see up . 
  well , it probably has * some * relevant information as to opinions as countries go , but you 're right that `` users on / r/europe are hardly a representative sample of the population as a whole '' . 
  buuuttt ... it does give information about the / r/europe population , at least . 
  as of this writing , * one * country where the majority opinion -- one user -- is `` i do n't know '' , and that 's the uae . 
  :-) guess the world is an opinionated bunch . 
   at this rate , she will be dating farage by friday . 
  if there 's one thing that gets french nationalists all hot-and-bothered , it 's british nationalists !, 
  weeeell , so is nigel farage . 
   i do n't know what it is with so many people longing for `` strong leaders '' at the moment , which is such an undemocratic craving in my eyes . 
  `` we 're being held back because the leader is failing to use all the powers at his disposal or others are preventing him from doing so . '', 
  oh , damn , you 're right . 
  whew , that makes way more sense . 
  i thought that it was gdp per capita as a result of gdp-per-capita at an earlier time -- but it 's of the average . 
  disregard the above !, 
  i mean , there 's got ta be a way to do this automatically in r or something , though , and i would n't think that it 'd be hard to see on a choropleth map . 
  that 's a characteristic of it in english as well ; pulling in more :  political parties and politicians often use the terms populist and populism as pejoratives against their opponents . 
  such a view sees populism as demagogy , merely appearing to empathize with the public through rhetoric or unrealistic proposals in order to increase appeal across the political spectrum . 
  [ 2 ] but fox does n't conform to that . 
  it uses rhetoric ( e.g. 
  you might see a headline like `` is obama going to make guns illegal ? '', 
  -- no , but now the idea is planted ) , but you really ca n't simply reduce populism to simply rhetoric . 
  look at the [ news on fox news ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/ ) . 
  they 're highlighting a bad black actor , saying nice things about republicans , talking about cracking down on gangs , talking about negative stuff associated with mexico , representing russia as an anti-us aggressor , talking about issues among military vets , arguing some academic-freedom case , and talking about how un forces sexually-abused children . 
  there 's certainly right-wing stuff in there -- nationalist and race-baiting , some militarism . 
  but it 's not particularly populist . 
  if you look at , say , alex jones , he 's a great example of populism and always has been . 
  fox news ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/populism  populism is a political doctrine that proposes that the common people are exploited by a privileged elite , and which seeks to resolve this . 
  the underlying ideology of populists can be left , right , or center . 
  its goal is uniting the uncorrupt and the unsophisticated `` little man '' against the corrupt dominant elites ( usually established politicians ) and their camp of followers ( usually the rich and influential ) . 
  it is guided by the belief that political and social goals are best achieved by the direct actions of the masses . 
  although it chiefly comes into being where mainstream political institutions are perceived to have failed to deliver , there is no identifiable economic or social set of conditions that give rise to it , and it is not confined to any particular social class . 
  [ 1 ] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/populism  ( philosophy ) a political doctrine or philosophy that proposes that the rights and powers of ordinary people are exploited by a privileged elite , and supports their struggle to overcome this . 
    ( derogatory ) the practice of appealing to the interests of the common people . 
  the characteristics you listed are not what defines populism .
