  you claimed that they were american , which is what i 'm calling you on . 
  * moas : italian * medecins sans frontieres : french * jugend rettet : german * save the children : british * proactiva open arms : spanish * sea-watch : german * sea eye : german * life | boat : german not one ngo listed is american . 
  `` american '' ? 
  why exactly do you describe it as populist ? 
  for a given poll , but multiple polls concurring make it less likely . 
  `` american ships '' ? 
  `` resources start depleting '' sounds pretty vague . 
  there [ is n't a fixed amount of work ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lump_of_labour_fallacy ) . 
  automation might improve productivity , but people generate demand . 
  taking people away decreases labor , but also demand . 
   their trade is only dying because chinese factories ( which are much less safe and much more polluting ) offer a lower price . 
  sure . 
  but there 's nothing wrong with that -- if china offers a great deal for little , it 's something that the us should take . 
  if china undervalues their work safety -- and i am not sure that they are , as their priorities will differ -- it 's hurting china but simply giving the us wealth . 
   would n't it be better to stop them long before they reached calais ? 
  possibly , but the point still stands . 
   whether it is more beneficial to other members is irrelevant to that conversation i mean whether the uk should join in terms of its own interests -- it might or might not be in uk interests , and i wanted to make it clear that i was n't making a claim about that . 
  i was simply saying that it it was less favorable for the uk to be in schengen than it would be favorable for austria to be in schengen . 
  fox news is n't populist , and by us standards ( we do n't use the terms center or far , but in terms of where it is relative to the center ) , it 's center-right . 
  not really . 
   why is losing that control such a bad thing ? 
  because it 's easier to get undesireables into the mainland eu than into the uk . 
  calais is a pretty obvious example . 
  lose the control and you get the undesirables . 
   it seems to me that it is much more effective to do things together rather than trying to do it on your own . 
  that may be true . 
  i am not arguing that the uk should or should not join schengen , that it is or is not a net benefit . 
  i am saying that the benefits are smaller and the drawbacks larger than for austria . 
  unless and until it 's argued that trump actually broke laws , he 's not going to be impeached , dude . 
  same reason the us is n't extraditing gulen to erdogan without erdogan showing that gulen committed crimes . 
  associating with people linked to russia is not a crime . 
  japan is not a nato member , though it is in an unrelated military alliance with the us . 
   this nato myth is just a recruitment tool of the us . 
  apparently stalin was a recruitment tool , too !, 
  well , the cold war kinda put west berlin in a crummy situation . 
  need to just composite nuts2 with available nuts3 data . 
  that 's economic * divergence * . 
  the uk currently has major natural borders , which means that it is far more practical to control population movement in and out of the uk than it would be austria . 
  the uk entering schengen sacrifices that control . 
  austria had limited control over borders -- they can make it slightly-more inconvenient to violate a border , but not that much more , so entering schengen gives up little . 
  for the same reason , the benefits are smaller . 
  people may very well engage in a daily commute across the austrian border , or regularly shop across it . 
  it 's easy and so being blocked from doing so is a big inconvenience for legitimate border-crossers . 
  fewer people are likely to do the same out of the uk , so the benefit is smaller . 
  same would apply to , oh , french guiana . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quran_desecration there is a prohibition in islam over desecration of the koran . 
  christianity does not have a similar prohibition . 
  christians are n't going to care . 
  i fail to see what this proves . 
  i would love to know whether corbyn supporters in the labour party are still waiting for the uk to awaken to the left with a bold new movement or if they 're simply unwilling to give up the podium now that they have it , given their unlikelihood of getting it again . 
  i mean , clearly the left could get * some * of what they want under a centrist leader , but by playing hardball and telling the center-left `` my way or the highway '' , they lose everything . 
  also , ld can take tory voters too , not just labour . 
  ireland ? 
  hmm . 
  i was using `` you '' for the eu ... but i bet that given the context of the thread , you were meaning uk ? 
   right wing populist like farage , erdogan , orban , le pen , trump nah . 
  trump is nothing compared to us nativism in , say , the 1870s . 
   in short , we 're not america or new zealand . 
  these are just a bunch of mostly transplanted europeans . 
  there 's nothing in the air or water . 
  i guess that they were people who chose to leave ( albeit sometimes under severe pressure ) . 
  maybe the selection there has some potential for filtering . 
   solution is to drastically decrease immigration . 
  then your population collapses . 
  schengen would provide fewer benefits and have more costs to the uk than to , say , austria . 
  clearly too straightforward and simple to be the real reason . 
  they 're not mutually-exclusive . 
  well , the liberal democrats * did * manage to get a referendum , but not get the public to vote for it ... 
  [ for those not familiar with the quote ] ( http://www.snopes.com/quotes/goering.asp ) . 
   without a strong opposition the ruling party is free to follow more risky policies as it wo n't impact their votes as much . 
  it 's not fptp that produced the current ineffective labour party . 
  it happened because of a change in internal party rules . 
   fptp creates a more polarised climate < shrug  it tends to create parties with policies that differ very little . 
  i suppose that there 's a lot of arguing about which is best , if that 's what you mean . 
   you guys i 'm american . 
   europe would be better off broken up . 
  doubtful , since as a union it can leverage economy of scale in markets . 
   unless you guys buck up and redistribute wealth to the east which is happening , albeit more-slowly than some might like ... and labor moving to the west is part of the convergence process . 
  i was gon na say `` the hell ... it 's got no windows '' . 
  apparently , however , that 's canvas on the outside , so light gets in and out . 
  dunno , just had n't ever thought about it . 
  no , no -- what i mean is that when describing things as an architectural style , the style simply being a result of functional requirements is okay . 
  an absence of decoration can define an architectural style . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/architectural_style  an architectural style is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable or historically identifiable . 
  a style may include such elements as form , method of construction , building materials , and regional character . 
  like , if what i have to build with is [ dry stone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dry_stone ) , the way the british often historically did , and i build unadorned buildings and stone walls from it , it does n't mean that it 's not architectural style . 
  [ here 's housing in new mexico ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lmh-19qybdg/tshstg9y_qi/aaaaaaaabm4/ibpk2348y1c/s1600/pueblo+house.jpg ) constructed in the same way that pueblo indians built their housing . 
  it looks the way it does because it uses the clay that 's available , does n't need to deal with rain or snow , benefits from providing shade and a lot of thermal mass ( it gets hot in the desert in day , cold at night ) , and so forth . 
  it 's pretty purely-functional , but it 's an architectural style . 
  here 's [ ashdod ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/ashdod_2005%2c_rooftop_view_p2.jpg/1280px-ashdod_2005%2c_rooftop_view_p2.jpg ) , in israel . 
  the roof on these is typically open and flat , so that people can go up top to get some air in the hot climate -- more space-friendly . 
  would n't work in a snowy climate , where the thing would n't shed snow and would collapse . 
  it 's light-colored to avoid heating up , and probably not pure white to avoid being blinding . 
  the style is n't really decorative . 
  i dunno if anyone 's named it , though it looks something like [ bauhaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bauhaus#architectural_output ) to me . 
  but you would n't say that they do n't have an architectural style just because the style is heavily functional .
