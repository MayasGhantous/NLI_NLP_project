  that does n't mean that the letters are not legitimate , but rather that i do find plausible an argument that they are not . 
  afaict , there 's nothing been released by the police , so it 's really all pure speculation -- probably nothing of real value . 
  the one thing that we do know is that the guy arrested with isis ties was n't responsible .

  i would n't give this a lot of credence .

  also clearly speculation and probably anonymous . 
  i would n't put a lot of credence in that either . 
  i suspect that it 's going to be a while until anything official comes out , and based on past terrorist incidents , there 's probably going to be a lot of wildly-wrong speculation . 
  as for who would benefit ... well , terrorists , obviously ( though this is non-suicidal or at least without a lot of personal risk , unlike most previous attacks ) . 
  anyone who wants to affect elections ( possibly not even german elections ) towards the far-right . 
  anyone who wants to promote violence or pressure against migrants . 
  no real meat to work with yet . 
  normally , my understanding is that modern law enforcement is good about tracing the origins of explosive material from precise residue and tracing the origins of bomb components , so i 'd guess that that will probably be high on the list of things that the investigators look into . 
  ditto with the letters -- searching for any dna traces , [ printer identifiers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/printer_steganography ) , possibly paper source ... tracing printed paper is well-understood too . 
  security footage from security cameras on stores surrounding the area may still exist and have recorded the perpetrator who planted them . 
  if the person had a cell phone on , it may narrow the pool of people in the area . 
  i 'd guess that police will be exploring at least those options . 
  the business of any business is making money , and altruism is n't part of it . 
  you could say the same thing of the guitar store on the corner .

  i do n't hear the same complaints about , say , deutsche bank ( which has certainly been quite naughty on many accounts in the past few years ) or warren buffet . 
  this is from yesterday , pre-referendum .

  all we have on offer is donald trump in a flying squirrel suit . 
   what 's his endgame ? 
  winning the referendum . 
  this was from yesterday . 
  seems legit . 
  and yet , columbus never stopped searching for a passage , till the day he died . 
  the british public do n't seem to object to a constitution-less uk , though . 
  the hell is with you people and rothschild ? 
  i disagree . 
  posting something indicates that people may find it interesting . 
  based on the voting , they do . 
  people who voted trump in the general election are plain old republican voters who do the same thing as always and vote republican . 
  i 'd add that negative campaigning was prevalent on both sides . 
  if you have two viable candidates , negative campaigning makes much more sense . 
  when israel produces a comedian of comparable popularity , let 's talk . 
  his policy in practice represents a threat to the eu 's integrity . 
  being `` anti-eu '' is probably a good-enough short summary from the standpoint of what outsiders care about . 
   seriously , snails can be found in a lot of brasseries anywhere in paris til that brasserie / = brassiere . 
  if you liked melenchon , you would not have liked anything that a us show would have said about him . 
  yes , there 's the same acid present in hershey 's . 
  but the point is that phrasing it in such a way as i did is probably a stronger statement to an american than a frenchman . 
  if i think that french cheese is bad and ( politely ) informing a frenchman cheesemaker of the fact , i 'd be more likely to say `` i 'm not really into french cheese . 
  the flavor just reminds me too much of mold '' , so that the statement is about my mind ( converting a statement to being a criticism of my opinion is a good tactic ) and indirect and using less-emotion-laden words . 
  saying `` your cheese is disgusting and tastes like mold '' would be more like `` your cheese is bad and i 'm trying to pick a fight '' . 
  it 's different when the criticized party is n't present , maybe , but there is an expectation to not give offense directly to someone . 
  i suspect that the brits use even softer forms . 
  edit : i recall reading that de gaulle came away from military conferences in world war ii feeling that americans were dishonest , and that american generals came away feeling that de gaulle was wildly arrogant . 
  we do n't have transcripts , but i suspect that this was the same mechanism in action -- de gaulle would criticize something directly in a way that would only be something that in the us a subordinate * might * be expected to accept from a superior , and the american general would feel profoundly insulted . 
  then the american general would disagree with a proposal of de gaulle 's , but in a very soft form , since he is speaking to de gaulle and in front of others , so as not to show disrespect . 
  de gaulle would brush off the soft comment , then hear his proposal being criticized in much harsher terms to someone else and become convinced that the americans were trying to undermine him . 
  translation is hard ...

  [ dangerous medicines : unproven aids cures and counterfeit antiretroviral drugs ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2291042/ )  on february 11 , 2007 , the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad , announced a series of technological and medical breakthroughs and asserted the country 's nuclear `` rights '' . 
  within this highly politicized announcement , president ahmadinejad announced a new treatment for aids [ 25 ] . 
  the treatment , an herbal medicine made from seven `` completely native '' iranian herbs , was named imod , an abbreviation for `` immuno-modulator drug '' , and developed by a russian scientist and tested by the iranian research center for hiv/aids . 
  the center 's english language website does not directly state that the herbal remedy is a ` cure ' but suggests that imod could be used as a `` therapeutic vaccine '' and as the `` first choice '' for treatment in resource constrained developing countries [ 17 ] . 
  at the announcement ceremony , iran 's top aids expert and head of the research center , minoo mohraz , stated that , `` a medicine that is used for curing aids [ emphasis added ] , should be completely secure and reliable '' , and stated that this is true in the new medicine [ 15 ] . 
  -  south africa : in early 1997 , the minister of health , nkosazana dlamini-zuma , met with two university of pretoria scientists promoting ` virodene ' a drug composed of the toxic industrial solvent dimethylformamide as a ` cure ' for aids [ 27 ] ... a major obstacle to the further promotion of the ` cure ' was the refusal by the government 's independent medicines control council ( mcc ) to provide permission for the continuation of the clinical trial , due to the known toxicity and lack of effectiveness of dimethylformamide . 
  eventually the minister of health was able to replace key mcc members [ 27 ] , however official approval was still not provided . 
  nonetheless , the researchers continued , without ethical approval , to test the drug in south africa [ 6 ] and tanzania ... both mbeki and his two health ministers have referred to art as ` toxic ' and promoted alternatives to art , including garlic , olive oil , beetroot and lemon . 
  -  south africa : the minister of health also promoted an herbal treatment developed by a dutch nurse composed of african potato extract , olive green leaf extract , and grapefruit seed extract called ` africa 's solution ' . 
  tshabalala-msimang invited the remedy 's developer to address provincial health ministers and arranged for the provision of the solution to aids patients in government hospitals and clinics [ 31 ] . 
  allegedly , the solution was given to over 40,000 people , but the records were destroyed when a burglar urinated on them [ 32 ] .

  well , i do n't know how british law works here , but i do n't much like the prospect . 
  * i do n't know what british law is on stripping citizenship , but in the us , after some legal wrangling , courts eventually decided that this is something that should essentially never happen without someone voluntarily surrendering citizenship ( even serving in another country 's military or so forth ) . 
  i know that the prospect of stripping citizenship this is a hot topic in / r/europe right now . 
  i think that i agree on the `` citizenship should not be stripped '' point . 
  there is too much potential for abuse in stripping citizenship ( i.e. 
  one can strip citizenship to remove legal protections and then do something else unpleasant to a person ) and it seems rare that there 's much benefit . 
  i also think that it decreases the value of a citizenship if one can no longer rely on keeping it -- certainly most citizens of a country do n't want to decrease the safety of their citizenship . 
  * syria is not directly in conflict with the uk and i suspect that there 's no british restriction on supporting a country that is not an enemy . 
  * as far as i can understand it , the extent of her support is speech . 
  starting a precedent of punishing someone for speech , especially political speech , is something that i 'm not enthusiastic about . 
  * this is doubly so for the prospect of stripping citizenship . 
  stripping citizenship is one of the most-extreme things that a country could do . 
  doing so for nothing other than speech seems like a really bad idea to me .
