  the issue was , rather , a political one . 
   i am not sure , why you would want to move to somewhere and not be a part of the culture . 
  well , for pensioners , which i understand is a fair chunk of the people involved : * inexpensive housing * lower cost of living * warmer climate i mean , retirees in the us move to arizona or florida for those three reasons too , not because they are hell-bent on switching culture late in life . 
   he keeps pushing erdogan 's made no meaningful policy changes . 
  sending back a truckload of cows or having the minister of families get booted out produces a story but does n't really change anything significant between the countries . 
  i suspect that both of them are thinking more about making the affair look nice than anything else ( `` do n't trip and fall '' , `` do n't sneeze on the other guy '' , etc ) . 
  both knew that this was coming down the pipe . 
  the [ british ambassador had press yelling at him all the way over ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zut0v_lh43a ) ... 
   they have abandoned all democratic procedures for political gains , '' soylu said about europe . 
  * all * democratic procedures . 
  we are n't talking about any halfway business , this is an * entirely anti-democratic europe * here that we 're faced with . 
  well , they could stop operating in nato -- i mean , nato places relatively-few * hard * constraints on members . 
  france remained in nato during its `` i 'm going off to do things myself '' period . 
  that being said , i do agree that this is more referendum glop for the benefit of turkish voters and has little to do with turkey 's actual arrangements . 
   straight jacket [ straitjacket ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straitjacket ), 
  not an expert on the law here , but for a lot of companies , i suspect that it will be desirable to * have * a uk subsidiary precisely so that they have a business that can operate without having to deal with any barriers created during brexit . 
  ditto for any british companies that have been doing business with the rest of the eu setting up a subsidiary somewhere in the eu . 
  you 're probably not going to get a very friendly response from brits if you propose splitting up their country . 
   here ya'ar * `` keep border controls ; not use euro '' . 
  `` this was n't part of the deal '' . 
  the leaflet did n't claim that it was part of the deal . 
  it said that the uk enjoys a special status . 
  * the `` not ever-closer union is largely-symbolic '' . 
  i disagree that there 's grounds to make that assertion -- sure , it 's not a concrete legal guarantee , but it 'd be impossible to make one , since there 's no way of knowing what future arrangements will happen . 
  certainly the uk could expect to hold that up against the uk being required to join closer union . 
  it 's not a guarantee that the uk would not have sought closer union , but that 's an internal british matter , not a guarantee that the eu can make . 
  * i agree that the work restrictions are not specific to the uk , but as i understand it , this was something that the uk pushed for . 
  * i agree that the `` reducing red tape '' thing is largely a political statement , but so is the initial complaint about `` having red tape from the eu '' as well . 
   the eu doesnt actually restrict trade with countries outside of it . 
  yes , it does . 
  that 's not necessarily a bad thing , but it does impose restrictions . 
  if the eu were an fta ( like nafta , say ) , it 'd be a looser organization , but it would n't mandate that members not trade with countries on the outside . 
  because it is a customs union to * get * that bargaining clout that you 're talking about and to work toward a tighter union , it disallows members from conducting trade outside of the eu without unanimous agreement from all eu members . 
  i 'd add that i do n't think that having a customs union is a bad idea , but not being able to establish ftas via qmv does n't seem so great to me -- that creates a strong preference towards blocking ftas . 
   with the uk leaving the eu it will return to wto standards this assumes no eu-uk fta , which i would call an unlikely scenario . 
  the eu [ has ftas with ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) south africa , chile , and morocco . 
  i doubt that they 'd avoid an fta with the uk , and i doubt that the uk would avoid an fta with the eu . 
  it will be the eu that will object to not having a hard border , not the uk . 
  the only way i really see that changing and the onus being on the uk will be if the roi joins schengen ( i 'm assuming that that would terminate the roi-uk cta ) . 
  so far you 've had two parties involved : * the cameron administration promising to hold a referendum while recommending remain . 
  this was , ultimately , a political call made for political reasons . 
  * the british public making the call . 
  from here on , i expect that the matter will be primarily handled by the bureaucracy on each side . 
  well , and one qmv vote on the final deal that 's made being accepted , which i assume will be pretty much * pro forma * . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth-generation_jet_fighter  france has abandoned any attempt to develop an indigenous fifth-generation fighter and have moved resources directly to development of a sixth-generation fighter aircraft . 
  i suspect that the geopolitical analysis involved was slightly-more sophisticated than that . 
  it has the highest population density of any eu member !, 
  close-enough , i guess . 
  the issue was always just over the label . 
  you could have purchased it as `` sparkling wine '' at any point . 
  iirc , the eu and the us already worked that out during this period that you have been part of it , in 2003 . 
  [ the `` champagne '' label may be used by french producers in the region or us producers that are grandfathered in , but not new ones . 
  ] ( http://vinepair.com/wine-blog/loophole-california-champagne-legal/ ), 
  they really wo n't know , and it 's not really because anyone 's done anything wrong as such . 
  there are lots of people affected , so my guess is that whatever outcome happens will wind up being considered and reasonable . 
  the photographer intentionally set up the shot to make her look alone . 
  at a conference table , zoomed back to show empty chairs , taking up only a small portion of the shot . 
  anti-vaccination is natural selection in action . 
  i 've seen some similar articles . 
  i think that this * guardian * article may simply be incorrect . 
  there may be a legal argument that the uk can not do that , but it 's far less-clear cut than the `` people can not come in and work during the duration of the a50 negotiations '' argument . 
  well , supposing military spending rose ... 
   but in every single debate about the eu army , advocates emphasize that combining our defense industries would yield better striking capability at a lower cost . 
  those are n't mutually-exclusive either . 
  for most problems , `` drop nuclear weapons on it '' is not a very effective solution . 
   russia is the foundation of the throne of god , today is the only state that has at least a theoretical chance to build law and society based on god 's law . 
  somewhere , the pope is slightly-irked . 
  surely the year is what you make of it ? 
  i mean , erasmus students attend the same lectures that students in that country would attend , right ? 
  < looks at people from different states in the us marrying each other  i 've never felt particularly rootless and cosmopolitan . 
  `` we thought we might go find a picture of the american flag somewhere in our stock photo collection , but then we said ` naw , the hell with it , just use liberia ' . '', 
  well , now we 've got russia trying to get california to secede and farage + the republicans trying to split california into multiple states . 
  anyone else feel into reshaping borders ? 
  what if the uk property bubble bursts in the next two years , i wonder ... 
  not sure if it was this sub or / r/ukpolitics , but yesterday there were articles on a poll held showing that jeremy corbyn was even more-unpopular among britons than donald trump . 
  yes . 
  f-35a -- no carrier capability , requires a regular runway . 
  f-35b -- can vtol . 
  limits the range . 
  f-35c -- can operate off a catobar carrier ( catapult to get going , arrestor hook to stop ) . 
  seems like a bit of a stretch to tie the two . 
  it really should n't * need * a secret clause . 
  it 's normally just not done to encourage secession in friendly countries . 
  tends to make them a bit unhappy . 
   since the reasons for having daylight savings do not apply anymore in modern society . 
  saving on lighting energy ? 
  i 'd think that it would . 
  might be less-important than it once was ( i bet that things like air conditioning use more power , and lighting systems have moved away from incandescents , reducing the relative importance ) . 
  hmm . 
  though ... most people that work indoors work in a lit environment anyway , regardless of the time . 
   could n't we just use the same time all over the world the [ swiss already tried this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swatch_internet_time ) . 
  no uptake . 
   swatch internet time ( or beat time ) is a decimal time concept introduced in 1998 by the swatch corporation as part of their marketing campaign for their line of `` beat '' watches . 
    instead of hours and minutes , the mean solar day is divided into 1000 parts called '' . beats '' . 
  each . beat is equal to one decimal minute in the french revolutionary decimal time system and lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds ( 86.4 seconds ) in standard time . 
  times are notated as a 3-digit number out of 1000 after midnight . 
  so , @ 248 would indicate a time 248 . beats after midnight representing 248/1000 of a day , just over 5 hours and 57 minutes . 
    there are no time zones in swatch internet time ; instead , the new time scale of biel meantime ( bmt ) is used , based on swatch 's headquarters in biel , switzerland and equivalent to central european time , west africa time , and utc +01 . 
  unlike civil time in switzerland and many other countries , swatch internet time does not observe daylight saving time . 
  the f-35c ca n't fly on british carriers , as the catapult on the new brit carriers was yanked to save money and they require a catapult -- you 're wanting the f-35b .
