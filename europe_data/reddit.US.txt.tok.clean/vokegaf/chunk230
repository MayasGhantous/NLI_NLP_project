  if she had issued bonds in a foreign currency ? 
  she could certainly have dug herself into serious trouble . 
  investors do not set rates based on what is a good idea for a state or whether a state is wisely spending funds . 
  they will merrily let a state spend many of its good times down the road for good times today . 
  their only constraint is the likelihood of the state paying them back . 
  it would have been more-obvious -- rates would have become obscene -- but greece could very much have borrowed herself into inability to service debt . 
  you can find plenty of cases where states have defaulted .

  trump was mentioned in the article as an appeal to authority and was * specifically * talking about trying to tamp down trade surplus , which should not be something that the us is worried about . 
   in theory . 
  in practice , most european countries have labour regulations so rigid , even post-crisis , that such a path to fix nominal rigidities does n't exist . 
  countries * can * make the process even more disruptive via labor regulation , that 's fair enough . 
  however , if they do so and completely manage to stop the process , they will have the businesses involved go out of business and new ones reform and hire workers ... at a lower wage . 
  greece 's issues with taking out debt denominated in euros are independent of any greek issue caused by a german-greek trade imbalance . 
  greece could have issued bonds in euros even if there was no trade whatsoever between greece and germany ... hell , greece could have issued euro-denominated bonds even without being in the eurozone . 
  some countries * do * do this -- the us dollar is not uncommonly used for this . 
   if greece had readopted the drachma back in 2010/11 and had let it realign , she would have suffered a strong shock , but would have recovered since then . 
  greece could not have ( legally ) zeroed the debt , which was her real problem , by readopting the drachma , because she 'd already taken out debt denominated in euros . 
  greece moving to the drachma in 2010/11 would absolutely * not * have addressed the issues greece is seeing today . 
  basically : * the article is wrong that a german trade surplus is a threat to global stability . 
  * other countries can and will ultimately adjust to a german trade surplus * even if they are on the same currency * , just suffering more business disruption in the process . 
  * the article talks vaguely about problems caused for `` neighbors '' , which presumably is intended to imply greece , whereas greece 's problems are primarily due to an unrelated issue than german trade . 
  * while it 's not the article , you are wrong in stating that moving back to the drachma would have resolved greece 's debt problems , and i 'd furthermore add that greece could potentially have dug itself into that same hole even if it had always used the drachma by simply issuing debt denominated in a foreign currency . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mustafa_kemal_atat%c3%bcrk  as the president of the newly formed turkish republic , atat\u00fcrk initiated a rigorous program of political , economic , and cultural reforms with the ultimate aim of building a modern and secular nation-state . 
  he made primary education free and compulsory , opening thousands of new schools all over the country . 
  turkish women received equal civil and political rights during atat\u00fcrk 's presidency ahead of many western countries . 
  probably more than any other single social reformer that i 'm aware of in history , he radically-restructured and modernized his country . 
  he took turkey from being an islamist state to being a secular state , and changed how society worked across the board . 
  i am fairly sure that any one person trying to change as much as he did would have run into a political wall in the us , for example -- people would * never * have accepted it . 
  edit : in fact , i ca n't even think of that many abrupt modernizations that nations did on their own ... maybe the [ meiji restoration in japan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meiji_restoration ) . 
  probably when empires took over countries , they would have created abrupt social change , but i mean a sort of change that did n't rely on outside force , but instead required politicking and ensuring that the country itself supported such a change . 
  if you include violent revolutions , i guess that there are some examples . 
  edit2 : let me put it this way . 
  the eu and predecessor organizations has been an integration project for how many decades now ? 
  you 've seen how fiercely people resist comparatively minor social changes that someone hands down . 
  weighing oranges in kilograms in the uk ? 
  `` fuck you , i 'm rebelling and leaving . '', 
  imagine what would happen if some guy came in and said `` what we need here is to create an islamist society , need to have religious figures running things , religious schools , stop educating women and most of the population , get rid of elections , eliminate separation of power , have religion run the courts , adopt the burkah , new writing system , etc '' . 
  no figure in europe has ever even approached doing anything even * remotely * as radical as that . 
  europe would go completely batshit insane . 
  he basically did that in reverse and kept the population onboard . 
  for how concerned a ton of people are on here about the prospect of a society becoming non-secular to even a small degree , i 'd think that they 'd be radically enthusiastic about him . 
  i 'll be damned , you 're right . 
  i [ did n't know that it was english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turn_in_one's_grave ) . 
  greece cut spending which was unsustainably high and fueled by unsustainable government borrowing . 
  that is no doubt unpleasant , but would very much have happened with or without a german export surplus . 
  you could have completely blocked all trade between germany and greece , and you would have seen the same effect .

  `` it 's you !, 
  so we have to do it . 
  let 's go , folks !, 
  courage ! '' that statement is an entirely content-free bit of rhetoric . 
  and how does this conflict with what i 've said ? 
  did you read * my * comment in full ? 
  yes , it can be less-disruptive to have relative currency values shift , since it does n't need the awkward tool of layoffs and rehirings . 
  but such surpluses * will not * persist . 
  further , germany having a trade surplus is no `` threat to global stability '' . 
  reading / r/ukpolitics in particular , one would think that a trade surplus is a treasure of great value , something to be hoarded and protected . 
  * [ john locke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_locke ) was a briton ( an englishman ) , living from 1632-1704 . 
  * [ david hume ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_hume ) was a briton ( a scot ) , living from 1711-1776 . 
  * [ adam smith ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adam_smith ) was a briton ( a scot ) , living from 1723-1790 . 
   adam smith and david hume were the founding fathers of anti- [ mercantilist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) thought . 
  a number of scholars found important flaws with mercantilism long before adam smith developed an ideology that could fully replace it . 
  critics like hume , dudley north , and john locke undermined much of mercantilism , and it steadily lost favor during the 18th century . 
    in 1690 , john locke argued that prices vary in proportion to the quantity of money . 
  locke 's second treatise also points towards the heart of the anti-mercantilist critique : that the wealth of the world is not fixed , but is created by human labor ( represented embryonically by locke 's labor theory of value ) . 
  mercantilists failed to understand the notions of absolute advantage and comparative advantage ( although this idea was only fully fleshed out in 1817 by david ricardo ) and the benefits of trade . 
  [ 40 ]   for instance , imagine that portugal was a more efficient producer of wine than england , yet in england cloth could be produced more efficiently than it could in portugal . 
  thus if portugal specialized in wine and england in cloth , both states would end up better off if they traded . 
  this is an example of the reciprocal benefits of trade ( whether due to comparative or absolute advantage ) . 
  in modern economic theory , trade is not a zero-sum game of cutthroat competition , because both sides can benefit . 
    hume famously noted the impossibility of the mercantilists ' goal of a constant positive balance of trade [ citation needed ] . 
  as bullion flowed into one country , the supply would increase , and the value of bullion in that state would steadily decline relative to other goods . 
  conversely , in the state exporting bullion , its value would slowly rise . 
  eventually it would no longer be cost-effective to export goods from the high-price country to the low-price country , and the balance of trade would reverse . 
  mercantilists fundamentally misunderstood this , long arguing that an increase in the money supply simply meant that everyone gets richer . 
  [ 41 ] they figured out that maintaining persistent trade surpluses is n't possible -- that trade is not zero-sum , that you do n't need to worry about it , as the trade equilibrium was inevitably self-regulating . 
  we fast-forward to the center-right newspaper of record in great britain , and observe its headline :  germany 's trade surplus is a threat to global stability , and must be fixed ... in effect , germany has become an economic rogue state , hollowing out the industry of its neighbours , creating vast flows of footloose capital and undermining the stability of the financial system ... for now , the important point is this : an out of control surplus is just as much of a problem as an out of control deficit . 
  i think that perhaps british schools should cover the great advances that britons gave to the world . 
  the world 's known how this works for hundreds of years . 
  ( i 'd blame trump too , but he can at least claim politicking . ), 
  true , germany 's trade with other countries in the ez ca n't be regulated by changes in the relative values of their currencies , since they 're both on the euro , which would be the least-disruptive route . 
  but it will inevitably be regulated by layoffs and rehiring at lower wages in euro terms in greece , and greek workers being unable to afford german goods and cutting off the export spigot . 
  let me explain how this works , russia . 
  the un votes to engage in a massive intervention . 
  the resolution goes to the unsc . 
  russia holds a permanent seat on the unsc . 
  russia vetoes the action . 
  this is n't the unsc malfunctioning . 
  this is exactly what it 's supposed to do -- the un can not start a war between the great powers . 
  it * is * blocked by a paywall . 
  they use logic like giving n free articles or not blocking an article for a while until people start linking to it . 
  three more than the typical new yorker could name !,
