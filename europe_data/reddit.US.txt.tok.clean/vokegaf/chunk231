  look , you 're not in the south pacific this time . 
  on the other hand , some us states have larger militaries than some european countries do . 
  not allowed to independently wage war , though , that 's true . 
  flair checks out . 
  username checks out . 
  post confirmed legit . 
  i mean , they * do * both start with `` u '' ... 
  we need a list of upcoming referendums , because the french vote is almost here , and then i wo n't know what excitement is coming up . 
  greece has been having some technical issues . 
  and we have that upcoming french vote to look forwards to !, 
   indonesia is one of the nicest places i 've been too . 
  flynn got his hind end removed from the trump team for all the unpleasantness he was in . 
  i guess the swamp * does * get drained , one way or another . 
  islamism was n't really a core element of erdogan 's schtick . 
  this is n't iran . 
  nato does n't have a suspension mechanism . 
  also , i suspect that few countries would want to join an organization that chose to overrule their internal politics . 
  this is a democratic result . 
  erdogan 's asked for a move to a presidential system , and he 's not the only one with such a system -- the us has one too . 
  granted , turkey will have fewer limitations on the president , but the people of turkey clearly chose this ... 
  ataturk worked out all right , and he had extensive powers . 
  i guess we 'll have to see what happens . 
  it 's not the result that i wanted , and i think that turkey will be worse-off for it , but still got ta see what will happen . 
   it would be a hilarious turn of events , as the dictatorial executive powers that were won in this election would fall in the hands of secularists instead of the sultan . 
  not that i think that that would be fantastic either . 
   saddam hussein was `` democratically elected '' as well . 
  he [ arrested and wiped out his political opposition , though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kluktjbp2ug ) ... ahhh . 
  yes . 
  [ dramatization ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke7er0egbdw ) . 
  they are people who came to work in the netherlands . 
  they may ( or may not ) have dutch citizenship , but turkey 's citizenship scheme has you ( a ) automatically inherit turkish citizenship and ( b ) does n't let you get rid of turkish citizenship without paying a fee . 
  ergo , unless they 've gone out of their way to avoid it , they can vote in turkish elections . 
  may or may not be a good idea , but since a lot of the guest workers in europe come from relatively-undeveloped places in turkey ( unlike the turkish diaspora over here ) , they tend to support erdogan . 
  note that normally americans living abroad can do the same , since they act as if they were resident in their last state in the federation . 
  the only time they ca n't vote in federal elections is if they 're living in territory that is n't part of a state , like puerto rico . 
  i can not believe that that article is n't semi-protected at this point . 
  that was * not * intentional . 
  they played up evidence to be more solid than it was worth , but both the uk and the us believed that weapons were present . 
  melenchon wants to shut down france 's nuclear power production . 
  pretty much nobody was a democracy a couple hundred years ago or had been . 
  * au contraire * . 
  europe is in the middle of the largest voluntary political restructuring in human history precisely to address that concern . 
   if you thought that the american style conservative arguments of the tory right would win in a rational debate we 're a federation in the us , and the republicans , making the `` american-style conservative argument '' [ have overwhelming dominance at the state level ] ( https://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/14/1598918/-republicans-now-dominate-state-government-with-32-legislatures-and-33-governors ) . 
  now , i know that the comeback is probably gon na be `` oh , americans just are n't * rational * '' , but ... 
  perhaps he 's a noble crusader in the service of http://www.killtheapostrophe.com/, 
  any time !, 
  we do what we can !, 
  what , the microsoft antitrust case ? 
  i mean , microsoft is pretty far from innocent in leveraging monopolies to try to move into new markets . 
  i 'd strongly object to defending them . 
   i 'm a u.s. defense attorney . 
  i 've assisted with the defense of major u.s. and eu corporations in scandals involving violations of u.s. law . 
  with respect to these scandals in the u.s. , the difference is the behavior of the company . 
  even aside from regulatory issues , my understanding is that germany does n't presently have a direct equivalent of the [ class-action lawsuit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/class_action ) . 
  so outside from regulators , i wonder if a lot of companies in the us are worried about being bled dry down the road in court by class-action lawsuits and think about how having a clean nose or at * least * creating a pretty convincing image of having a clean nose in court is gon na play out . 
  i mean , the us gets a lot of flak for having a too-litigious environment ( class-action lawsuits plus hefty and historically ( and even today , in a few states ) uncapped [ punitive damages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punitive_damages ) , plus use of [ jury trials ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jury_trial ) in [ tort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tort ) ) , but one thing that it does do is mean that it forces companies to think pretty hard about what happens if something comes out down the line . 
  it means that you may not want to try just doing something and toughing out the damages down the line * or * at least you 're going to go out-of-your-way to establish plausible deniability . 
  the actions you 'd take when worried about `` how would this look in a class-action-lawsuit if it comes out five years from now '' issue would also probably apply to `` how is this gon na look to regulators if it comes out five years from now '' . 
  ehh ... i can never * prove * that it is n't , but vw got caught on : * attempts to defeat the regulatory system . 
  not good because it becomes a `` rule of law '' issue . 
  * high-level involvement . 
  not good because a company having insufficient internal standards to avoid violations is a harder bar to meet than expecting high-level people to not willfully engage in violation . 
  * a paper trail left behind indicating high-level involvement . 
  kills plausible deniability . 
  * destruction of evidence when caught . 
  that shows not only that you were a bad actor in the past , but you 've every intention of wanting to * continue * to be a bad actor , barring severe involvement from the state . 
  * attempts to fight regulators when caught . 
  * lots of evidence of violation available . 
  it 's not possible to claim some weird manufacturing defect or something like that -- the firmware is available on every car . 
  * a large-scale problem . 
  * a public health-and-human-safety issue . 
  not * that * many lives -- i understand about 60 -- but plays badly politically . 
  no legislator is going to come bat for you . 
  * an environmental issue . 
  now the latte-sipping liberals are n't going to protect you . 
  plays badly politically . 
  i do n't know how things are handled in germany . 
  maybe destruction of evidence in the face of regulators getting involved is considered less-severe , but i 'd expect even a `` bad actor '' company in the us to try to hide what it could under plausible deniability ( `` i have no recollection of that '' , `` perhaps an engineering team made some bad decisions , but there 's no reason to believe that anyone knew about it or that it was intentional outside that '' ) , maybe to try to avoid establishing a paper trail in the first place , but to work with the regulators on what they are caught on and accept their lumps there . 
  they better at least give a compelling * impression * of trying to work with regulators . 
  and vw really did n't do that . 
  i mean ... i do n't know what portion of the penalties depended upon vw hiding and destroying evidence , but it had to be significant . 
  when i was reading the news articles about the destruction of evidence coming out , i was shaking my head and saying `` holy cow , they are digging themselves a deep hole '' . 
  in fact , this is a current issue , because it relates heavily to what turkey is doing with the referendum ( which , according to news outlets , erdogan just won ) . 
  there are two positions -- the [ head of state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_of_state ) and the [ head of government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_of_government ) . 
  the head of state is a person who is basically a ceremonial figure . 
  they tend to be somewhat-disconnected from politics , and act as a unifying figure or a symbol of the country . 
  the head of government is more of a `` manager '' . 
  they set policy and tell people what to do . 
  in the uk , the queen is the head of state . 
  she has little day-to-day power , though in theory if she * did * become involved , she could probably promote particular issues . 
  in sweden , the king is the head of state . 
  much of europe uses a system of government called the [ parliamentary system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_system ) . 
  in such a system , there 's a separate head of state and head of government -- most-often , the head of state is a president ( though sometimes it 's a once-powerful king or queen ) and the head of government is the prime minister . 
  the prime minister is set by a coalition of parties who control the legislature , so the prime minister both runs the executive and is effectively in control of the legislature . 
  the prime minister knows that he can basically do what he wants legislatively ( since his coalition of parties rules the legislature ) * but * he 's subject to being removed by the legislature at any time , which can hold a vote of no confidence and strip him of his position . 
  the us , and most of the americas , use a [ presidential system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_system ) . 
  in a presidential system , the president is both the head of state and the head of government , which means that he is a far more-powerful figure than the ceremonial president in parliamentary systems . 
  in a presidential system , the president operates more-or-less independently of the legislature -- the same party or coalition may not control the legislature and the presidency , and in fact they may be at odds . 
  in the us , these two are fairly-strongly separated , and in the us , it is possible for a president to do quite unpopular things , and need not fear removal at least as long as he breaks no laws and does n't need to worry about his term running out ... but he will only control the executive branch of the government , and the legislature and judiciary have the ability to stymie much of what he does if they are truly opposed . 
  france uses a '' [ semi-presidential ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semi-presidential_system ) '' system , where the president is less-powerful than in the us , but still holds a fair amount of clout .
