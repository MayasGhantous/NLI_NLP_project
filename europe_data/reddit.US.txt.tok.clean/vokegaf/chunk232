  turkey is currently holding a referendum on moving from a parliamentary system to a presidential system ( albeit one with a more-powerful president than in the us ) . 
  the issue i was trying to raise in my earlier comment , though , was not the difference between presidential and parliamentary systems , but rather than it 's not defined whether the legislature or the head of government ( the prime minister in parliamentary systems , and the president in presidential ones ) has the authority to withdraw from treaties like the one entering the uk into the eu . 
  in the uk , there was just a ruling that the head of government does * not * have that authority , and must go to the legislature . 
  in the us , it 's somewhat-undefined -- and it 's a more-interesting question in the us and other presidential systems , since the head of government may very well be at odds with the legislature . 
  the eu only says that a member must officially indicate that it wants to initiate article 50 to withdraw . 
  it does not specify the means -- which is reasonable , as the member state itself determines what is its official mechanism . 
  in france , i do not know whether the situation is similar to the uk or us , where it is not clear who exactly may have this authority . 
  this may be of some upcoming interest , as the question of whether le pen would single-handedly have the power to remove france from the eu may be a matter of some importance if she is elected . 
  this * may * also have already been decided in france , in which case it is a non-issue . 
    socialist libertarian   i 'm hearing popcorn poping my head as i read this . 
  ooooh boy , you 're gon na set off the left-libertarians with that one . 
  almost nobody in the us drives diesel automobiles , so the problem in the us was far smaller . 
  [ in the us ] ( https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/bts_fact_sheets/oct_2015/html/entire.html ) :  only 1.5 percent of all light duty vehicles ( including passenger cars , sport utility vehicles , minivans , and all but the largest pickup trucks and vans ) in model year 2014 were diesel-powered . 
  this percentage is up from less than 0.1 percent in the mid-90s , but below the peak of 5.9 percent in model year 1981 . 
  in model year 2014 volkswagen 's fleet had the highest percentage of diesel-powered light duty vehicles in the united states ( 20.1 percent ) , followed by daimler ( 6.9 percent ) , bmw ( 6.0 percent ) , chrysler-fiat ( 2.8 percent ) , and gm ( 0.5 percent ) [ usepa 2014 ] . 
  [ in the eu ] ( http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/eu_pocketbook_2014.pdf ) :  diesel cars account for 53 % of all new registrations in 2013 , slightly less than in 2012 . 
  this situation differs notably from other major car markets . 
  the us , chinese and japanese markets are all dominated by gasoline-powered cars , with diesels playing almost no role . 
  one market of note that has embraced diesel technology , however , is india , where the diesel share was around 50 % in 2013 . 
  so you 're talking about an issue that 's probably in the ballpark of 35 times as large in the eu as in the us . 
  i doubt that vw could reasonably afford to do the same thing in both . 
  hell , i bet you 're not even grumpy . 
  no , * you 're * doing okay . 
  i 'm talking to the ones who are n't . 
  if you find that objectionable , you can also make up the difference via very-large-scale immigration . 
  frankly , that seems to generate a substantial amount of political unhappiness , looking at the past couple years . 
  my suspicion is that sex would be the more popular route . 
  let me do a back-of-the-envelope : * the eu-28 has [ 510m people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) . 
  * [ the eu-28 had a tfr of 1.58 in 2015 . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/fertility_statistics ) * you need a tfr of 2.1 to maintain population in a developed country . 
  * that means that you 're losing about 100 - 100 x ( 1.58 / 2.1 ) = 25 % of your population every generation at current tfr . 
  you can imagine a map with a quarter of populated europe disappearing every generation . 
  * that means that you need to replace a quarter of your population with immigrants from outside the eu every generation to just hold steady . 
  * [ the mean age of a woman at childbirth in the eu-28 was 30.5 years ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/fertility_statistics ) . 
  let 's use 30 years for the approximate length of a generation . 
  * that means that unless you have more kids , you 're gon na need 127m immigrants every 30 years to make up the fertility deficit and maintain the population , or about 4.2 m immigrants per year -- legal , illegal , and asylum-seekers . 
  * 2015 saw 1m/year refugees in the refugee crisis . 
  [ a slightly older article from ~ 2000 ] ( http://oecdobserver.org/news/archivestory.php/aid/337/immigration_in_the_european_union:_problem_or_solution_.html ) :  europe 's population is set to decline over the next 50 years . 
  italy will lose 28 % of its population by 2050 . 
  in order to maintain its working age population , italy would need to start importing more than 350,000 immigrants per year or , alternatively , keep its citizens working until they are 75 . 
    the us ( population 275m ) has tended to take only small numbers of asylum-seekers -- fewer than europe , relative to its population . 
  but it has a more liberal immigration regime . 
  by the late 1990s , the us was taking in about 1m immigrants a year : 730,000 legal immigrants , 200,000 illegal aliens and about 100,000 refugees . 
  about 70 % of legal immigrants are admitted for the purposes of family reunification . 
    the in-flows of migrants during the 1980s and 1990s -- the second great migration of the 20th century -- has literally changed the face of america . 
  in 1970 the us population was 5 % hispanic , 1 % asian and 12 % black . 
  a recent projection indicates that by 2050 , it will be 26 % hispanic , 8 % asian and 14 % black . 
  -  no one knows what will happen to asylum trends -- indeed , no one knows what is really happening now ; one reputable estimate puts the number of illegal migrants smuggled into the eu each year as 400,000 . 
  the probability is that more small wars and the increasing urbanisation of the world 's population will keep the asylum numbers high . 
  [ it looks like up until 2013 ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/infographics/immigration/migration-in-eu-infographic_en.pdf ) , the eu had ~ 800k/year net migrants ( i * think * this is only legal immigration , not legal + illegal . 
  it excludes asylum-seekers . ) . 
  using those numbers -- assuming that the eu can sustain the 2015 1m asylum-seekers number , which generated a lot of political friction -- and 400k illegal migrants and 800k legal migrants , you 've got maybe 2.2 m/year . 
  you need another 2m/year to maintain population in the long run . 
  or , more sex sans birth control . 
  edit : corrected math error . 
  edit2 : not right , because the population does n't drop by a quarter -- just the age group . 
  so it should be about half that rate of drop -- it 's about sufficient to hold level with the migrant crisis . 
  gdp is slightly different ( though normally they tend to track each other reasonably closely ) , and i do n't know whether gdp ever topped 50 % . 
  every wealthy bit of a modern country tends to subsidize the other bits . 
  what would the uk amount to if it were a naked london that had confidently shed everything else , so that it could be isolated and wealthy ? 
  how long would it have things going well ? 
   being more of a laughing stock of the world than that bolivarian alliance with cuba , bolivia , nicaragua and venezuela that melenchon would propose to join would happen ? 
  i 'd be putting money on poland and friends before i 'd be betting on the success of a new socialist bloc . 
  jesus christ , * independent * . 
   but the oecd forecasts the american economy to comprise 17 % of world gdp in 2060 ( down from 23 % in 2012 ) while europe 's share of world gdp will shrink from 17 % in 2012 to just 9 % by the same year . 
  get to making more europeans , europe !, 
  yes , [ you ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:fertility_indicators,_2015_yb17.png ) , the one reading this who is not having sex at the moment !, 
  i 'm talking to you !, 
  the british empire never engaged in a single air-to-air refueling operation . 
  edit : just to be clear , since i guess that we 're two levels of metaphor deep , sure , i get that you 're not speaking literally -- you 're referring to the ability to project force . 
  but i 'm not being literal either -- there are a lot of ways to exert influence . 
  the amount of land farmed wo n't decrease . 
  there will just be fewer , larger , more-efficient farms ... and fewer people working on them . 
  at least one major factor is farm size . 
  small farms are inefficient -- you want scale , want to leverage things like industrial farm equipment that have high fixed costs . 
  however , people historically tended to farm on small farms -- it was the society that all of us came from a couple of hundred years ago . 
  to be blunt -- there are simply too many people farming in france . 
  it 's not necessary to have that much labor to produce food on the land . 
  that transition process is not gentle . 
  in the us , it took the [ dust bowl ] ( http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3729e/i3729e.pdf ) to drive some farmers out of business -- they ca n't sell their goods at a profit , go out of business , have to `` sell the family farm '' , as the phrase goes . 
  it 's desirable from a policy standpoint , but politically-difficult , since people may not be comfortable with or understand how to get out of farming . 
  generally-speaking , i think that we 've done a less-than-ideal-job of providing a smooth path to get people out of farming . 
  the subsidization just gives small-scale farmers time to get out of farming and limit political heat on the transition process out , which some clearly are not doing . 
  http://www.economist.com/node/5278374  what might the french landscape look like if all subsidies and external tariffs were drastically cut ? 
  estimates suggest that france would lose between a third and two-thirds of its farms . 
  a sustainable industry might consist of just 150,000 farms , according to a recent study by the institut montaigne , a think-tank . 
  these would range from big , efficient producers , such as lowland cereal , dairy and beef farmers , through the fruit , vegetable and wine-growers who already get very little help , to niche producers of `` appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e '' and organic foodstuffs . 
    the big lowland farmers are already among europe 's most competitive . 
  the latest talk among them is about a new satellite-controlled combine harvester . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sites/agriculture/files/rural-area-economics/briefs/pdf/009_en.pdf  in 2013 , a total of 10.8 million farms operated in the eu-28 , down from 12 million farms in 2010 ( -11.5 % ) . 
  the long-term decline in the number of agricultural holdings thus continued -- between 2005 and 2013 the average annual rate of decline stood at -3.7 % . 
  while some of these losses may be due to changes in survey thresholds , it is clear that a consolidation process towards larger , more competitive farms is taking place across the eu , with an increase in the average farm size from 14.4 to 16.1 ha of agricultural land ( +12.2 % ) between 2010 and 2013 . 
  farms are growing even more in economic terms . 
  the standard output per holding , which is a measure of the economic farm size , increased by a remarkable 21 % . 
  the increase in competitiveness is further expressed in the lower number of regular agricultural workers ( 22 million in 2013 , down from 25 million in 2010 ; -12.8 % ) . 
  converted into full-time jobs , the decline is less pronounced ( -4.4 % between 2010 and 2013 ) , indicating a shift towards more full-time employment in agriculture . 
  while all key indicators declined in absolute terms , their average numbers per holding increased , indicating a trend towards bigger , more productive farms .

  it 's not clear to me whether the french constitution makes explicit who can initiate a hypothetical a50 .
