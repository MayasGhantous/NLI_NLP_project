  it 's not a matter for the eu to determine , but for the member state . 
  a member state could give its president authority to initiate a50 if it wishes . 
  remember that [ this was a point of some legal contention in the uk -- whether may had authority to withdraw ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/24/supreme-court-article-50-judgement-announces-its-article-50-judgment-politics-live ) . 
  it was n't defined and had to be fought out in british court . 
  furthermore , it looks like the us suffers the same ambiguous point -- it 's never been really determined * who * exactly has the power to withdraw from treaties . 
  the question of whether trump could single-handedly withdraw from nafta was a question a few months back . 
  it seems to me that there 's a common-sense argument that if the senate ratifies a treaty , then at a minimum , senate approval should be required to withdraw . 
  in the 1800s , this was generally-accepted to be the way this worked . 
  [ however , in the 1900s , presidents withdrew from some treaties without congress saying anything , and the supreme court declined to explicitly rule on the matter ] ( http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1227&amp;context=law_lawreview ) . 
  as a result , it 's not at all clear who would have the power to initiate such a similar withdrawal in the us . 
  i would not at all be surprised if this question of authority is also undefined in a number of other eu members . 
  i do n't know enough about french law to know whether-or-not the french constitution spells this out , but it is very possible that a president le pen could , with a flick of her wrist , terminate french membership . 
  spain and the uk have a dispute about how far offshore gibraltar territorial waters go . 
  spain sailed a boat through the disputed area , as apparently happens on a frequent basis . 
  the uk sent a patrol boat after it to tell it to leave , as also apparently normally happens . 
  a number of british publications ran stories that implied that war was imminent , which it certainly was not . 
  honestly , the spain-on-gibraltar thing did n't seem like a huge concern , because ultimately , that 's a matter for the negotiators . 
  there 's nothing wrong with the uk saying `` gibraltar is not up for offer '' , but it does n't have to happen in public -- the `` impending war '' response was n't necessary either . 
  i was more concerned about the snp bit from the eu . 
  any scottish second independence referendum does depend on public opinion . 
  unlike gibraltar , having sturgeon in the ep affects public perception in scotland -- that 's an action that can only encourage the uk to promote a negative image of the eu domestically , to promote unity . 
  encouraging bits of a country to break off is a downright hostile act . 
  just as spain would expect , say , the us to refrain from providing support for , say , catalonian independence , so the uk would expect the eu not to encourage scotland to split off . 
  because turkey is going to take the normal-for-a-country position . 
  these are n't turkish citizens . 
  if the eu shows up with a boatload of nigerians , eritreans , pakistanis , and syrians and tells turkey that they were caught , turkey is going to say `` are any of these turkish citizens '' ? 
  the eu 's going to say `` no '' . 
  turkey 's going to say `` well , we only accept deportations of turkish citizens '' . 
  that 's not unreasonable or abnormal -- all countries do that . 
  the country that 's doing the deporting is responsible for getting them back to the country where they have citizenship . 
  you ca n't ( legally ) just dump a load of people off on a beach in turkey somewhere , any more than turkey can legally dump undesirables off on a greek beach . 
  however , if turkey is willing to make it more-difficult to * get * to the eu in the first place , then it does n't become an eu issue . 
  one option is to not rely on turkey . 
  but then the eu is going to need to address the problem of deportation , and one issue there is going to be that [ non-refoulement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-refoulement ) will block them from deportation to syria and some other countries * and * if people apply for asylum the eu will probably need to grant it unless they 're going to start making use of the `` no direct travel plus illegal entry , no asylum status '' clause in the refugee convention * and * unless current policy changes , the legal temporary residence that asylum gives normally gives people access to citizenship after a few years . 
  so turkey * is * handling something of a headache for the eu in a way that the eu could n't handle it . 
  is it worth the price that turkey will charge ? 
  < shrug  i do think that the eu made a major error in offering a vague `` fast track of turkish eu membership '' early-on , which was flagrantly bullshit and does not set the tone for honest dealings moving forward , but ... 
  you mean a legally-residing turk ? 
  maybe , but damn , that seems pretty fucked-up . 
  some guy who got turkish citizenship because his parents had it , was born in germany , lived there all his life , has been quietly working as a machinist or something , probably does n't even speak turkish ... you 're going to use him as ammunition against turkey ? 
  have police come to his house , load him into a van , dump him off at the turkish border ? 
  i mean , come on . 
  do n't let erdogan `` own '' people with turkish citizenship living in the eu . 
  they are n't `` his '' . 
  i have happily supported many hard-line border control policies , including withdrawal from the refugee convention and camps on islands for people who are caught trying to illegally enter . 
  but punishing turks living in europe because the turkish government is being irritating seems like the most asinine suggestion i 've ever heard . 
  i do n't think that he 's gon na get it . 
  the it just does n't make any sense for pressuring the eu -- `` deal with a larger amount of population movement or we 'll make you hassle with a smaller amount of population movement '' . 
  the timing is politically - * appalling * -- right after having a spat over turks living in the netherlands and germany . 
  if i understand the main draw for turkey , it would let turks effectively work illegally in the eu . 
  the eu could always clamp down hard on things like people working illegally and address * both * issues . 
  he 's not actually getting a lot out of this . 
  i think that he 's much-better-off aiming for , say , regularizing status in the customs union , where it seems to me that turkey has a strong argument and has potential for long-term gains . 
  sure . 
  not contradicting my point , though . 
  sure you can -- just not as concisely . 
  `` those guys '' , for example . 
   and the protectionism stance he has are agains ' t coutries outside the eu , not within so idk what you 're talking about . 
  he is proposing halting it with other countries within the eu . 
  this would violate the freedom of capital and of goods , and would violate france 's treaty obligations . 
  [ google translate ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://laec.fr/section/52/appliquer-un-plan-b-en-cas-d-echec-des-negociations&amp;usg=alkjrhijo_ivrdvsgue7scd111ltzuveya )  establish control of capital and goods at national borders to avoid tax evasion by wealthy and large groups could there be an eu without france fulfilling its obligation to the four freedoms to other members ? 
  yes , in theory . 
  but it was over the uk asking for release from the obligation of freedom of labor that france insisted could never be done , that all four freedoms must be followed . 
  well , perhaps we 're complaining about semantics , if the issue you 're concerned about is that the same terms might be extended to all ( which afaik the uk was fine with ) . 
  the uk wanted the four freedoms to be violated , as does melenchon -- is that more-acceptable to you ? 
  or someone aiming to affect the elections . 
  thank you for the english summary . 
  i assume that france also has separate capital gains and income tax , like the us . 
  the wealthy get their money from capital gains , not in the form of wages . 
   got nothing i understand that he actually made greece worse-off , as the delay while he was playing hardball screwed up businesses and banks in greece . 
  yes , i 'm not saying that what tsipras did was on par with negotiating-against-the-backdrop-of-brexit-or-frexit . 
  just that it did not work out well for greece , and had the similar `` i will give my threats credibility via a referendum '' approach . 
  i think so , holland . 
  nato has no obligations in asia , if that 's what you mean . 
  well , it 's selling access to the eu . 
  it 's not uncommon -- the us has a `` millionaire visa '' , as does canada , australia , and probably other countries that i have n't looked at , though the amount of money involved varies . 
  it generates some taxable activity , and is immigration on wealth -- you 're pulling money into the country . 
  i 'd note that the us has a very limited supply ( 30k/year ) and demand greatly exceeds supply . 
  the broader concern seems to me to be that there are no limits . 
  i can understand the eu not wanting to have common immigration policy . 
  but today , any member can sell an arbitrary number of these , and the real thing being `` sold '' is access to other members , who have no control over that access . 
  at the least , it seems to me that there should be some sort of cap on the amount that can be extended without approval from other members . 
  if tomorrow , an eu member extended access to 100m people , would it be objectionable to other members ? 
  i can only assume so , yet there is no mechanism for other members to have influence on the rate of that immigration . 
  yes , not saying that it was to leave , but tsipras tried using a referendum as a lever to gain negotiating strength against the eu , which appears to be what some melenchon supporters think that melenchon will do ; instead , tsipras got nowhere and wound up worse-off , splitting with what he had been promising . 
  i suspect that we are violently agreeing . 
  oh , come on . 
  we did give you freedom after that . 
  also , even aside from * quantity * ... there are some legal restrictions on what you can do . 
  you can monitor people to some degree , but you ca n't jail someone for `` potentially being involved with religious extremists at some point in the past '' . 
  if someone 's making bombs in their apartment , you could raid it , find the stuff , arrest the guy . 
  but unless you can intercept communications clearly indicating intent , not much you can do about someone who just jumps in a truck and runs people over . 
  sweden could probably relax those restrictions , but that 's a dangerous path to take -- `` you seem kinda suspicious , off to jail you go '' . 
  that 's being more concise , not more-precise . 
   the second part just seems like a logicians dream surely [ logiban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lojban ) claims that title ... 
  if you want the true spqr [ classic latin alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_alphabet#classical_latin_alphabet ) , then you ca n't use `` j '' , `` u '' , or `` w '' . 
  if you adopted `` turkeli '' , it would finally end all the puns with turkey-the-bird . 
  $ 400k is about median for a neurosurgeon in the us . 
  right -- sorry , i meant of the top four , the candidates who might make it to round two . 
  socialism does involve public control of the means of production .
