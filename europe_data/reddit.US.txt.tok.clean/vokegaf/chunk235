  he wanted to give france , in the event of an east german incursion into west germany , the option of coming to a separate peace with the eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger nato -- warsaw pact war . 
  [ 36 ] in february 1959 , france withdrew its mediterranean fleet from nato command , [ 37 ] and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on french soil . 
  this caused the united states to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of france and return control of the air force bases that had operated in france since 1950 to the french by 1967 . 
    though france showed solidarity with the rest of nato during the cuban missile crisis in 1962 , de gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing france 's atlantic and channel fleets from nato command . 
  [ 38 ] in 1966 , all french armed forces were removed from nato 's integrated military command , and all non-french nato troops were asked to leave france . 
  us secretary of state dean rusk was later quoted as asking de gaulle whether his order included `` the bodies of american soldiers in france 's cemeteries ? 
  '' [ 39 ] this withdrawal forced the relocation of shape from rocquencourt , near paris , to casteau , north of mons , belgium , by 16 october 1967 . 
  [ 40 ] france remained a member of the alliance , and committed to the defence of europe from possible warsaw pact attack with its own forces stationed in the federal republic of germany throughout the cold war . 
  a series of secret accords between us and french officials , the lemnitzer -- ailleret agreements , detailed how french forces would dovetail back into nato 's command structure should east-west hostilities break out . 
  [ 41 ]   france announced their return to full participation at the 2009 strasbourg -- kehl summit . 
  [ 42 ] that being said , it 's not clear exactly what melenchon * means * by `` leave nato '' , either ... 
  hamon 's not going to win , though , so it 's essentially throwing out the vote . 
  a resounding battle cry of `` yolo !! '', 
  rings out over the hills . 
  seriously , though , france . 
  if you were supporting blocking the uk getting an exception to one of the eu 's four freedoms and the uk says `` fuck it , no exception , we leave '' and then votes to leave , and then six months later * france * elects a candidate on the promise of france being able to get an exception to a different one of the four freedoms or frexit referendum , that 's kinda poor form . 
   female hitler is of course not worth mentioning . 
  never vote for the lesser evil . 
  [ evanescence : * wake me up inside * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdgmjspdjr8 ) [ snip ]  do n't let me die here   there must be something wrong , bring me to life -  wake me up , wake me up inside i ca n't wake up ,   wake me up inside , save me ,   call my name and save me from the dark , wake me up   bid my blood to run , i ca n't wake up   before i come undone , save me   save me from the nothing i 've become, 
   why are so many people more worried by seing melenchon at the second round than le pen seriously , me ? 
  because le pen was going to fairly-reliably lose to macron or fillon in the second round , and neither of the latter were going to frexit ... whereas a le pen-melenchon means that frexit is in the cards . 
  melenchon may likely frexit and le pen will frexit and melenchon will be in a better position to get parliamentary support . 
  i 'm more-worried about an eu disintegration than i am some radical coming to power in france , who will worst case screw up france 's economy or social cohesion . 
  no matter what damage they cause , some years down the road , france can be off at least starting to repair that . 
  france leaving the eu may have severe consequences that are harder to put back together . 
  [ still my favorite illustration of the matter . 
  what is your source for it being us or uk ? 
  it was originally dutch , then owned by a finnish company and apparently sold to kudryavtsev . 
  cheap fusion power , human-level artificial intelligence , i dunno . 
  i did n't say that the us did n't , but we still did n't declare war . 
  / u/yuyuhunter is using a definition of `` war '' that 's predicated on the fact that north korea never formally signed a peace treaty , just an armistice , so by that definition , north korea is still at war . 
  in practice , of course , north korea is not friendly , but clearly not at war . 
  the point i was drawing was that if we 're going to go by declarations of war and peace treaties , one could as easily argue that a war never existed . 
   and eu member states alone can not be superpowers , they are too small ehh . 
  it 'd be theoretically-possible to acquire a monopoly on some sort of game-changing technological advantage . 
   i think that polls can act as a smoke screen of sorts , a voter is less likely to get informed about a candidate 's program if he sees that he 's low on polls well , it 's possible that it can create `` inertia '' , i suppose , but if you look at recent elections , both in the us and france ... well , that inertia does n't seem to be very strong . 
   also how much percentage of the population a poll represent , there 's so many people not expressing their opinion , so in the end should we really trust those ? 
  [ sampling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sampling_\\ ( statistics \\ ) ) is a well-understood field in statistics . 
  as long as you can choose a random sample from the entire population and get honest answers , you can get a representative poll with pretty well-understood accuracy . 
  sampling is used in many fields outside of simply polling humans , and it is solid and reliable . 
  you do n't need to look at a large percentage of the population -- looking at 1000 random samples , regardless of the population size , will give you a result that is off by no more than 3 % in 95 % of the times that you run the experiment . 
  those * can * still be tricky -- you ca n't * force * people to take part in a poll , so you only get people willing to take part in a poll . 
  some people will lie about making socially-unacceptable choices . 
  some people do n't vote . 
  but simply not being able to talk to a large portion of the population is n't a problem . 
  and the errors that do exist have been well-studied . 
  you 're better than us intelligence , then : the general assessment was that the ussr could remain stable . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predictions_of_the_dissolution_of_the_soviet_union  the central intelligence agency also badly over-estimated the internal stability of the soviet union , and did not anticipate the speed of its collapse . 
  former dci stansfield turner in 1991 wrote in the us journal foreign affairs , `` we should not gloss over the enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the soviet crisis . 
  yet i never heard a suggestion from the cia , or the intelligence arms of the departments of defense or state , that numerous soviets recognized a growing , systemic economic problem . 
  '' [ 8 ] -  stewart brand said when introducing the work of philip tetlock that brand 's partner had given a talk in the 1980s to top central intelligence agency people about the future of the soviet union . 
  one scenario he raised was that the soviet bloc might break up ; a sign of this happening would be the rise of unknown mikhail gorbachev through the party ranks . 
  a cia analyst said that the presentation was fine , but there was no way the soviet union was going to break up in his lifetime or his children 's lifetime . 
  the analyst 's name was robert gates . 
  [ 46 ]   on the other hand , in hearings before the u.s. senate on march 19 , 1986 , when gates ( then head of the cia 's directorate of intelligence ) was asked `` what kind of work the intelligence community was doing to prepare policymakers for the consequences of change in the soviet union , '' he responded : `` quite frankly , without any hint that such fundamental change is going on , my resources do not permit me the luxury of sort of just idly speculating on what a different kind of soviet union might look like . '' [ 47 ], 
  generally-speaking , fonts have been hardened at least somewhat against it , though you 're right that it 's not perfect . 
  anyway , that 's why it 's rare for people to be able to use unicode identifiers , even if they can use unicode everywhere else . 
  why not ? 
  i assume that the concern is preventing strategic voting , but what 's wrong with that ? 
  are you opposed to strategic voting ? 
  france 's voting system is vulnerable to the [ spoiler effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoiler_effect ) in the first round , and arguably , knowing that a candidate will not win minimizes the effect , since people can transfer their votes . 
  no , that leaves the problem intact : i 'm reading text and someone appears to be someone else . 
  there are fixes , but they are n't trivial . 
  what makes something a `` pseudo-culture '' instead of a culture ? 
  yes . 
  but his argument was one of inevitable ideological conversion and triumph . 
   any place that is not shitty and is dominated by religion is good * in spite of * religion , not because of it . 
  china , japan , and korea have n't historically been super into what we 'd call organized religion in the west ... but they 've had their own shitty periods . 
  i 'm skeptical of religion-as-a-cause so much as decline-of-religion-as-an-effect . 
   why do i , a lesbian , want to let in people that by and large , if they do n't want to kill me themselves , are ok with * someone * killing me , islam , like christianity , can be expected to undergo the same liberalizing process that 's happened elsewhere in the world . 
  you already have a muslim-majority country in europe in albania . 
  it 's seen the same moderating and secularizing process that christianity has . 
  somewhere along the line , usury -- lending money for interest -- stopped being a sin in christianity . 
  the vast bulk of the christian world was quite comfortable with [ sodomy law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sodomy_law ) up until recently . 
  the shift towards sexual permissiveness has been pretty consistent . 
  anti-miscegenation law , acceptance of skin showing , etc. 
  yes , if you go to the most-isolated portions of the islamic world , there 's a lot of support for mandating social conservativism . 
  but move out of that , get closer to the rest of the world : http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/27/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/  in other areas , however , there is less unity . 
  for instance , a pew research center survey of muslims in 39 countries asked muslims whether they want sharia law , a legal code based on the quran and other islamic scripture , to be the official law of the land in their country . 
  responses on this question vary widely . 
  nearly all muslims in afghanistan ( 99 % ) and most in iraq ( 91 % ) and pakistan ( 84 % ) support sharia law as official law . 
  but in some other countries , especially in eastern europe and central asia -- including turkey ( 12 % ) , kazakhstan ( 10 % ) and azerbaijan ( 8 % ) -- relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law . 
  in the us :  as of 2011 , u.s. muslims were somewhat split between those who said homosexuality should be accepted by society ( 39 % ) and those who said it should be discouraged ( 45 % ) , although the group had grown considerably more accepting of homosexuality since a similar survey was conducted in 2007 . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i think that there are very legit concerns about large-scale immigration into europe ... but a conservative form of islam surviving the plunge into a wealthy , educated , secular society and ideologically winning a battle in the marketplace of ideas is not one -- not unless there is great deviation from past trends . 
  a lot of the world is pretty shitty , not just the islamic part . 
  sub-saharan africa is n't all that islamic , [ especially in western africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim_world ) , but things are pretty shitty there . 
  little islands out in the middle of nowhere ? 
  things are pretty shitty . 
  india 's not very islamic , but there 's no shortage of shitty situations there . 
  china was shitty for a long time , and it 's not islamic . 
  south america 's not islamic , and it 's got plenty of shitty places . 
  things are , by europe 's standards , shitty in a great deal of the world . 
  and most of that world is n't the islamic-heavy mena-and-indonesia . 
  you can argue for why things are awesome in europe and * some * related places for a long time . 
  you 've a million people with their own explanations : * guns , germs , and steel * , racial arguments , the material written on the [ great divergence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) , claims about ideology or luck -- there 's no universally-accepted answer , and it was probably a combination of factors . 
  but `` things being shitty '' does n't map all that well to the islamic world . 
  the islamic world is , indeed , part of the world that has a lot of problems . 
  but the part of the world where things are not very pleasant is n't limited to the islamic world . 
  and i 'd go further -- i think that people have had a very strong tendency in the past , when concentrating on one issue , to see * that * as the key element that made where they lived successful .
