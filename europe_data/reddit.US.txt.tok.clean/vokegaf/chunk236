  christianity . 
  ( protestantism used to be a popular explanation in the us until a lot of catholics showed up and things did not go to shit . ), 
  [ skull size ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craniometry ) . 
  any number of social norms in the civilized-area-that-works-well versus the-barbaric-area-that-doesn ` t. 
  capitalism . 
  democracy . 
  you name it . 
  and so i tend to be pretty cautious about accepting any one explanation , since i know that a lot of explanations that do n't - pan-out seemed pretty obviously correct to people in the past . 
  hey hey !, 
  the mongolian navy finally gets some coastline , i see !, 
  also , this map is very , very clearly made by a canadian . 
  no , neither do most muslim migrants . 
  about 6 % of europe 's population is muslim . 
  if they did , europe would long since have stopped functioning . 
   as one british jihadi wrote in a recruitment guide for the organisation : `` when we descend on the streets of london , paris and washington ... not only will we spill your blood , but we will also demolish your statues , erase your history and , most painfully , convert your children who will then go on to champion our name and curse their forefathers . '' very khrushchev [ `` we will bury you '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_will_bury_you ) . 
   while addressing westerners at the embassy on november 18 , 1956 , in the presence of polish communist statesman w\u0142adys\u0142aw gomu\u0142ka , khrushchev said : `` about the capitalist states , it does n't depend on you whether or not we exist . 
  if you do n't like us , do n't accept our invitations , and do n't invite us to come to see you . 
  whether you like it or not , history is on our side . 
  we will bury you !, 
  '' [ 5 ] -  in a 1961 speech at the institute of marxism -- leninism in moscow , khrushchev said , that `` peaceful coexistence '' for the ussr means `` intense , economic , political and ideological struggle between the proletariat and the aggressive forces of imperialism in the world arena '' . 
  [ 7 ] later , on august 24 , 1963 , khrushchev remarked in his speech in yugoslavia , `` i once said , ` we will bury you , ' and i got into trouble with it . 
  of course we will not bury you with a shovel . 
  your own working class will bury you , '' [ 8 ] a reference [ citation needed ] to the marxist saying , `` the proletariat is the undertaker of capitalism '' , based on the concluding statement in chapter 1 of the communist manifesto : `` what the bourgeoisie therefore produces , above all , are its own grave-diggers . 
  its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable . '', 
  many people use the term `` europe '' as a synonym for `` eu '' , and in that sense , `` europe `` means something different ... and not inclusive of switzerland or norway . 
   and turkey , well turkey is not europe , it 's asia minor , a gateway to asia . 
  in all fairness , the error is one i 've seen a number of times stateside , too . 
  also , while silicon valley is a name for a place in northern california , `` silicone valley '' is sometimes used for a place in southern california : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_fernando_valley  the valley became the pioneering region for producing adult films in the 1970s and grew to become home to a multibillion-dollar pornography industry , earning the monikers `` porn valley '' , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] `` silicone valley '' ( in contrast to silicon valley , nickname for the santa clara valley ) [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] and `` san pornando valley '' . 
  [ 31 ] [ 32 ] the leading trade paper for the industry , avn magazine , is based in the northwest valley , as were a majority of u.s. adult video and magazine distributors . 
  the paul thomas anderson film , boogie nights explores these aspects of the valley . 
  according to the hbo series pornucopia , at one time , nearly 90 % of all legally distributed pornographic films made in the united states are either filmed in or produced by studios based in the san fernando valley . 
  well , you 've got some people using `` european '' as a synonym for `` being in the eu '' , apparently to parallel `` american '' ( which is an ambiguous term if your schools teach that `` america '' is a single continent '' ) ; for them , switzerland is n't part of europe , norway is n't part of europe , maybe part of south america is and countries can join and leave europe . 
  you 've got the crowd that says that turkey is n't european . 
  people who say that russia is n't european . 
  the british use `` europe '' to refer to the mainland in contrast to themselves . 
  whereas over here , if you said `` europe '' or `` european '' , you 'd just be talking about the sort of definition that you 'd find in the atlas . 
  well , it had the [ * exxon valdez * oil spill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exxon_valdez_oil_spill ) , and it looks like it has [ nunathloogagamiutbingoi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nunathloogagamiutbingoi_dunes ) . 
  i dunno about both at once . 
  ireland 's still got a ban on blasphemy on the books , with up to a two year prison sentence . 
   since when on earth are flamethrowers and grenade launchers a useful tool for a hostage rescue ? 
  well ... 
  okay , i 'm not familiar with the beslan situation . 
  but grenade launchers are common in crowd control situations , to launch gas grenades . 
  could be to fire gas or stun grenades . 
  flamethrowers are a little bit more out there . 
  maybe if some of your bad guys are alone in a room without hostages , and you do n't want to stick your head in and get shot ? 
  france used to have a 75 % tax over 1m . 
  i suspect that companies developed loopholes to work around this . 
  i dunno , does n't she have it in for gay people ? 
  unicode is vulnerable to similar-looking identifiers . 
  you do n't want to use it for user-selectable usernames where someone might act as an imposter . 
  ascii is fairly-resistant to that . 
  i do not understand how it is mathematically-possible for the us to have lost two ranking positions if there is only a single higher-ranked country that has moved up . 
  i am seeing * definite * potential for a flood of `` no , * this * is the worst map of europe '' submissions . 
   in the states , the situation is completely different , as ford managed to move over 900 focus electrics in 2016 , and during the first quarter of 2017 almost 700 had been sold , says insideevs . 
  that seems pretty limited too , frankly . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ford_focus the ford focus * overall * sold 202,478 units in 2015 in the us , of all engine types . 
  900 a year or even 2800 a year for the electric engine is pretty insignificant by comparison . 
  i know that talking about electric vehicles is popular and trendy , but they simply are not important today . 
  one day , that might change , but that day is not today . 
  this could n't * possibly * have waited another two days ? 
   why are we all defending a stupid rock far from british lands because it controls who transits the atlantic-mediterranean , so is strategically-useful . 
  same reason that spain is doing precisely the same thing with ceuta . 
  if the uk actually wanted to attack spain , there were hundreds of years to do so . 
  nobody is doing anything particularly unusual on either side from a military standpoint . 
  nobody is likely to do so . 
  god * damn * . 
  most migrants do not actually want europe to burn . 
  one of the most-interesting characteristics of / r/europe is how differently its inhabitants define `` europe '' from , say , atlases , the un , and so forth . 
  the olympics does this too ... but then , the olympics is also political . 
  could mandate a music genre that changes each year instead of just a theme , if the issue is that it 's europop-heavy . 
  that being said , i suspect that the goal is in part to promote current artists , so you 'd want pop music . 
  i mean , the competition * is * kinda set up as a popularity contest among countries . 
  there are things that you could do to shift it . 
  i 'm kinda curious about what south korea and china and the us have as exit plans . 
  i mean , someday the hermit kingdom is gon na fall apart -- we may mispredict the date , but * sometime * it 's gon na happen -- and you 're gon na have tens of millions of people with no applicable modern-society skills dumped right between the increasingly-well-off china and the well-off south korea . 
  well , if you 're gon na go by the standard of declaring war or peace , we never declared war , so maybe there never was a korean war . 
  well , the article does say that this is a temporary measure . 
  on the other hand :  nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program . 
  -- milton friedman also , this is a subset of the borders in the schengen area -- this is `` there 's a problem at these , so we 're suspending uncontrolled access here '' . 
  the question is more what kind of changes would be required to make schengen uncontrolled at all borders again . 
  i 'm a bit skeptical that people will want to stop coming to europe on their own . 
  so either there has to be a change that reduces the pull factors ( e.g. 
  crack down on illegal employment and granting refugee status , requiring thumbprint readers on busses , etc ) , or a change in control of schengen 's exterior borders ( like having an eu coast guard that is n't going to simply bring people to the eu ) . 
   of course it would be an emigrant in new hampshire oh , clearly he ca n't be * truly * portuguese and care about solving the oliven\u00e7a crisis , i see . 
  the best response to a stabby bad guy with knives and broken bottles is stabby good guys with knives and broken bottles . 
  well ... i agree that freedom of labor * does * drive up the french unemployment rate . 
  certainly it exacerbates inequality in france . 
  that being said , i also do n't know if there 's a better ( i.e. 
  more-politically-acceptable-and-effective ) to produce economic convergence across the eu , which i think probably would need to happen in the long term . 
  taxing the french and germans and dutch and swedes and british more-heavily and simply transferring more money to the poorer countries might also work . 
  however , i think that it 'd tend to be less-politically-salable , and i think that you 'd have a lot of cynicism about money being `` stolen '' , and that the kind of safeguards that those countries might demand would be seen as politically-intrusive by other countries . 
  i 'm somewhat sympathetic to the idea that this does tend to cause the french poor to pay the bill for improving the lot of the romanian poor . 
  but i do think that at the end of the day , it is going to have to involve the french being somewhat worse-off , regardless of who in france does so , to help improve the situation of some of the less-developed countries in europe , until the two converge . 
  i also think that there is some benefit to population movement in that it will tend to drive cultural cross-pollination across europe -- same idea as erasmus . 
  i see that as a bonus , rather than a weakness . 
  it causes issues , too , like clobbering pension systems in poorer members ... but i am thinking that that 's something that can viably be addressed . 
  so , while i would n't agree much with the french left on the best policies to take , i can empathize with some of their concerns , which i agree are valid . 
  i do n't agree with the idea that the current french unemployment rate is due to the subprime crisis , though -- the unemployment rate in france [ has been about where it is since ] ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/lrun74ttfrq156n ) the 1990s .
