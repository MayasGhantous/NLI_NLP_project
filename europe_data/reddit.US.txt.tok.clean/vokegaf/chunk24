   but the f-35a is not particularly good what 's your objection to it ? 
  you could be illiberal and still respect law . 
  80 % of corbyn voters say that he 's doing a good job . 
  well , i guess that what they got is what they wanted ... 
  you always have a culture . 
  this man 's blood had a higher alcohol content than bud light does . 
  piss off , turkey . 
  that 's our schtick . 
  then the chest-pounding and dick-waving from both sides over the negotiations starts, 
  i mean , remember his speech after the referendum in the european parliament ? 
  unless he was just trying to spread venom around to lock things in a separation trajectory , it seemed pretty self-indulgent . 
  has he ever specifically detailed how he thinks the eu will fail , or just kept vaguely talking about failure ? 
  just talking about eventual failure all the time smacks of [ fear , uncertainty , and doubt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt ) . 
  you do n't have an argument , so you let thr listener 's mind supply one . 
  or if you 're a californian who is tired of being underrepresented in the senate . 
  he was left on the order of a hundred million in inflation-adjusted dollars from his father . 
  that 's a total count , not a per-capita count . 
  having a bump is n't * per se * bad . 
  was he personally corrupt ? 
  does n't he also have a german passport ? 
  i do n't like erdogan not because of `` them '' , but because he 's trying to entrench himself as a one-man-show for the long haul . 
  i think that that is likely to be shitty for turks . 
  i think that it will invariably cause problems with europe . 
  frankly , i 'd be delighted if people on here would cool down in turkey . 
  but erdogan is not turkey . 
  erdogan is just the guy presently sitting at the controls . 
  if your point is that there are people who are just looking to take out their annoyances by bitching about turkey , i agree . 
  but you ca n't equate complaining erdogan to that . 
  you do n't have to want friction with turkey to be unhappy with erdogan . 
   if they vote no , erdogan 's cabinet simply ceases to exist , which is also beneficial for us . 
  why ? 
  should n't he be around for another three years ? 
  i mean , it may kill his path to stay in power after that , unless he can gin something up over the next three years . 
  but not immediately . 
  / u/xnicolex 's question does n't require revolutionary change in the answer . 
  a non-revolutionary change would be a possibility . 
  that would probably require there to be seriously-competitive alternative parties in a position to put united russia under pressure on their policies , though . 
  technically the last was criticizing russia 's environmental policy , not putin personally . 
  `` pay '' is really a misnomer . 
  there 's no payment * per se * . 
  should be `` spend on their military what they agreed to spend on their military '' . 
   ah liberal white women i see six men , eight women , and one person who i ca n't make a good guess at , given that i 'm looking at their hair from the back/side . 
  do you want us states to break up ? 
  then why not have europe enjoy the same sort of structure that the us created ? 
  both will most-likely continue to exist , just somewhat poorer and worse-off . 
  insofar as t_d uses `` reee '' to indicate someone angry and upset about something , this is pretty much the opposite . 
  it 's people showing that they 're happy and proud of something . 
  i imagine that they 've been popular as long as people were literate and wanted to assemble to make political arguments . 
  the [ freedom to assemble ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_assembly ) was , i believe , a western innovation , so i guess you could say that . 
  certainly it 's generally-accepted today . 
  the eu is substantially more than a fta . 
  the eu [ itself has ftas with other countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) , and people do n't act like this with them . 
  i believe that not artificially restraining multinationals from existing will help make my part of the world better , yes . 
    i think that the european union is the most transparent political entity ever concieved . 
    i think that the european union is the most convoluted political entity ever conceived . 
  i am willing to bet that it is neither . 
   sure , everything is out in the `` open '' but you need a degree in political science to understand it and a willingness to go through it . 
  the same is going to be true of any government . 
  where is your model government that can be easily understood by any member it governs ? 
  i mean , i can give you a simple good-and-evil play and sell it to various voters . 
  that will probably happen every election , as candidates run on issues . 
  but that does n't give a good idea of all the reasons things are done . 
   which could have been swiftly handled like in the united states , the european union drops the ball consistently . 
  the united states is a federation . 
  it has a single federal authority in charge of immigration . 
  the eu is a confederation . 
  it has one coordinating organization which has almost no authority to actually set policy . 
  at one point , the united states was also a confederation . 
  at that point , it probably also could not have swiftly-changed much as regards immigration ( and , in fact , it had a very halting history to reach that point where it could ) . 
  note that `` swiftly handled '' does not mean that the solution is one that you will like . 
  there are many people with strongly-opposing positions on immigration , and plenty of people disagree with us policy on immigration too . 
  [ ... said the italian . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_unification ), 
  i am thinking for myself . 
  i 'm not following [ batshit conspiracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_world_order_%28conspiracy_theory%29 ) sites . 
  < checks  yup . 
  posts on / r/the _ donald and [ believes in nwo conspiracy theory ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/60n55a/i_live_in_super_liberal_massachusetts/df7zuq1/ ) , as expected . 
   you only pay the difference between what you buy and what you sell . 
  i imagine that there 's a whole [ transfer pricing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transfer_pricing ) financial industry in europe devoted to avoiding vat in high-tax locales . 
  `` yes , this custom screw made at our facility in this low-tax area adds 90 % of the value in this headphones set ... '', 
  note , interestingly-enough , that this was not a us federal requirement , but due to states individually arm-twisting the company . 
  also , i suspect that most retailers will continue to not do so . 
  true , but in terms of population size , economy size , having a single market , and having one reasonably-unified set of product standards , which i would suspect are the relevant factors , the eu is more-comparable to the us than any one member country is . 
   selling goods from different countries on one website with one interface is not beneficial for the average customer . 
  hmm . 
  if i took that sentence and made it `` selling goods from different us states on one website with one interface is not beneficial for the average customer '' , i bet that the typical american would probably very much disagree . 
  besides , who gets that concerned about having different delivery times on different items ? 
  i mean , you can get pretty much anything overnighted from anywhere in the us if you 're willing to pay for it , so i 'm sure that the eu has similar logistical capability , and i almost never purchase something online that i need * 16 hours from now * anyway . 
  amazon gives you an option to combine shipments or have things be shipped as soon as possible if different warehouses are involved . 
  voluntarily-entering into a union with germany is n't the same thing as being attacked by germany . 
  they do n't need or want saving , dude . 
  that 's not really answering the question , though -- he 's not saying `` why has n't a company in london made euroshop.eu and outcompeted amazon '' , but rather `` why does n't amazon have a single europe-wide ( or eu-wide , not clear from his title ) site '' ? 
  what do they show the prices as before you buy it , though ? 
  i would avoid using letter grades at all for product classification unless there is clearly and unambiguously in pretty much all situations one that is worse . 
  otherwise , you attach a stigma to the thing , and people purchasing it in cases where b - , c - or whatever grade is * not * an issue avoid it . 
  for example , in the us , maple syrup [ used to be graded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maple_syrup#old_grading_system ) a - , b - , etc , with lower grades having more particulate matter . 
  that grade system made sense for the * original * purpose of maple syrup , where the goal was to get sugar , and you wanted something that was simply sweet . 
  but there are cheaper ways to get sugar now , and when people are buying maple syrup , they normally do so for the maple flavor -- which comes from that particulate matter . 
  buy a grade and you get more calories for a given amount of flavor . 
  so most people really * wanted * b grade , but are unhappy about purchasing anything that looks `` sub-par '' to eat , so it was avoided .
