  finally , the industry got fed up and successfully lobbied a change through so that all of the earlier types were essentially reclassified to a grade , with a subtype `` golden '' , `` amber '' , `` dark '' , `` very dark '' . 
  now they can actually sell the stuff with more particulate matter successfully . 
  that general clusterfuck could have just been avoided by using a neutral term from the get-go . 
  say eu a grade bananas were `` banana split bananas '' or something neutral like that instead . 
  that does n't make the guy trying to sell his eat-fresh-for-lunch bananas have to slap something that sounds sub-par on it . 
  it makes for consistent eu-wide labels , but it does n't make the bureaucracy prescriptive , does n't try and attach a positive or negative sense to one or the other . 
   the bendy banana law is literally just a standard for grading bananas you can sell any bananas you want just fine i feel like there needs to be an eu issues wiki , with things like the bendy banana page , because i suspect that this thread has been repeated ten thousand times over , with the same arguments on each side . 
  easier to just aim everyone at the wiki and have it updated with any expansion on the point than to repeat the argument . 
    excise   okay i 'll say it , it 's bloody excess . 
  i 'm not sure whether you 're joking , but [ excise tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/excise ) is indeed a thing . 
  symbolic , that . 
  `` you have been made moderator of / r/schland ! '', 
  i do n't know , but i 'll throw guesses out there : * not all of europe is part of the [ european single market ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_single_market ) . 
  you could maybe do an eu-wide one , but not all of europe . 
  * automatically setting settings , like language and currency . 
  sure , you could manually-select it too , but ... * amazon is a front for third-party sellers as well . 
  some of them may not ship everywhere in europe or the eu . 
  * i do n't know how amazon currently handles vendors having currency conversions -- whether the vendor can list an item in one currency and then the currency conversion happens at checkout time . 
  a vendor may want the freedom to have floating exchange rates rather than fixgranted , as long as you 're selling within just the eurozone , that would n't be an issue . 
  * consumer protection laws differ nontrivially across the eu . 
  you do n't want to sell goods at a loss , so you have to price high-enough to take account of the country with the most-expensive restrictions . 
  for example , france imposes a [ strong return policy ] ( https://www.out-law.com/en/topics/commercial/consumer-protection/french-consumer-law1/ ) on retailers . 
  to take into account losses from that , a retailer will need to raise prices . 
  but there 's no reason to require , say , polish users to have the same elevated prices . 
  * amazon acts as a front for third-party vendors as well , and these need to be able to communicate with customers to deal with issues or disputes . 
  i assume that most of them can not handle all languages spoken in europe . 
  * amazon uses reviews . 
  these would also run into language fragmentation -- users writing and reading reviews on a product need to have the same language in common . 
  they [ defected to the soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_tiedge ) and were n't assassinated . 
  honestly , the `` do n't go assassinating people on someone else 's soil '' thing is a pretty strong taboo . 
  most developed countries do follow it -- the only reason that they can offer protection is because they in turn respect protection extended by others . 
  violating that taboo is not smart . 
   and he walked away free , without being punished for the crimes he committed as egypt 's president because the current egyptian government does n't want to reform itself i do n't see what one has to do with the other . 
  on private debt , though , the uk looks pretty good [ compared to the nordics ] ( https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-debt.htm ) . 
    also , merkel has n't poisoned anyone with polonium , not did she have anyone shot . 
    that is , to your knowledge . 
  ... i mean , yeah , kind of needs to be . 
  but there 's no reason to believe that merkel is assassinating people . 
   what exactly are we looking at ? 
  there 's a stream of events in the right sidebar . 
  clicking on an item on the map scrolls to the item -- photograph , text , etc in the sidebar . 
  this site was tracking all the events in the ukrainian fight back when . 
  i 'd stopped following it , but it looks like some entrepreneur has expanded it into a global feed for all kinds of stuff . 
  it 's covering events in russia . 
  probably easier to see at http://russia.liveuamap.com/ than the static image , which is largely useless . 
  clearly this title is in no way clickbait . 
  i 'm [ thinking that i 'd put other european countries closer to the top ] ( http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1578227/pope-francis-christmas-message-2016.jpg ) . 
  source ? 
  indirect translation to account for cultural differences ? 
  i do n't know if iceland 's ever done the civil war thing . 
  interesting how `` western values '' flip between `` christian '' and `` not christian '' . 
  we 're gon na need a stickied megapost for the weekly collection of things that the eu must do to survive . 
  degree debt is more-or-less `` good debt '' -- it 's an investment , as long as you 're getting a degree in a field that will pay back . 
  i 'd say that a bigger concern is [ overall debt ] ( https://betterdwelling.com/the-6-6-trillion-dollar-real-estate-bubble-brewing-in-the-commonwealth/ ) , and australia 's on top there . 
  i dunno , but steel is politically-sensitive . 
  i could easily believe that germany is not dumping and that trump is doing this to make steelworkers think that he 's `` looking out for them '' . 
  ... but russia has eggplants . 
  i mean , this is n't some sort of food exotic to russia . 
   the eu is not doomed . 
  [ oh , the eu is doomed all right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultimate_fate_of_the_universe ) . 
  i suppose the question becomes `` if europe is n't center , then what is the left - and right - comparison to '' ? 
  the really stupid thing about all this is that the demand comes from china and vietnam for traditional medicine . 
  i mean , we 're talking about a market for snake oil . 
  there are some ways in which china has really outperformed , and some ways in which it 's just damn embarrassing . 
  the attachment to bogus , mystical medicine is perhaps the best example of the latter . 
   americans do n't see anything `` grand '' in the eu , they see 27 different starbucks outlets in the same deteriorating mall . 
  source please . 
   not some single world government ( which would be a horrific nightmare ) . 
  eu membership is not equivalent to world government . 
   apparently , russia is one of those countries that needs a undisputed leader to stay organized , i am quite suspicious of these sorts of `` national character limits/enables x '' sorts of analyses . 
   and there was also a certain country that then held 50 % of the worlds gdp at the time throwing money at western europe like it was rice during a wedding gnp , not gdp . 
  also , the money spent was important because of the ( really awful at the end of world war ii ) situation things were in , but it was not large compared to what was rebuilt after the war . 
  the marshall plan was maybe $ 110 billion or so in today 's dollars . 
  that 's a substantial chunk of change , but it 's about on par with the gdp of hungary today -- you can think of it like `` let 's redirect hungary 's resources and people for one year to rebuilding europe '' . 
  meaningful , but it is n't nearly rebuilding germany or the other countries that got clobbered . 
  they had to do that . 
  was it a good idea ? 
  yeah , probably . 
  given the situation , i think that there was a lot of bang for the buck . 
  but it did n't make europe the way it was pre-war or even get an appreciable way there . 
  it was to get things moving again , not to fully-restore . 
  what europe is today was built by europe . 
   shit the clocks are going forward ? 
  depends on where one is . 
  [ various countries and regions ignore daylight savings time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daylight_saving_time_by_country ) . 
  looks like in europe , you guys pretty consistently use it ( except for iceland and turkey ) . 
  most of the us uses dst , but parts do not . 
  ditto for canada . 
  most of the rest of the world has either never used daylight savings time or has since moved away from it . 
  yeah , i 'm objecting to ( b ) , not to ( a ) , the bit about the weapons . 
   not in the eu they do n't also , while you [ can have an armed tank in the us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvklaa9bogu ) , you 're gon na need a federal license for it . 
  in the us as regards tobacco use , yes -- it 's a statistic i normally like to lug out when people are talking about the healthcare costs of tobacco . 
   and just boiled it down to the anti people being little englanders was that the case ? 
  why ? 
  in russia 's defense , they are one of many that selectively-arm . 
  never been a treaty saying that you got ta be agnostic in who you permit your arms manufacturers to supply . 
  probably mostly older people , though . 
  might be a net positive on pensions -- it 's profitable for the us government when people smoke tobacco , for example , because they tend to pay into social security but die off so much earlier without drawing from it that it 's a plus when it comes to benefits . 
  see the username . 
   so dumbasses in wetern europe need to stop injecting their thighs with this shit .
