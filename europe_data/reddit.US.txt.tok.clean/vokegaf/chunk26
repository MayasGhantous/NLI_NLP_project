  people buy fighter jets and operate them legally . 
  this does n't seem very cost-effective . 
  maybe infrared cameras or something are useful , but you do n't need something huge and heavy like an mi-24 for that .

   `` the u.k. will need to prepare itself to be treated as a third country , '' juncker said . 
  `` there will be no half-membership or cherry-picking . 
  in europe , the choice is to eat what 's on the table or not come to the table at all . '' i mean , europe is full of countries that cherry-picked -- it 's why there are so many circles on the venn diagram of europe . 
  i agree that the uk probably wo n't get restricted immigration combined with full esm membership , which some / r/ukpolitics users were confidently predicting pre-referendum . 
  but i 'm also confident that , whatever happens , the uk 's relationship with other european countries will look very different from , say , mongolia 's . 
   `` it 's the old kgb tricks adapted for the social-media age , '' mr. velichkov said .

  you got ta have a certain amount of sympathy for the guy . 
  he had the full attention of the news media , and now erdogan and trump are busy stealing all the `` outrageous statement '' coverage . 
  was more that christians were disallowed ( usury originally was a much broader sin ) and jews just filled the gap . 
  he feels that hitler was misunderstood . 
   le pen is a putin puppet no doubt ehhhh . 
  it is probably advantageous for putin for le pen to win , and there is probably financial support . 
  that does n't mean that le pen would simply do whatever putin wants if she wins france , though . 
  i think that the term `` puppet '' is seriously-overused on this sub . 
   i 've always said that as a jew i feel a lot safer in the us , you 're a new yorker , right ? 
  [ the last time there was a nazi in the news in new york city , he was black and did n't have any beef with jews ] ( https://nypost.com/2014/05/16/nazi-taxi-driver-who-wore-swastika-suspended/ ) . 
  edit : i 'd also add that i think that he 'd have a pretty good court case if he challenged his suspension for wearing his swastika armband at work . 
   this invasion is perfectly fine then . 
  you are free to object to muslims from the middle east and north africa entering europe . 
  i personally think that it is a bad idea ( though my objection has more to do with the fact that it is large-scale unskilled immigration , which i do not think is in europe 's interests ) . 
  my point is that you are mistaken if you are equating eu membership with muslims entering europe . 
  eliminating the eu would not eliminate the factors that cause muslims to enter europe . 
  geert wilders was convicted of hate speech by the netherlands , not the eu . 
  he was talking about immigrants in the netherlands . 
  and if the netherlands left the eu , he would have still been subject to the same law . 
  i might add that while his speech would have been legal in the us and i personally do not agree with the common-in-europe practice of having a hate speech crime , he did not get in trouble for `` even mentioning '' it -- many people have spoken about immigration , and have not gotten charged with hate speech . 
  he was at a rally encouraging a chant for throwing moroccans out of the country ; under dutch law , this is illegal . 
   i feel it has to do with the ottoman invasion are you trying to refer to muslims in general or to turkey ? 
  the eu has n't had turkey ( which is normally what `` ottoman '' tends to be used to refer to , as turkey was where the ottoman empire 's seat of power was based ) join . 
  turkey does n't have freedom of movement with other eu members . 
  the [ largest population of turkish diaspora in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_europe#demographics ) is in germany . 
  that predates the eu , and kicked off not as something that the eu was urging for , but as [ part of a work visa program -- if anything , the us , not the eu , was a factor there , building the nato coalition out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastarbeiter#west_germany ) . 
  addressed economic bottlenecks in post-war europe . 
  if you 're talking about the refugee crisis , again , the eu is n't really fundamental to this . 
  there are a few ways in which it 's been a minor contribution , but generally , if the eu vanished tomorrow , it would n't really do anything about the migrant crisis . 
  some members of the eu are part of an arrangement called the schengen area . 
  within this area , countries have gotten rid of customs checkpoints . 
  this means that it 's cheaper and faster to travel around -- it 's generally an advantage to the members . 
  think of how people can normally travel between us states without a checkpoint . 
  this made it easier for refugees to travel from a state that they could reach , greece or italy , to a wealthy state that they wanted to work in , germany or sweden . 
  the eu has tried to house refugees who * did * enter the eu illegally spread among member states instead of having them pool up in the wealthier ones . 
  this was actually something of an attempt to * discourage * illegal immigration -- that is , if you got into the eu and got assigned to , say , estonia , you were n't going to get the fat german wage that had been encouraging people to come . 
  you may have heard about this as the eu somehow encouraging illegal immigration -- it produced a lot of resistance among eu members , but it really was something of the opposite . 
  in practice , it did n't really have any effect anyway -- members were unwilling to accept refugees , and when refugees were accepted , they simply illegally left again and went to the wealthier eu members . 
  all european countries have signed the [ geneva convention relating to the status of refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) . 
  this requires a country , under certain conditions , to accept and provide welfare for and permit refugees to work and move freely . 
  the us is also a signatory . 
  the us tends to use some loopholes to avoid some of the spirit of the agreement ; germany * had * been trying to leverage the same loopholes , but was n't able to do so as successfully for geographic reasons . 
  my own view is that the convention has some significant flaws , and should be updated , but in practice , countries have not shown interest in doing so . 
  this convention is n't tied to the eu other than in that revising it is somewhat more-complicated for eu members due to some of it hooking into eu law . 
  however , generally-speaking , almost all the world has adopted this -- it 's really not something specific to the eu . 
  the [ echr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_court_of_human_rights ) , a european court , blocked italy from deporting migrants to libya , which was deemed an unsafe country . 
  this is not part of the eu , but part of a broader , europe-wide court ( for example , russia is also a member ) . 
  in fact , my own view is that the eu would be better-off as a tighter organization , a federation like the us is , in terms of dealing with this . 
  because the eu is a loose-knit organization , it can not throw its full resources towards control of the exterior borders the way the us can with the [ cbp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._customs_and_border_protection ) and does n't fully-exchange information about people who have illegally entered one member the way [ ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._immigration_and_customs_enforcement ) does in the us . 
  the basic issues that drive immigration out of the middle east and north africa are not really related to the eu -- it 's that transportation is cheap and europe is wealthy . 
  it 's the same reasons that cause people from latin america to want to work in the us . 
  just as splitting the us up into states would n't really change anything there ( well , maybe it would make the us poorer and less-desirable ... ) , so splitting the eu up would n't do much there . 
  finally , you ca n't be jailed for `` even mentioning '' either the turkish diaspora or the refugee situation . 
   the eu representatives are unelected are n't they ? 
  perhaps that is where the source of confusion is coming from . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_of_the_european_parliament  a member of the european parliament ( mep ) is a person who has been elected to serve as a popular representative in the european parliament . 
  [ 1 ]   when the european parliament was first established , meps were directly appointed by the governments of member states from among those already sitting in their own national parliaments . 
  since 1979 , however , meps have been elected by direct universal suffrage . 
  each member state establishes its own method for electing meps -- and in some states this has changed over time -- but the system chosen must be a form of proportional representation . 
  it 's comparable to how us federal representatives are chosen , if you 're from the us . 
   and do n't european politicians get convicted for even mentioning the problem ? 
  maybe you should clarify what the `` very obvious very real problem '' is . 
  for britons , intra-eu immigration was a major concern ; for germany , extra-eu immigration was . 
  if you feel that the problem is something to do with representation , then that 's a whole other issue . 
  same thing they would if they wanted a domestic policy change ? 
  edit : assuming that you 're talking about immigration from outside the eu . 
  from within ... if that is your objection , the concern is n't the eu 's bureaucracy , but freedom of movement . 
   usually when he starts talking about that putin is a good/strong leader and takes care of business/his own i just zone out and think of boobs that 's going to have an interesting pavlovian conditioning effect . 
  by m. night shyamalan . 
  fn is opposed to the eu too , right ? 
  i mean , that 'd be a marriage of convenience , not a downside . 
  no gulags in modern russia . 
  so how do they explain no chechen genocide ? 
  each member state has its own bureaucracy , and it 's about as accountable as any other representative democracy .
