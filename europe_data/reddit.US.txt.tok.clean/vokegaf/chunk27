  over the long run , every export is paired with an import and visa-versa . 
  that 's inevitable . 
  trying to [ separate the two and stockpile money ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) does n't help you . 
  wealth is simply the possession of stuff with value . 
  there 's nothing special that requires that the stuff be in monetary form , and nothing that requires that the stuff be in monetary form obtained by giving something you produced domestically to someone else overseas . 
  britain 's top export and import is `` machinery including computers '' . 
  if i produce a mechanical loom in britain , i 've now got a mechanical loom . 
  that 's wealth . 
  i could export it and get a stack of euros , and i 'd still have wealth . 
  i could take the stack of euros and trade it for another mechanical loom made in germany , and i 'd still have wealth . 
   if people are ranking soft , then remain , then hard , it shows that as soft is n't even possible then the majority would prefer to stay . 
  i do n't see why . 
  i mean , i could easily seeing someone having such a preference order . 
  the issue is just that if the eu * knows * that it can force a remain via its offer , soft wo n't happen . 
   i do n't believe hard brexit as an option would have been particularly popular , could be wrong though . 
  well , if hard is `` no free population movement '' and soft is `` continue single market membership , scratch most other things , accept unrestricted population movement '' ... i think that there are a lot of people who wanted to terminate free population movement . 
  seems that way at / r/ukpolitics , at any rate . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_territories_by_population_density  india : 399.58 / sq. 
  km   romania : 83/sq . 
  km india 's pretty crowded , frankly . 
  yes , i 'll grant that . 
  i would have liked a ranked-choice option . 
  however , i think it would n't have been able to viably produce a remain ( might have gotten a soft brexit ) for [ this reason ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/610kyy/richard_branson_calls_for_second_brexit/dfb2y2p/ ) . 
  < glances meaningfully at scotland  sturgeon 's asking for a new referendum two years after the last one , based on the fact that voters then did n't know that the conditions of scotland staying would involve this . 
  if voters for brexit learning what the conditions of brexit are , surely they could have a referendum on accepting it . 
  true , but a semantic quibble . 
  it 's not terribly-controversial for people to have the option to choose not to vote . 
   there are referendums in the us on state level . 
  only some states do this . 
  while i am sympathetic to the position and rather feel the same way , that the referendum as-asked let all the leave choices combine : * it would need to be ranked choice , to prevent abusing the [ spoiler effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoiler_effect ) in favor of remain . 
  * voting for `` soft brexit , then remain , then hard brexit '' would effectively cut the legs out from under the british government 's negotiating position . 
  the eu , which would prefer remain , would simply refuse to offer a soft brexit deal , knowing that refusing to do so would force the uk to remain . 
  i am not sure how to repair this . 
  one possibility would be to do a ranked choice vote between these three options : `` soft -  hard if not possible '' , `` hard '' , `` remain '' . 
  having a soft preferred to remain preferred to hard would not work , since the eu would simply force remain . 
  * while a second referendum could certainly have a * somewhat * more-informed populace , and i think could be done better , the core objection that i have remains : it is hard for people to judge the reliability of the claims . 
  i assumed that this was because they did n't want to be visible to police , but : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/begging#finland  begging has been legal in finland since 1987 when the poor law was invalidated . 
  in 2003 , the public order act replaced any local government rules and completely decriminalized begging . 
  [ 20 ] why would non-beggars register but beggars not register ? 
   some building ca n't be built on , nor destroy , simply because they are consider of architectural value . 
  well , it 's certainly true that to build upwards , there would need to be a cap on the amount of the city that is restricted from construction . 
  it looks like the weakest and largest sense of `` protected '' in london is a `` conservation area '' : one has to get permission to build in such an area . 
  [ this document ] ( http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/40house/background_doc_k.pdf ) estimates that half of london 's housing stock might be covered by this . 
  i do n't know how easy it is to get approval with a height increase , but i suspect that , in practice , it 's not necessary to restrict increasing the height of half of london 's housing stock to maintain a pleasant environment . 
  the issue of designated historic buildings and areas was [ covered in this * the atlantic * article on the subject ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-skyscrapers-can-save-the-city/308387/ ) -- it urges creating a fixed number of buildings that may be protected , and beyond that , preservationists must choose things to remove from the list : adding something means removing something else :  second , historic preservation should be limited and well defined . 
  landmarking a masterpiece like the flatiron building or the old penn station is sensible . 
  preserving a post-war glazed-brick building is absurd . 
  but where do you draw the line between those two extremes ? 
  my own preference is that , in a city like new york , the landmarks preservation commission should have a fixed number of buildings , perhaps 5,000 , that it may protect . 
  the commission can change its chosen architectural gems , but it needs to do so slowly . 
  it should n't be able to change its rules overnight to stop construction in some previously unprotected area . 
  if the commission wants to preserve a whole district , then let it spread its 5,000-building mandate across the area . 
  perhaps 5,000 buildings are too few ; but without some sort of limit , any regulatory agency will constantly try to increase its scope . 
  the problem gets thornier in places like paris , practically all of which is beloved worldwide . 
  in such cases , the key is to find some sizable area , reasonably close to the city center , that can be used for ultra-dense development . 
  ideally , this space would be near enough to let its residents enjoy walking to the beautiful streets of the older city . 
  -  regardless of the amount of money injected simply because demand is way higher than any possible supply . 
  i do n't see any grounds that would support such an assertion . 
  oddly-enough , i do n't see eurostat data coming up on google for this , but [ here 's ] ( https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/420e/1907312c34957023fcdff3dfd83e62d89bf3.pdf ) a ( now seven-year-old ) thesis . 
  on page 9 , it has a table with german language fluency among turks living in germany and first and second generation : | german knowledge | % first gen immigrants | % second gen immigrants | | - | - | - | | very well | 16.83 % | 32.56 % | | good | 23.76 % | 53.49 % | | fairly | 25.74 % | 6.98 % | | poorly | 21.78 % | 2.33 % | | not at all | 9.90 % | - | | n/a | 1.98 % | 4.65 % | that 's not up to par with ethnic germans , and the author says that it 's below that of other immigrant groups , like italians , but it shows a pretty-substantial shift across generations . 
  huh .

  [ i do n't see much change in the trend of the per-capita gdp ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/turkey-gdp-per-capita.png?s=turnygdppcapkd&amp;v=201701171418t&amp;d1=19170101&amp;d2=20171231 ) at that point . 
  [ april 16 , 2017 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017 ), 
  what , that one can build enough to outrun any form of demand ? 
  you think that investors would buy another , say , half-london just to fill with empty boxes in the increasingly-improbable hope that one day , house prices would start rising ? 
  because london * could * certainly have buildings that average half-again as high as the current ones , and i 'd claim that that would easily outrun anything that investors would be willing to try to gamble on . 
  london 's [ current housing stock is valued at # 2.5 trillion ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/f331cc36-9732-11e4-9636-00144feabdc0 ) . 
  are investors furiously going to throw another # 1.25 trillion into london housing buying empty boxes , putting more and more money in as prices refuse to rise , utterly disregarding the plummeting rents as they subsidize housing for more and more britons and keep throwing money in ? 
  that 'd be half the gdp of france . 
  i do n't think that they would . 
  and if that kind of money and investors that hell-bent on getting something were a concern , i 'm pretty sure that i 'd be more worried about much smaller markets being cornered . 
  this is [ a graph of george w. bush 's approval ratings ] ( https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/gallupspaces/production/cms/poll/cvfspjk4hesmzts2bc0brg.gif ) . 
  there is one overwhelming spike in approval that dominated his entire time in office . 
  you might think that it was due to a brilliant new policy or some profound act of leadership . 
  nope . 
  it was because he was in office at the time that the country was attacked , and when that happens , people rally to the leader . 
  even most of the political opposition dropped what they were doing and agreed to do whatever he needed . 
  [ fdr also peaked immediately after pearl harbor ] ( http://voices.washingtonpost.com/behind-the-numbers/2007/07/approval_highs_and_lows.html ) . 
  maybe it 's good , maybe it 's bad , but it 's what people do . 
  if the nation is under attack , they 'll accept all sorts of things that they never otherwise would . 
  erdogan needs popular support really quickly for his referendum to pass , and a public impression of turkey and turks as being under attack would probably fit the bill pretty well . 
  an international incident in which turks are being oppressed or treated badly or threatened -- well , it 'd make for good media fodder . 
  italian drivers . 
  breaking news : reddit user / u/doldenberg 's extraordinary and humane decision to go out of his way to properly-quote article text that he was referring to was the greatest act of contrition for hitler 's crimes !, 
  you are repeating the same thing that you said before , repeatedly . 
  no , i 'm sorry -- my points earlier continue to stand . 
   you ca n't limitlessly build `` high '' and you should n't be . 
  but you can build higher than anyone will be choosing to invest in properties . 
   it creates a stupid race to the tallest building that will just make a housing bubble allowing construction does n't create a housing bubble : rather , it prevents them from inflating in the first place . 
  housing bubbles have happened when people see rising house values and outbid people who would have bought the housing , thinking that they will earn money from the appreciation that has happened in recent history . 
  that creates a positive feedback loop , since the rising price itself attracts more attention from people who are attracted to the appreciation . 
  naturally , that can only go for so long , and then it pops . 
  but price is a function of demand and supply , and if supply is increasing to keep up with demand , the bubble ca n't inflate . 
  my own pet policy wish is to have a requirement to have a queue of pre-approved zoning height increases that automatically trigger as house prices rise above some metric of affordability . 
  that lets people living in an area decide on what they most-are-willing to have rise in height , but not block height increases entirely . 
  the existence of this list and policy also discourages people trying to play musical chairs with housing , since they know that sufficient demand will simply result in more supply being added to the market . 
   ( you guys know very well about that right ) . 
  we had a housing bubble -- yes , i agree , and a good portion of that was in places like san francisco , where height restrictions let a bubble inflate far more than around the rest of the country . 
  but our nationwide bubble mostly popped years back , and today , it 's the other anglosphere countries that are in a massive housing bubble , significantly-more-severe than ours at its peak .
