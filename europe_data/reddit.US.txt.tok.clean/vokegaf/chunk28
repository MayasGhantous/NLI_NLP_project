  compare the [ debt-to-income ratio on the graph on this page ] ( https://betterdwelling.com/the-6-6-trillion-dollar-real-estate-bubble-brewing-in-the-commonwealth/ ) -- they 've kept climbing out-of-sight . 
  you only take out that much debt when you think that you 've got a fantastic win and want to make a leveraged investment into it ... but we know that at some point , the music stops and the prices fall back down , and then a lot of people have a huge loss on a leveraged investment . 
   some country actualy do n't need ( more ) money for infrastructure , simply because inf . 
  cost are already properly budgeted via high tax . 
  < shrug  well , i think that few governments complain about more tax revenue coming in . 
  you can cut taxes or provide more-extensive services with it . 
   what they want is to avoid ghost town . 
  what , like with only 50 % of the apartments occupied full-time , and 50 % being used for vacationing , like ? 
  i mean , that does n't seem to be a great problem to me . 
  you mean because they might all get dumped back on the market at once and produce a price drop ? 
  well , it 's the fact that there was a bubble in the first place that drew in investment , and the fact that supply did n't rise to fulfill demand that let it get inflated . 
  by letting the bubble get inflated and forcing britons to stretch and indebt themselves for much of their future to buy in , you 're creating a long , long way down for those new buyers to fall . 
  so maybe you avoid any risk of pre-bubble homeowners seeing their house prices drop at all ... but at the cost of much-more-severely hitting anyone who buys in during the bubble . 
  and it 's not like , as a country , you 're losing anything anyway when those prices drop down low -- it just means that some young couple can move in and effectively get some wealth transferred from the pre-bubble homeowner . 
  and let 's say that all that housing does get dumped back on the market . 
  your foreign investor made a bet -- a bad bet -- that demand would be increasingly-insufficient in the future , so he could sell the housing for more than he bought it for . 
  he was wrong . 
  so now at some point , to get his capital back , he eats a loss and subsidizes housing for a briton who * does * want to live there . 
  that 's a pretty sweet deal for the uk -- someone else took a risk and paid for part of the housing for britons . 
   tourist come and go . 
  you ca n't have a city with a structure made for tourist . 
  that is simply to risky for regular people . 
  what if people do n't want to visit anymore ? 
  the city would be utterly fucked . 
  we just had an article up about how about four times iceland 's population visits each year in tourism . 
  [ paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris ) is n't [ quite that high ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_paris ) -- only about 1.5 times paris 's population in tourist visits . 
  surely if that vanished overnight , it 'd have a huge impact on paris . 
  but paris seems to be doing all right , and is n't too concerned about driving off tourists for the volatility they might represent . 
  `` have some sympathy for motives behind charlie hebdo attacks '' , the criteria in the poll , is not the same as `` supported '' . 
  i have some sympathy for the motives behind nazism -- wanting to end high unemployment and feeling cut out of the colonial game . 
  i do n't support nazism . 
  but even that standard is n't what we 're aiming for . 
  the question is how many actually * do * this . 
  there are currently something like [ three million muslims in the united kingdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  we do n't know whether this attack was related to islam -- just that the guy looks middle eastern -- but let 's say that it was . 
  in the past twenty years in the uk , there was one incident with [ two men who stabbed someone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_lee_rigby ) , one incident with [ two men who set off a bomb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_glasgow_airport_attack ) , and one incident with [ four men who set off bombs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_july_2005_london_bombings ) . 
  so that 's a total of nine people out of three million who chose to attack people in twenty years . 
  now , clearly that 's a higher rate of killings for religious reasons than non-muslims in the uk are doing . 
  but it 's also still a vanishingly-small portion of the muslims that are in the uk that have been engaged in religious violence . 
  you 're talking about 9 people who killed , and 2,999,991 who did n't . 
   while we allow different cultures and languages to co-exist we will have instability . 
  maybe . 
  is belgium unstable ? 
  switzerland ? 
  those certainly have different languages , at least . 
   stability is not a `` natural '' state . 
  that was n't really where i was trying to go -- after all , it 's not as if the current countries in europe contain only one historic people either , and unless one says that they 're unstable ... well , i think that the article author was trying to draw a distinction between things-like-germany and the eu . 
  disease did n't stop killing people just because the declaration of independence was signed , either . 
  ah , that 's a good point . 
  i mean , i 'm sure that there 'd be disruption , but it seems awfully arbitrary for it to be a concern for transport services but not for manufacturing or any other field that we 'd normally try to have an internationally-competitive market in . 
   naturally stable what does `` naturally stable '' even mean ? 
  china used to be a [ bunch of warring states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warring_states_period ) . 
  same thing for japan in the [ sengoku period ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sengoku_period ) . 
  the indian subcontinent was n't unified . 
  these are ( after some intervening nasty civil wars ) operating as a single country . 
  are these `` naturally stable '' ? 
  was japan fated to , in some way , come together ? 
  is japan a `` naturally stable '' chain of islands ? 
  what about germany ? 
  is a unified germany the natural state of being , or should it have been the holy roman empire ? 
  should greece be city-states ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i would at least be open to the idea of one region strongly-incompatible with the others in some fundamental way . 
  but the article does n't seem to indicate * why * europe is n't `` naturally stable '' -- it just asserts it . 
   no country is going to let a foreign company work their domestic flights . 
  yes , but what i 'm asking is why . 
  i first ran into it when reading about domestic shipping ( probably more of an issue for the us than most countries ) . 
  i did n't see a clear and obvious reason why it was essential to have a domestically-headquartered company handling 100 % of this . 
  i could maybe understand arguments that cutting it off at will provides too much leverage , on a country 's infrastructure , but it seems like one could post requirements to maintain services or similar on a company , regardless of where its headquarters is . 
  correct . 
  that is highly asymptomatic of muslims . 
  the people who * do * are muslim , but the overwhelming bulk of muslims do not do this . 
  my summary of the article is `` it 's not economic concern , but backlash to social change . 
  the people upset tend to be relatively-well-to-do , to have a low level of education , to be older , to be white , to be religious , and to be male . '', 
  hold up . 
  i am not saying that belgium is doing everything ideally . 
  i am saying that i do n't think that it 's reasonable to claim that their policymakers `` lack a spine '' . 
   we import more from the eu than we export to the eu . 
  exports are not more important than imports . 
  i do n't really understand what externality preventing the eighth freedom to any old provider is intended to address . 
  ( the us does n't allow it either , but i 've never been very clear why . ), 
   grow a spine and do something about it !, 
  i 'm pretty confident that policymakers not enacting a policy rarely has to do with `` lacking a spine '' . 
  it 's certainly not as often as they 're blamed for lacking one . 
  the prime minister of belgium is probably not personally quaking at his boots at the thought of closing some mosque who has a member who knows a guy who was involved in an outfit that has fundraised for an organization that has engaged in terrorism . 
  rather , he 's got a list of reasons why doing this would be ineffective , counterproductive , or have bad side-effects that outweigh the benefits . 
   apparently last week turkey put tariffs on russian wheat . 
  hmm . 
  from the article :  `` our closest neighbor , turkey , has built up a strong milling industry subsidized by the government , tapping almost all the arab and asian markets on the basis of our grain , blatantly violating all wto rules , '' russian deputy agriculture minister sergei levin said march 21 , as reported by tass . 
    according to levin , russia has not assumed similar supportive measures , which is why it now exports grain instead of flour . 
  russia is complaining that in an undistorted market , russia would be milling russian grain instead of turkey -- turkey is subsidizing its milling industry . 
  assuming that this is true , it would seem to me that it would make no sense for turkey to put tariffs on russian wheat -- or at the least , the tariffs would be counterproductive to having a subsidized milling industry . 
   i think the main difference is the vat , it just shows you the difference between deregulated usa , vs. highly regulated eu . 
  i do n't see why it has anything to do with level of regulations . 
  the eu tends to rely on regressive consumption taxes , the us progressive income taxes . 
  the flip side is that the us tends to use that money to do flat social spending and the eu progressive social spending . 
   i think it 's absurd that anyone would want to ship a car over the atlantic . 
  i 'm trying to turn the lights off when i leave the room , i try to recycle , do n't eat meat , and you 're shipping a corvette across the atlantic . 
  first , sounds like an expensive way to mitigate carbon emissions in terms of utility to you . 
  i 'd bet that buying carbon offsets are more cost-effective . 
  send some money , then go off and do whatever you normally would do .
