  * detention of people trying to enter the country -- much less illegally -- is not abnormal . 
  * the japanese-american and canadian-american internments were seen in retrospect as a mistake , but the initial move was done after [ this incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niihau_incident ) , when officials extrapolated and thought that there might be large-scale support for japanese military plans against the us among japanese-americans . 
  it 's not uncommon for the same rights extended to citizens to not be extended to people asking for entrance to the country while they are being evaluated . 
  as long as the person is permitted to return home if they want , i do n't see an objection . 
  that does n't mean that it 's the right approach here , but detaining people coming into the country at the border until they are evaluated and potentially booting them out is not on par with simply arbitrarily jailing whoever is in the country . 
  edit : also , in this case , it 's not a matter of someone going to the border and asking for asylum . 
  it 's having illegally-entered . 
  it 's possible that legitimate refugee status would , under the refugee convention , block any penalties being imposed on them for breaking that law , but certainly the us 's read is that until that has been established that it 's fine to detain people until that determination has been made . 
   every single refugee should be held until their application is processed . 
  it 's expensive . 
  keep in mind that we 're talking a couple million people . 
  the us currently operates a very large immigration detention system , [ but it 's a fraction of the size that you 're talking about ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_detention_in_the_united_states ) :  from 1996 to 1998 , the number of immigrants in detention increased from 8,500 to 16,000 [ 3 ] and by 2008 this number increased to more than 30,000 . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] according to the global detention project , the united states possesses the largest immigration detention system in the world . 
  [ 6 ] you 're talking about building something a hundred times that large . 
  maybe if it had been done early-on , and the flow cut off . 
  but now ... i do n't know how viable concentration camps at that scale would be . 
  even nazi germany 's world war ii [ concentration camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_concentration_camps ) -- which , i suspect , were willing to accept standards that people would not like to bring back -- were only 715 thousand . 
  it * could * be the promised land . 
  it 's that he was n't allowed to stay and work in sweden , which does n't conflict with that . 
  let 's say that you gave all your family savings to human smugglers or something to get into the promised land and the promised land says `` no '' -- well , they 're the closest ones to take it out on . 
  on the up side , this is probably better than it being someone whose primary goal was to simply inflict terror . 
  i mentioned this concern a while back , after the swedish knifing attack . 
  sweden would be better-off requiring everyone to bring all their personal necessities and and receive notification of whether they 're being permitted to stay or not . 
  if they can stay , they go out door number 1 , to get their permanent residency papers and back to sweden . 
  if they can not stay , they go out door number 2 , directly to an airplane out of the country . 
  otherwise , the deportations are not gon na work and you 're gon na have a lot of people out-of-the-system doing stuff like this or working under the table or committing crimes to feed themselves . 
  sure , it 's an inconvenience , as people have to make sure that their affairs are in order or can be wrapped up remotely and have to arrange for someone ahead of time if they do n't get to stay . 
  but , well , if there 's a problem , it seems like it 's reasonable to impose the inconvenience on the person asking sweden to extend trust and resources . 
   the turkish government has , for example , built many dams which have submerged historical kurdish and armenian sites . 
  oh , come on , man . 
  you ca n't just build dams in arbitrary spots -- people * always * have something that they do n't want flooded that gets flooded . 
  which country in the region is better-off ? 
  hmm . 
  i think you want `` testy '' , not `` zesty '' . 
  `` zesty '' has pretty positive connotations . 
  yes , which is why i 'm pointing out that saying `` islam '' is probably painting with an over-broad brush if the concern is n't inclusive of albania . 
  why is madoff an issue in poland ? 
  i mean , it was a scam in the us -- i would n't have thought that it 'd have made polish news . 
  do you have some reason to believe that poland is unique or unusual in this ? 
  aw , shucks , thanks , poland !, 
  edit : what 's with the vietnamese , though ? 
  they do n't seem like something that would show up in the polish experience much ... 
  i assume that you 're not going to explain why albania is n't a concern . 
   europe is european , backwards piecw of shit religions like islam have no place in modern europe . 
  tell me about albania . 
   one advertisement was for a `` young girl , 14 or 15 years old , either american or german , to take care of a young child . 
  no irish need apply . '' start 'em working young !, 
   but irish nationalists launched their own , unsanctioned attack on canada in 1866 . 
  [ wikipedia : fenian raids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fenian_raids ) for more details . 
   and the irish in the us became americans . 
  and also remained irish !, 
  they were almost entirely wiped out by disease ( well over 90 % ) . 
  afaik , there are no true pure-blood native americans surviving , just because you were pretty much boned without genetic resistance to the last eleven thousand years of disease in the rest of the human world . 
  i do n't think that even with today 's resources and technology , and if they had the upper hand in resources , it 'd be possible to do that much , and neither side had the kind of understanding of disease and resistance needed in the 1400s . 
  sooner or later , the cornucopia of afro-eurasian disease was going to be dumped into the americas . 
  i mean , i doubt that even places like north korea are epidemiologically-isolated from the outside world .

  i 'm sure that the point would have been interesting , but ... 
  [ probably the french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent#number ) :  the six-continent combined-america model is used in france and its former colonies , italy , portugal , spain , romania , latin america , [ 24 ] and greece . 
  panama is in [ north america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_america ) . 
  the term '' [ central america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_america ) '' , which may be what you 're thinking of , does n't refer to a continent , but for the southern part of north america , the stuff `` south of mexico '' . 
  the us census data does n't let you put down eight identities . 
  maybe being irish is just more desirable than some other identity , but ... 
  the problem is that there is n't ownership here , and being property is kinda core to slavery . 
  i mean , they 're working really hard to describe paying for transport as `` buying '' someone to draw the parallel with slavery , but they simply do not own the person . 
  this is n't intended to diminish concerns about the practice -- paying wages infrequently in an area where someone needs the money to travel to work for someone else ( which i assume violates payroll law ) , or seizing passports is a real concern . 
  ( especially in areas where someone does n't speak the native language , which i guess was not the case here . ), 
  but ... well , the person is n't * owned * in that case . 
  there are no property rights , they ca n't be sold anywhere -- it 's just more-difficult to switch employers than it would be for you or me . 
  if they went to an embassy , they 'd still be able to work out their passport situation -- it 'd just be a pain in the ass . 
  it 's kinda like people using the term `` murder '' for someone committing manslaughter because they want to leverage the emotional connotation of murder . 
  like , the actual action here is a concern ; it should warrant people addressing it directly . 
  it does n't need a crutch . 
   `` the decision to call off johnson 's visit to moscow confirms once again doubts in the presence of added value in speaking to the uk , which does not have its own position on the majority of present-day issues , nor does it have real influence on the course of international affairs , as it remains ` in the shadow ' of its strategic partners . 
  there are 193 countries in the un . 
  how many of those do you think have more influence on the course of international affairs than the uk ? 
  i like the [ extremely subtle hint in the london flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_greater_london.svg ) that it rules the waves . 
  ehhhh ... i 'm not saying that there are n't sketchy places in the backwoods that deny and exploit lack of people 's access to a competitive labor market , but i think that `` slavery '' is really a misnomer for exploitative labor practices . 
  the state will not enforce these -- the video shows police being called in by the organization to intervene on behalf of the workers in one case -- and does not recognize ownership , and i think that the documentary is loose on letting threats from companies about police be inferred to be what police will actually do . 
  i think that people use the term because it has negative connotations , but there really needs to be a term other than `` slavery '' . 
  i 'll grant that `` exploitative labor practices '' may be too vague and broad , but ... 
  would be more-interesting to see [ per-capita stats than absolute ] ( https://xkcd.com/1138/ ) . 
  all of the top countries are very populous except for hong kong , with germany on a second tier . 
   capital punishment will , besides being a barbaric practice which should have no place in any society wanting to call itself civilized < grins barbarically  < spears another haunch of meat with his eating knife and begins chewing contentedly , 
  well , at some point we probably * will * develop a cure for aids . 
  also , treating someone 's religion as something that can `` simply be changed to something more convenient '' is , i think , not exactly understanding the role that religion plays in people 's lives . 
  i assume that you would object to someone saying `` why do n't you just only have sex with the other gender ? '', 
  and would be irritated by casual discussion of heterosexual people about how you might change your sexuality . 
  people bind up their moral and world view with religion . 
  and , finally , it 's not muslims as a group committing terrorism . 
  if muslims were -- 1.6 billion people , about 21 % of the world 's population -- humanity would have fallen . 
  it is a very small number of people among muslims who are engaging in terrorism . 
   zeit campus online : this division between politics and society is a topic of discussion across europe and also in the united states . 
  what is so special about france ? 
    chauvel : there has n't been a renewal of the political establishment for around 30 years . 
  who cares whether-or-not a politician is booted out ? 
  what would matter would be policies adopted . 
  besides , even if you wanted that , the french system is , i think , much more open to new parties gaining power than many other systems , like the british one . 
  in the us , barring an * extremely * rare splintering of parties , you have two options at the national level . 
  the democrats have been around for 189 years , and the republicans for 163 years .
