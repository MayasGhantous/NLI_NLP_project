   massacre of the civilians there were individual massacres . 
  happened on both sides of the matter , part of a conflict , and was n't the dominant factor . 
   that even consist an aim of genocide since you wanted to partially exterminate nations in order to take their land . 
  i think i already mentioned that extermination was * not * an aim . 
   knowingly forcing people to death marches is also pretty much sending them to their extermination . 
  i ca n't see any `` opsie , we just wanted to cleanse you . 
  not to kill you at all '' situation there . 
  there were widespread deaths , primarily from disease , during relocations . 
  this was n't a new phenomenon , and had been killing native americans since europeans showed up on the continent , and was responsible for the death of well over 90 % of the native american population in the americas . 
  even had european settlers wanted to do so -- which they might well not have , given the opportunity -- there was n't the technology -- probably would n't be today -- to avoid that . 
  sure , settlers saw themselves as stronger , better-fit , because unlike the native americans , they were n't dying out all over the place and seemed to have much better disease resistance . 
  but if you blame the settlers for that , it 'd be like blaming east asians for the black plague hitting europe . 
  were native americans well-treated ? 
  often , they were not . 
  they were used as pawns by various sides in conflicts . 
  the us often could n't be arsed to provide for them to a degree that modern norms would expect . 
  but the us never set out with a goal of destroying native americans , and that 's a requirement for genocide . 
   death marches are pretty much a way to eliminate people . 
  the trail of tears was not a genocide -- it was a relocation to reservations . 
  i 'm sorry , dude , but while you can find instances of people being unnecessarily killed , and you can claim ethnic cleansing and certainly unfair deals , you ca n't claim that genocide was an aim of the us wrt the native americans . 
  breivik and mcveigh did n't target specific people . 
  the submission title appears to be incorrect in that the police officer was n't shot , but stabbed -- the shots fired were from the police . 
  would it be possible to update the title and or the sticky post , particularly since the submitted article title has also changed ? 
  no , they got moved to reservations and off land . 
  certainly people died during the process , and you can say that not enough care was taken or resources put into it , but it is incorrect to claim that the goal was extermination . 
  taking land , yes , extermination , no . 
  no , just stop holding them back . 
  ireland 's still got blasphemy law in its constitution . 
  he was responsible for getting through a wide range of reforms that greatly modernized and secularized turkey . 
  i think that few statesmen have had as large an impact on their countries . 
  if you compare to the political struggles that late imperial china had against modernization , it looks really impressive . 
  freight elevators , dude . 
  so what ? 
  if the irish edition were constrained to use the same content a british one did , it would lose out to competitors . 
  hmm . 
  i 'm not aware of any point that we have intentionally put out false casualty numbers of us soldiers . 
  but seriously , it 's the fact that russia only reported on the five russian military members and not 18 russian mercenaries ? 
  this is a blip . 
  and :  moscow has not officially acknowledged the presence of the contractors in syria . 
  probably why . 
   germany had it much easier because there was n't an a powerful country left that still supported that ideology that they had been apart of . 
  germany was split in half and actively screwed-over in many ways . 
  they hardly had it easy . 
   i mean one of the biggest reasons that russians distrust the west is because everything they believed about it after the collapse of the ussr was proven by the us , france and uk . 
  the only relevance the west had to any degree that you 've listed was in that russians laundered money and used some western banks in the process . 
  many , many other countries exist and do not have the same problems that russia does , despite the fact that they had equivalent access to the same banks . 
  russia owns the vast bulk of russia 's problems . 
  well , ca n't argue with you there . 
  < shrug  you go to some blog affiliated with something you like and the same ideas percolate around . 
  you 're skeptical of the government ? 
  you wind up on some site that also tells you that the banking system is a fraud . 
  common ideas kinda slosh around . 
  i mean , you 're right that most people are n't gon na subscribe to everything there , but if you hang out on braindead right-wing websites , you 're gon na get exposed to a lotta common ideas . 
  [ wikipedia : new world order ( conspiracy theory ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_world_order_%28conspiracy_theory%29 )  as a conspiracy theory , the term new world order or nwo refers to the emergence of a totalitarian world government . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   the common theme in conspiracy theories about a new world order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government -- which will replace sovereign nation-states -- and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of the new world order as the culmination of history 's progress . 
  many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events , ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies , at both national and international levels , as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   before the early 1990s , new world order conspiracism was limited to two american countercultures , primarily the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the antichrist . 
  [ 8 ] -  right-wing populist advocacy groups with a paleoconservative world-view , such as the john birch society , disseminated a multitude of conspiracy theories in the 1960s claiming that the governments of both the united states and the soviet union were controlled by a cabal of corporate internationalists , greedy bankers and corrupt politicians who were intent on using the u.n. as the vehicle to create a `` one world government '' . 
  this right-wing anti-globalist conspiracism fuelled the bircher campaign for us withdrawal from the un . 
  american writer mary m. davison , in her 1966 booklet the profound revolution , traced the alleged new world order conspiracy to the establishment of the us federal reserve in 1913 by international bankers , whom she claimed later formed the council on foreign relations in 1921 as a shadow government . 
  at the time the booklet was published , many readers would have interpreted `` international bankers '' as a reference to a postulated `` international jewish banking conspiracy '' masterminded by the rothschilds . 
  [ 14 ]   claiming that the term `` new world order '' is used by a secretive elite dedicated to the destruction of all national sovereignties , american writer gary allen -- in his books none dare call it conspiracy ( 1971 ) , rockefeller : campaigning for the new world order ( 1974 ) , and say `` no ! '', 
  to the new world order ( 1987 ) -- articulated the anti-globalist theme of much current right-wing populist conspiracism in the us . 
  thus , after the fall of communism in the early 1990s , the main demonized scapegoat of the american far right shifted seamlessly from crypto-communists , who plotted on behalf of the red menace , to globalists , plotting on behalf of the new world order . 
  the relatively painless nature of the shift was due to growing right-wing populist opposition to corporate internationalism , but also in part to the basic underlying apocalyptic millenarian paradigm , which fed the cold war ( ca 1947-1991 ) and the witch-hunts of the mccarthy period [ 14 ] ( 1950s ) . 
  -  since the 19th century , many apocalyptic millennial christian eschatologists , starting with john nelson darby , have predicted a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical new world order governing structure as the fulfillment of prophecies about the `` end time '' in the bible , specifically in the book of ezekiel , the book of daniel , the olivet discourse found in the synoptic gospels and the book of revelation . 
  [ 25 ] they claim that people who have made a deal with the devil to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a utopian world government that rests on the spiritual foundations of a syncretic-messianic world religion , which will later reveal itself to be a dystopian world empire that imposes the imperial cult of an `` unholy trinity '' of satan , the antichrist and the false prophet . 
  in many contemporary christian conspiracy theories , the false prophet will be either the last pope of the catholic church ( groomed and installed by an alta vendita or jesuit conspiracy ) , a guru from the new age movement , or even the leader of an elite fundamentalist christian organization like the fellowship , while the antichrist will be either the president of the european union , the secretary-general of the united nations , or even the caliph of a pan-islamic state . 
  [ 6 ] [ 25 ] i 've chatted with some of these people in person . 
  they are stubbornly-attached to their worldview . 
  anyway , it 's not a new position . 
  this is just ye olde right-wing wingnut views attaching themselves to whatever 's new . 
  balls ? 
  he wants to provoke a confrontation , an international incident , so that he can say that he 's standing up for an under-attack turkey , and gain the associated surge of support for him and thus his referendum . 
  why help him win his referendum by reacting ? 
  he has no reason to follow through on any of this . 
  twenty-five days from now he wo n't even have a reason to be trying to produce a confrontation . 
  just to be clear , it 's a [ tfr rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/total_fertility_rate ) , not a percentage . 
  the number is how many children you can expect an average woman to have during her lifetime . 
  located in picturesque [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany_township,_adams_county,_pennsylvania ) , i see !, 
  apparently it 's barnsta * p * le/uk , and barnstable/usa was actually named for it 378 years ago , but since then the uk renamed their town . 
  clearly this youtube video is being brigaded by polite , literate people from somewhere . 
  the title reads `` europe and north america 's * top * coffee-drinking nations '' . 
  that indicates that there is a cutoff point somewhere . 
  they did n't specify that it was `` more than n kg '' or `` the top n countries '' , but somewhere they will stop listing them . 
  it does n't list russia ( 1.7 kg ) or ukraine ( 1.4 kg ) in europe , either . 
  looks like [ you are correct ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_teenage_pregnancy ) . 
  that probably indicates a [ bimodal distribution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multimodal_distribution ) -- older women in one group , teens in the other . 
   yes , because when purging your own citizens it is essential to take help from foreign powers which can then plant sleepers and control/subvert you as needed . 
  i assume that the uk was n't doing * hiring * for czechia , but rather teaching what they did in their intelligence service to the new intelligence service ( probably not * everything * , but enough to get them going ) . 
  i 'm not saying that that 's not gameable at all , but it should have limited exposure . 
  i mean , it leaks some information , like who is in the intelligence agency , but most people who work for an intelligence agency are n't going to have that secret . 
  secondly , czechia could always double-check information with other powers ( `` britain says that communications method x is secure as far as they know . 
  is this also true for you ? '' ), 
  and pick up flagrant holes .
