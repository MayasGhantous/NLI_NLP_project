   on the other hand this is the guardian so likely bullshit . 
  * the guardian * is center-left , yes , but reputable . 
   that 's because you 're talking about latvia - state that openly violates western standards on treatment of minorities when it comes to their russian minority . 
    no such problem exists in finland for example . 
  well ... in all fairness , my understanding is that things were n't always terribly pretty as regards violent nationalism in the area if you go back a ways :  the russians consistently overestimated the influence of both extremes of finnish domestic politics . 
  when the great depression finally reached finland , its effects spawned a fascist party called the [ lapuan movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua_movement ) ( named after a town where a mob of conservative farmers had beaten up a rally of the league of communist youth in late 1929 ) , let by a rather pathetic mussolini clone named kosola . 
  most of the lapuans ' activity was mere hooliganism -- taking leftists for a ride to the russian border and bodily chucking them over the fence ... * trotter , william r. * a frozen hell : the russo-finnish winter war of 1939-1940 * .

   [ lapua movement ] ( https://www.britannica.com/topic/lapua-movement ) , ( 1929 -- 32 ) , fascist movement in finland that threatened the young state 's democratic institutions and for a time dictated the policies of the government . 
  it was named for the parish of lapua , where a fascist group disrupted a meeting of communists late in 1929 . 
  the movement , engendered by the great depression and influenced by italian fascism , espoused anticommunism and hatred of russia . 
  through 1930 the movement gained wide popular support , and in 1930 -- 31 it unofficially dominated the government , forcing it to outlaw the finnish communist party , to curb radical trade unions , and to intimidate the press . 
  the tactics of the movement included mass demonstrations and kidnapping , raids on newspaper offices , and other forms of terror . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua_movement  one common treatment was `` muilutus '' , which started with kidnapping and beating . 
  after that the subject was thrown into a car and driven to the border of the soviet union . 
  that being said in the defense of the finns , things sounded like they were [ substantially-worse on the soviet side of the border when the soviet union got control of the territory in the winter war ] ( http://www.genealogia.fi/emi/art/article255e.htm ) :  it has been revealed that the liquidations in soviet karelia were perhaps even harsher than was earlier imagined . 
  the studies carried out in the 1980s and early 1990s revealed that almost all the finnish families in soviet karelia were touched by the liquidations . 
  in particular , it seems that male finns were taken into custody , shot on the spot after the `` trial '' , put to hard labour or deported to distant places like northern russia ; siberia and central asia . 
  virtually all the important figures of finnish origin were liquidated . 
    dr irina takala of petrozavodsk university and other researchers have been able to find the lists of arrests held by the ogpu in the karelian archives . 
  their findings confirm the earlier assumptions . 
  the exact number of liquidated people of finnish origin is yet an open question . 
  in 1933 there were ( according to the statistics ! ), 
  12,100 finns in soviet karelia ( 3.2 % of the population ) , while in 1939 their number was 8300 ( 1.8 % of the population ) , a decrease of 3800 persons . 
  it is possible that a great many of these people were shot for spying and treason , or died in the hard labour and concentration camps in various parts of the soviet union . 
  however , it has to be remembered that those of karelian national origin as well as russian and other ethnic groups were severely hit by the liquidations . 
   making it extremely expensive . 
  there 's already going to be content produced in those languages , and assets can be reused -- and economy of scale on those itself is worth something . 
   and at what time should things be broadcast ? 
  i do n't follow -- there are successful tv networks that span many timezones . 
   every single anti-western point can be countered with `` and you guys are getting infected with hiv '' . 
  ugh , let 's not play the whataboutism game . 
  also , russia has a problem with hiv , yes . 
  but that 's not by choice . 
  the government ca n't pass a law to get rid of hiv ( well , short of holocaust-level `` exterminate the infected '' practices ) . 
  it 's not , per se , due to a single policy that could be easily-changed . 
  and so , bringing it up is really just mocking people . 
  i am happy to criticize russia for occupying part of ukraine . 
  i am not happy to make fun of people suffering from terminal and incurable disease , many of whom had no particularly-special role in the ukraine situation . 
   explosive tourism increase of the last years . 
  apparently there were about 1.5 million tourist visits in 2016 .

   justin bieber ... american did he ever get citizenship ? 
  [ at least as of 2013 , he did n't have it ] ( http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-hollywood-plays-immigration-game-889764 ) :  bieber , it was noted , was and still is a guest of the u.s. on a o-1b temporary work visa , designated for `` individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement . '', 
  ... and i see people still talking about him not having citizenship in 2016 and whether he could get it after his assault conviction , so i think that you 're stuck with him for the moment . 
  the three largest cities in the netherlands are amsterdam , rotterdam , and the hague , and besides rotterdam and amsterdam , there 's also [ hague , new york ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hague,_new_york ) . 
  the real story here is that google 's prediction algorithm is n't good enough to guess that an irate akp supporter is more-likely to want rotterdam , netherlands than rotterdam , new york . 
  it was the non-emergency line .

  `` politicians '' ? 
  your link does not support your claim . 
  * it 's a paper from a student * suggesting that such a thing could be done * . 
  it does not say that anything exists ; the paper would n't exist if it did . 
  * the cia is n't a military organization , and this was talking about use by military organizations . 
  * `` meme '' in this context -- and maybe you understand this -- are unrelated to the context that you may be familiar with the term . 
  he 's using the term in its original sense , as they are defined in memetics . 
  not a * huge * deal , but since you said * even * , i assume that you 're calling it absurd -- in the sense of the `` image meme '' . 
  turkey does n't have an obligation to block middle eastern refugees ... and honestly , looking at what , say , croatia and other european countries often did , waving migrants on through as quickly as possible , i do n't think that turkey 's doing any worse than most european countries and more than quite a few . 
   it 's an absurd double standard i disagree . 
  the eu has freedom of movement to build toward a more-integrated collection of states , yes ? 
  so there are good reasons to want intra-eu migration . 
  but the eu is not trying to integrate with eritrea -- it does n't make geographical or economic sense for the eu . 
  french is actually a new rt addition , as i understand it .

   where hordes of africans raped scores of european women under the powerless eyes of an impotent police force `` impotent '' may not be the best adjective to use here ... 
  us abm systems are far , far too small to remotely threaten russian first-strike capabilities . 
  the us has , what , 30 anti-ballistic-missile interceptors in romania ? 
  russia has thousands of warheads . 
  the difference is that russia has placed nuclear-capable short-range ballistic missiles in kaliningrad and the us has placed a small handful , like 30 or so , anti-ballistic-missile interceptors , that ca n't be used to do anything unless someone throws a ballistic missile at you . 
  frankly , germany dropped nazism . 
  it earned respect by spending a lot of time operating in good faith with its neighbors . 
  countries in eastern europe , started working on their economy and political system . 
  do i expect every country to magically make things perfectly instantly ? 
  no , of course not , that 's not reasonable . 
  but other countries * did * do significantly more to improve their situation than russia did . 
  and the largest responsibility is going to fundamentally be on the country in question . 
  when you 're talking about `` missed opportunities '' -- let me be frank . 
  first , i am very dubious that russians would have wanted or trusted our deep involvement in the 1990s , and i think a `` stand back '' approach was warranted . 
  second , on some points , there * was * major coming-together efforts , like the international space station .
