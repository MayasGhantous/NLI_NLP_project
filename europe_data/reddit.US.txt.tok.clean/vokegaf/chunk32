  third , we sent billions of dollars in aid russia 's way after the breakup of the ussr . 
  russia 's beef at the moment is that it feels that it is not acceptable for countries like ukraine to enter into a trade association with the eu instead of russia . 
  the us position is that if ukraine wants to do that , that 's ukraine 's business . 
  i think that it is very difficult to argue against that position . 
   greater russia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novorossiya, 
   installs puppet governments the us has appointed interim governments long enough for the public of countries to hold votes . 
  it has happened that the us has supported anti-democratic folks , particularly if you go way back , but it 's rare . 
  that 's not just a moral high ground -- it 's a matter of stability . 
  a government that has popular appeal is a lot more stable than one that does n't , and democracy ensures that it does . 
   because france and the uk did n't have the technical capacity to command the operation on their own i suspect that they could have commanded it just fine . 
  they just did n't have the capability to take out air defenses safely , and the us has a lot of tools for that . 
  once the us took those down , they could use air supremacy . 
  france , we moved into vietnam to aid * you * , and long after you had begun to be involved there . 
   the sources which you have provided me are on an equal footing with russia today and sputnik - incredible amount of bias * the guardian * is not on equal footing with rt or sputnik . 
  i think that the point of the article would be that it can be affected , and trying to see what can be done . 
   just 5 years ago left leaning outlets in the us were attacking mitt romney because he saw russia as a geopolitical foe and 4 years before that obama was campaigning for his 1st term with a promise of a renewal of russian relations even after the invasion of georgia . 
  / r/republicans is full of comments along the lines of `` we told you when romney was around , and you did n't listen ... '', 
  politicians are n't a class . 
  it 's not simply `` the political right '' . 
  t_d maybe . 
  if you go to / r/republicans , things are quite a different matter . 
  this is why you keep the list of disproven bogus claims around , so that the next time the party makes a bullshit claim , you bring up 50 pages of historic incorrect claims that they 've made . 
  such as ? 
  voa will definitely cover bad things that russia does , but i do n't think i 've ever seen them lying about something or clearly promoting bogus information . 
  rt does do that , and that 's a qualitative difference . 
  fuck you , collectivist !, 
  those are probably organized commenters , not representative of actual readers . 
  the jidf used to do the same thing -- brigading the comments section of major news stories -- and so i assume that russia has folks organized to do the same . 
   as a half polish person i knew it !, 
  you guys in europe do this too !, 
   i mean for fuck sake - the cia actually has a ` meme warfare division ' . 
  source ? 
   tough on the causes of russians . 
  the * causes * of russians ? 
  what , like russians having sex ? 
  i think that it 's a good idea to distinguish between russia-the-country-with-a-foreign-polilcy-that-may-not-be-what-many-of-us-would-like and russians the people . 
   russia today is a cancerous fascist growth that is killing western democracy i 'm pretty bullish on western democracy , actually . 
  was eddard stark honestly naive ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_chapman  magazines and blogs detailed chapman 's fashion style and dress sense , while tabloids displayed her action figure dolls . 
  [ 21 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] chapman was described by local media in new york as `` stunning '' and a regular of exclusive bars and restaurants . 
  [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 56 ] us vice president joe biden , when jokingly asked by jay leno on nbc 's the tonight show with jay leno , `` do we have any spies that hot ? 
  '' , replied jokingly , `` let me be clear . 
  it was not my idea to send her back . 
  '' [ 57 ]   as a model , chapman posed on the cover of russian version of maxim magazine in agent provocateur lingerie . 
  the magazine included chapman in its list of `` russia 's 100 sexiest women . 
  '' [ 58 ] [ 59 ] chapman has also made an appearance as a runway model for moscow fashion week at the shiyan & rudkovskaya show in 2011 , [ 60 ] and for antalya at the dosso dossi in 2012 . 
  this was a list of top coffee-consuming countries . 
  mexico does n't have high-enough consumption to make the cut . 
  * top * coffee-drinking countries . 
  mexico [ does 1.2 kg/year ] ( https://fusiontables.google.com/datasource?docid=1c-fn6nse21acp0xjio1t1x0wohqfmycqyjjbqdk#rows:id=1 ) . 
  it is n't high enough to be on the chart . 
   but regular coffee might do next to nothing to you after a while . 
  that 's when it 's time to cut back for a few weeks . 
  the real problem , of course , is that the `` contract '' did n't lay it out one way or another from the start , and so there 's really no guidance -- it 'll be a matter of negotiation . 
  i 'm assuming that what is being negotiated here will not only be the terms of exit for the uk , but assuming the precedent is used , the terms of exit for any and all future members . 
  so it 's a big deal above-and-beyond just the uk for the eu . 
  it 's actually not great for the eu , since the uk has an unusually-strong negotiating position . 
  i 'd imagine that it would be in the eu 's interests if it could somehow avoid setting precedent . 
   it 's like taking a mortage , then moving out , and assuming the rest of the mortage wo n't have to be paid just because you no longer live there . 
  actually , in some states in the us , that 's how it works . 
  mortgages are * non-recourse * there -- the lender has no recourse if the borrower defaults other than seizing the house . 
  it 'll screw up the defaulter 's credit rating for a few years , but it means that borrowers can shift losses to lenders if real estate values tank and they 've put little equity into a property . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonrecourse_debt  in europe , mortgage loans secured by personal residences are usually recourse loans . 
  [ 2 ] most states in the united states also permit recourse for residential mortgages , but antideficiency statutes in a minority of states require nonrecourse mortgages . 
  around 13 states can be classified as nonrecourse states , depending on a researcher 's classification standards . 
  in developed countries , like those in europe , it 's about 2.1 -- higher than 2 ( each couple having two children ) to account for the fact that some people will die before they would have had children . 
  yes . 
  i believe that europe also tends to teach language at a younger level than does the us . 
  the fact that foreign language instruction is something that only older students will take in the us also probably makes it less-likely that someone in the us will learn a foreign language . 
  the only way that you 'll get foreign-language education in the us at a young age is if your parents are teaching it to you or if they want to shell out money for private instruction . 
  as i recall , i got * extremely * small -- not enough to be particularly useful for much -- mandatory partial-semester snippets of spanish , french , and japanese somewhere in public middle school ( iirc age 13 ) . 
  i also took as an option three semesters of spanish in high school ( so age 15-18 ) , done more because a guidance counselor vaguely advised that university admissions offices liked seeing foreign language study than because i had interest in learning it , and because spanish is the only language that would be likely to see any use at all in the us other than english . 
  [ pew : learning a foreign language a ` must ' in europe , not so in america ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/13/learning-a-foreign-language-a-must-in-europe-not-so-in-america/ ) :  in most european countries , students begin studying their first foreign language as a compulsory school subject between the ages of 6 and 9 , according to a 2012 report from eurostat , the statistics arm of the european commission . 
  this varies by country and sometimes within a country , with the german-speaking community of belgium -- one of the three federal communities of belgium -- starting its 3-year-olds on a foreign language , but parts of the united kingdom ( excluding scotland ) waiting until age 11 . 
    [ chart showing when people are required to start learning a foreign language in various european countries ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/07/ft_15.07.13_foreignlanguage_histogram.png ), 
   stands on his statement . 
  hmm . 
  the idiom in english that i think you 're aiming for is '' [ stands behind ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stand_behind ) '' . 
  might be a different idiom in spain . 
  [ here 's a pew study for hispanics in the us as a whole ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/24/a-majority-of-english-speaking-hispanics-in-the-u-s-are-bilingual/ ) . 
  | generation | speaks english only | bilingual | spanish only | | - | - | - | - | | foreign-born | 5 % | 35 % | 60 % | | first generation born in the us | 56 % | 39 % | 5 % | | second generation born in the us | 42 % | 50 % | 8 % | | third generation born in the us | 76 % | 23 % | 1 % | so , basically , until the third generation , it 's still common for us hispanics to at least have some ability to speak spanish . 
  but starting with the first generation born in the us , it 's very unlikely to only be able to speak spanish . 
  you will be able to make much more money if you know english , and you already have a public education system based on english available , so ... < shrug  and , yes , i know that `` hispanic '' is something of a misnomer in this context , but it is what it is as us identity goes , so ... < shrug  if you want to substitute latino instead , go for it . 
  i do n't know what causes the bump at second-gen , but it might be due to different sources of immigration at some point in the past . 
  ** anecdotes ** as an anecdote , one woman who i 'm acquainted who cleans at a local business can speak english enough to get by , but is n't amazing -- i believe that she was born in some other country . 
  she 's much more-comfortable speaking in spanish . 
  her daughter speaks english as well as anyone else , as best i can tell , but can also drop into spanish to talk to her mom , and while i ca n't judge spanish fluency as well as english , she seems to do okay with spanish too . 
  i 'd guess that this is kinda what a lot of people 's situation looks like -- that is , in the home , they speak spanish because it 's harder for their not-born-in-the-us parents to do english , but outside of the home , they would normally use english . 
  i 'm in california -- i 've never * needed * to personally use spanish other than on one nearby mexican restaurant that keeps a menu that 's almost-entirely spanish only . 
  the staff there is foreign-born and mostly serves a foreign-born population doing construction work and the like -- there 's normally some sort of supervisor there who also speaks english fairly well , but a lot of the staff ca n't do much english beyond the few words that you might use when ordering . 
  you could get by in some places using spanish , but generally-speaking , subsequent generations do n't actively attempt to do so . 
  i also have a number of friends who are chinese-american , the first generation born in the us . 
  they try to teach their kids ( second generation born in the us ) to speak both english and chinese . 
  generally-speaking , the only times i see people not using english are : * foreign-born people who have a hard time with english -- they had to learn it at a late age , when it 's harder . 
  * people intentionally trying to get their kids to speak it . 
  * people speaking with their relatives abroad . 
  call grandma in china , and you may be speaking chinese . 
  * as a sort of `` code language '' . 
  so , if you 're in a room and there are other people there and you two are the only people who speak a language , it 's common to drop into that language if you want to say something privately . 
  i work with people who were born in a wide range of countries -- europe , asia , south america -- and that 's a very common thing to do .
