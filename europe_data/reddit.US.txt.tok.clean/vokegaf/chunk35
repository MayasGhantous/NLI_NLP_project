  privacy could be harmed by such a proposal . 
  it would become easier for repressive governments and other institutions to track visits to sites in a domain labeled as adult and record personally-identifiable information about the visitor . 
  repressive governments would instantly have more power to monitor naive users and prosecute them for their activities . 
  it 's also implausible that a top-level domain would be effective in controlling access to chat , email , newsgroups , instant messaging , and new services as yet to be invented . 
  it 's not a recall vote , as in parliamentary systems .

   international declaration of human rights . 
  the [ * universal * declaration of human rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universal_declaration_of_human_rights ) is n't legally-binding . 
  the geneva [ convention relating to the status of refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) is , however . 
   the us however does not generally deport refugees from what i can find . 
  on the other hand , the us is geographically in a better position to avoid having people show up in the first place , so ... < shrug , 
  i mean , there 's definitely slant towards the gop , but it 's certainly not vanishingly small -- there are about 2 republican gun owners for every 1 democratic gun owner . 
  and then there are a handful of left-oriented gun organizations specifically to not be conservative . 
  < shrug  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pink_pistols  the pink pistols are a gay gun rights organization in the united states and canada .

  you would need to modify the us constitution , as [ secession is unconstitutional ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/texas_v._white ) . 
  that would require three-quarters of the state legislatures to agree . 
  the uk is somewhat unusual in that there is no written constitution . 
  i agree that parliament could , say , strip out scotland from the united kingdom , but that 's quite abnormal . 
   all of the things you propose in your second paragraph essentially boil down to draining money out of germany . 
  realistically , do you see an `` ever-closer union '' without that happening ? 
  i mean , the wealthy subsidizing the poor happens within germany ... 
  income would , at least potentially , be the most-progressive , if that strikes you as favorable . 
  easier to spread culture around if you 're in one union than two or three fragments . 
  i mean , northern europe is * wealthier * ... 
  i think that part of the issue is that the eu proper has been given relatively little power by its members , so brussels is limited to threatening accession talks . 
  that 'd be a silly reason to end it . 
  cyprus and greece i get because of territorial disputes . 
  what is france 's issue with turkey ? 
  i mean , that could be changed . 
  so , basically , it works the same way as almost all countries ? 
  countries are n't obligated to let pieces of themselves break away . 
   i 'd hardly call a place with a 15 % unemployment rate rich . 
  lower than spain as a whole . 
  it may wind up like that , though . 
  and it does n't need to be identical . 
  if what you 're worried about is market access , for example ... 
  or the eu or canada . 
  i mean , it clearly consumes resources , but how much does it cost versus how much does it cost to take sides in a cultural spat ? 
   many texans are proud to live in texas , and have special cultural heritage yet they still recognize the benefit of being part of the united states . 
  yeah , but the catalonians are thinking `` cool , i can just stay in the eu for most of those benefits '' . 
  same deal as scotland . 
  it 's not clear that the secessionist groups would have as much clout if eu membership were n't an option . 
   this is not about money my understanding is that catalonia is wealthier than most of the rest if spain and that if it did n't have to subsidize poorer areas in spain , it could keep more tax dollars though , right ? 
  you boycott when you know that you 're going to lose , though , to try to damage the legitimacy of the referendum . 
  it was n't going to pass . 
   i think eu should at least acknowledge , if not support , pro-eu independence movements * in non-eu countries * . 
  that is a very quick way to produce a lot of bitter enemies , as most countries take a dim view of another country trying to get part of them to secede to take the territory . 
  see ukraine , crimea , donbas and russia . 
   such policy would also serve as a deterrent to countries who toy with the idea of leaving the eu . 
  whether wisely or not , the creators of the eu established that at least in its present form , membership in the eu is at-will . 
  that is , the thing that holds members to the eu is only that they feel that the benefits from being in the eu outweigh the disadvantages . 
  i 'd consider carefully the consequences of making an unannounced shift . 
  you can have organizations of either form -- nato is at-will , where any member may leave when they choose . 
  us statehood is not -- when you 're in , it requires bilateral agreement to leave . 
  but the two sorts of organizations have different properties -- what members can do and rely on -- and transitioning from one to the other without explicitly wanting to do so and having members opt in may be unwise . 
  i imagine that one could have a non-journalist control group and see if there are statistical irregularities between the two .

  no , you ca n't . 
  the problem is n't logging properly-identified things , but in discovering when illicit goods are moving through . 
  let 's say that i 'm in china . 
  china lacks a free trade agreement with the eu , but i 'd * really * like to trade with the eu . 
  so i load a bunch of the steel i 've manufactured up , and take it on a ship to the uk instead . 
  the uk has signed a fta with china and charges no tariff . 
  i then ship the goods in a box in a truck with no rfid tag on it from northern ireland into ireland . 
  my cheap chinese steel is now in the eu and i 've had no pay no tariff . 
  sure , it 's nott legal , but with no hard border and thus customs to enforce anything , hard to do anything . 
  and with no rfid tag , it 's invisible to your readers ( not that an rfid tag inside of a truck would probably be readable anyway ) . 
  if a company can set up shop in ireland , unlike in other eu members , it can leverage the lower of the eu or uk tariff to that country , providing a competitive advantage over companies in other eu members . 
  the obvious fix is a hard border . 
  ireland does n't want this , since it will be disruptive , but the eu will probably require something to control smuggling like this . 
  it 's * possible * that some sort of spot checks and pre-approved passes or something could mitigate some of the issue . 
  it 's not at all clear to me how any of this supports any eu goal . 
  certainly it would be quite abnormal to sanction a country for being insulting or because one thinks that part of its population is `` dumb '' . 
  i 'm economically-right and i denounce the attack !, 
  you have not provided any positive demonstration that trump was recorded , yet you 've asserted that this was the case in a way that seems to try implying that this is certain . 
  trump 's already had to have his pr folks pull back and say `` well , i did n't * literally * mean wiretapping '' . 
  he is , frankly , an embarrassment . 
  the man has extremely little credibility at this point due to many past false statements . 
  he 's running the executive branch . 
  if he wants to be taken seriously by anyone , the onus is on him to provide evidence of it . 
  we are n't going to waste time speculating about possible worlds in which his statements have n't been disproven . 
  trump needs to shape up or shut up on his public statements . 
  i suspect that the intent was to say `` can not export to other major countries under an fta '' . 
   climate change produce a model explicitly demonstrating costs as an externality to various countries of climate change that meets with consensus agreement and where globally emission of carbon dioxide can be reduced to a dollar value , with people bidding on sequestration or other things to mitigate impact . 
  and your model 's going to have to take into account positive externalities . 
  that 's what you do if you seriously want to address a problem . 
  right now , climate change policy amounts to a vague bat to whack things with to get policy through . 
  want corn subsidies in the us , but the coastal states would never let it happen ? 
  `` pass my bill or climate change . '', 
  it 's the same as moral decay is for the right , a never-resolved problem for which almost any policy can be a solution , to get people to accept particular policies .
