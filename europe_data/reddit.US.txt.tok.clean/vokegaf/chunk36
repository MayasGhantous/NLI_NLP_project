  i personally doubt that there 's real interest among policymakers in anything much beyond climate change being used as that whip . 
  but if you 're worried , that 's probably where i 'd go . 
   ** we ** allowed the mass murdering of civilians because we started to get afraid of the unknown and started to think that everything we do not know will try to hurt us . 
  oh , i 'd say that subsequent to world war ii , [ things have actually been pretty good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long_peace ) . 
  some famines . 
   ** we ** allowed a super-power to be formed and that this super-power can pretty much do whatever they want . 
  the british empire was running around as a superpower quite some time back ; not a particularly-new situation . 
   ** we ** allowed people to be proud of something that they had no control over . 
  are you not proud that you are white , male , straight , and were born in a western country ? 
  like you had so much control over it . 
  i mean for some people those are their proudest achievements in life . 
  people should be proud of their actions and not because of certain privileges they were born with . 
  if group bonds consistently emerge around the world , probably a good argument for there being an evolutionary advantage to it . 
   ** we ** allowed patriotism/nationalism/fascism ( they are different , but close to each other ) to be on the rise again . 
  this maybe because that the things discussed in my previous point led to people thinking that their country is the best because they were born in it ? 
  anyways , no country is better than all other countries . 
  if you 're complaining about the us having a lot of patriotic people running around , i 'd point out that the eu is seeing cohesiveness issues arguably because of a lack of same : i 'd think deeply about whether patriotism is a negative and what the practical impacts are . 
  if the concern is over another world war arising somehow , i 'd question whether suppression of patriotism is the most-effective mechanism to attempt to avoid it . 
  you may not have been following the prior year of trump statements . 
   i have long said that russian president vladimir putin is no longer a communist has there been anyone arguing that putin * is * a communist ? 
  that trump was n't recorded ? 
  well , `` in the pocket of '' or `` supported by '' ? 
  i mean , if the only thing important about someone is that they 're likely to burn domestic political capital of leadership and stir up problems , then anyone who can get public support is interchangeable . 
  send some money , see if it does some good . 
  it 's not like there 's some coordinated , shadowy , legion of doom . 
  back during the cold war , if you had a communist movement in a country and someone else , the us typically was n't too picky about whoever else that was . 
  now , if he 's saying `` nothing would have happened without involvement '' , that 's probably not true . 
  those are pre-existing movements , not things fabricated from scratch . 
  but if his point is `` euroskepticism is sufficient criteria alone for a political movement to get monetary support , and the fine details do n't matter '' , i 'd buy it . 
  california anti-trump secessionist movements and texas survivalist secessionist movements have fuck-all to do with each other other than that they 're potentially disruptive for the us . 
  if one is willing to support both of them ... < shrug , 
  people in the us learning spanish ? 
  this is actually a very wonderful thing , as i see it . 
  human instruction is expensive . 
  it 's hard to improve . 
  to keep it cheap , it requires whole classes to move together at a fixed pace . 
  and yet , education is so essential and consumes so much of our time that we need to spend a tremendous amount of time in each human life , years of full-time work on it . 
  but if we could finally successfully make the jump to automated teaching ... 
  * the war prayer * by mark twain -- it was a time of great and exalting excitement . 
  the country was up in arms , the war was on , in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism ; the drums were beating , the bands playing , the toy pistols popping , the bunched firecrackers hissing and spluttering ; on every hand and far down the receding and fading spread of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the sun ; daily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new uniforms , the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices choked with happy emotion as they swung by ; nightly the packed mass meetings listened , panting , to patriot oratory with stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts , and which they interrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause , the tears running down their cheeks the while ; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country , and invoked the god of battles beseeching his aid in our good cause in outpourings of fervid eloquence which moved every listener . 
  it was indeed a glad and gracious time , and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to disapprove of the war and cast a doubt upon its righteousness straightway got such a stern and angry warning that for their personal safety 's sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended no more in that way . 
  sunday morning came -- next day the battalions would leave for the front ; the church was filled ; the volunteers were there , their young faces alight with martial dreams -- visions of the stern advance , the gathering momentum , the rushing charge , the flashing sabers , the flight of the foe , the tumult , the enveloping smoke , the fierce pursuit , the surrender !, 
  then home from the war , bronzed heroes , welcomed , adored , submerged in golden seas of glory !, 
  with the volunteers sat their dear ones , proud , happy , and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth to the field of honor , there to win for the flag , or , failing , die the noblest of noble deaths . 
  the service proceeded ; a war chapter from the old testament was read ; the first prayer was said ; it was followed by an organ burst that shook the building , and with one impulse the house rose , with glowing eyes and beating hearts , and poured out that tremendous invocation : * god the all-terrible !, 
  thou who ordainest , * * thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword !, 
  * then came the `` long '' prayer . 
  none could remember the like of it for passionate pleading and moving and beautiful language . 
  the burden of its supplication was , that an ever-merciful and benignant father of us all would watch over our noble young soldiers , and aid , comfort , and encourage them in their patriotic work ; bless them , shield them in the day of battle and the hour of peril , bear them in his mighty hand , make them strong and confident , invincible in the bloody onset ; help them crush the foe , grant to them and to their flag and country imperishable honor and glory -- an aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the main aisle , his eyes fixed upon the minister , his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet , his head bare , his white hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders , his seamy face unnaturally pale , pale even to ghastliness . 
  with all eyes following him and wondering , he made his silent way ; without pausing , he ascended to the preacher 's side and stood there waiting . 
  with shut lids the preacher , unconscious of his presence , continued his moving prayer , and at last finished it with the words , uttered in fervent appeal , `` bless our arms , grant us the victory , o lord and god , father and protector of our land and flag ! '' the stranger touched his arm , motioned him to step aside -- which the startled minister did -- and took his place . 
  during some moments he surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes , in which burned an uncanny light ; then in a deep voice he said : `` i come from the throne -- bearing a message from almighty god ! '' the words smote the house with a shock ; if the stranger perceived it he gave no attention . 
  `` he has heard the prayer of his servant your shepherd , and will grant it if such be your desire after i , his messenger , shall have explained to you its import -- that is to say , its full import . 
  for it is like unto many of the prayers of men , in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware of -- except he pause and think . 
  `` god 's servant and yours has prayed his prayer . 
  has he paused and taken thought ? 
  is it one prayer ? 
  no , it is two -- one uttered , and the other not . 
  both have reached the ear of him who heareth all supplications , the spoken and the unspoken . 
  ponder this -- keep it in mind . 
  if you would beseech a blessing upon yourself , beware !, 
  lest without intent you invoke a curse upon your neighbor at the same time . 
  if you pray for the blessing of rain on your crop which needs it , by that act you are possibly praying for a curse on some neighbor 's crop which may not need rain and can be injured by it . 
  `` you have heard your servant 's prayer -- the uttered part of it . 
  i am commissioned by god to put into words the other part of it -- that part which the pastor -- and also you in your hearts -- fervently prayed silently . 
  and ignorantly and unthinkingly ? 
  god grant that it was so !, 
  you heard the words ` grant us the victory , o lord our god ! ' that is sufficient . 
  the whole of the uttered prayer is compact into those pregnant words . 
  elaborations were not necessary . 
  when you have prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow victory -- must follow it , can not help but follow it . 
  upon the listening spirit of god fell also the unspoken part of the prayer . 
  he commandeth me to put it into words . 
  listen !, 
   `` lord our father , our young patriots , idols of our hearts , go forth into battle -- be thou near them !, 
  with them -- in spirit -- we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe . 
  o lord our god , help us tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells ; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead ; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded , writhing in pain ; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire ; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief ; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended in the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst , sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of winter , broken in spirit , worn with travail , imploring thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it --   for our sakes who adore thee , lord , blast their hopes , blight their lives , protract their bitter pilgrimmage , make heavy their steps , water their way with their tears , stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet !, 
    we ask it , in the spirit of love , of him who is the source of love , and who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek his aid with humble and contrite hearts . 
    amen . 
  ( after a pause . ), 
  `` ye have prayed it ; if ye still desire it , speak !, 
  the messenger of the most high waits . '' ... 
  it was believed afterward that the man was a lunatic , because there was no sense in what he said . 
  seems to me that that 's pretty sympathetic to turks . 
  how do you ... no . 
  i do n't even want to know . 
   it does n't seem to be just for internal consumption it 's not . 
  it 's trying to provoke a reaction soon , within the next four weeks , so that he can use the response in his referendum . 
   what do you think europe should do as a response and future policy ? 
  do you believe this problem will resolve itself on its own ? 
  well , ignore . 
  he 's not doing anything with real impact . 
  if that 's too passive ? 
  put out material that presents erdogan 's actions as being the source of annoyance for turks abroad and at odds with their desires . 
  does n't mesh well with the `` turks are threatened and only i shall save them '' narrative . 
  any response should be explicitly critical of erdogan rather than of turkey . 
  he wants a threat to turks or turkey that he can grandly step into . 
  he does n't want to be dragging turks or turkey into something about him . 
  i suspect that if you start sanctioning countries for poor press freedom or using political clout to punish political opponents that you 'll have a long list of countries to get through , and that a lot of countries will be upset about involvement in their internal politics . 
  you mean the returning-the-40-holstein-cows , the claiming that europe is a bunch of nazis and/or crusaders , having one of his ministers intentionally create a scene by trying to illegally enter the netherlands ?
