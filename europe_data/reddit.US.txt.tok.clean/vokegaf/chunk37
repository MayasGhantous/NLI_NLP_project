  that sort of thing is far below the level that i 'd expect a country to start imposing sanctions over . 
  well , ordinarily one would impose pressure with some sort of goal in mind . 
  erdogan 's putting on an act for the benefit of domestic politics . 
  he 's caused no real harm to anyone outside the country . 
  we 've got a pretty good idea that he 's going to stop soon ( and at least at the current rate , he appears to be likely to be unsuccessful to even win his referendum , for what that 's worth ) . 
  so what would the purpose be of putting economic sanctions on turkey for him engaging in his political theater be ? 
  the problems will be gone and will not have caused harm to anyone outside of turkey . 
  there was a lot of back-and-forth . 
  [ this land is my land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eviyrrjtty ) takes a while to get to the crusaders . 
   i just hope the eu sanctions turkey hard after the referendum . 
  why ? 
  he 's probably going to stop after the referendum . 
  oh , come on . 
  you 're telling me that [ these ginger locks ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jpptnvw8qao/vbfxrmq5kfi/aaaaaaaabqq/6hnw7uei7oi/s1600/bernhard%2bplockhorst%2b-%2bthe%2bgood%2bshepherd.jpg ) did n't come from the emerald isle ? 
  stuff and nonsense . 
  i can almost guarantee that mcdonald 's was * not * the first to produce a green milkshake for st. patrick 's day . 
   capitalism allows lazy people to receive an income without working for it and it is a useful tool to prevent those who are diligent and creative to be successful . 
  well , perhaps one day someone will produce something better . 
  socialism 's track record , however , has been rather worse . 
  unfortunately , if your political system advocates for global revolution , you 're pretty much lining yourself up for a clash . 
  communist organizations did a much better job of doing in their own people than anyone else did . 
   also the suez crisis showed what happened if you disobeyed the dear leader . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis#international_reaction  the operation , [ 285 ] aimed at taking control of the suez canal , gaza , and parts of sinai , was highly successful for the invaders from a military point of view , but was a disaster from a political point of view , resulting in international criticism and diplomatic pressure . 
  along with the suez crisis , the united states was also dealing with the near-simultaneous hungarian revolution . 
  vice president richard nixon later explained : `` we could n't on one hand , complain about the soviets intervening in hungary and , on the other hand , approve of the british and the french picking that particular time to intervene against nasser '' . 
  [ 286 ] beyond that , it was eisenhower 's belief that if the united states were seen to acquiesce in the attack on egypt , that the resulting backlash in the arab world might win the arabs over to the soviet union . 
  [ 287 ]   despite having no commercial or military interest in the area , many countries were concerned with the growing rift between western allied nations . 
  the swedish ambassador to the court of st. james , gunnar h\u00e4ggl\u00f6f wrote in a letter to the anti-war conservative m.p. 
  edward boyle ,    i do n't think there is any part of the world where the sympathies for england are greater than in scandinavia . 
  but scandinavian opinion has never been more shocked by a british government 's action -- not even by the british-german naval agreement of 1935 -- than by the suez intervention . 
  [ 280 ]   the attack on egypt greatly offended many in the islamic world . 
  in pakistan , 300,000 people showed up in a rally in lahore to show solidarity with egypt while in karachi a mob chanting anti-british slogans burned down the british high commission . 
  [ 288 ] in syria , the military government blew up the kirkuk -- baniyas pipeline that allowed iraqi oil to reach tankers in the mediterranean to punish iraq for supporting the invasion , and to cut britain off from one of its main routes for taking delivery of iraqi oil . 
  [ 289 ] king saud of saudi arabia imposed a total oil embargo on britain and france . 
  [ 290 ]   when israel refused to withdraw its troops from the gaza strip and sharm el-sheikh , eisenhower declared , `` we must not allow europe to go flat on its back for the want of oil . '', 
  he sought un-backed efforts to impose economic sanctions on israel until it fully withdrew from egyptian territory . 
  senate majority leader lyndon b. johnson and minority leader william knowland objected to american pressure on israel . 
  johnson told the secretary of state john foster dulles that he wanted him to oppose `` with all its skill '' any attempt to apply sanctions on israel . 
  [ 291 ] dulles rebuffed johnson 's request , and informed eisenhower of the objections made by the senate . 
  eisenhower was `` insistent on applying economic sanctions '' to the extent of cutting off private american assistance to israel which was estimated to be over $ 100 million a year . 
  as far as i know , with the benefit of hindsight , us actions over the suez were not considered to be an error and were considered to be well-grounded . 
  the potential benefits of seizing the suez were outweighed by the potential costs . 
   and price per 1 liter of gasoline higher than diesel that 's due to taxation . 
  well , you 're hearing about this * because * of a fraud investigation that successfully identified a problem , and that 's the first step to stopping it . 
   people have a fear ( justified or not ) that computers can be tampered with , or can lose their vote etc. 
  well , anything can be tampered with . 
  the problem is the ease which large-scale manipulation could occur on a computer versus on paper . 
  it 'd be a lot harder to shift a million votes on paper than via a computer . 
  that 's a warhead count , not delivery vehicles , and it 's including the reserve ( hence `` usable and not '' ) . 
  well , when you control the executive branch and the legislative branch , there 's only really one option left if you want to ineffectually flail around to show that you * really do want * to pass that policy and fight the man , but just ca n't quite manage to get it through . 
   we have around 14 000 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction  current stockpile ( usable and not ) : 4,500   current strategic arsenal : 2,600 granted , the precise numbers are pretty much irrelevant in that range , but in the name of accuracy ... 
  ... that is an extremely good point . 
  this would n't be the first time that the viking threat has descended on unsuspecting settlements . 
  we had best fortify the us atlantic coast immediately . 
  much as i am irked with russia 's policy and as ready as i am to call people out who are being dishonest or trolling ( and this * has * happened here before ) , / u/zurfer75 is not doing that . 
  * if someone were doing that , they probably would n't use a russian flair anyway . 
  * / u/zurfer75 is a mod for / r/europe * he 's probably one of the more laid-back long-term users on here . 
  i 'd get a lot more irritable reading zinging about the us than he does about russia . 
  if i were reading about people talking about how my country could most-effectively be sanctioned , i 'd probably get kinda steamed up . 
  i know that / u/zurfer75 has personally talked about sanctions affecting his life . 
  * he 's critical of putin 's policy , for that matter . 
  just like a lot of the folks from the us on / r/europe are irritated about trump ... * russia 's foreign policy is n't set by its 144m residents . 
  not much point in taking it out on them . 
  it 's not genetic -- if you picked up baby ivan from siberia and dropped him in a bassinet in whatever country you want , twenty years down the road , baby ivan 'd have the same hopes and fears as the other people in whatever country he was living in . 
  * and , yeah , russians want to be proud of their country and all that too , not just have it be a perpetual punching bag . 
  they 're gon na talk up their country . 
  they 're gon na have a different perspective on russia -- while i think that * some * of the positions are pretty bogus , some of it is going to be seeing things from the other side , and some are going to be new insights . 
  if every russian who comes through gets run off because he 's russian , you 'll get an echo chamber at least as regards russia . 
  probably does n't make things better . 
  finally , i 'd add one more point , even above-and-beyond the point that russians are n't russia-the-country . 
  russia is probably going to do some less-than-nice things . 
  [ this kind of thing is legal but not nice ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/us-and-eu-separatist-groups-to-gather-on-moscows-dime/ ) . 
  but remember ... russia 's got sanctions on it . 
  those are legal but not nice . 
  it 's going to also do things that are legal but not nice . 
  that might include unfriendly propaganda or whatnot . 
  being aware of it is one thing . 
  getting * angry * about it means that we 'd just wind up with a lot of people being pissed off for years . 
  taking a sidebar quote from another subreddit that i read : `` please do not blindly advocate for a side in a conflict , or a country in general . 
  surely there are many patriots here , but this is not the arena to fight those battles . '', 
   whenever swedish politicians talk about a `` real and deteriorating security situation in our region '' , `` new security challenges '' , `` regional threats '' it almost always means russia in veiled terms . 
  the second codephrase with potential for misunderstanding [ i 've seen today ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/5zpjc4/operation_london_bridge_the_secret_plan_for_the/dezzh9x/ ) . 
  hmm . 
  you could add a wikipedia page , actually , cite estonian sources , immortalize it . 
  those dogs were not angry , despite the title . 
  well , daycare 's different from a nanny -- you have many kids relative to an adult . 
  i was specifically saying that nannies ca n't be a solution for society as a whole . 
  the same objection would n't apply to daycares . 
   what the point is of forcing both partners to work and then give them money to bring the child to daycare has always been beyond me . 
  because it 's cheaper to have a fraction of an adult watching kids than a whole adult . 
  let 's say that you have two kids . 
  you can have one of the parents stay home and watch them , in which case it requires 0.5 adults to care for a kid . 
  or you can have a daycare . 
  this varies in the us based on state , but let 's take a quick look [ at minnesota ] ( http://childcareawaremn.org/adult-child-ratio ) 's maximum ratios : | age | minimum staff : child ratio | | - | - | | infant | 1:4 | | toddler | 1:7 | | preschooler | 1:10 | | school-age child | 1:15 | so now you 're going from 0.5 adults to take care of a kid to somewhere between 0.25 to 0.07 adults per kid . 
  that 's a lot of productivity you 've just gained , as this affects all the parents out there . 
  looking at [ oecd child-to-staff ratios ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/37864559.pdf ) , it looks like the us 's ratio is quite low internationally , so if you 're somewhere like portugal ( average something like 1:11 for 0-3 year-olds ) , you 're getting even bigger gains from moving kids into daycares . 
  and as icing on the cake , you eliminate constraints on the parent needing to be the caretaker . 
  let 's say that you need to teach someone to change a diaper , basic first aid , etc. 
  now , that 's not particularly-skilled work -- you have to teach it to every parent anyway , since they have to take care of the kids in off time . 
  so it 's not too hard to find folks who can be care-takers -- the skillset required is n't higher than any parent will already need , and there 's a huge pool of people who are capable of doing this .
