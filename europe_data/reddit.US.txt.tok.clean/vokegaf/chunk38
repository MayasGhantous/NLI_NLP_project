  * but * ... let 's say that mom is an architect , and dad is a civil engineer and each hour taking care of the kid is an hour that normally would have generated a lot of economic activity , time that you 're sacrificing if they 're the ones doing the care-taking . 
  you 're no longer constrained to have specifically mom or dad be the one doing the care-taking , so you can essentially exchange time in less-skilled work for time in more-skilled work and increase your productivity further . 
  so to the extent that you can offload child care to childcare facilities , you can make your society economically-stronger . 
  i 'm not blaming turks as a whole for not somehow `` doing something about it '' any more than i 'm blaming each individual in a country for their own leader doing something dumb . 
  germany is low , but the problem is not specific to germany , and thus it 's unlikely that the issue is any characteristic of germany relative to other eu members . 
  all of the eu-28 is [ presently below replacement rate ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:total_fertility_rate,_1960%e2%80%932015_\\ ( live_births_per_woman \\ ) _ yb17.png ) . 
  i do n't think that any country in europe manages to reach replacement rate other than turkey , which * just * manages to make it . 
  well , i imagine that you would n't have in that case , there is that ... 
  but i mean that i think that there 's a general sense that institutions should be sustainable . 
  i could live very well this year by simply running up a giant debt . 
  similarly , a country could improve the standard of living of its citizens by not worrying about bringing up the next generation to fund its pensions . 
  it could cut r&d and spend it on other things , with the cost only showing up down the road . 
  it could , in effect , trade its tomorrows for more-glorious todays . 
  but i think that ordinarily , i think that most would n't buy into that . 
  if you mean that you * personally * do n't feel any obligation to sacrifice on behalf of someone else , i 'm not arguing . 
  i do n't think that the onus is on individuals to donate to address problems . 
  i would n't say to you `` you must raise twelve children because someone else is n't raising any '' . 
  but i do think that it 's reasonable to argue for changing the system to avoid misincentives in that system . 
  i would n't volunteer to go to war . 
  but i 'd support the imposition of a draft and take my chances -- i recognize that the country needs such a system to function , even if i do n't feel that merely the generous should bear the brunt of the costs . 
  so i think that countries need to think about and provide for the long run as well , and that their people should be willing to choose a system that can function in the long term . 
   if there 's one thing i enjoy about american politics it 's the clear degree of planning that went into the government structure and branches . 
  well ... we also had a point in time where people were responsible for planning it . 
  the uk grew organically over a much longer period of time . 
  and some things in the us subsequently showed up and did * not * always show much planning . 
  * the extension of the federal constitution to the state governments was driven by court decisions subsequent to 1925 , and done somewhat ad-hoc . 
  before that , things like the first amendment applied to the federal government alone , not to state and local government . 
  so you had freedom of speech ... as regards federal law only . 
  * the fact that the supreme court could determine constitutionality was n't ever written down in the constitution . 
  the supreme court simply decided on the fact itself , which is more-than-a-bit sketchy . 
  similarly , it was not ( and still is not ) entirely-clear who correctly has the power to withdraw from treaties . 
  * numerous processes , like fillibustering , and thus some supermajority requirements , evolved organically rather than via planning . 
  * constitutional amendment proposals have no sunset date . 
  this led to many partially-passed amendments that are still floating around today . 
  * the electoral college evolved from a system that really existed to deal with an earlier system . 
  * it 's not at all clear to many , including myself , that apportioning political power in the upper house of the legislature based on state division makes sense . 
  it has some interesting properties that may not be desirable . 
  * it 's dubious that permitting packing the supreme court with more justices was originally-intended -- it 's really too-powerful of a trump card . 
  * the strength of the president and weakness of the legislature was not originally-intended . 
  * a * lot * of what makes things work smoothly in the us , like in the uk , evolves from court precedent , not from some grand plan early-on . 
  what the first amendment actually * means * was decided by many court cases -- it probably would have been much weaker if it functioned as it was originally planned . 
  * it 's doubtful that the people creating the system understood the properties of the voting system they were creating and the sort of party and political structure that would result from it . 
  washington tried to get the country to entirely-avoid political parties . 
  * the power to act militarily was intended to require more legislative commitment than is the case today . 
  * as in ( most ? 
  all ? ), 
  countries , there 's a tendency for old laws to accumulate , including largely-irrelevant ones -- there 's little incentive to take obsolete legislation off the books . 
  * parliamentary systems avoid legislative deadlock with the executive . 
  deadlock is a common occurrence in the us . 
  it 's not clear to me that it 's an advantage for this to exist in the us -- even if one wants a brake on goverment action , it seems like there could be more-effective schemes for this . 
  the comments on reddit around the brexit referendum were perhaps more gramatically-correct but often not far off in emotion . 
  it 's stupid even above and beyond that . 
  let 's say that schauble himself got hit . 
  what exactly was this going to accomplish ? 
  let 's even ignore the question of blame -- because i personally think that it 's unreasonable for the greeks to blame schauble . 
  let 's say that schauble * is * blameworthy and that the bomb * does * hit him . 
  is killing or maiming schauble going to result in the debt going away ? 
  of course not . 
  is it going to make future creditors so frightened that they will simply forgive greece 's debts ? 
  hell , if anything it might make it harder for greece to borrow . 
  basically , there 's nothing that this does to help greeks , even ignoring the question of violence and ignoring the question of blame and imagining that the bomb would have personally only affected schauble . 
  it 's a primitive `` i 'm going to hurt someone who hurt me '' response . 
  that kind of thing makes sense if it 's going to discourage someone from causing harm in the future , but it 's not going to do that here . 
  if you 're going to be angry at someone , be angry at the people who were entrusted with the greek budget and stole from the greek people , not the bank for not forgiving a larger portion of the debt . 
  this is specific to erdogan . 
  note that [ russia has a tfr of 1.78 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia ) . 
  that beats the eu-28 , but it 's still a falling population ( and in one of the least-densely populated countries in the world ) . 
  according to wikipedia , the [ highest remaining tfrs in russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_federal_subjects_of_russia_by_total_fertility_rate ) are in [ chechnya ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chechnya ) at 2.80 and in [ tuva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuva ) at 3.39 . 
  chechnya 's muslim and tuva 's the poorest place in russia , so neither quite fits the wealthy , secular , sustainable-tfr that i think people are looking for . 
  if it were 1930 , you also tended to have one-wage-earner households , with the woman staying at home -- so you have someone who effectively full-time operates the home and raises kids . 
  today , that needs to be a free-time activity , squeezed in around full-time work . 
  it amounts to two people doing work that previously would have been the work of three . 
  i mean , it does mean that we produce a lot more , and we can offset some of that via technology ( vacuum cleaners , washing machines , microwaves ) and specialization of labor ( daycares , schools ) . 
  but it 's still two needing to do the work of three . 
  in the past , the wealthy might have used nannies . 
  but you ca n't do that and have an egalitarian society . 
  human labor has to be too expensive , or put another way , just not enough people to do that . 
  on the flip side ... what if your parents had said that , or if all their generation had ? 
  well , you have three options : * europeans start having children of their own at a sustainable level . 
  * europeans accept importing people from abroad . 
  * europe suffers a demographic crash and all that goes with that ( pensions , decline in economic and other clout , etc ) . 
  in the * long run * , people are going to show up anyway if europe becomes depopulated , so option 3 is really option 2 , but deferred . 
  at present , you can , to some degree , pick where immigrants come from , their educational level , and so forth , because you 're a well-to-do place with the ability to draw migrants . 
  the us leverages the hell out of that and has almost entirely skill-based legal migration . 
  that may-or-may not be an option available in the long run , depending upon how appealing other places in the world make their societies . 
   exactly what happens when the immigrants grow old too is never quite explained it would n't be a one-off . 
  the current tfr of the eu-28 is [ 1.58 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:total_fertility_rate,_1960%e2%80%932015_%28live_births_per_woman%29_yb17.png ) . 
  that means that without immigration , after every generation , only about 75 % of europe 's population remains in the next generation . 
  if you can continuously stream in immigrants , population can be held constant . 
  but you have to * keep * doing it , since you 're going to need to replace that quarter of europe 's population that would have otherwise vanished . 
  or at least not population collapse . 
  balkans respond that they are willing to join the esm . 
   russia wants to break up nato because it is scared of itself being attacked by a military alliance 15 times its size . 
  odd , because nato was n't attacking russia , and had no treaty in place to act other than defensively . 
  until russia hacked off part of georgia and ukraine , nato had been withering -- the us had been steadily pulling people out to `` pivot to asia '' ( which plan is now on ice ) and europe had been steadily slashing military budgets . 
   being good neighbors and searching compromises is far better than being paranoid and mobilize to fight . 
  i mean , i agree with the principle , but i really do n't think that , as countries go , sweden ranks high on the `` bad neighbor '' list . 
   because no one or very few people in europe would say that we have a `` gun culture '' . 
  i 'm not sure whether that 's a very good metric . 
  i mean , i 'm assuming that the us looms larger in the public 's mind as a comparison to germany than the people 's republic of china or india , but ...
