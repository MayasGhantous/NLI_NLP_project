  the us has 3-4 times the guns-per-capita of the eu 's most-heavily-armed countries , switzerland and finland , with france and germany just behind . 
  so ... in that sense , yeah , germany looks like it 's not much on arms . 
  but those countries in europe also have about * ten * times what those-great-masses-of-humanity india and china do on a per capita basis . 
  by their standards , europe has firearms everywhere , and in proportion , by greater than the distance between the us and europe . 
  ( context : poster is canadian , and canada is more restrictive than the us on handguns , though not on long guns . ), 
  i shoulda put a / s in there , i guess . 
   baby boomers are scared for their pensions , that 's all if you planned for retirement relying upon its presence , it 's kind of a big deal . 
  what happens in 10-20 years ? 
  you talking about world war iii or the technological singularity or what ? 
  dw is the german equivalent of the us 's voice of america , the uk 's bbc , france 's france24 , etc. 
  yes , you 're correct , but i mean that i wish that the paper ballot was the only mechanism used in the us . 
  i think that e-voting trades many valuable characteristics for a few not-very-important characteristics . 
  how does that conflict with the claim ? 
  well , i suppose that 's fair . 
  i do think that you 'd have to put up with * hearing * a great deal of `` whining '' from people who did object to that requirement , though . 
  well , i disagree with you on ( 1 ) , and ( 2 ) is for recreation , not for cheaply producing meat . 
  but as for ( 3 ) , i do n't think that many people would consider it the same thing , in the same sense that many people would n't accept you banning motorcycles on the grounds that `` you could just race a motorcycle in a video game '' . 
   according to the accompanying documents -- which had some information missing -- the weapons were to be transported from ghana to commercial gun dealers in the united states . 
  i do n't see how swiss gun possession laws are at fault here . 
  their manufacturers made and presumably-legally sold weapons , probably to outside of the eu . 
  changing what a swiss citizen may possess would n't have addressed this at all . 
  well , it depends . 
  if the job does n't require knowledge of a particular language or particular skills , sure . 
  so if you pull in disproportionately low-skill workers , then low-skill workers in your country will wind up worse-off . 
  but overall ? 
  you 're hitting the [ lump of labor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lump_of_labour_fallacy ) fallacy . 
  there is n't a fixed amount of work to do -- it 's not as if larger countries wind up with higher unemployment . 
  more people also need more things done . 
  further , if you have more resources , you can do things that you could n't have done before . 
  i have * ridiculous * amounts of entertainment available to me compared to someone a hundred years ago , for example . 
   besides it 's hilarious and frustrating to see politicians rally against the eu threatening to leave the union because it did one thing wrong instead of trying to change something inside the eu itself . 
  i agree with the general principle here , but switzerland is excluded from doing that * because * it is constrained to follow rules that apply to schengen but can not legislate for schengen . 
  is it a good idea to have that structure ? 
  i mean , if the * intent * was to make switzerland unhappy so that it would join the eu , it seems like it runs the risk of driving switzerland away . 
  i doubt that this is a well-planned strategy -- it seems more like people just expressing frustration that switzerland has n't joined , and that 's not going to be a good driver for policy . 
  if the goal * is n't * to make switzerland unhappy , why not include switzerland , as a schengen member , in the group of countries that make rules for schengen ? 
  obviously , switzerland would n't be involved in making rules that were n't bound to schengen , but ... 
   and are used for nothing else but killing and harming people this is clearly not the case . 
  the vast bulk of gun owners have never killed or harmed anyone and do use their guns . 
  probably better to improve it if possible . 
  they mostly acted via bombings , yes ? 
  well , they 're presumably `` whining '' because someone is trying to force legislative change on them . 
  would you `` whine '' if a new law came down mandating that every citizen purchase and keep a gun in their home ? 
   the reason they gave was the new regulations had to be put in place as fast as possible , because the next terrorist attack might happen any day , and doing an adequate impact assessment would take months . 
  which is silly , because implementation would also take many months . 
  [ wikipedia : prussian virtues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_virtues ), 
   guns are not exactly part of `` european culture '' . 
  oh [ yes they are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ) . 
  european expats to north america wound up taking it more-seriously than europe proper did , but by global standards , guns are part of european culture . 
  holy cow , thank you . 
  i 've wanted a term for this for ages . 
   however , the eu insists there is a third unwritten guillotine around freedom of movement and shengen , under the justification that it does n't make sense to have shengen without fom . 
  i do n't agree on that , because you can penalize employers who hire illegally . 
  the swiss border is n't gon na stop a dedicated person from jumping it . 
  there was never isolation of people from being able to get in and work illegally . 
  what schengen membership does is make it hard to control bulk movement of goods . 
  so , for example , preventing the smuggling of wheat would become unreasonable . 
  did they traverse serbia ? 
  has this actually caused any problems ? 
  bombs are way better than guns for terrorism . 
  harder to control , kill more , you do n't need to be there .

  it 's all about having a wildly favorable kill-to-death ratio .

  it buys little and opens major risks .

  could be intentional . 
  lets trump be `` fighting the man , who is styming his attempt to do what he can for the common man '' even while controlling the executive and having gop control of both houses of the legislature . 
  it looks like the eu-28 have a [ tfr of 1.56 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:total_fertility_rate,_1960%e2%80%932015_\\ ( live_births_per_woman \\ ) _ yb17.png ) . 
  2.1 is required for sustainability in a developed country . 
  so each generation , about 74.29 % of the population will remain . 
  at that rate , europe 's still got about 65 generations left before it dies out -- quite a long time . 
  however , the concern is n't extinction , but other factors . 
  * european countries make use of a welfare state . 
  one of the major things a welfare state does is transfer wealth from the young to the old . 
  for that to be viable , the population can not collapse , or the burden on the children of paying for the retirement of the elderly rises greatly , since each child 's earnings must be drained to pay for more than one older person . 
  historically , children supported their parents . 
  this was n't a problem -- parents had an incentive to raise children , so that they had old age insurance . 
  however , once the state took over , parents lost some of the financial incentive to raise children . 
  * europe 's global clout and economy are a function of productivity and of the number of workers . 
  at europe 's current tfr , it will [ decline as a share of global population and economy ] ( https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/future-world-s-population-4-charts ) . 
  europe will be the only region of the world to decline in absolute terms . 
  okay , but it still really is not the troika 's job to move the greek government leftward , even if they potentially had enough influence to manage that . 
  i mean , their job is simply `` get greece to a functioning level . '', 
  the question of how to allocate wealth within the society is one for the greeks . 
  my argument is n't whether it * is * a legal ability for eu schengen members to force non-eu schengen members to adopt the rule or leave schengen . 
  my point is that it may not be advisable . 
  the benefits of forcing that choice may not outweigh the drawbacks .
