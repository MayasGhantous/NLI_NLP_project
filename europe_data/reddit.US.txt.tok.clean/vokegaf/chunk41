  the breeds , national derivatives of the dutch friesian , had become very different animals from those developed by breeders in the united states , who used holsteins only for dairy production . 
  -  whilst the british friesian is first and foremost a dairy breed , giving high lifetime yields of quality milk from home-produced feeds , by a happy coincidence , surplus male animals are highly regarded as producers of high quality , lean meat , whether crossed with a beef breed or not . 
  beef-cross heifers have long been sought after as ideal suckler cow replacements . 
  this shit is going to run for at most four more weeks of stupid posturing , until erdogan has his referendum . 
  you 're going to cut ties over that ? 
  hell , you 'd just help him in the referendum . 
  lot of that going around . 
  yeah , fair enough . 
  still , in it 's defense navassa 's a small uninhabited wildlife preserve with a non-military dispute over who owns it -- not quite the same thing . 
  gitmo 's certainly closer , though the us imposed the lease as a condition of cuban independence at a time when doing so was still legal and has n't ever claimed the territory for the us . 
  my guess is that if and when the us irons things out with cuba , that port will go back . 
  probably not , but some countries in eastern europe have some hardware that 'd be compatible with russian gear . 
  maybe spare parts purchases ? 
  also , this is something of a thing with turkey . 
  they 're talking about buying a russian air defense system now . 
  in 2013 , turkey had a chinese , russian , us , and european competitor . 
  she said that she was going to buy a [ chinese air defense system ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/why-turkey-may-not-buy-chinese-missile-systems-after-all/ ) , the [ hq-9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hq-9 ) , until she canceled the order . 
  then she apparently stated that she was [ planning to build her own ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/industry/2015/11/28/turkey-leans-toward-local-air-defense-system/76284788/ ) . 
  now she 's on the russian option . 
  could be some sort of elaborate bargaining strategy to push the price down on the [ european ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aster_%28missile_family%29 ) or [ us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mim-104_patriot ) systems , as well . 
   russia should use its special services within the borders of the united states to fuel instability and separatism , for instance , provoke `` afro-american racists '' . 
  russia should `` introduce geopolitical disorder into internal american activity , encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic , social and racial conflicts , actively supporting all dissident movements -- extremist , racist , and sectarian groups , thus destabilizing internal political processes in the u.s. 
  it would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in american politics . 
  '' [ 1 ] weeellll , i 'll grant conflict , but the whole [ moscow separatist conference ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/us-and-eu-separatist-groups-to-gather-on-moscows-dime/ ) thing seems pretty unlikely to result in much by way of actual separatism . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yes_california  the yes california independence campaign promotes the secession of the state of california from the united states . 
  [ 6 ] it proposes including a measure for a referendum in 2019 on the state 's 2018 gubernatorial election ballot . 
  [ 7 ]   the campaign president is louis j. marinelli , a new yorker who lives in russia [ 8 ] and has received significant assistance from the russian government to promote his efforts . 
  [ 9 ] the vice president is marcus ruiz evans . 
  [ 10 ] both men are former republicans [ 11 ] and marinelli says he voted for donald trump . 
  [ 8 ]   marinelli announced on december 18 , 2016 , the yes california campaign had opened an embassy in moscow as a cultural centre to help educate russians about california 's history , boost trade , and promote tourism . 
  the embassy has no legal standing . 
  [ 12 ] this 2016 event was partially funded by a kremlin-backed charity linked to russian president vladimir putin , while the anti-globalization movement of russia is providing the office space for the moscow embassy rent-free . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ]   yes california is controversial within the independence movement for advocating a `` crimean scenario '' [ 15 ] [ 16 ] for californian independence , because crimea was annexed by russia immediately after declaring independence . 
  [ citation needed ] i 'd call this more of a joke than anything that would be a concern . 
  i doubt it . 
  the uk just went through this same referendum two years ago . 
  do n't see why it would be worse now than then . 
  on an unrelated note , us [ foreign aid to tuvalu ] ( https://explorer.usaid.gov/cd/tuv ) spiked in 2015 and the us [ maintains a regular annual quantity of foreign aid to vanuatu ] ( https://explorer.usaid.gov/cd/vut ) . 
  i wonder if russia has a historical graph of publicly-released per-country foreign aid to look at and compare . 
  yeah . 
  i was speaking of some hypothetical point in time when they did ( `` if and when the terms are met '' ) . 
  guess i should have phrased that better . 
  eh , i do n't think that it 's a significant factor . 
  if putin actually wanted enemies -- and i 'm dubious that he does , as my understanding is that he 's at no real domestic political risk -- it 's not too hard to produce them if need be . 
   currently according to my personal opinion and perspective the european union is trying to move to something just short of totalitarianism . 
  [ totalitarianism ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/totalitarianism ) :  a system of government in which the people have virtually no authority and the state wields absolute control , for example , a dictatorship . 
  nah , does n't sound like it to me . 
  secular , maybe . 
  totalitarian ? 
  i 'm not an expert on islamic theology , but i am pretty confident that mohammad was not seen as perfect . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_fundamentalism  christian fundamentalism began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among british and american protestants [ 1 ] [ 2 ] as a reaction to theological liberalism and cultural modernism . 
  fundamentalists argued that 19th-century modernist theologians had misinterpreted or rejected certain doctrines , especially biblical inerrancy , that they viewed as the fundamentals of the christian faith . 
  [ 3 ] ** fundamentalists are almost always described as having a literal interpretation of the bible . 
  ** and even if you 've got a christian denomination that accepts interpretation as allegory ... what exactly what group of people takes as allegory and what literally is certainly up in the air . 
  just as there are liberal forms of christianity , so there are [ liberal forms of islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_and_progressive_muslim_movements ) :  the methodologies of liberal or progressive islam rest on the interpretation and re-interpretation of traditional islamic scripture ( the quran ) and other texts ( such as the hadith ) , a process called ijtihad ( see below ) . 
  [ 4 ] this can vary from the slight to the most liberal , where only the meaning of the quran is considered to be a revelation , with its expression in words seen as the work of the prophet muhammad in his particular time and context . 
  as a consequence , liberal/progressive muslims may then interpret verses from the quran allegorically or even set them aside . 
  so does deuteronomy no longer apply ? 
  [ deut 5:17 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut+5%3a17&amp;version=niv ) :  you shall not murder . 
  that 's part of the ten commandments , probably the single most-widely-known set of moral commands that you 'll find christians citing . 
  but let 's delve a bit further into deuteronomy ... [ deut 21:18 -21 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+21:18-21 ) :  if someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him , his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town . 
  they shall say to the elders , `` this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious . 
  he will not obey us . 
  he is a glutton and a drunkard . '' then all the men of his town are to stone him to death . 
  you must purge the evil from among you . 
  all israel will hear of it and be afraid . 
  i 'm not sure how much popular support there is for that particular punishment . 
  now , of course , * we * know that people do n't actually do that . 
  but it 'd be pretty alarming if someone were to start quoting snippets of the bible and saying `` this is what christians actually believe !, 
  they will do this in our country if they get in ! '', 
  but ... there are a lot of people who are pretty comfortable saying that muslims will do things written in the koran that clearly * are n't * being done back home , at least not in any significant numbers . 
  because there 's no way to demonstrate that russia has stopped . 
  it could be that sanctions are terminated and then the next day , another neighbor gets annexed . 
  russia has no way to prove that it will not do this , so it 's unreasonable to ask for it . 
  whatever criteria exist for lifting sanctions should be something that can be measured by russia and measured by the us/eu , and the terms should be unambiguous to both . 
  well , there are two separate goals here . 
  first , the obvious goal -- that russia return control of ukraine 's territory . 
  i 'm no expert in the area , but i am less-inclined than you to think that this is n't viable . 
  there are certainly strong political reasons for russia to not want to do this ... but i 'd add that there would have also been a long time when lithuania looked like a long shot to some too . 
  we waited ... what , forty-five years on that one ? 
  russia 's not going to want to return territory , but russia also is n't going to want to screw up her economy , either . 
  if we have to play the long game here ... well , that 's part of the nature of soft pressure . 
  you do n't just get what you want immediately -- but the decision was to go with soft pressure rather than to use hard power , and that 's going to be a consequence of that . 
  at the current rate of burn , russia has burned through about all of one of her sovereign wealth funds , is burning through the one used to fund her pensions , and while she could drain her foreign exchange reserves , i 'm not sure whether she wants to play hardball with her currency . 
  i do n't know how long that kind of pressure would be necessary . 
  russia 's economy depends [ heavily on export of oil and derived products ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/rus/all/show/2013/ ) . 
  the supply of oil on the world market determines the price of oil . 
  right after sanctions went in , obama removed our forty-year-old restrictions on exporting oil , and at the same time saudi arabia started flooding the market with oil . 
  the us blocked export of oil extraction technology to russia , so russia 's cost-of-extraction rises . 
  saudi arabia also just said that they 're going to start increasing oil production again , so ... < shrug  i dunno what all efforts are involved , but there are probably a lot of levers that i ca n't see ( and probably would n't recognize if i did -- no expertise there ) . 
  i will tell you one thing : i will believe that the people who crafted and imposed those sanctions are in a good position to decide whether-or-not they will be efficacious . 
  i doubt that they would have done so if they did not believe that they could be made to work to the extent that their designers wanted . 
  second , there 's a another goal . 
  independent of the territory itself ... it is not desirable to have countries annexing bits of countries that you 're associated with . 
  that means even if a country winds up in control of territory , the costs associated with it must be sufficient to make it regret having done so , so as to discourage it from doing so again . 
  the us , for example , has imposed sanctions on cuba for about fifty years now for seizing a great deal of us-owned property in cuba and refusing to pay for it . 
  cuba has not paid for it , and probably will not do so , but as of a couple of years ago , by my back-of-the-napkin calculations , the economic losses to cuba have exceeded the inflation-adjusted value of the property that cuba seized . 
  while people and businesses in the us wo n't be getting the property back , the us established a precedent and reputation that it wanted : seize us property , and you will be made worse-off by doing so . 
  this creates a substantial disincentive to performing such a seizure in the future . 
  there 's a cost to doing that , of course , but there 's also a value to the reputation .
