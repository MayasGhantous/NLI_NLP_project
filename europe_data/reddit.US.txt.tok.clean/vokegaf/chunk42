  you can think of finland 's fighting in the winter war as having achieved not just continued independence of part of the territory , but to having established a useful-to-finland reputation -- that you can , given sufficient expenditure of resources , take land from finland , but the price you pay will not be worth it . 
  i do n't know what the countries involved in imposing sanctions decided upon as to geopolitical goals . 
  i am not a geopolitical expert , nor privy to the concerns of the countries involved . 
  but i could certainly imagine that both of the above goals are on the agenda . 
  no , i agree there . 
  both the us and i believe the eu have separate sets of sanctions over donbas and over crimea . 
  each will terminate at the time that the issue they are tied to is resolved , if what you 're getting at is `` this should not turn into russia takes two pieces of land from a country and gives one back so can keep the second '' . 
  additionally , ukraine may have claims for damages caused . 
  i do n't know whether resolution of that was part of the terms for ending sanctions or not . 
  i mean , they 're similar in that they are n't part of the us proper , but there 's no territorial dispute regarding them . 
  that article is n't arguing that it 's unconstitutional either , just that the us rarely does it . 
  and i 'm not disagreeing with that -- there are good reasons to * not * want to do it , if you have enough soldiers to be the one doing command , and the us tends to . 
  if someone screws up , it 's a lot more-palatable if it 's * your * country that screws up . 
  but that 's different from it being unconstitutional . 
  and i do n't agree that it does n't happen . 
  i think that the most-recent major international military operation that we 've been involved with is the libya intervention . 
  in [ operation unified protector ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_unified_protector ) , italy had operational command of the maritime forces . 
  those forces included a number of us warships . 
   you will never round up or destroy 100 % of currently existing standard or extended capacity magazines , ah , but [ eventually people will fire all the bullets in the high-capacity magazines and that will be that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxtu228byfw ) !, 
  might happen , but ... okay , i 'm no expert on annexation or the political situation there , but ... russia kind of * has * to issue russian passports . 
  remember ... only four countries ( one of which is russia , one of which is a small central american country , one of which is a collapsing-under-a-socialist-government-and-hyperinflation south american country , and one of which is a tiny island ) recognize south ossetia as a country . 
  that means that south ossetia-issued passports are going to be treated like monopoly money pretty much everywhere in the world , on par with sealand passports . 
  so either you run the risk of south ossetians being unable to leave the country and eventually saying `` the hell with it '' and going to georgia to get a passport , which is n't too good for creating the perceived-reality-that-is-a-country , or russia has to extend them passports and her own credibility . 
  maybe there should be sanctions tied to south ossetia . 
  but what i 'm getting at is that the sanctions tied to the occupation of ukraine should come off if and when the terms are met , rather than someone saying `` oh , yeah , and you * also * need to do x , y , and z too '' . 
  if that does n't happen : * is going to make russia ( legitimately , in my eyes ) pissed off . 
  they held up their side of the deal , and the sanctioners would n't be following up on their side . 
  * it harms the ability of sanctioners to leverage sanctions in the future , since they lose credibility as to actually lifting sanctions . 
  that 's significant to all the sanctioners , but i 'd imagine probably particularly the eu , which presently mostly uses its influence as a bloc via economic pressure -- it would be advantageous to the eu to establish and maintain such a reputation if it wants to be able to make effective use of sanctions in the future . 
  russia 's just claiming that it 's a satellite state , not part of russia yet . 
  also , [ the only countries of the 193 members in the un to recognize south ossetia as not part of georgia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_abkhazia_and_south_ossetia#states_formally_recognising_abkhazia_or_south_ossetia_as_independent ) are : * russia * nicaragua * venezuela * nauru, 
  i can certainly imagine a world where that is totally workable . 
  does mean that one needs to assign little credibility to unknown faces on the internet , but ... edit : actually , this is very apropos . 
  some user * just * [ did that to me ] ( https://reddit.com/comments/5zgf0p/comment/dey31zb ) and reddit still seems usable . 
  even if not , at some point , we 're going to have to have this out . 
  the german and us guarantees on free speech simply do n't mesh , and the internet is a shared space . 
  so either the us has to * de facto * give up free speech rights , germany has to * we facto * accept more , or the internet has to be partitioned into a `` free '' and `` non-free '' area . 
  edit : and just to be clear , i 'm talking about social norms , not legal violations . 
  disagree . 
  i mean , i 'm with you on them being retained , but i think that it 's important to have well-defined conditions for ending pressure if you start applying it , else you kill the incentive to do that thing . 
  the sanctions have requirements in place , and they 're tied to occupation of ukraine . 
  if sanctions were to be imposed over georgia , they should be explicit and have well-defined conditions for being lifted . 
  [ 1 peter 2:18 ] ( http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm )  slaves , in reverent fear of god submit yourselves to your masters , not only to those who are good and considerate , but also to those who are harsh . 
  [ deuteronomy 21:10 -14 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+21%3a10-14&amp;version=niv ) :  when you go to war against your enemies and the lord your god delivers them into your hands and you take captives , if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her , you may take her as your wife . 
  bring her into your home and have her shave her head , trim her nails and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured . 
  after she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month , then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife . 
  if you are not pleased with her , let her go wherever she wishes . 
  you must not sell her or treat her as a slave , since you have dishonored her . 
  your linked paper says that the us * does * place forces under foreign command and appears to be an conservative advocacy organization arguing that it should stop . 
  i 'm not making a normative statement about whether it fits us values to do so or the us should -- personally , i 've no objection , as long as the us can expect that the lives of her soldiers are not being devalued by the commander involved . 
  i 'm just saying that the us * does * permit this . 
  i 'm not making any normative statement here about what people * should * do . 
  i 'm correcting a technical quirk . 
  if someone gets accidentally run over and you say `` he murdered her '' and then someone else says `` actually , that 's manslaughter '' , i assume that your response is n't to say `` you must love running people over in cars in your spare time !, 
  stop justifying her murder ! '' . 
  i realize that it 's an emotional subject , but seriously , dude ... 
   we need better spending of the current funds , not more funds that are equally badly spent , if not worse . 
  the two are not incompatible . 
  the 2 % level is an equal-across-the-board requirement . 
  some minimum must exist to avoid tragedy of the commons . 
  is 2 % the right amount ? 
  probably not perfectly optimal , but it 's a reasonable level globally , and it was a number that all members had the opportunity to discuss . 
  for an organization that provides national defense to work , something has to force spending , or you get tragedy of the commons . 
  no other single party is going to be in a position to do that . 
  the us met and exceeded the limit and represented the bulk of nato . 
  luxumberg would have been ignored had luxembourg made the same point . 
  finally , this was something that all members had discussed and agreed to and which most had simply been ignoring . 
  and yes , members are sovereign . 
  they can leave if they want . 
  sovereign countries can and do sign treaties -- like the north atlantic treaty -- and having done so , are expected to follow the terms of the treaty unless they withdraw . 
   europeans should never have agreed to send troops to afghanistan . 
  state-backed effort hits military headquarters and tries to hit legislature , state says that they 're not willing to stop it ? 
  would you also advocate not honoring commitments to other countries in europe ? 
  would you expect the us to honor commitments in europe ? 
  you 're an advocate of an eu army , and i can tell you now that for that to work , you 're going to have willing to honor commitments . 
  some french user on social media not being diplomatic about france being diplomatic ? 
   the proposed law would require each network to run fully staffed , round-the-clock reporting systems and to name an individual responsible for handling complaints . 
  that person could face an individually levied fine of five million euros if companies break laws governing what can be published and if you 're smart , you 're setting up a company to handle outsourcing this for social media companies . 
  if he was a nazi , his naturalization would have been under false pretenses , which means that he 's probably not actually a us citizen . 
  no , that 's how the dsm defines it . 
  strictly speaking , that does n't mean that he 's a pedophile -- pedophilia is a psychological condition . 
  someone would need to be `` predominantly or exclusively attracted '' to prepubescents to be a pedophile . 
  it 'd be possible to have sex with children and not be a pedophile or to be a pedophile but not have sex with children . 
  yeah , but not approved for human consumption . 
  you can get [ rocky mountain oysters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rocky_mountain_oysters ) ... 
  hmm . 
  could you expand on the implications of the latter ? 
  i assume that it would let scotland control fishing in the uk eez off scotland . 
  that 's a lot more than us states control -- it looks like normally , they only get up to three nautical miles offshore . 
  the soft brexit thing seems unlikely to happen , if i correctly understand and can take as truthful what positions have been laid out . 
  [ diplomatic immunity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomatic_immunity ) does not mean that police can not disarm or detain you . 
  it means that instead of going to court or prison , you will be deported to your home country . 
  furthermore , the minister had been declared [ * persona non grata * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persona_non_grata ) . 
  doing this means that you are stating that you will not extend any diplomatic immunity to someone re-entering the country . 
  if this picture was after that , the minister can not expect diplomatic immunity . 
  i 'm not saying that it is n't potentially useful for propaganda , but come on . 
  it does look badass . 
  are these demands for more political autonomy or for more money ? 
  username checks out . 
   also , the leave voters want to abolish the nhs , because by getting a trade deal with the us ( where only non-tariff barriers exist , mainly ) they will be able to harmonise those regulations and the uk will get a us-style healthcare system .
