  why would the uk need to have a private healthcare system to trade with the us ? 
  i mean , it 's not like the us cares about canada in nafta paying for public healthcare . 
  i think i prefer the route of not letting russia annex pieces of neighboring countries to having everyone start doing so and creating a massive bloody clusterfuck . 
  what ? 
  no it is n't . 
  for example , the [ battle of the java sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_java_sea ) was under dutch command . 
  weeeelll , we did have a pretty huge fight over the [ federal assault weapons ban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_assault_weapons_ban ) . 
  that had a built-in sunset clause and expired , but it was probably the closest thing to this eu ban . 
  the legislation itself was n't shot down in court over any of the legal challenges before its expiry , but it seriously hurt the democrats : https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/when-bill-clinton-passed-gun-reform/488045/  we lost 53 seats in the rural areas [ in the 1994 midterms ] , particularly in the south . 
    when asked if this bill was a key element , griffin said : `` absolutely . 
  yes . 
  i 'd say , for 40 of those seats , yes . 
  for [ judiciary committee ] chairman [ jack ] brooks ( of texas ) to lose his seat [ after 42 years ] ? 
  these guys had been safe forever . 
  and they voted against all this stuff but they were still targeted politically because their president was for the [ assault weapon ] ban . ''   the political price for passing the ban included the loss of congress to the republicans in 1994 , endangering clinton 's agenda , and creating the partisan conditions on capitol hill that produced his own impeachment . 
  when ag eric holder came in under obama , he started talking about similar gun control . 
  nancy pelosi told him to knock it off . 
  way too damaging to touch . 
  you 're talking about the [ ghost gunner ] ( https://ghostgunner.net/ ) or something more-generic ? 
  the nra is a us institution . 
  the closest swiss equivalent is [ protell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protell ) . 
  i do n't know of any eu-wide equivalent . 
  hmm . 
  wikipedia has [ international association for the protection of civilian arms rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_association_for_the_protection_of_civilian_arms_rights ) , which appears to be a broad coalition of pro-gun-rights organizations around the world . 
  it lists the more-civil-rights-oriented second amendment foundation in the us , though , rather than the industry/trade oriented nra . 
  disproportionately urban . 
  disproportionately young . 
  disproportionately male . 
  disproportionately black . 
  disproportionately poor . 
  this is true for both victims and shooters . 
  heavily associated with the drug trade or gangs ( which themselves are associated with the drug trade ) . 
  ca n't go to the police or courts if you have a dispute between drug dealers or if someone steals your drugs -- you have to resolve it yourself . 
  might be more-interesting to try to find a way to resolve drug-related disputes than to try banning guns . 
   i am opposed to any further restriction , of any type , even if it does n't concern me directly . 
  might be more productive to , when faced with further restrictions , ask `` okay , are you willing to lift this existing over-broad restriction in exchange ? '', 
  we have wolves , and we still have ~ 33 million deer in the us . 
  i 'm assuming that you 're talking about a bolt-action , wooden stock rifle ? 
  why do you need to use an antique firearm design to legitimately go hunting ? 
   these firearms are sold by european governments to unstable and corrupted countries in third world a lot were sent by the communist bloc to the third world from the get-go to undermine european colonial powers ... precisely because it 's hard for an hostile , occupying power to control an armed populace . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decolonization#decolonization_after_1945 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-47#cultural_influence_and_impact  during the cold war , the soviet union and the people 's republic of china , as well as united states and other nato nations supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces around the world . 
  during this time the western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles , such as the fn fal , the hk g3 , the m14 , and the m16 . 
  in contrast , the russians and chinese used the ak-47 ; its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make aks in vast numbers . 
    in the pro-communist states , the ak-47 became a symbol of third-world revolution . 
  during the 1980s , the soviet union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by western nations , including middle eastern nations such as iran , libya , and syria , which welcomed soviet union backing against israel . 
  -  the proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers . 
  the ak-47 is included in the flag of mozambique and its emblem , an acknowledgment that the country gained its independence in large part through the effective use of their ak-47s . 
  [ 168 ] it is also found in the coats of arms of east timor and the revolution era burkina faso , as well as in the flags of the hezbollah and new people 's army . 
    some western countries associate the ak-47 with their enemies ; both cold war era and present-day . 
  for example , western movies often portray criminals , gang members and terrorists using ak-47s . 
  for these reasons , in the u.s. and western europe the ak-47 is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents , gangsters and terrorists . 
  conversely , throughout the developing world , the ak-47 can be positively attributed with revolutionaries against foreign occupation , imperialism , or colonialism . 
  [ 158 ] the soviets subscribed to the `` an armed populace is a free populace '' doctrine too . 
  they just did n't want it happening in the soviet union ... 
  is it less-transparent than the typical national government ? 
  just thought it was funny insofar as it relates to the proposition that `` those gun nuts can just leave switzerland and go to the us '' . 
  for someone opposed to gay marriage , the issue would be that it would attach the * imprimatur * of the state and whatever moral endorsement that carries to same-sex marriage . 
  that 'd affect people who are n't engaging in same-sex marriage , albeit obviously to a much lesser degree than those who do . 
   you can always move to the land of the free and home of the brave !!!, 
  it 's actually pretty hard to emigrate to the us . 
  i mean , that 's not really a realistic suggestion . 
  besides , come on . 
  he 's got ties to the place . 
  romania has restrictive gun law . 
  switzerland has permissive gun law . 
  just as you are unhappy about guns showing up in romania and would n't much appreciate `` just move somewhere else '' as a response to guns becoming more-available , the swiss are unhappy about people mucking around with guns in switzerland . 
  edit : amusingly-enough , the shootout involving the most bullets in us history , the [ north hollywood shootout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_hollywood_shootout ) , had one of the two perpetrators having moved to the us from the restrictive romania . 
  [ full dramatization ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wty8vsi4fs0 ) and [ national geographic documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44ygyluoqq ) . 
  | country | [ percent of population in urban areas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization_by_country ) | | - | - | | sweden | 86 | | france | 85.8 | | united states | 82.4 | | united kingdom | 79.6 | | spain | 77.4 | | germany | 73.9 | | switzerland | 73.7 | | poland | 60.9 | | romania | 54.0 | i mean , romania has one of the most-rural populations in the eu , and it has [ highly-restrictive gun law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation#bosnia-herzegovina ) . 
  switzerland has a comparatively-urban population , and it has very permissive gun law . 
   you can make the materials very hard to get . 
  it 's pretty hard to block access to all chemicals that can react strongly exothermically . 
  and even if you do -- for example the eu [ restricts access to ammonium nitrate ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/explosives/explosives-precursors_en ) , as it 's a common precursor . 
  how * actually * hard do you think it would be in the eu to manage to obtain , possibly illegally , enough to fill a vehicle with fertilizer ? 
  what is actual security on farms around the continent like ? 
  nor do i think that synthesizing an explosive from precursors is that viable to restrict . 
  [ mcveigh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timothy_mcveigh ) was no chemist , after all . 
   also , bombs are hard as fuck to miniaturize to the point where you can smuggle them into a position where they 're capable of causing massive harm . 
  vehicles can drive pretty much anywhere . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_guisan  on 25 july 1940 , general guisan delivered a historic address to the entire swiss officer corps assembled on the r\u00fctli , a location charged with symbolism in swiss romantic nationalism by virtue of being identified as the site of the r\u00fctlischwur of 1291 . 
  guisan became a symbol of resistance to nazism that was widespread amongst the swiss public . 
  [ 6 ]   he made it very clear that switzerland would resist any nazi invasion . 
  if they ran out of bullets they were to resort to the bayonet . 
  he said that switzerland would defend itself against any invader and would never surrender . 
  [ 5 ] the swiss government had a decentralised structure , so even the federal president was a relatively powerless official with no authority to surrender the country . 
  indeed , swiss citizens had been instructed to regard any surrender broadcast as enemy lies and resist to the end . 
    as a consequence , general guisan developed his famous r\u00e9duit national concept in summer 1940 , according to which the swiss army would have retreated into the alps relatively soon if attacked , but would have kept up resistance based on some sort of guerrilla and stay-behind tactics from there . 
  the swiss paramilitary organization aktion nationaler widerstand ( resistant national action ) , formed from contacts between selected army figures and conservative civilian circles , had the explicit task to persuade the civilian population to resist invaders . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ]   however , guisan 's and switzerland 's main strategy was deterrence rather than fighting , and germany never risked invasion . 
  on 20 august 1945 , [ 9 ] general guisan left his command , considering his mission to be fulfilled . 
  actually , it 's legal as long as it 's in a cheese that has been aged for at least 60 days . 
  also , if the ban you 're talking about is federal , it 's possible to produce it in-state , since the fda only restricts interstate commerce ( though i agree with the fda on the listeria risk in unpasteurized milk -- people have died from unpasteurized milk ) . 
  i suspect that the only reason that there 's any raw milk dispute at all is specifically * because * legal raw milk is inherently produced in-state , so it 's a protected market , so if you 're a dairy farmer and can sell people on drinking raw milk , you have access to that protected market . 
  i do n't see why the eu has to be fundamentally anti-gun . 
  i 'd think that it 'd be possible to have an eu without having more restrictions on guns . 
  i was n't trying to produe a proposal , but it 's pretty obviously what / u/chickenoverlord was proposing -- your response was taking issue with the fact that there is n't a way to provide an reliable metric of who will commit attacks . 
  i do n't think that 's reasonable in that whatever he would want would permit for some degree of error . 
  it 'd be like saying `` we ca n't have a justice system , since people who commit crimes would never choose to identify themselves '' . 
  yeah , you 're going to have some error rate , but you can get an * approximation * of those who commit crimes via investigations , making use of probability , and accepting a certain error rate where some who have committed crimes will escape punishment and some who have not will be punished . 
   dangerous as fuck to the driver , if the state provides healthcare , that 's an interest of the state , yes ?
