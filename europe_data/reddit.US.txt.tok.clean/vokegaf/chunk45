  i suspect -- though have never dug into this -- that western governments intentionally and consistently used `` communist '' ( derived from the party name and the claimed ultimate goal ) rather than `` socialist '' ( derived from what the society was was ) to help reduce appeal to members of socialist parties in europe . 
  that being said , i am not very sympathetic to the `` just a bit more ideological purity and we 'd get there '' crowd . 
  that same claim was made in communist countries , with everyone claiming that the other guys were n't pure enough . 
  if you hit your head increasingly hard and it just makes your head hurt , it 's doubtful that hitting it a * little bit harder * will totally make everything work . 
  he 's kinda got a point on the refugee promises being fulfilled . 
  there was an essentially bullshit promise about fast-tracking part of the turkey eu accession , iirc . 
  i do n't think that anyone took it seriously at the time . 
  at the time , i do remember saying on here `` if you do n't mean it , do n't promise it '' . 
  ahhh , okay , your objection is to the idea that the netherlands is doing it for domestic political reasons ? 
  you two canadian flairs have quite the us-european dispute going on there . 
  i would be very surprised if the primary goal is not domestic turkish politics . 
  you know that he has his critical referendum coming up that he 's got everything staked on . 
  what other possible benefit would erdogan derive ? 
  [ looks like it 's got concrete over it ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/das-tomb-karl-marxs-resting-place-has-an-entry-fee/412411/ ) . 
  austria apparently disallows dual citizenship , and makes an explicit exception for those who are unable to renounce citizenship : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_nationality_law#dual_citizenship  austrian law substantially restricts dual citizenship . 
  in general , only the following categories of austrian citizens may possess a foreign nationality : [ snip ]  * naturalized austrian citizens who are unable to renounce their existing nationality while there is , afaik , no legal guarantee that germany would need to extend the same exception if germany started disallow dual citizenship , i would imagine that doing so would indeed happen . 
   should a german-american dual nationality be allowed ? 
  french-new zealandic ? 
  and how would they react ? 
  i mean , it 'd be a pain in the ass for german-americans and american-germans who have dual citizenship , but i do n't see why the us would object , if that 's what you mean . 
  it 's not like the us pushed for the existence of dual citizenship . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_nationality_law#dual_citizenship  the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) neither defines dual citizenship nor takes a position for it or against it . 
  there has been no prohibition against dual citizenship , but some provisions of the ina and earlier u.s. nationality laws were designed to reduce situations in which dual citizenship exists . 
  although naturalizing citizens are required to undertake an oath renouncing previous allegiances , the oath has never been enforced to require the actual termination of original citizenship . 
  [ 30 ]   although the u.s. government does not endorse dual citizenship as a matter of policy , it recognizes the existence of dual citizenship and completely tolerates the maintenance of multiple citizenship by u.s. citizens . 
  in the past , claims of other countries on dual-national u.s. citizens sometimes placed them in situations where their obligations to one country were in conflict with the laws of the other . 
  however , as fewer countries require military service and most base other obligations ( such as the payment of taxes ) on residence and not citizenship , these conflicts have become less frequent . 
  google : aw , yeah , you show those iphones !, 
  well , there are different tests for iq -- it 's not a single measurement -- but iq [ does have correlation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligence_quotient#social_correlations ) with measurable real-world achievements :  ... children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers . 
  the correlation between iq scores and grades is about .50 . 
  -  the validity of iq as a predictor of job performance is above zero for all work studied to date , but varies with the type of job and across different studies , ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 . 
  [ 99 ] the correlations were higher when the unreliability of measurement methods was controlled for . 
  [ 8 ] while iq is more strongly correlated with reasoning and less so with motor function , [ 100 ] iq-test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations . 
  [ 98 ] that said , for highly qualified activities ( research , management ) low iq scores are more likely to be a barrier to adequate performance , whereas for minimally-skilled activities , athletic strength ( manual strength , speed , stamina , and coordination ) are more likely to influence performance . 
  [ 98 ] it is largely through the quicker acquisition of job-relevant knowledge that higher iq mediates job performance . 
  -  while it has been suggested that `` in economic terms it appears that the iq score measures something with decreasing marginal value . 
  it is important to have enough of it , but having lots and lots does not buy you that much '' , [ 104 ] [ 105 ] large-scale longitudinal studies indicate an increase in iq translates into an increase in performance at all levels of iq : i.e. 
  ability and job performance are monotonically linked at all iq levels . 
  [ 106 ] [ 107 ] charles murray , coauthor of the bell curve , found that iq has a substantial effect on income independently of family background . 
  [ 108 ]   the link from iq to wealth is much less strong than that from iq to job performance . 
  some studies indicate that iq is unrelated to net worth . 
  [ 109 ] [ 110 ] -  the american psychological association 's 1995 report intelligence : knowns and unknowns stated that the correlation between iq and crime was \u2212 0.2 . 
  note that a 0.2 is not a terribly-strong correlation -- here 's a distribution with a 0.28 correlation , which does n't look like much , and that 's a stronger correlation than this . 
  on the whole , though , variation within a population dominates variation between populations . 
  it 's already evened out , because the [ chinese were off burning dutch flags a few years back ] ( http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2008/04/burning-the-wrong-flag/ ) when they were pissed off at the french . 
  ... says the man drinking deeply from the chalice ... 
  i mean , the erdogan supporters in the submitted video had the same problem with the flag they were trying to burn -- they were dumping accelerant all over it to try to get it to ignite , and were just burning holes in it and finally just dumped the thing on the ground . 
  they uploaded theirs . 
  dangerous ideas to spread for a man sporting a flair with an english flag with a thingy in the middle . 
   please , after the american attempts at making paella and tortilla * attempts * !? 
  * attempts * !? 
  let me just clarify something : * [ this is what a tortilla looks like ] ( https://sentinel63.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/9122322-flour-tortillas-on-wooden-table-stock-photo-tortilla-tortillas-corn.jpg?w=833 ) . 
  * [ this , on the other hand , is some sort of ungodly mating of a potato pancake and an omelette ] ( http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/spanish-tortilla-recipe0 ), 
   d\u0131 edit : holy shit apparently it is i dunno , could also be someone going in for absurd humor . 
   the rule is that it takes three generations to make an american ... these people did n't come to europe to become european -- they came here to colonise it . 
  i 'm dubious . 
  people said the same thing in past waves of immigration to the us . 
  they changed the us too -- we eat kielbasa now -- but over time you wound up with people tending towards a combination of the two . 
  kids just do n't have all that much interest in geopolitics . 
  it 's a lot easier to get by in a country if you speak the language , can consume the media , and so forth . 
  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/24/a-majority-of-english-speaking-hispanics-in-the-u-s-are-bilingual/ here 's an example of spanish-speaking immigrants to the us -- this is a big group , many many millions , lot of data gathered on it . 
  only really takes one generation for the people who predominantly use a foreign language to become a tiny part of the population . 
  parents do tend to feel a need to provide bilingualism . 
  it does tend to fall off over time too , more-slowly . 
  people do n't much like the idea of dropping languages . 
  but that does n't mean that there are attempts to `` colonize '' the country . 
  a buddy of mine is a first-gen turkish immigrant ( a software engineer ) . 
  his daughter -- i once gave her some old english-language children 's books of mine , and she 's a voracious reader ) is bilingual , but realistically , she 's first-rate at english and probably kinda meh about turkish . 
  she may-or-may-not bother to teach her children turkish -- aside from maybe visiting turkey from time-to-time ( though my buddy hates erdogan so much at this point that i dunno if he wants to encourage that ) i doubt that she 'll use it much . 
  i 'd bet that the same process also exists in the netherlands and germany : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_the_netherlands  the first generation of turkish immigrants is predominantly turkish-speaking and has only limited dutch competence . 
  [ 28 ] thus , for immigrant children , their early language input is turkish , but the dutch language quickly enters their lives via playmates and day-care centres . 
  by age six , these children are often bilinguals . 
  [ 29 ]   adolescents have developed a code-switching mode which is reserved for in-group use . 
  with older members of the turkish community and with strangers , turkish is used , and if dutch speakers enter the scene , a switch to dutch is made . 
  [ 30 ] the young bilinguals therefore speak normal turkish with their elders , and a kind of dutch-turkish with each other . 
  [ 31 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_germany  the turkish language is the second most spoken language in germany , after the german language . 
  it was brought to the country by turkish immigrants who speak it as their first language . 
  these immigrants mainly learned the german language through employment , mass media , and social settings , and it has now become the second language for many of them . 
  nonetheless , most turkish immigrants have passed down their mother tongue to their children and descendants . 
  in general , german-born turks become bilingual at an early age , learning turkish at home and german in state schools ; thereafter , a dialectal variety often remains in their repertoire of both languages . 
  [ 67 ]   german-born turks mainly speak the german language more fluently than their `` domestic '' - style turkish language . 
  consequently , they often speak the turkish language with a german accent or a modelled german dialect . 
  [ 68 ] it is also common within the community to modify the turkish language by adding german grammatical and syntactical structures . 
  parents generally encourage their children to improve their turkish language skills further by attending private turkish classes or choosing turkish as a subject at school . 
  in some states of germany the turkish language has even been approved as a subject to be studied for the abitur . 
  not very friendly to albania , i see . 
  yeah , they 're gon na be milking this one for a while . 
  no reason that it could n't start to be . 
  i do n't think that oranges are liquid-enough to blend . 
  you 'd need a food processor . 
   i 'd be a lot more impressed if they were stabbing gouda cheese , stroopwafels and fresh herring . 
  oh , you mean `` freedom flapjacks '' . 
  liberty steaks . 
  not as widespread a renaming as liberty cabbage .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotterdam_blitz  the rotterdam blitz was the aerial bombardment of rotterdam by the luftwaffe ... killing nearly 900 people and making 85,000 others homeless . 
  shocking and appalling . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_bombing_of_rotterdam  in one incident , during a raid on the shipyards and dock area , the united states army air forces accidentally bombed a residential area , killing hundreds ... the death toll was between 326 and 401 [ a ] and made between 10,000 and 20,000 people homeless . 
  oops .
