  i dunno about that . 
  he [ dropped it off in mongolia in exchange for a flashlight and beat a hasty retreat ] ( http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980cefd6133ff930a15753c1a9639c8b63 ) . 
  i 'm increasingly suspicious that a lot of countries give these things just because it 's a hilarious way to mess with world leaders . 
  [ hollande 's camel ( and then replacement camel , after he tried to quietly give the original one to some family that ate it ) ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22089457 ) is an even better example . 
  * step 1 : find the most fantastically-awkward-to-keep-yet-somewhat-symbolic-of-your-country-that-you-can-find gift . 
  for belarus , for example , use their national animal , the european bison . 
  * step 2 : tell your buddies about this , because they are n't going to want to miss out . 
  also notify media . 
  * step 3 : present , in grand , formal manner , the gift . 
  * step 4 : wait for officials to politely say that this is exactly what they 've always wanted and fulfills their dearest wishes . 
  hook , line , and sinker . 
  * step 5 : wait until they try to get rid of it before leaving the country . 
  notify the press again , and take the position that the country is gravely-concerned that it did n't meet their desires . 
  wait for them to say that no , it was exactly what they always wanted . 
  * step 6 : present , in grand , formal manner , a replacement gift . 
   hard to say that they are buddies . 
  they just have many common interest , and both are economically not powerful enough to confront each other . 
  i am not very enthusiastic about the idea of using nato to coerce political change in members . 
  consider , for a moment , what would happen if the us were doing that to members that it disagreed with . 
  i think that nato works because it stays in thr political realm . 
  let 's say it becomes a pressure tool . 
  well , the uk has already been flirting with it over brexit terms and polish benefits . 
  imagine if the us started doing so . 
  how did lithuania feel when trump said that maybe members who did n't meet their spending commitment might not be defended ? 
  and that 's very different from saying `` we do n't like your leader or him moving to a presidential system and are going to tell you what to do '' . 
  turkey probably has more interests in common with europe than with russia . 
  but ... let 's say turkey was forced out . 
  turkey might well aim to link up with russia . 
  turkey 's got territorial ambitions in the europe too , after all . 
  sure , today it 's not a concern , maybe . 
  but what about a ways down the road ? 
  if i were europe , i 'd intensely want to avoid creating a hostile bloc there . 
  basically , i just do n't see the point . 
  turkey has n't * done * anything that would change the reasons for maintaining a military alliance . 
  are other nato members onboard with using nato as a pressure tool ? 
  i doubt that the us would be . 
   not only we need to kick them out of nato but we should seriously consider to remove him by force and put turkey back on track . 
  turkey is supposed to be a buffer state between europe and the middle-east , not run by a mussolini wannabe . 
  * turkey is currently blocking a lot of refugees from entering the eu , with more in turkey than are in , i believe , the entire eu . 
  if you want them to act as a shield , they 're doing it . 
  * if you recall the escapade the uk and we in the us had in overthrowing the iranian government ... it tends to make people dislike you for a long time . 
  you will probably discredit those who favor a european society in turkey for a long time . 
  * the iraq war was in part about deposing a dictator . 
  consider that fifteen years later , the outcome was not satisfactory ... and the us expended a * lot * of money -- about two trillion dollars -- and resources on getting things stable afterwards . 
  consider whether france is willing or able to line up that kind of resource commitment . 
  * going to war with a country tends to produce refugees . 
  we saw it with libya and iraq . 
  consider what would happen if this happens again on larger scale right next to the eu . 
  * thus far , erdogan has been long on talk vis-a-vis other countries , and short on action . 
  i do not think that he will actually sanction the eu , which would be fantastically counterproductive . 
  he * is * harming europe 's image in the eyes of turks , but imposing a government would hardly remedy that . 
  * i do not see how erdogan being a dishonest populist who has restricted rights in turkey and engaged in bluster conflicts with fundamental european interests . 
  he has , frankly , done little other harm than be impolite to countries outside of turkey . 
  * erdogan was democratically elected . 
  whatever else his faults , he has convinced the turkish public that he should lead them . 
  if you storm in and depose him and have an election , there is every reason to believe that turkey would elect someone similar . 
  if you disallow an election , you will be imposing a subordinate government . 
  in the eyes of the world , this would be very much on par with russia 's actions in ukraine and even the soviet union 's actions in your eastern members in the past . 
  consider whether this image is advantageous to france or the eu or whoever-would-be-doing-the-deposing . 
  * there is no mechanism to kick a country out of nato . 
  * even the lesser act of kicking turkey out of nato would substantially weaken europe 's military position vis-a-vis russia , as control of the mediterranean would be lost . 
  * if it is in europe 's interest to act if russia seizes the dardanelles anyway , europe might as well be allied with turkey . 
   many in europe like to parade the fact around of the `` us having no culture and history '' and while that is not strictly false , it also makes it a lot easier to assimilate into a nation and culture that is easy-access to anyone . 
  -  no culture dammit , germany . 
  * 1940s : [ american culture is pervasive , damaging , and a threat ] ( https://99chan.org/reich/src/138484227099.jpg ) * 1980s : [ still pervasive ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm ) * now : americans do n't have and have never had culture . 
  make up your mind . 
   if you accept the premise , 2/3d generation immigrants can still retain connections to their parents/grand-parents culture and be `` integrated '' . 
  damn right , just like the 33m irish living in the us !, 
  well , that 's pretty clear -- you 're living in the netherlands , after all . 
  turkey just lets people inherit citizenship and requires you to `` buy '' your way out of turkish citizenship , as i understand it . 
  i do n't think it 's actually possible to stop blending over time . 
   yeah and the chinese/asian countries tend to integrate well , is the standard here for integrating well not living in ethnic ghettoes ? 
  because it 's historically common in the us for immigrants to live in 'em -- today 's [ tourist attraction chinatowns ] ( http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com/ ) were once exactly that . 
  often rather rough-and-tumble , too . 
  a co-worker of mine just commented the other day that his vietnamese wife wanted them to retire near little saigon or similar so that she could continue to get exotic vietnamese groceries and the like . 
  ethnic ghettoes exist because people are homesick , because they do n't just drop traditions like that , because they may have family members who have trouble with the language , because it 's hard enough to get going in a new country . 
  it does n't mean that it 's all part of a plan to convert the country to * country-of-origin * . 
  there was some anglicanization of names that has happened in the past , but it was not the norm unless you come from somewhere that does n't use the roman alphabet and * have * to come up with something . 
   the most popular daily turkish newspaper hurriyet has the [ customary slogan of `` t\u00fcrkiye t\u00fcrklerindir '' on an atat\u00fcrk image on every front page ] ( https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%bcrkiye_t%c3%bcrklerindir#/media/file:h%c3%bcrriyet_logo_20_haziran_2012.png ) , which translates to `` turkey belongs to turks . '', 
  can you imagine a highly popular newspaper in germany with the logo emblazened : `` germany for the germans , '' or the new york times with the slogan : `` america for the whites . '', 
  why america for the * whites * rather than america for americans ? 
  i suspect that things looked pretty bonkers when they were happening in the past too . 
  it 's mostly images of august statesmen doing serious policy things without politics live on down to us . 
  combine with cheap international communications makng it easy for people to are how much horseshit is present in political in other countries where the political appeals are n't molded to fit us , and ... 
  it 's probably safe to say that people today are better-educated , more cosmopolitan , and better informed than any point in world history . 
  if if feels like politics are like being chest-deep in a cesspool ... well , perhaps they used to be nose-deep . 
  my understanding from this forum is that this does n't mean much , though . 
  turkish citizenship is inherited and you 'd need to pay a fair amount of money to give it up -- turkey does not allow free renunciation of citizenship . 
   there 's nothing inherently bad in monarchy there was in the british monarchy-in-the-1770s , if you did n't want to have trade monopolies imposed on you .

  [ albanians are smokin ' the reefer , i see ] ( http://hightimes.com/news/cannabis-is-still-green-gold-in-albania/ ) ... 
  finland 's capital did get bombed by the soviet union , and they did lose part of their urban territory , rendering some of the population refugee within finland , though . 
  i think the more germane question is whether turkey was a marshall plan participant . 
  i do n't see how that would destroy its history . 
   i wonder if he will call the americans nazis at some point . 
  oh , [ donald trump beat him to it . 
  ] ( http://www.someecards.com/news/politics/donald-trump-nazi-germany-tweet/ ), 
  you know ... a lot of the past writing samples we * do * have from long-dead languages are basically shit-talking too -- kings of some location talking about how they kicked the hell out of some king in a neighboring kingdom and how they could beat the snot out of anyone else too getting it engraved on stone and letting it last a couple thousand years . 
  would n't be all that out-of-place . 
  first , it may be true that the uk could negotiate special privileges ( obviously it did once ) .
