  but i do not think that the uk not being able to do so makes for a threat . 
  second , i have a different take on the political viability of that . 
  ( 1 ) the eu is larger than it was , and will probably have the uk be less-essential than it was when it first joined ( 2 ) i think that there is a strong misperception among some people that export partners are somehow `` better '' than import partners , and so the uk can expect more from germany than visa versa . 
  any trade must ultimately balance -- what you want is trade , not specifically import or export . 
  ( 3 ) even aside from the import-export issue , by cutting $ n in trade , you produce a certain amount of disruption . 
  as the eu represents a larger portion of uk 's trade than the uk does of the eu , any trade disruption is a greater concern to the uk . 
  ( 4 ) it 's not at all certain that the uk wo n't wind up , at least for some period of time , in efta or in a similar status . 
  being in efta would mean that much trade would continue to happen . 
  both the uk and the eu have an interest in maintaining free trade with each other , even if the uk leaves . 
  thus , i 'm not convinced that uk-eu trade is the primary concern driving the eu to want uk membership . 
  because it 's a good conversation-starter : not every link here needs to be a news point . 
  because the position he holds is probably the most-meaningful in the world to make a statement like that . 
  because it was upvoted . 
   it was n't the people who decided to join , it was the political elites . 
  if `` political elites '' means your government and diplomatic service , i think that britons can probably claim many years of perhaps the most-competent service from them of any country that exists and perhaps ever * has * existed , given the clever wheeling-and-dealing that led to the british empire . 
   i believe in the us , everyone born in american territories are us citizens , right ? 
  with the exception i mentioned of unincorporated territories -- normally not the case for anywhere populated -- yes . 
  also , damn you guys like your complex venn diagrams . 
  :-) also , i vaguely recall that there were various other categories that you are n't listing ... there are still some [ british subjects who are not british citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_subject ) . 
  edit : well , unless that 's what you meant by `` not british citizen with right to live in u.k. '' . 
  ireland [ did do some things behind the scenes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_neutrality_during_world_war_ii ) :  despite the official position of neutrality , there were many unpublicised contraventions of this , such as permitting the use of the donegal corridor to allied military aircraft , and extensive co-operation between allied and irish intelligence , including exchanges of information , such as detailed weather reports of the atlantic ocean . 
  for example , the decision to go ahead with the d-day landings was decided by a weather report from blacksod bay , county mayo . 
  [ 1 ] also , while i understand where you 're coming from , i suppose that pretty much everyone has a complaint along those lines . 
  the finns felt that even if they had no formal alliances with anyone , that the democracies of the world had something of an obligation to act militarily against [ unprovoked aggression from the soviet union against them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) . 
  the czechs probably felt abandoned over international inaction over the [ sudetenland annexation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_occupation_of_czechoslovakia ) . 
  the poles felt [ abandoned by the french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal ) , who made what was more-or-less a [ symbolic gesture towards fighting germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_poland ) rather than invading germany while germany was working on the poles . 
  at least some french felt that the british had basically cut-and-run in the [ battle of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_france ) . 
  the british were irked that america refused to give up neutrality until [ america herself was attacked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attack_on_pearl_harbor ) . 
  the soviets were upset that the british and the americans kept postponing [ d-day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normandy_landings ) . 
  oh , and refusing to attack finland , who had [ proceeded to counter-attack the soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) at the first opportunity . 
  pretty sure that the poles were n't very enthusiastic about [ yalta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yalta_conference ) . 
  i also bet that when the soviets were buddies with germany , that they were n't very happy about receiving a knife in the back in the form of [ operation barbarossa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa ) . 
  while i 'm not familiar with them , i 'd bet that members of the axis had similar complaints -- i suspect that hitler was probably fantastically exasperated with italy . 
  probably a ton more , too , below the national level . 
  churchill was not happy that british forces had [ given up so easily in singapore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_singapore ) . 
  i suspect that singapore was n't very happy about being expected to hold out against air attacks without serious air support , too . 
  it is what it is . 
   we have no say over whom they choose to put in power . 
  well ... that is true . 
  but you also have no say on what mps the other people in the uk put into britain 's parliament , and i assume that you do n't object to that , that you would n't advocate for setting off alone with the rest of your parliamentary constituency . 
    they will always be welcome back on my books , but no concessions this time . 
    the eu is a parasite . 
  the organization should n't threaten . 
  that does n't really sound like a threat to me . 
  you can hardly make an agreement without deciding on terms for that agreement , and `` the same rules as everyone else '' , whether-or-not it 's a good idea , hardly seems terribly threatening . 
   in the states , our population has gone from 180 million to 320 million just since the 1960s , while the uk 's population has barely increased at all . 
  checking world bank data , including immigration , the current us [ annual population growth rate is 0.8 % ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.pop.grow ) , the same as the current uk population growth rate . 
  for reference : | country | population ( millions ) | | - | - | | australia | 24.4 | | canada | 35.1 | | new zealand | 4.8 | | united kingdom | 65.1 | | - | - | | all above combined | 129.4 | | - | - | | united states | 324.7 | it 's a bit under 40 % of the us population . 
  [ eh , that 's not that bad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3hgv7ui0ia ) ... 
  oh , you 're right . 
  weird . 
  inhabited us territories are almost all part of the us . 
  aside from tiny [ american samoa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_samoa ) ( which is weird in that it is both inhabited and an unincorporated territory ) , and whose people are american nationals rather than american citizens , i think that 's across-the-board . 
  the uk does n't appear to work that way . 
  it looks like both [ british overseas territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_overseas_territories ) and [ crown dependencies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_dependencies ) are not part of the uk . 
  however , it looks like people in ( at least some , like the isle of man ) crown dependencies are [ more-or-less british citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isle_of_man#citizenship ) , and [ britsh overseas citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isle_of_man#citizenship ) can generally become a british citizen . 
  well , there 's gibraltar ... 
   our infrastructure/housing has struggled to keep up with our population growth seriously , though , that does n't seem like a good fix . 
  i mean , you can always build more housing . 
  i did a [ brief breakdown as to why your housing is so expensive relative to what you 'd expect ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xy96u/leaders_of_euro_zones_biggest_economies_back/dem6zzd/ ) . 
  because in the us , `` irish '' means `` ethnically irish '' , since it 's the most common use . 
  goddammit , darkhoof !, 
   the us has plenty of people who skew toward that idealism , and are instantly suspicious of anything that appears to be an intrusion on freedom of speech , assembly , etc . 
  for better or worse . 
  anyone infringing on my right to [ peacefully assemble at the legislature with a bunch of buddies and firearms ] ( https://www.thetrace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/b3e067e0e1869b58ef1c6c19d26a6f6d1-1920x1000-c-top.jpg ) is a goddamn fascist . 
  actually , germany and france in ( friendly ) union is really a more-impresssive accomplishment , imho . 
  canada and the us already have an fta in nafta . 
  so do au-nz ( and those two also have [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans-tasman_travel_arrangement ) -- they 're tightly integrated ) . 
  the uk currently has an fta with sa as part of the eu ( the us mostly stays out of the africa -- i think that 's the eu 's playground ) . 
  i dunno about the others . 
  how exactly would the uk being a member of the eu destroy its history ? 
  in partial defense of this position , canada has never asked to join the us ... and the level of economic and cultural integration between canada and the us is comparatively high relative to that relative to the uk and the eu . 
   [ u.s. goods and services trade with canada totaled an estimated $ 662.7 billion in 2015 . 
  ] ( https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/canada ) -  [ about 44 % of uk exports in goods and services went to other countries in the eu in 2015 -- # 220 billion ... ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/ ) and the uk 's gdp is $ 2.6 t , canada 's only $ 1.5 t. 
  and the uk is an island , whereas canada 's got the world 's longest border with the us and most of the canadian population lives near the border . 
  if over a long time , canada 's been happy just having free trade , cross-border financial services , and military coordination , i realistically could see the uk doing the same with the eu . 
  in what way is it an empire ? 
  france and germany do n't have special political powers vis-a-vis other members , and in fact are less-influential on a per-capita basis than less-populous members in qmv . 
  the word `` european '' * means * something different in the uk -- it 's used to distinguish between britons and mainlanders . 
  if you want something to compare it to , think about how funny it is here to hear americans calling themselves `` irish '' -- it 's because in the us , saying unadorned `` irish '' refers to ethnicity , not citizenship . 
  that is , this seems like more of a question of linguistics than one of self-image . 
   the thing is , germany and france wrote their own basic interests and requirements into the founding treaties and bodies that became the eu . 
  that 's an insightful point , but it 's not like those were permanently baked in , either : the eu could have changed them via qmv-driven mechanisms if they were hugely advantageous to those to countries to the detriment of others . 
   furthermore , the financial , fiscal and securitive danger of letting the illegal emigrants from syria , iraq etc. 
  into the uk is just ridiculous : that may be true , but it 's not really tied to schengen . 
  seriously , why did you not do a territory swap to resolve that ? 
   i do n't get why people are opposed to having to show a document when you cross an international border ? 
  well , it 's kind of a pain in the ass . 
  it segments up markets , because it would be a pain to live on one side and daily commute to the other . 
  it increases the time and cost of transport of humans and goods , and that 's an input to darn near everything . 
  i did n't really understand why you guys oppose having romania in schengen , so i asked , and apparently it would reduce dutch port usage or something that was n't what i expected . 
   i 'd like to meet the brave bugger who has to sell schengen and the euro to the british electorate . 
  they were irked at large-scale influx . 
  as economic convergence happens ( as it is happening , except in greece ) , there 's less immigration pressure . 
  on the other hand , it 's not like canada ever friend to join the us , and i could easily see the uk doing that as well , so ... < shrug , 
  i do n't think that it 's reasonable to say that there was any connection . 
  some of these are not surprising ( sick people dying ) , and some would have required suicidal people to carry out ( like the one in turkey ) . 
  if you 're using firefox on android , [ abp ] ( https://adblockplus.org/ ) seems to handle it . 
  so on a scale of one to trump , where does he rank ? 
  does this involve subcontracting to romania and poland ?
