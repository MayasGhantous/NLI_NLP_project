  a round hitting your helmet is the same as you stopping a recoiling rifle with your head . 
  it 's not gon na break your neck . 
  you 've almost certainly had more energy transferred into your head at times in the past in your life as the scrapes and bruises of everyday life . 
  edit : i mean , not that it 'd be a good idea ... edit2 : [ tvtropes : * blown across the room * ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/blownacrosstheroom ), 
  hmm , the us has associate membership too , like australia . 
  https://www.eurovision.tv/page/about/which-countries-can-take-part  associates of the ebu may also be eligible to enter the eurovision song contest , this is decided by the reference group , the governing body of the eurovision song contest , on a case by case basis . 
  if the european union can include land in northeastern south america , i do n't see why the australians have to be excluded from eurovision . 
   usa ? 
  a war which killed a hundred thousand people to achieve the same result as canada did without a war . 
  couple hundred years earlier . 
  assuming that canada * would * have gotten independence in that alternate timeline ...  france ? 
  sucked for a while , but it did finally pull down the monarchy , and did so before the uk . 
   to become a booming capitalistic economy which is communist in name only ? 
  china ended their own imperial era as well . 
  i think that china is a particularly striking example , since attempts to reform the imperial structure in china without revolution had failed spectacularly . 
  i think that you 're setting an unrealistically high bar -- there are going to be negatives to revolutions , sure . 
  but that does n't make them failures . 
  why do you believe that that document contradicts it ? 
  i was about to comment that it 's march , not february , and then read the article . 
  i had no idea that russia switched to the gregorian calendar so late . 
  that is freaking crazy . 
  apparently , parts of the world were using different calendars for hundreds of years , with countries dominated by the eastern orthodox church hanging on just about the longest . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adoption_of_the_gregorian_calendar  the gregorian calendar was decreed in 1582 by the papal bull inter gravissimas by pope gregory xiii russia did n't switch until 1918 , over three centuries later . 
  it looks like some of it was tied to the eastern orthodox church hanging on for an unusually long time . 
  looking [ at a list of dates ] ( http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-countries.html ) : * 1582 : france ( though parts of modern france took until 1682 ) , italy , luxembourg ( parts took until 1583 ) , poland , portugal , spain , usa ( french and spanish parts ; the british parts switched in 1752 , and alaska in 1867 ) * 1583 : austria , germany ( though parts of modern germany took until 1700 ) , netherlands + belgium ( though went back to julian in 1594 , then went to gregorian in 1700 to 1701 ) , switzerland ( various parts switching in 1584 , 1597 , and 1700 ) * 1584 : czechia * 1587 : hungary * 1605 : nova scotia , canada ( first time ) * 1700 : denmark , norway * 1752 : nova scotia , canada ( second time , after switching back to julian in 1710 ) , great britain and dominions * 1873 : japan * 1875 : egypt * 1912 : albania * 1915 : latvia , lithuania * 1916 : bulgaria * 1918 : estonia , russia * 1919 : china , romania , yugoslavia * 1924 : greece * 1927 : turkey this makes the metric changeover look smooth and rapid by comparison . 
  i really do not understand why germany is as upset with turkey as it is or turkey is as upset with germany as it is . 
  neither seems to have done anything particularly harmful to the other . 
  the native population got wiped out by disease . 
  if you wanted your genes to survive a cocktail of afroeurasian diseases , 30k years of evolution in the making , your best bet was to be lucky enough to survive long enough to have kids with an afroeurasian and hope that they wound up with the right genes . 
  i doubt even with modern technology and if european settlers had * wanted * to it would have been possible to stave that off . 
  maybe you could manage to keep people alive in bubble boy-type environments in large enough numbers and gradually expose people to just * one * disease and breed for resistance of each without pulling in genetic material from across the atlantic ... i dunno . 
  was n't going to happen , though . 
  afaik , the only major american disease that survived to make it back and hit afroeurasia was [ syphilis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syphilis#history ) . 
   why the fuck do people even mention north korea because if you 're making an argument via [ * reductio ad absurdum * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reductio_ad_absurdum ) about how restricting trade is n't actually a good idea , north korea is the obvious choice for an example , as it 's the most-isolated-from-the-rest-of-the-world country . 
  countries as a whole get affected by the actions of their leadership -- that 's part of what happens when you choose a leader to direct your country . 
  honestly , given the existence of targeted sanctions at russian leadership , i 'd say that this goes unusually out-of-the-way to avoid impacting russia 's population . 
  what part of my comment are you disagreeing with ? 
   nato wont go to war with russia over east ukraine would also fuck up ukraine to have a ground proxy war there . 
  not a very good idea if the goal is to get ukraine back to a healthy state , since ukraine would like to be linking up with the eu . 
  on an unrelated note , according to news reports over the past few hours , we 've [ started deploying regular ground forces with artillery into syria ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/03/08/marines-have-arrived-in-syria-to-fire-artillery-in-the-fight-for-raqqa/?utm_term=.4547661c29b5 ) . 
  there 's something to that , but i 'm not sure that it 's a very compelling argument in favor of releasing russia from sanctions . 
  you could say that to any response . 
  i mean , `` hitler invaded poland ! '', 
  `` yes , but responding to him would only reinforce his claims of germany being repressed . '', 
  yes . 
  to restrict imports of something is to artificially support the domestic form of that industry . 
  but it is to also artificially-harm the export industries that had been operating . 
  forego $ 1 of imports , and you forego $ 1 of exports ... and the previous situation would have been more economically-efficient than the situation now . 
  north korea , for example , does almost no trade with the rest of the world and must produce more things domestically than otherwise would have been the case . 
  it is certain that there are certain industries that exist in north korea that would never have existed had north korea traded -- but on the net , north korea is worse off for not trading . 
  russia kinda collapsed in a revolution in world war i , though . 
  well , after trump got in , he did . 
  the obama administration was okay with it . 
  i 'm somewhat sympathetic to the argument that the term `` europe '' has a long history of abuse for political reasons , but frankly : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine  ukraine ( listeni/ju \u02d0\u02c8kre\u026an / ; ukrainian : \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 , tr . 
  ukrayina [ ukr\u0251\u02c8jin\u0251 ] ) is a sovereign state in eastern europe ... 
  that being said , while oil is n't going back where it was any time soon , my understanding is that oil prices in 2017 are expected to be higher than in 2016 . 
  i imagine that the `` protect the attacked ethnic russians `` thing has to do with attempting to draw a parallel with nato becoming involved in serbia , where you had mass murders and ethnic cleansing underway . 
   russia does n't mind and is happy to extend the sanctions on eu too . 
  i strongly suspect that counter-sanctions are more disruptive to russia than to the eu . 
  trade with the eu is a much larger portion of russia 's trade than trade with russia is of the eu 's trade . 
  it does n't really matter who initiates the sanctions , just that they reduce trade and that causes disruption and economic pressure . 
  i suspect that the counter-sanctions have more to do with domestic politics than realistically attempting to coerce the eu via economic pressure . 
   shooting down a russian plane that plane crossed into turkey after turkey had had an ongoing series of complaints about aircraft in that vicinity . 
  i suspect that the us would n't have done the same , but that was still within turkey 's legal right , and turkey did n't initiate that -- if you 're a russian warplane on a combat mission it * is * your responsibility to stay out of the airspace of other countries . 
  in practice , was turkey jumping at the chance to hit it rather than really believing that turkey was at risk and acting in defense ? 
  yeah , probably . 
  diplomatically , probably not the best move . 
  but they also do n't want to permit violation of their borders to become the norm . 
   a killing russian ambassador , happened in turkey , but clearly not a goal of the turkish government . 
   weapons which did indeed act as a consumer export to some degree . 
  [ americans are snatching up russian ak-47s in record numbers ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/americans-cant-get-enough-of-russias-ak-47s-2012-8 ) once you 've got your ar-15 for the western side of history , got ta go pick an ak-47 for the eastern side . 
  that was all pre-sanctions . 
  [ us goes on ak-47 buying frenzy after sanctions imposed on russian kalashnikov maker ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11071089/us-goes-on-ak-47-buying-frenzy-after-sanctions-imposed-on-russian-kalashnikov-maker.html )  when president barack obama announced a ban on the import of russian kalashnikov rifles this summer it was meant as a punishment for moscow 's incursion into ukraine . 
    but the ban had an unintended consequence closer to home : creating an ak-47 buying frenzy in american gun stores . 
    firearms dealers reported an immediate surge in demand as buyers rushed out to get their own version of the world 's most iconic weapon . 
    `` they pretty much cleaned us out , '' said brian bunting , president of atlantic firearms , a gun sales business in maryland . 
    he estimated that the white house announcement on july 16 led to a tripling of demand for kalashnikovs , with prices for a mid-range rifle jumping from $ 850 to $ 1050 . 
    it is still possible to import ak-47s made in former soviet bloc countries like poland or romania , or even to buy models produced in the united states . 
  but the russian-made weapons , designed for the red army by mikhail kalashnikov , are considered `` the classic '' by gun aficionados . 
    `` if you think wine , you think french fine . 
  if you think kalashnikovs , you think russian kalashnikovs , '' mr bunting told the telegraph . 
   how about '' ** us sanctions are hurting russians ** '' ? 
  not actually as much as eu sanctions are . 
  the us does n't do much trade with russia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanctions_against_iran this was considered to have been successful ( though perhaps trump is n't liking the outcome ... ), 
   which begs the question why the killing of ukrainians is more important to the russian people let 's not be disingenuous . 
  the goal is clearly not to `` kill ukrainians '' -- that 's just a side effect -- but to claim part of ukraine for russia . 
   but these funds are supposed to be used for securing pensions . 
  you have the [ reserve fund ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/16/news/economy/russia-cash-reserves-depleted/ ) :  after almost two years in recession , the country 's rainy day fund has shrunk to just $ 32.2 billion this month , according to the russian finance ministry . 
  it was $ 91.7 billion in september 2014 ... `` at the current rate , the fund would be depleted in mid-2017 , perhaps a few months later , '' ondrej schneider , chief economist at the institute of international finance , wrote in a note this week . 
  and the [ russian national welfare fund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_national_wealth_fund ) : this is used to support the pension system :  one of the fund 's main responsibilities is to support the russian pension system -  from july 2014 to september 2016 the fund shrunk by $ 15.26 billion , from $ 87.97 billion to $ 72.71 billion . 
  finally , there 's the foreign exchange reserves that russia could theoretically eat into , though i am not sure how close to zero this can get without other consequences ( like confidence in the ruble collapsing ) :  the central bank still has $ 395 billion in international reserves , down from $ 524 billion in october 2013 . 
  the bank burned through more than $ 140 billion in foreign currency reserves between 2014 and 2015 , trying to defend the ruble from collapsing . 
  it looks like the [ forex reserves are at $ 392b ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/foreign-exchange-reserves ) at the moment . 
  hmm . 
  as i understand it , the ukraine sanctions are predicated on all eu members agreeing -- that is , this is a veto-based decision that must be regularly renewed . 
  if that 's the case , compromising the leadership of any eu member would bring down the ukraine sanctions . 
  if that is true , i believe that the bar is lower in the eu -- it would be comparable to having any us state governor being able to terminate ukraine sanctions . 
  moving forward , if the eu does not federalize and have a single `` department '' handling foreign policy , where the eu does take collective decisions , it might make sense to raise the bar for backing off those decisions . 
  that would give the eu the power to make more-forceful statements -- for example , even if a veto-level decision is required to take on a position , it might make sense to require a majority vote to left it .
