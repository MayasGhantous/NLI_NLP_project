  surely it does n't hurt you for france to be in the eu . 
  juncker , trump , anti-trump people in the us , the uk , and erdogan all agreeing on something this week . 
  well , * this * was unexpected . 
   but both are centrists and macron in particular is the `` strategic vote '' candidate against le pen , so it makes no sense for voters to switch from him to a pair of nobodies it does if they think that macron is safe in the first round . 
  if i understand the statement correctly , it destroyed the aircraft that dropped the chemical weapons . 
  it wo n't be dropping any more . 
  agent orange was a defoliant . 
  it wiped out trees , not humans . 
  there were some contaminated batches that caused serious harm , but in its pure form , the thing did n't hurt people . 
  * parallelize and add more stations . 
  * use rfid or other automation . 
  going to always be a concern to be dealt with , not just for terrorism . 
   oh my god , shaking . 
  not again , i ca n't fucking believe this . 
  this seriously ca n't be happening . 
  well ... let 's keep perspective . 
  three dead , eight injured . 
  assuming that all eight die , eleven dead . 
  sweden has [ 272 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate ) traffic deaths per year , so worst case this is two weeks of regular accidents in sweden . 
  best case , four days . 
  it 's not good , but this many accidents happen on a regular basis , and people do n't break down . 
  the point of terrorism is to produce terror , not to simply kill a few people . 
  not being terrified detracts from that goal . 
  have n't you guys been having a long string of severe attacks for a while now ? 
   they ca n't stop people from driving . 
  oh , you can . 
  might not be cost-effective , but you could have : * completely robotic vehicles , * entirely redesign cities to avoid having any crowds of people near a driveable area . 
  lot of stanchions . 
  * throw electronic monitoring anklets on possible troublemakers and require that they stay within relatively-secured areas . 
   really ?!, 
  just get on with our lives and ignore it ? 
  maybe `` ignore '' is too strong , but there 's a very legit point here . 
  the main point of terrorism is to create terror , not to kill a few people . 
  when we create coverage and talk about things and get a lot of people afraid , we facilitate that . 
  i do n't know what the best response is . 
  it is possible -- but costly -- to create technical limitations to trucks driving into crowds of people . 
  would have to do major changes to roadways and sidewalks , or roll out new trucks that auto-shut-down on collisions or something . 
  and there will probably be another way for a dedicated person to kill a dozen or two dozen people . 
  we have n't tried simply denying the exciting coverage , though . 
  regular auto accidents are much more deadly than terrorism-driven auto accidents , but people are n't terrified by those . 
  if an act of terrorism only generated a short news item , without all the glitz and glamor , perhaps it would decrease the appeal of engaging in the terrorism in the first place . 
   this is a developing story and hardly anyone checks a reddit thread more than once , let alone checking the comments . 
  if they 're interested and want to do so , surely they can . 
  like `` only-english-speaking hispanics '' , yes . 
  or `` portuguese-speaking brazillian hispanics . '', 
  :-) i think that there has been some shift to use `` latino '' instead , just that `` hispanic '' is still dominant . 
  well , whoever is attacked could call article 5 , and if it were gibraltar , it 'd be the uk . 
  benefit is to whoever is defending . 
   you do n't have the naval power to control the strait anymore . 
  against * spain * ? 
  the brits have [ the fourth-most-powerful navy on the planet by this reckoning ] ( http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-five-most-powerful-navies-the-planet-10610?page=3 ) , and 5th [ by this reckoning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=por8vhuqi8w&amp;t=5m16s ) . 
  also , an attack on gibraltar would almost certainly trigger a shit-ton of external non-military involvement even before an article 5 invocation . 
  if spain were * that * hell-bent on a fight with the uk , i 'm pretty sure that the eu would be involved in negotiating a settlement . 
  back in 1840 , maine and canada had a major land dispute , the [ aroostock war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aroostook_war ) , and the us and the british empire ( neither of whom wanted the two setting off a larger war ) negotiated a settlement , with the us paying maine for giving up some of its claims . 
  given that there 'd be shit-tons of nato and eu member nations with commitments in various ways to both , my guess is that it 'd be dealt with diplomatically . 
  i like how someone stuck colored dots all over the blade to give it a cheery appearance . 
  arguably it 'd make sense to provide economic support if the sanctions are seen as likely to be short-term . 
  it 's `` polonium '' rather than `` plutonium '' . 
  defaulting via inflation is as bad from an investor standpoint . 
   then they have a term `` latinos '' , which complicates thing even further , as that is neither skin color , nor race , not continent , though some say that `` latinos '' stands for `` latin america actually , the us usually uses `` hispanic '' for that . 
  kaliningrad is n't relevant because it has no land connection to the rest of russia . 
  but you 're right that the `` warm water ports '' thing does not hold up , in that sevastopol in crimea is not russia 's only warm-water port in the black sea . 
  [ novorossiysk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novorossiysk ) is another large warm-water black sea port , and there are also smaller ones ( which * would * cost something to develop , but ... ), 
   yes , but that 's nothing you can change at this point . 
  russia is too involved over there by now . 
  we were [ deploying artillery units into syria ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/03/08/marines-have-arrived-in-syria-to-fire-artillery-in-the-fight-for-raqqa/?utm_term=.3aebafb69f28 ) last month . 
  it 's morphing from a special forces and cia deal to bringing in the conventional us military . 
  i do n't see how russian involvement is a barrier . 
  this sort of thing does not strike me as diplomatically wise . 
  it 's politically advantageous to be many states , as it provides more senate influence . 
  [ failed continent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pangaea ), 
  i 'm pretty confident that in a week and a half , he 's gon na knock it off , because either he 'll have gotten the power that he wants or blown his chance . 
  a europe/us dickwaving thread started as a response to / u/xnicolex . 
  this should be good . 
  the eu offers to take thrace off erdogan 's hands if it 's such a distasteful place . 
  in turkey , you have to buy your way out of citizenship . 
  maybe the netherlands could front the money to let native-born dutch-turks buy their way out of turkish citizenship . 
  i assume that turkey would not accept it for these people , though ... 
  https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/16383/why-do-some-nations-not-allow-renunciation-of-citizenship  in the case of iran however , iranian citizens can only renounce their citizenship when they 're over 25 and with the permission of their council of ministers ( the latter of which makes it almost impossible to obtain ) . 
  one reason is that if iran catches a former iranian within its border doing espionage or committing crimes or claiming to be related to the former shah of iran or simply masquerading as a foreigner , that it reserves the right to view that person only as an iranian citizen and not provide any of the reciprocal courtesies afforded to a foreigner holding a foreign passport or holding a diplomatic passport . 
  the us and the uk and canada and the us and new zealand and australia and almost all the americas allow multiple citizenships without restriction . 
  europe tends to permit with restrictions . 
  southeast asia and thereabouts and africa tend to disallow multiple citizenships . 
  you can not take away someone 's citizenship in another country , for obvious reasons -- imagine if another country could strip you of yours . 
   gibraltar is n't even part of the uk fed-ral-ize !, 
  fed-ral-ize !, 
  if you 're gon na do an eu reddit meetup in gibraltar , there may be a closing two-year window ... 
  the uk joining nafta wo n't simply involve throwing their name at the bottom . 
  i mean , maybe they 'd do something on a provisional basis , but the difficulty is n't in coming up with an initial agreement . 
  it 's in making sure that everyone 's industries have had their input and concerns met . 
  i remember reading about the financial services bit in nafta . 
  so , canada did n't want to have their whole financial industry go us , so they wanted to have some things that would shield canadian banks . 
  probably a million things like that . 
  my bet is that if the uk joins nafta , they will have a laundry list of concerns , and similarly mexico and canada and the us will have a laundry list of concerns . 
  the selling point for nafta is that most of the other parties have already found a politically-acceptable-to-other-parties combination , and it is a large fta . 
  it does n't mean that the uk would just sign on without changes to it . 
  if the uk winds up in the efta ( which i would assume will be the case , and the eu 's initial demands from the uk vis-a-vis no parallel negotiations , i assume , indicate that they place a high value at `` getting in first '' to establish the economic terms ) , any incompatibilities will need to be harmonized . 
  well , there was [ mikhail lesin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_lesin ) . 
  seriously , though ... even if he * was * murdered , that does n't mean that the state did it . 
  i 'm trying to imagine someone who both has a need for one and needs it smuggled .
