  i did n't notice it until a chinese buddy of mine -- not a particularly thin-skinned guy -- took exception to me using it . 
  never been aware of any sort of campaign or anything about it , but ... < shrug , 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  yeah , a lot of people threw in the towel long ago and started calling that `` classical liberalism '' . 
  ca n't fight the man by offering easy solutions when you are the man . 
   the whole `` sanctuary cities '' and anchor baby nonsense going on in the us does n't happen here . 
  you commit crimes like the man in the article and your ass is getting deported . 
  frankly , if you commit crimes in the us and you 're present illegally , you 're also getting deported . 
  the major factors for the us are having a border to mexico and having particularly high pay for a lot of jobs . 
   growing up being constantly told every single thing you do is a sin and you 'll spend the eternity suffering in hell for it is absolutely normal bah . 
  i [ give the edge to protestantism over catholicism ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/sinners_in_the_hands_of_an_angry_god ) . 
  the calvinists make the catholics look like wusses . 
  i love these , but there needs to be some software to facilitate these . 
  they often do n't line them up perfectly ... should be possible to take a couple pictures and have software generate a perfect mapping . 
  i 'm pretty sure that canada 's training contingent -- [ 200 soldiers ] ( http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/operations-abroad/op-unifier.page ) , no heavy combat hardware -- does n't represent a significant existential threat to russia . 
  [ * archon : the light and the dark * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archon:_the_light_and_the_dark ), 
   the infrastructure is usually built by foreign ( mostly german ) companies , and most of our larger businesses are also foreign/german owned . 
  they move their factories here so they can pay 5 times less salary than in germany , and make huge profits . 
  hmm . 
  but that 's not an inherent sign of a negative , right ? 
  i mean , it may tend to increase the value of the particular type of labor relative to other forms of labor or capital or whatever other forms of assets there are in hungary . 
  ... but in germany , it 's just doing the reverse . 
  in germany you probably have workers complaining about how `` they ca n't compete with foreign labor and how this helps the other country more than germany . '', 
  and in an efficient market , if you reduce the costs of an input like that and make a business very lucrative , your profit will not survive -- some * other * business will see the existing one making a ton of money , say `` hey , * i * want to get in on that '' , and go start up their own competitor that undercuts the existing one , and the resulting competition pushes profit down towards zero . 
   and i 'm not even going into all the programmers/engineers/doctors who get free education here then move to western europe for higher pay . 
  on this one , i agree with you -- this is a legitimate concern , and an inefficiency that exists in the us too at the primary and secondary levels -- [ looks like only 8 % of primary and secondary educational funding comes from the federal budget ] ( https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/role.html ) , but one state could pay to educate someone , and simply have them move . 
  there are a couple of ways that could be used to deal with this : * make funding education an eu competency . 
  this does not require giving control over education to the eu . 
  in the us , the federal government has effectively no role in determining curriculum , but does provide educational funding ( much more funding when it comes to higher education ) . 
  you 're still vulnerable to the eu educating someone and having them leave the eu , but presumably you can expect to see higher inter-eu movement . 
  * provide a system of tracking people and have an inter-eu set of agreements having destination states provide `` rebates '' on education to source states . 
  the us [ tends to spend something like an average of $ 130k/student to educate them in public primary and secondary levels ] ( https://ed100.org/blog/cumulative-cost-of-k-12 ) . 
  because of that potential loss , we would expect states to underfund education relative to what would be an efficient level . 
  if you break that up with some weighting over their working lives , you have the target state repay the source state . 
  the us suffers the same issue . 
  note that i 'm very suspicious that eu members are digging themselves into some difficulties when it comes to pension funding , which sees a very similar problem -- eu members that have people tend to leave are losing the mechanism to fund the retirement of the older people in the country . 
  on this one , the us does have a solution , as social security is a federal mechanism , not a state mechanism . 
  * completely eliminate public subsidy of education . 
  here , each individual becomes responsible for taking out debt to pay for their primary and secondary education . 
  the us tends to have primary and secondary education publicly-funded and tends to have higher education privately-funded ( at least to a greater extent ) . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what rationale went into deciding to draw the line at higher education , since it seems a bit arbitrary , but ... < shrug  . 
  this might have some other issues in that if it tends to discourage people from getting a primary or secondary education at all , it may have serious negative externalities in society . 
   also the eurozone is shit and it 's only good for germany while seriously hurting southern europe and france . 
  it basically hurts every country with a negative trade balance , most notably greece and portugal . 
  i post this on here a lot , but i do want to reiterate : it 's not advantageous in trade to try to force a positive trade balance -- someone doing so winds up worse-off in an efficient market than someone who does n't . 
  my understanding is that greece or italy can see disruption and elevated unemployment from not having a floating currency while having a very different economy from germany . 
  however , [ the idea that the goal of trade should be to try to produce a positive balance of trade died about three hundred and fifty years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) . 
   the thing is , that actually is why women choose those methods . 
  yes , i was n't trying to crack a joke . 
  [ * scientific american * : `` sex and suicide : why do more men than women kill themselves ? 
  ] ( https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/sex-and-suicide-why-do-more-men-than-women-kill-themselves/ ), 
  he had some scheme where he planned to get rid of trident but not decomission the submarines carrying them because it would result in job losses . 
  that sounded pretty inscrutable to me . 
  you can word something politely , but normally being firm as to matters of territorial integrity -- particularly as regards a country who tried annexing said territory not long ago , one might add -- is pretty reasonable . 
   i mean can eat two big macs plus fries without a problem and i 'm still hungry three hours later how can these small amounts of `` food '' make them even fit for work . 
  a big mac has 540 calories each . 
  a medium fries has 340 calories each . 
  if you had two big macs and a medium fries , that 's 1420 calories -- i 'm assuming that you 're eating only one fries and not drinking anything with calories , as a medium coke would add 220 calories to that . 
  a moderately-active man [ needs ~ 2,200-2 ,800 calories per day ] ( http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/many-calories-average-male-need-day-5165.html ) . 
  the two-big-macs-and-one-fries is already the majority of the daily calorie budget spent , even if you assume the high end caloric requirements . 
  `` more suitable for open-casket viewing purposes . '', 
   they figured out that the order including tanks and ammo would be to expensive , so instead of reducing the order they left out the ammo . 
  this is pretty much the definition of useless . 
  this is not , i think , incredibly uncommon . 
  france and the uk short of munitions in libya , and i know that a swede on here was talking about sweden buying a missile boat ... with no missiles . 
  my guess is that the time to obtain munitions is smaller than the time to obtain and train people on the platform that uses it , so militaries gamble that they will have sufficient advance warning and be able to start purchasing munitions ( and will get a larger budget ) if things get serious . 
   and they have a history of overspending on their military i think that countries in greece 's position vis-a-vis turkey might feel differently . 
   any type of actual war against nuclear nations would go from 0 to 100 instantly . 
  india-pakistan and argentina-uk are both counterexamples where a country initiated a war against a nuclear power . 
  partly because occasionally countries decide to try to take your islands . 
  the un [ says that you 're middle of the pack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_happiness_report ) , so now you do n't even have that sweet misery to wallow in . 
  in the us , women are likely to try to overdose on prescription drugs , which is not all that effective at actually killing someone . 
  men are likely to simply shoot themselves , which tends to pretty effectively get the job done . 
   isis are who we support in this fight . 
  nope . 
  stop reading your conspiracy theory outlets . 
   unfortunately it went against sa and oil related interests , so we supplied isis instead . 
  no , you did not supply isis . 
   the big deal is economic benefits coming from reduced transit times of freight no , no . 
  i understand why romania would want to be in schengen . 
  what i do n't understand is why someone would want romania to be out . 
  i mean , my knee-jerk response would be `` freedom of movement matters a lot , but once you 've got that , a new member joining schengen should be a comparatively minor concern for other members '' . 
  i mean , it only buys something insofar as it lets you catch something or someone crossing the border when they should n't -- to me , that seems like people illegally passing through romania or smuggling , the things i mentioned above . 
  well , it 's not just one flat rate . 
  [ here 's the wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_the_united_states ) . 
  here 's the [ relevant chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_federal_effective_tax_rates_by_income_percentile_and_component.gif ) . 
  compared to the eu , i believe that consumption tax is much less relevant ( the federal government does n't impose any consumption tax at all -- that 's just state and local ) and income tax is relatively-important . 
   he really understood what uk was about and that uk will never fit in a continental european system . 
  i 'm usually skeptical of anything that involves someone trying to distill national character ... 
  could you expand on why ? 
   unless russia finds jesus suddenly [ check ] ( http://www.st-barbara-church.org/images/new/lord-jesus.jpg ) . 
   this is what happened to schengen what * is * the big deal there , anyway ? 
  i mean , the only real issue that disallowing schengen seems to really help with would be people who are n't supposed to be in romania using it as a gateway into the rest of the eu ( is romania particularly vulnerable to this ? ), 
  or smuggling . 
  i am not familiar with the work behind [ land value taxes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_value_tax ) , but i understand that they have a deep philosophical and political background . 
  there are some people who are very attached to the idea of them . 
  i am a bit suspicious that some of the historic appeal may have been because in more agricultural times , land was once * the * big capital good , so it acted like a [ wealth tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wealth_tax ) , and appealing to people who wanted that . 
  radical wealth redistribution historically often took the form of redistribution of land ... land is , i think , no longer as important a capital good , so some of the arguments for land value taxes may no longer be present , as it taxes disproportionately capital in the form of land . 
  that is , were i to be a wealthy spaniard , instead of purchasing land and constructing a factory in spain ( and thus being subject to tax ) , i might instead want to invest my money in , say , a factory in turkey . 
   one corporate tax rate should be across the eu .
