  we have two separate tax systems -- federal and state . 
  the state taxes however it wants and the federal government taxes however it wants -- but the federal tax applies to everyone . 
  you might want that to let eu members compete on taxation for things that are n't related to eu-wide issues -- that is , if the irish figure out a way to operate their country efficiently with low taxes , you 'd want to let them compete based on that against countries that have higher taxes . 
  however , it would still mean that you get funding for , say , cap and defense or whatever else . 
  french . 
  well , * gratis * got sucked in a long time ago . 
  * libre * appears to have made it into wiktionary , so we 'll see . 
  normally it 's implied from context -- this was highly-separated from context . 
   areas with more enrolled students will presumably receive more funding but even this level of funding is n't enough . 
  i mean , are you just generally complaining that the funding for education in the uk should be higher , or is it that it does n't scale linearly with the number of students ? 
   then there are problems with lack of housing , especially affordable housing , driving up house prices . 
  on that , while i 'm sure that it 's an input , as long as there are no regulatory barriers , it should be bounded by cost of new construction . 
  hmm . 
  all right , now i want to check the numbers . 
  it [ looks like ] ( http://www.zoopla.co.uk/market/uk/ ) the current average price per square foot for a detached home in the uk is # 346 , so # 3,114 / square meter . 
  the [ cost per square meter of construction ] ( http://www.costmodelling.com/building-costs ) for a detached house in the uk appears to run # 1,760 . 
  [ the cost for residential land ] ( http://www.buildinglanduk.co.uk/residential-land-for-sale.htm ) appears to be # 5.5 m per hectare in london -- the most expensive area . 
  that 's # 550/square meter -- some other examples had prices less than a fifth that . 
  in some less-expensive areas , it appears to be more like # 87/square meter . 
  so it looks like construction costs dominate land costs . 
  usually the house does n't completely fill the lot -- there 's a garden in front or back -- but it 's [ apparently also the case that the most-common british dwellings ( 81 % were detached and most of these were two-story ) have multiple floors , so i 'll just somewhat-arbitrarily assume that there 's a 1:1 land to square footage ratio . 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6703/1750754.pdf ) in the us , it [ looks like construction and land costs are 80 % of the price of a house ] ( https://www.nahbclassic.org/generic.aspx?genericcontentid=248306 ) . 
  the land price is about a third of the cost of labor , on average . 
  so assuming that the uk is similar , that 'd give an expected market price of # 2,887 / square meter for a detached house in london , or # 2,308 / square meter for a detached house in less-expensive areas . 
  the actual average housing price in the uk should be about 7 % -25 % lower than we 'd expect based on the cost of land and construction and estimated overhead , so there is more overhead or regulatory restrictions or something else that 's making it harder than it should be based on costs to produce another house to add to the housing stock . 
  additionally , the average cost per square meter of construction in the us [ appears to run ] ( http://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/architects-and-engineers/build-a-house/ ) about $ 150/square foot , or about # 1,323 / square meter . 
  so it looks like some of it is high construction costs -- the us pays 25 % less than the construction costs in the uk -- if the uk were comparable , it 'd lop another 18 % off the average uk house price . 
  that * may * partly be due to construction differences -- the us norm is to use a timber frame , and it looks like [ masonry is more-common in the uk than timber ] ( http://www.the-self-build-guide.co.uk/house-construction-methods.html ) . 
  it does say that timber frame is an option , but i do n't know how much more timber costs in the uk than in scandinavia or the us or canada -- though i have a hard time believing that it 's that hard to ship it from scandinavia . 
  the uk should n't particularly suffer from any unusual restrictions that would require builders to build special buildings ( earthquakes , hurricanes , tornadoes , wildfires , major flooding ) . 
  that 'd suggest that uk housing could come down maybe 25 % -43 % relative to what it could reasonably be based on construction and land costs . 
  that 's actually also about [ what * the economist * was estimating for overvalue based on a different set of metrics -- compared to rent prices and compared to disposable income ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/global-house-prices ) :  to determine whether homes are fairly valued * the economist * looks at the relationship between prices and disposable income -- an indicator of affordability -- and between prices and rents -- a substitute for buying a home . 
  if rising prices move these ratios above their long-run averages , then either incomes or rents are likely to rise , or house prices to fall . 
  across america house prices , after falling by 25 % from their peak between 2007 and 2012 , are now at fair value compared with rents and incomes . 
  but thanks largely to their big cities , housing appears to be more than 40 % overvalued in australia , britain and canada , according to the average of our two measures . 
  well , `` reform '' is another vague term , though `` further integrate '' works . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-federalism  anti-federalism refers to a movement that opposed the creation of a stronger u.s. federal government and which later opposed the ratification of the 1787 constitution . 
  the previous constitution , called the articles of confederation , gave state governments more authority . 
  led by patrick henry of virginia , anti-federalists worried , among other things , that the position of president , then a novelty , might evolve into a monarchy . 
  yup . 
   if the idea however is to cause division by leaving some members behind ( esp . 
  precisely countries like spain , portugal or slovenia that , for varying reasons , the founding countries might deem ` unworthy ' ) , then i do n't see this ending well . 
  well , realistically , i 'm assuming that further integration has to be the result of a bilateral decision -- both sides need to agree to it . 
  i have a hard time imagining any situation where the eu would permit unilateral decisions as to further integration -- that 'd be completely unworkable . 
  and if decisions are going to be bilateral , there are probably going to be some points on which it 's the `` core group '' that puts the kibosh on things . 
  so i 'd imagine that that 's going to happen , but i do n't know whether it 's something to object to . 
  the only real alternative is blocking any further integration without full consensus from all members , which seems to me to likely be more objectionable . 
   let 's hope for macron and schulz and some actual pro-european politics . 
  in this context , what would `` pro-european politics '' entail ? 
  in the us , normally those about to be executed are permitted to request a last meal , and have a fair amount of leeway in choosing what they want . 
  one guy [ ordered a last meal including mcdonalds ' fries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/last_meal ) :  gary carl simmons , jr. : 1996 murderer ; executed in mississippi in 2012 -- lethal injection : one pizza hut medium super supreme deep dish pizza with double portions of mushrooms , onions , jalape\u00f1o peppers , and pepperoni , a second pizza with three cheeses , olives , bell pepper , tomato , garlic , and italian sausage , 10 8-oz . 
  packs of parmesan cheese , 10 8-oz . 
  packs of ranch dressing , one family size bag of doritos nacho cheese flavor , 8 oz . 
  jalape\u00f1o nacho cheese , 4 oz . 
  sliced jalape\u00f1os , 2 large strawberry shakes , two 20-oz . 
  cherry cokes , one super-size order of mcdonald 's fries with extra ketchup and mayonnaise , and two pints of strawberry ice cream . 
  he consumed about half of the meal . 
  [ 27 ] and here you are just handing it out every day . 
  clearly the prison is too luxurious . 
  ireland is making bank . 
  also , eastern europe is slowly converging ... 
  [ * libre * , not * gratis * !, 
   multi speed europe would be pretty damn awful for poland why is that ? 
  i mean , afaict nobody seems to have defined what the implementation would entail . 
   western companies enjoy national protectionism note that doing this for particular industries is not normally a good idea . 
  it provides a benefit to a particular industry in that country ... but at the cost of weakening all other industries in that country to `` pay '' for the boost to that strengthened industry . 
  well , the uk 's leadership . 
  the uk 's leadership also did n't want brexit ... 
  free trade, 
   this is particularly true in more rural areas like lincolnshire and east anglia that received big influxes of eastern european agricultural workers but pretty much no investment in schools , healthcare or infrastructure to reflect the increasing population . 
  < dubious  does the uk not tie school funding to number of enrolled students ? 
  and surely healthcare reimbursement is tied to the amount of use it gets . 
  i mean , i could see not expanding streets or something enough to keep up with traffic and getting congestion -- that 's a common problem in high-growth areas . 
  i can see how it would be confusing , what with me responding directly to a serious comment describing american garb . 
  ahhh , okay . 
  then that does seem about reasonable , thanks . 
  if that 's correct , the current pension should be ~ 75 % what it was in 1990 , and 136 % what it was in 1995 in real terms . 
  so it does represent something of a reduction from the soviet era . 
  three that were used a way back in us history : * [ * join or die * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/join,_or_die ) * [ united we stand , divided we fall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_we_stand,_divided_we_fall ) * and a benjamin franklin quote : `` we must , indeed , all hang together or , most assuredly , we shall all hang separately . '', 
  hmm . 
  okay , fair-enough -- so the buying power of a russian pensioner for non-russian goods has increased since then , but decreased for russian goods , i guess . 
  < headscratch  [ this ] ( http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?a=200000&amp;c1=rub&amp;indice=rucpi2000&amp;dd1=01&amp;mm1=01&amp;yyyy1=1995&amp;dd2=06&amp;mm2=03&amp;yyyy2=2017&amp;btnok=compute+actual+value ) seems to say that 200,000 rubles in 1995 is equivalent to 9 436 599.96 rubles today . 
  that seems like it ca n't be right , though -- if so , it would mean that the pension today is 1/731th what it was in 1995 , which seems unlikely . 
  i 'm probably missing something obvious , but ... 
  soooo ... what are the chances of successfully aborting brexit at this point ? 
  i bet that it 's french labor law , which produces high unemployment among the young . 
  `` tear down the status quo '' sells better to discontent people . 
  just to add some numbers : http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/08/world/retired-people-are-struggling-in-the-new-russia.html?pagewanted=all  according to roland nash of the russian working center for economic reform , the average pension nationally is about 200,000 rubles a month , or just under $ 45 , compared with the average salary of $ 109 a month . 
  but in real terms , discounting inflation , that pension represents only 55 percent of the average pension of 102 rubles in 1990 , when prices were fixed abnormally low and before the big surge of inflation . 
  that $ 45 pension in 1995 was presumably in 1995 dollars ( when the article came out ) . 
  https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/balancing-russias-budget-could-cost-pensioners-46-billion-47669  russia 's roughly 40 million pensioners receive on average 12,900 rubles ( $ 240 ) in state pension payouts . 
  that 's in 2015 dollars . 
  so lets put some approximate average pensions up in constant 2017 dollars : | year | average pension in russia in constant 2017 dollars | | - | - | | 1990 | $ 130.36 | | 1995 | $ 71.70 | | 2015 | $ 245.90 | if that 's accurate , it seems like pensioners today are substantially-better-off in real terms than they were at the end of the soviet union .
