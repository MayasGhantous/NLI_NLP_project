  as for the japanese , they would be ground to powder . 
  all the rest was merely the proper application of overwhelming force . 
  the british empire , the soviet union , and now the united states , bound together with every scrap of their life and strength , were , according to my lights , twice or even thrice the force of their antagonists . 
  no doubt it would take a long time . 
  i expected terrible forfeits in the east ; but all this would be merely a passing phase . 
  united we could subdue everybody else in the world . 
  many disasters , immeasurable cost and tribulation lay ahead , but there was no more doubt about the end . 
    silly people -- and there were many , not only in enemy countries -- might discount the force of the united states . 
  some said they were soft , others that they would never be united . 
  they would fool around at a distance . 
  they would never come to grips . 
  they would never stand blood-letting . 
  their democracy and system of recurrent elections would paralyze their war effort . 
  they would be just a vague blur on the horizon to friend or foe . 
  now we should see the weakness of this numerous but remote , wealthy , and talkative people . 
  but i had studied the american civil war , fought out to the last desperate inch . 
  american blood flowed in my veins . 
  i thought of a remark which edward grey had made to me more than thirty years before -- that the united states is like `` a gigantic boiler . 
  once the fire is lighted under it there is no limit to the power it can generate . '' being saturated and satiated with emotion and sensation , i went to bed and slept the sleep of the saved and thankful . 
  in retrospect , yeah , '67 looks easy because it went well . 
  at the time , that was n't quite how things looked . 
  unlike israel , us intelligence had solid confidence that israel would prevail , and even the us 's predictions on outcome were rather-less-favorable than what actually happened . 
  technically he did get away with the holocaust part , just not the thousand year reich bit . 
  if you mean palestine , it 's actually quite dense .

   israel claims that in the long run , those jews who remain outside of israel , remain at danger of potential repeat of history . 
  mmmhmm . 
  how many near-death experiences has the jewish population of israel had since israel 's founding now versus the jewish population of the us ? 
  there was [ 1948 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_palestine_war ) , and then [ 1967 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/six-day_war ) ... 
   in the earlier gulf war , when saddam invaded kuwait , germany contributed cash but not soldiers . 
  in response to criticism from britain among others that germans preferred to pay others to risk their lives , then president richard von weizs\u00e4cker commented incredulously : `` can it really be the world has forgotten how good german soldiers can be ? '' the banter continues ... 
   because a cabinet is not a person and therefore can not be persona non grata . 
  while i suspect that he probably was n't super-worried about formality and i suspect that in practice you are correct on that point , it might also be that the term has acquired a legal meaning that differs from its literal latin meaning . 
  for example , `` manslaughter '' need not involve a man , though the literal english meaning certainly does imply that . 
   i would understand it as short for '' [ the ministers of ] the cabinet ... '' - would n't it work then ? 
  if the sentence were written that way , it would , but the two are n't equivalent . 
  imagine the same construction with a different noun ; might be more-flagrant : * the firestation is burning . 
  * the firemen of the firestation is burning . 
  the second clearly is n't correct . 
   what determines if a singular is treated like a plural , i.e. 
  the police are ... ? 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/police  noun : police ( uncountable ) ( plurale tantum ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plurale_tantum  a * plurale tantum * ( latin for `` plural only '' , plural form : * pluralia tantum * ) is a noun that appears only in the plural form and does not have a singular variant for referring to a single object ... in english * pluralia tantum * are frequently words which denote objects that occur or function as pairs or sets , such as * spectacles * , * trousers * , * pants * , * scissors * , * clothes * , * electronics * , * bagpipes * , or * genitals * . 
   turkish people that came to germany that were educated enough or rather intelligent enough to partake in society are usually very well integrated . 
  note that turks in germany voted for akp in the last election , whereas turks in the us ( a better-educated group that had to pass through a skill-oriented immigration process ) voted for chf . 
  that being said , the situation in germany is partly our fault , a product of cold war-era coalition-building : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastarbeiter  the first gastarbeiter were recruited from european nations . 
  however turkey pressured the federal republic to allow its citizens to become guest workers . 
  [ 1 ] theodor blank , secretary of state for employment , was opposed to such agreements . 
  he held the opinion that the cultural gap between germany and turkey would be too large and also held the opinion that germany needed no more labourers because there were enough unemployed people living in the poorer regions of germany who could fill these vacancies . 
  the united states , however , put some political pressure on germany , wanting to stabilize and create goodwill from a potential ally . 
  the german department of foreign affairs carried on the negotiations after this , and in 1961 an agreement was reached . 
  well , he probably said it in dutch , and i do n't know what the rules are there , but in english he 's got it right . 
  `` cabinet '' is n't a plural . 
  you 'd say `` turkey 's whole cabinet is drunk with power '' , not `` turkey 's whole cabinet are drunk with power '' . 
  i mean , you could say `` turkey 's ministers are drunk with power '' , but not `` cabinet '' ... 
   2007 unless you think that we 've revised our model of native peoples in an area , it 's still accurate . 
   you know exactly what i mean well , if your issue is with europe being blended together , i think my point stands . 
  if it is n't with europe being blended -- say , for example , your beef is with immigration from libya or syria or nigeria , hell if i know what you 're trying to get at -- then the eu being the eu is irrelevant to that . 
  the eu splitting up would n't limit that . 
  eh , that was world war i , pre-nazi era . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_by_country#turkey  turkey was neutral until several months before the end of the war , at which point it joined the allied powers . 
  prior to the outbreak of war , turkey signed a mutual aid pact with france and britain in 1939 . 
  after the german invasion of france , however , turkey remained neutral , relying on a clause excusing them if military action might bring conflict with the ussr , which , after the division of poland , turkey feared . 
  then , in june , 1941 , after neighboring bulgaria joined the axis and allowed germany to move troops through to invade yugoslavia and greece turkey signed a non-aggression pact with germany . 
  turkey was an important producer of chromite , which is a key ingredient in the manufacture of stainless steel and refractory brick and germany had limited access to it . 
  the key issue in turkey 's negotiations with both sides was the sale of chromite to germany or to the allies . 
  the allies had access to other sources and mainly bought the chromite in order to preclude its sale to germany . 
  turkey halted its sales to germany in april , 1944 and broke off relations in august . 
  turkey declared war on the axis powers in february , 1945 , after the allies made its invitation to the inaugural meeting of the united nations ( along with the invitations of several other nations ) conditional on full belligerency . 
  no turkish troops ever saw combat . 
   i want to see a twitter war between trump and erdogan . 
  i wish both would shut up and do their jobs quietly . 
  ... that being said , after they step down , they can go have a four-way with duterte and kim jong un . 
  i thought that turks were generally not all that into the not-drinking thing . 
  also ... huh . 
  i do n't drink either , and i regret a bit that alcohol is so tied up with socialization , even in the ( compared to europe , relatively-dry ) us . 
  i wonder what they do at said clubs . 
  hmm . 
  how are you measuring that ? 
  citizenship ? 
  language knowledge ? 
  [ europe is pretty light-skinned ] ( http://www.grida.no/graphicslib/thumbs/1805c933-493c-4b85-be16-ad06eb342332/large/skin-colour-map-indigenous-people_8b88.jpg ) . 
  having europe unified is n't going to change skin tone in europe all that much , if you 're worried about germany getting a tan . 
  also , as i recall , you contributed quite a few resources to its development . 
  and while i realize that there are no hard rules as to who gets what in an international divorce , it seems difficult to me to argue simultaneously that ( a ) the uk should continue to pay for ongoing projects that it was involved with committing to ( which * is * certainly something that the eu has been raising ) and ( b ) that the uk should not benefit from projects that it has contributed to in the past . 
  that is , there should be some degree of symmetry . 
  either ( 1 ) brexit is a clean break and there are no liabilities but also no perks , or ( 2 ) past commitments and contributions are taken into account , and you get to benefit from things that you paid into but also have to pay for things that you were involved with committing to , relative to that commitment . 
  otherwise , you wind up catching the downside both ways , which does n't seem very reasonable to me . 
  to me , ( 2 ) seems like a no-brainer -- it 's less-disruptive and neither the eu nor the uk have reason to want unnecessary disruption . 
  given that you live in michigan , it was [ statistically probably german ] ( https://upworthy-production.s3.amazonaws.com/nugget/5228fb810fe612794a001236/attachments/usethnicities2.jpg ) . 
  it 's germany , dude . 
  whadda want , ship a bunch of people in from french guiana ? 
   as a sort of fun fact , there 's actually more non-native english speakers than native ones in the world these days . 
  that may , interestingly-enough , lead to simplification of the language -- if you 're bilingual , you 're going to have less time to deal with some nuance of the language than being monolingual . 
  like , it 'd be interesting to do a statistical vocabulary comparison between people in the uk or somewhere that does english natively and people in , say , the netherlands , and see whether some words are in less use on the continent -- because those words might be going the way of the dodo . 
  there are various forms of `` limited english '' out there , but afaict , nothing 's gotten wide adoption . 
  wikipedia [ has ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_page ) a far smaller [ basic english ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_english ) form . 
  i love the fact that it uses a simpler grammar , but while i do think that english 's vocabulary is oversized ( lots of loanwords from different european languages ) , it goes too far in reducing the grammar size , and just sounds awkward . 
  you need more than 850 words for a serious language , i think . 
  if you 're in a single market , people will tend to flow to where the jobs are . 
  many britons clearly took issue with large-scale immigration to the uk , felt overwhelmed -- okay , fine , but then you 're looking at making other places also compelling places to live and work .
