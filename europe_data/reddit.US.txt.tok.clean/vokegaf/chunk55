  i do n't see this as being a good idea . 
  all costs on galileo are fixed relative to the userbase -- it does n't buy the eu anything to restrict access . 
  it also does n't really provide much leverage in that there are a number of satnav systems out there . 
  hell , i 'd assume that future receivers will use at least gps , glonass , and galileo , and simply failover if one is n't available . 
  it was a hundred million in then-dollars , but basically you 've got it right . 
  it should have been * wordifying * , not * wordifing * , though . 
   by european standards , both parties in the usa are right wing populism . 
  right wing , maybe . 
   any germans also believe turks born in turkey are turkish , not german , even if they 've never been to turkey and hold german or dual citizenship i assume that you wanted `` born in germany '' . 
   turkey views all turks as its citizens , regardless of where they live , well , if they hold turkish citizenship , they are , regardless of where they live . 
  no , no , trump is a self-made man .

  [ university of wisconsin madison : a guide to bias-free communications ] ( https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/_files/aps/adeo/article_guide_to_bias-free_communications.pdf ) personally , i 'm fine using the masculine as generic , as is the traditional usage .

  ** this shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
  ** this refers to constitutionally-neutral member states . 
  you are required to defend sweden , austria , finland , malta , and ireland if they are attacked , but they are not required to defend you if you are attacked . 
  if moldova or serbia join and do n't change their constitution , they will also have the same status . 
   we go together , or not at all . 
  it 's more important to bring in uk , norway , switzerland in eu than having a tight federation of half of the european nations . 
  or just do both . 
  how do you have a specifically-defensive military headquarters ? 
  well , i do suppose that that would explain it ... 
  new zealand , are n't you the one that finds nuclear weapons so abhorrent that you ca n't stand to have one or even a nuclear reactor in your territorial waters ? 
  you know , your general interests overlap pretty strongly in getting a trade agreement in place . 
  i hope that at least the bureaucracy on each side is actually churning out material already behind-the-scenes , disregarding all the public chest-pounding from the politicians , because otherwise they 're going to run out of time . 
   advanced ftas requiring private arbitration courts like ttip have no chance of success because of public opposition to foreign interference into domestic legal affairs . 
  every fta that i 've looked at that both the uk and the other eu members have signed has involved isds . 
  well , that escalated quickly . 
  [ germanic people have been doing sandals and socks for a long time ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b2/88/9d/b2889dd2032207abc96b1f02171f7852--germanic-warrior-marauder.jpg ) . 
  well , it was having dire financial problems not long ago . 
  possibly . 
  and , of course , language can influence position . 
  but my suspicion is that the dominant factor was a linguistic one . 
  the linguistic difference predated the eu . 
   i take it you meant / r / , yes , sorry . 
   and i assume it quickly became filled with photos of unlocked bicycles and dropped wallets ? 
  i expect that you 're joking , but for those not familiar with the term , `` jailbait '' is slang for someone below the legal age of consent for sex -- that is , someone having sex with them would be guilty of statutory rape . 
  in the us , at least , this is also always lower than the age one can consent to being the subject of pornography . 
  the pictures there were ... well , theoretically not pornographic , but let 's say provocative pictures of young girls . 
  since they were of real people , they would violate us child pornography laws if found to be pornographic . 
  not surprisingly , the images came about as close as possible to being pornographic as they could get away with , and the site admins were constantly getting complaints and having to pull content to keep it legal for the us . 
  then it became the most-popular subreddit and google started suggesting it as one of the top six subreddits whenever someone googled for `` reddit '' , which resulted in a deluge of more outraged people every time someone mentioned reddit somewhere and a few hundred thousand people googled for it . 
  finally , the reddit admins decided that the whole thing was a monumental pain in the butt and not worth their effort and closed the thing down . 
  it was one of the major reddit dramas , some years back .

  well , the eurobarometer , the thing that people are complaining about here as having a flawed translation skewing the results , is a [ european commission project ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurobarometer ) . 
  i 've no reason to believe that there has been any issue with translation in pew 's polls or any us company 's polls in particular . 
  i 'm just using it as an example of another polling company . 
  i * think * that pew does use local companies , since they credit them in their methodology section , when polling in the eu . 
  i 've no idea who actually handles translation . 
  what i was trying to raise was that having all translations of the poll itself made available with poll results is useful , since it permits for looking for any sources of errors there , and that i think that it should be a best practice for polls in the eu , not just polls run directly by the eu . 
  in the us , it 's not an issue that really shows up much , since polling here is pretty much monolingual ... 
  also unequal and poor ( haiti ) or fairly rich and equal ( norway ) . 
  i am surprised that iceland ranks so highly . 
  [ iapcar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_association_for_the_protection_of_civilian_arms_rights ) should clearly go do a kickstarter-type thing and then mention it on / r/guns , say . 
  i suspect that they 'd get a shit-ton of donations from international people infuriated that someone somewhere is trying to remove guns . 
  note that eubarometer also polls people on whether they feel like they consider themselves part of europe or the uk . 
  the problem with asking the british this is that in british parlance , europe often * means * the mainland . 
  it should really have explicitly asked about the strength of their ties to the european union . 
  there are probably a bazillion of these , and even within a language , it 's impossible to iron them out ( the same question in the us would have been read differently ) . 
  but at least eubarometer publishes the questions so that people can raise issues ... 
   am i write in thinking that there is a difference between `` feel comfortable '' and `` feel at ease '' . 
  `` comfortable '' implies welcoming someone with open arms . 
  `` at ease '' implies not minding , not being disturbed . 
  i ca n't speak for dutch , but in english , i 'd say that the connotation of `` feel comfortable '' and `` feel at ease '' is pretty close . 
  neither would mean `` welcoming someone with open arms '' . 
  both would be close to `` not minding , not being disturbed '' . 
  sure , there 's bad social science . 
  but saying `` social sciences often have a problem with letting political advocacy leak in and losing objectivity '' ( to me , anthropology often seems to be awfully left-wing , for example ... ) is n't the same thing as saying that it 's not a science . 
  if you 're forming hypotheses to explain data , testing them , and letting other people reproduce , you 're engaged in science . 
   at least when they get strange results , they should check again whether they have n't made any mistake in the design of the survey kinda late to go fixing issues , though : then you have to throw out the questions or re-run the survey . 
  maybe have two different translation companies do the question translations and a third rectify the two . 
  that being said , translation is a real concern in polling internationally in the eu . 
  it was one of the potential sources of error i raised when talking about a pew poll that someone was questioning . 
  ( pew does a good job of publishing their questions and instructions with their results , but they 've historically polled in the us , so they only publish them in * english * , which leaves open potential for a mistranslation not to be hit in review ) . 
  it might be a good idea for the eu to put out a document with polling best practices , including a standard way to limit translation error ( like have a second source review it ) : these problems are gon na be common in multilingual environments like the eu . 
  greece has debt . 
  their government borrowed money and stole or irresponsibly spent it without much care for tomorrow . 
  germany bought a lot of that debt . 
  so now they 're the responsible party . 
  some of the debt was forgiven . 
  what a lot of people want is for a lot more of it to be forgiven . 
  what this amounts to is paying down the losses . 
  however , there 's nothing special about germany here . 
  any member could do this . 
  in fact , * any * country could . 
  the united states could go and pay off greece 's debt . 
  however , no countries seem to want to do that . 
  i see a lot of non-germans saying `` germans should pay for the losses '' . 
  now , there 's certainly room for saying `` it would be beneficial to give greece a hand '' . 
  however , i have a difficult time swallowing that when it is n't people saying `` we should * all * lend greece a hand '' . 
  greece has a debt of [ $ 350 billion ] ( http://countryeconomy.com/national-debt/greece ) . 
  there are 511 million people in the eu . 
  if all 511 million people each paid $ 684 , greece 's debt would be paid down .
