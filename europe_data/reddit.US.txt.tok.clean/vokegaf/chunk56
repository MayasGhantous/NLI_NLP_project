  now , maybe that 's not how people want to distribute it . 
  maybe they want poorer members to pay less , or wealthier people in a country to pay more . 
  but the general principle stands : if someone truly thinks that greece needs aid and that other countries have an obligation to become involved , it seems to me that they should be advocating for their own countries to step in . 
  sure , make doing so conditional on other countries also signing up . 
  but what 's the logic behind `` germans and only germans should eat the losses ? '', 
  other than that it means that one 's own country need not pay ? 
  germany was n't the only country that signed off on greece 's ez membership . 
  it 's bundestag mps , not bureaucrats . 
  i 'm guessing more domestic german politics than revenge . 
  before disney and crowd started making everything saccharine-sweet : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brothers_grimm  the brothers grimm ( die br\u00fcder grimm or die gebr\u00fcder grimm ) , jacob ( 1785 -- 1863 ) and wilhelm grimm ( 1786 -- 1859 ) , were german academics , philologists , cultural researchers , lexicographers and authors who together collected and published folklore during the 19th century . 
  they were among the best-known storytellers of folk tales , and popularized stories such as `` cinderella '' ( `` aschenputtel '' ) , `` the frog prince '' ( `` der froschk\u00f6nig '' ) , `` the goose-girl '' ( `` die g\u00e4nsemagd '' ) , `` hansel and gretel '' ( `` h\u00e4nsel und gretel '' ) , `` rapunzel '' , `` rumpelstiltskin '' ( `` rumpelstilzchen '' ) , `` sleeping beauty '' ( `` dornr\u00f6schen '' ) , and `` snow white '' ( `` schneewittchen '' ) . 
  their first collection of folk tales , children 's hand household tales ( kinder - und hausm\u00e4rchen ) , was published in 1812 . 
  let 's take a look at the brothers grimm versions : * [ cinderella ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cinderella )  the next morning , the prince goes to aschenputtel 's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister . 
  the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes in order to fit the slipper . 
  while riding with the stepsister , the two doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot . 
  appalled by her treachery , he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister . 
  she cuts off part of her heel in order to get her foot in the slipper , and again the prince is fooled . 
  while riding with her to the king 's castle , the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot . 
  -  in the end , during aschenputtel 's wedding , as she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids , ( they had hoped to worm their way into her favour ) , the doves fly down and strike the two stepsisters ' eyes , one in the left and the other in the right . 
  when the wedding comes to an end , and aschenputtel and her prince march out of the church , the doves fly again , striking the remaining eyes of the two evil sisters blind , a punishment they had to endure for the rest of their lives .

  language barriers ? 
  i 'm not sure how trans-national groups like that are . 
  well , some furries are gay and have a lot of sex with each other . 
  that probably would n't go over too well . 
  on the other hand , other furries are not gay and do not have sex with each other . 
  there 's nothing that i 'm aware of that prohibits dressing up as a six-foot-tell anthropomorphic wolf in islam . 
  i have one group of friends that set up a major furry convention , and spend plenty of time on the `` having gay sex '' side of that world . 
  while i have n't ever really asked them about it , i note that they rather go out of their way to separate their hobby from the rest of their life . 
  i rather imagine that some of it came from the fact that having gay sex was legal but often socially taboo . 
  everyone 's got a camera these days , too . 
  but fursuits cover someone up to the point of rendering them pseudononymous . 
  you 're just a fox and a wolf hanging out with other people . 
  just as many people here prefer to not use their given name and enjoy the freedom of discussion that pseudononymity provides ( / u/vokegaf can speak candidly to / u/potato _ in_my_anus without either knowing the other party 's real identity ) , so too do those people want to separate their recreation from the rest of their lives . 
  redditch is very free-wheeling , quite libertarian as forums go . 
  there are not many rules at the site level -- the site even tried for quite some time to keep having / u/jailbait running , despite the tremendous controversy it generated as it became one of the largest subreddits . 
  but one of the few sins that are unforgiveable on reddit is doxxing : unmasking someone 's pseudonomymity and exposing it to others . 
  so , you see , we all like wearing our masks , even if they 're shaped a bit differently . 
  the friends i mentioned are all quite active on pseudoanymous gay forums as well . 
  i 'd say that wearing a fursuit is , in fact , a more traditional form of that pseudoanonymity . 
  consider the libertine [ masquerade balls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/masquerade_ball ) of europe in centuries past :  masquerade balls were extended into costumed public festivities in italy during the 16th century renaissance ( italian , maschera ) . 
  they were generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes , and were particularly popular in venice . 
  they have been associated with the tradition of the venetian carnival . 
  with the fall of the venetian republic at the end of the 18th century , the use and tradition of masks gradually began to decline , until they disappeared altogether . 
    they became popular throughout mainland europe in the 17th and 18th centuries , sometimes with fatal results . 
  gustav iii of sweden was assassinated at a masquerade ball by disgruntled nobleman jacob johan anckarstr\u00f6m , an event which eug\u00e8ne scribe and daniel auber turned into the opera gustave iii . 
  the same event was the basis of giuseppe verdi 's opera a masked ball , although the censors in the original production forced him to portray it as a fictional story set in boston . 
  most masks came from countries like switzerland and italy . 
    john james heidegger , a swiss count who arrived in italy in 1708 , is credited with having introduced the venetian fashion of a semi-public masquerade ball , to which one might subscribe , to london in the early eighteenth century , with the first being held at haymarket opera house . 
  [ 1 ] london 's public gardens , like vauxhall gardens , refurbished in 1732 , and ranelagh gardens , provided optimal outdoor settings , where characters masked and in fancy dress mingled with the crowds . 
  the reputation for unseemly behavior , unescorted women and assignations motivated a change of name , to the venetian ridotto but as `` the man of taste '' observed in 1733 ;    in lent , if masquerades displease the town ,     call 'em ridottos and they still go down . '', 
    a standard item of masquerade dress was a `` vandyke '' , improvised on the costumes worn in the portraits of van dyck : gainsborough 's blue boy is the most familiar example , and a reminder of the later 18th-century popularity in england for portraits in fancy dress . 
    throughout the century , masquerade dances became popular in colonial america . 
  its prominence did not go unchallenged ; a significant anti-masquerade movement grew alongside the balls themselves . 
  the anti-masquerade writers ( among them such notables as samuel richardson ) held that the events encouraged immorality and `` foreign influence . '', 
  -  the masked guests were supposedly dressed so as to be unidentifiable . 
  okay , that one even made me cringe .

  that 's why 4chan users post the ackbar clip in response to people posting pre-op male-to-female transsexual pictures that avoid showing the genitals , yes . 
   i 'm honestly too old to understand what the fuck the second part of your comment means . 
  `` wifu '' is a misspelling ( or french spelling ? ), 
  of [ waifu ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/waifu ) :  ( fandom slang ) a fictional female character from non-live-action visual media ( typically an anime , manga or video game ) to whom one is attracted and , in some cases , whom one considers a significant other . 
  a `` trap '' is a cross-dressing man with a penis who dresses as and appears to be a woman -- i suspect that the term derives from `` falling for the trap '' and being attracted to the man .

  point 1 : it sure is funny how all of erdogan 's political opposition is , one-by-one , being discovered at being up to nefarious deeds . 
  hope people who voted for erdogan are happy with what they 're getting , because they 're sure gon na have a hard time changing if they do n't like it !, 
  point 2 : this is n't the first time i 've seen erdogan doing the loud sport jacket thing . 
  i dunno if this is a thing in turkey , but i have a mental association with used car dealers and sleaziness and dishonesty : it 'd be improbable wear for someone in a leadership position in the us . 
  * possibly * for a period of time half-a-century ago people might have worn them in offices .

  https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/furry_survey  ** the survey indicates a comparatively young fandom ** , with a third ( 33.2 % ) of respondents reporting their age as between 15 and 19 ; the average age of 23.28 years is very slightly younger than the uc-davis indicated figure of 24.6 years . 
  correspondingly , around 60 % of respondents said they had considered themselves a furry for between 0 and 5 years ; 9.5 % said they had done so for less than 1 . 
    ** the education level tends to be fairly high . 
  ** the percentage of american respondents aged 25 or higher reporting a college degree , at 52.9 % , is substantially higher than the 29.4 % reported by the us census bureau .
