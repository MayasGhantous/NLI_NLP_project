  you claimed `` for any reason '' . 
  you did not say `` military involvement '' . 
  in iraq , the government requested us air support after repeatedly losing battles . 
  the people attacking iraq were operating from syria , and syria was not shutting them down . 
   mainstream aka american propaganda ? 
  if you want to paint the world as `` american propaganda '' , go for it . 
   you absolutely are a colonist when you think you have the right to attack any country for any reason first , the us does n't do that . 
  second , you may not know what a colony is , or you may simply be mad and want something to tar the us with , but that 's not what a colony is -- it 's a territory controlled by another . 
  libya is n't controlled by the us . 
   only fools refuse to see the reality of the us empire . 
  well , you could maybe argue that the american civil war represented imperialism . 
  but if you 're going to claim that libya does , you 're going to be well disconnected from the mainstream . 
   the usa is responsible for million of people dead in the middle-east with their never ending wars and for destabilizing libya itself france : `` hey , us , can you support us in a bombing campaign in libya '' . 
  french dude , several years later : `` the usa is responsible for destabilizing libya '' . 
  you do n't like the situation in libya , fine -- but you 're in no position to complain about the us vis-a-vis libya . 
  you ca n't really be a colonist if you are n't colonizing it . 
  this image was kinda small , so i hit google images . 
  it looks like about a third of georgia 's population lives in the capital of tbilisi , a city of 1.2 million that dwarfs every other population center in georgia . 
  looks like this is nestled among hills , with [ fortress ruins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narikala ) and a church overlooking the town , and a `` peace bridge '' apparently spanning the river .

  loophole : one could advocate for * changing * the rules and for something to be judicial !, 
  guernsey and jersey should be enthralled !, 
   it 's not currently being destroyed by something , so lisbon . 
  the guy there was joking -- he was referring to the popularity of destroying the golden gate bridge in movies . 
  and yet somehow , theists have way more kids than atheists . 
   and kinda mean . 
  not in my eyes . 
   mind you `` native american '' also has ambiguity . 
  i suppose that there are contexts in which it could be something else , but in practice it 's not an issue in my experience , whereas `` native americans '' and `` indians '' can be ambiguous even with context . 
  no , i 'm saying that indians would be called indians . 
  pakistanis would be called pakistanis . 
  yeah , i 've said `` wa-wa-wa indian or red dot indian '' . 
  that one i 'm happy to have us move to `` native american '' on , because it 's damn ambiguous . 
  yeah . 
  a press conference here would probably look different , and i expect that the same would be true in sweden . 
  but at the end of the day , differences in presentation probably are n't * that * objectionable at an international level either . 
  they might piss off families in russia , but meh ... remember that some decades earlier , in [ project azorian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_azorian ) , the cia had gone to very great expense and effort , spending billions of dollars , for a chance to get inside k-129 , an earlier soviet nuclear ballistic missile submarine . 
  the us had informed russia about all this in the decade prior to the k-141 disaster . 
  these are vessels capable of clobbering dozens of cities , and both sides cared very much about having as much of an edge as possible as regards them . 
  would the us help to the best of their ability ? 
  i 'm sure we would . 
  would we also try to get as much intelligence out of the matter as possible ? 
  i 'm also sure we would . 
  so some russian guy is forced into the position of trying to figure out the security implications , on the spot , of having a bunch of people having some degree of access to k-141 . 
  they took they conservative route . 
  i do n't know if it was the right decision . 
  but i will say that it was not an unreasonable decision . 
  for all russia knows , the us already had someone in the us go out and work up an elaborates set of plans to exploit exactly such a scenario . 
  < checks flair  in the us , the first amendment very much protects advocacy of violence . 
  there are three related exceptions : a [ true threat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/true_threat ) , [ fighting words ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fighting_words ) , and [ incitement to violence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incitement#united_states ) . 
  in practice , modern interpretations of all three are much narrower than they might sound in common english , and i 'd be fairly confident saying that none of these exceptions would apply had he said this in the us : that the first amendment would protect this speech from any laws being made to prohibit it . 
  you 're probably thinking of incitement to violence . 
  the us [ interpretation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brandenburg_v._ohio ) requires that this be aimed at producing [ imminent lawless action ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imminent_lawless_action ) -- like telling someone with a gun to someone else 's head to `` pull the trigger '' . 
  just saying that muslims who do n't pray should be burned does not meet the imminency requirement . 
  i think that he should be able to do it , and we explicitly constitutionally protect speech , even that banned by some countries as hate speech , in the united states : http://www.christianexaminer.com/article/snopes-com-verifies-farrakhan-threats-but-doj-will-not-pursue-charges/49361.htm here 's the leader of the nation of islam in the us :  `` i 'm looking for ten thousand in the midst of the million . 
  ten thousand men who say , ` death is sweeter than continued life under tyranny , ' '' farrakhan told the congregants at mt. 
  zion missionary baptist church in miami . 
    `` death is sweeter than to continue to live and bury our children , while white folks give the killer , hamburgers . 
    `` death is sweeter , than watching us slaughter each other , to the joy of a 400 year old enemy . 
  yes , death is sweeter . 
    `` the quran teaches persecution is worse than slaughter . 
  then it says , ` retaliation is prescribed in matters of the slain . ' retaliation is a prescription from god ( beats his breast ) , to calm the breast of those whose children have been slain . 
    `` so if the federal government will not intercede in our affairs , then we must rise up and kill those who kill us . 
  stalk them and kill them and let them feel the pain of death that we are feeling . '' -  `` after looking into the matter we have determined that the farrakhan speech is protected by the first amendment and we will not be pursuing an investigation into the speech , '' louis delgado , spokesman for the u.s. attorney 's office , said . 
   european like minded hmm . 
  most russians live in europe . 
  is this like the brits using `` europe '' to refer to the mainland ? 
  realistically , russia also would have potentially exposed information about the submarine that would not have been worth the lives of the men . 
  it 's easy to criticize moscow from the us side . 
  i 'm skeptical . 
  hard to place a value on freedom of movement . 
  i 'd buy it if the person in the slum were actually starving , but not under normal circumstances . 
  < googles  nope . 
  switzerland beats you . 
  http://www.germanjoys.eu/2015/07/other-peoples-indians-and-germanys-minority-filled-prisons.html  switzerland tops the list with a whopping 74.2 % . 
  yes , you read that right : 74.2 % of the people in swiss prisons are not swiss . 
  germany is nowhere near as skewed ; only 27.9 % of its prisoners are foreigners . 
  probably not really what you want to have coming up at your parole hearing ... 
  they 're making fun of the french prison system as being easy , as i understand it from [ a francophone 's translation ] ( https://reddit.com/comments/6t38m8/comment/dlhym2w ) . 
  there may be arguments to have the us penal system take a lighter hand , but this probably is n't it . 
  government policy at the time . 
  hmm . 
  but in the context of the discussion , i do n't think that it 's the case that people in the us do n't care about the american flag . 
  it 's just considered a right to engage in political speech by defacing it . 
  the government is bot permitted to pass laws preventing people from criticizing the us even if other people in the governed area really , really like the us and tremendously disagree with the person destroying the flag . 
  i think that the difference is not so much how people care about the symbol , but in the position on how they may be used . 
  i 'm nit saying that pakistanis would be called indian ,, 
  i do n't consider french guiana part of europe . 
  part of the european union , sure . 
  canada and the us are mostly settled by people who came from europe , but presumably you do n't call * them * part of europe . 
  `` the czech republic '' rrequires that nonstandard article . 
  definitely going with czechia . 
  i certainly do not hear people using `` south asian '' in the us . 
  kinda like how the dutch were the deutsch living closest to the english , i guess . 
  yeah , same here . 
  nobody says `` south asian '' for indians . 
  they 're just `` indian '' . 
  ... which naturally involves a bit of ambiguity with native americans , who are n't * usually * called indian any more , but still are occasionally . 
  awed , she 's being supportive . 
   page 322 in all fairness , after 322 pages of visualizing * my * daughter be dicked by various people , i might be a bit out of it .
