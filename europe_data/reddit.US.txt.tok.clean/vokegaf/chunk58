  tax * optimization * . 
  they should be , since you want to build to the highest priced segment you can relative to the materials and land . 
  but that 's fine : by adding to the housing supply , you pull your new residents off competing for the existing supply . 
  the price on that is set by whoever can outbid enough people to get a slot in the available space : everyone else is forced out . 
  since there are fewer people with money bidding for that other housing , it lets prices come down from ridiculous levels on them . 
  also , the brits have this thing where they consider skyscapers just for the poor . 
   you know so some neighbors would n't get any idea of getting some more extra land . 
  nah , the money 's in people , not land . 
  speaking of which , we 'll be taking those , mexico ... [ one-fifth of el salvador , estimated one-quarter of mexico now living inside usa ] ( http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/07/one-fifth-of-el-salvador-estimated-one-quarter-of-mexico-now-live-inside-usa/ ), 
  there will be an older population in 2100 than today , barring some change . 
  even aside from the fertility rate issue , life expectancies are projected to increase ( which is part of what 's propping up the population numbers from being even lower , but society will be grayer than it is today ) . 
   and you can not force people into having kids . 
  i am sure there is some level of carrot and stick that would cause people to have more children . 
  the question becomes whether that is a worthwhile tradeoff . 
   so if they go to america , they 'll be expected to dump their language and become americans . 
  it 's not uncommon for first-gen immigrants to teach their kids the motherland 's tongue . 
  but it also stops within a few generations , because the kids ca n't be arsed to do it when it 's not buying 'em anything . 
  it 's not external pressure not to know it . 
  it 's simple practicality . 
  the jobs are in english . 
  the media is in english . 
  the bulk of people speak english . 
  unless you want a ( dubiously ) private channel for talking to someone else in a room where only you guys know the language , it just does n't buy that much beyond keeping grandma and grandpa happy , and that goes away as family ties become more distant . 
  i 've got a bunch of friends who are first-gen immigrants . 
  they invariably speak accented english and teach their kids the languages that their parents grew up with ( mandarin , cantonese , turkish , indian state languages , spanish , etc ) . 
  they have english words slipping into their speech when talking to the expat community even in that language . 
  their kids speak flawless english and probably badly-accented mother tongue . 
  ... he 's talking about how ignorant americans are about europe and how prone to stereotyping they are about europe and how thin-skinned americans are interspersed with his claims that sweden is n't in europe and getting upset with people who wo n't listen to him . 
  also illegal migrants , but yeah . 
  i mean , in one sense , yes . 
  but the eu permits for free population movement ( like the us ) but does not have a common a social security system ( unlike the us ) , so any major movements of population really screws over the elderly in the source country . 
   also , china does far more business with eu countries than it does with america . 
  i dunno about * far * more . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_china as of 2011 , china-eu trade was $ 567.2 billion , and china-us trade was $ 446.7 billion . 
  i mean , the eu is 27 % higher , but it 's in the same ballpark . 
  well , the reason i said `` you '' was because it makes people not think of people as simple machines with knobs that are really easy to twist . 
  i think that it 's easy for people to say `` oh , send out a baby box ... done '' . 
  but would that make * them * have another kid ? 
  that really forces you to think seriously about the kind of incentives change that would be required . 
   all current trends projected forward , the eu-28 population will be a bit larger in 2060 than now . 
  un projections have europe as a whole dropping by 100 million by 2100 . 
  belgium will still be rising at that point ( this will be due to immigration , as belgium has well sub-replacement fertility , as your first link shows ) . 
  [ see table s. 2 ] ( https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/files/wpp2017_keyfindings.pdf ), 
  / laughs too vain to give my weight , and this is a collective contest . 
  well , same applies to slovakia . 
  the guy i was responding to was czech . 
  because i think that a majority of voting brits wanted to be in the eu , but with free movement brakes . 
  if they ( painfully , disruptively ) leave because they 're told that it is absolutely unacceptable for any member to limit free movement and then immediately the eu does exactly what they wanted ... well , i 'd be upset if i were 'em . 
  obviously , some brits were leave regardless of immigration , and they 're probably delighted with the outcome , but i mean brits as an aggregate . 
  well , erdogan 's making it damn difficult for 'em to wind up in syria , that 's for sure . 
  well , some of it is locked into place . 
  it 's too late for women who are post-menopausal to have children , so their contribution to tfr will never rise above its present level . 
  at some point , you guys are gon na give in and allow more skyscrapers in london , i predict . 
  is the uk more like china or the us ? 
  because i 'd call it pretty similar to the us . 
  globally , precipitation increases with global warming . 
  i enjoy a challenge . 
  there 's always skyscrapers . 
  if you do that literally less than a year after the british public voted out because cameron could n't negotiate any brakes on freedom of movement with the eu , the brits are going to be * furious * . 
  well , that does mean that unless things change somehow , western europe is gon na screw over eastern europe pretty hard , as the elderly in we have comfortable retirements built in part on the earnings of younger people from ee and the elderly in ee have very poor final years . 
  that might sound nice for we in the short term , but in terms of building a lasting , continent-wide union , i 'd think that some way of offsetting the losses would be good to consider . 
  i am sure that it is also including immigration/emigration , not just fertility . 
  we have a sub-replacement fertility , just under 1.9 , but their projections show us steadily growing for those 80 years . 
  we rely on pulling a steady flow of immigrants from other countries . 
  a generous eu-wide * pension * would solve the `` eastern europe 's pension system is gon na be in dire shape '' issue . 
  still have to deal with getting more immigration to the eu or higher fertility , though . 
  well , what policies would be necessary to make you want to have one more kid than you currently want to have ? 
  that * would * entail those countries finding a source of mass immigration , where those immigrants will stay in the country in question . 
  i 'm pretty sure the issue is more that you are n't getting screwed . 
   the united states of america plus , we 're getting more obese , so there 'll be even more of us there to love !, 
   i never really understood why it was so important for them to enforce it on switzerland . 
  the whole `` it 's one of the four fundamental principles of the eu '' makes little sense since we did n't really get the other three ( free movement of goods , services and capital ) . 
  i assume because people move in and economically tie switzerland to the rest of the eu , marry in , naturalize and so forth , and switzerland joins the eu down the line : that is , the `` intermediate statuses '' exist with the intent of converting a country to an eu member down the road . 
  you want free movement if you want to ultimately have one people , one country . 
  geopolitically , europe 's greatest weakness is its division , so this addresses that . 
  looks like the us grows by 39 % : dark blue , like ireland . 
   huge immigration rate i assume you wanted `` huge emmigration rate '' . 
  i strongly doubt it , or the destruction of the existing eggs would n't have been necessary . 
  it looks like if it 's near hens it gets into the egg proper . 
  https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/fipronil#section=absorption-distribution-and-excretion  [ phenyl ( u ) -14 c ] - fipronil ( 19.2 mci/mmol ) was administered orally in capsules daily before feeding to groups of 5 laying hens at doses of 0.05 , 2 , or 10 ppm for 28 days ; assuming a daily intake of 150 g dry matter , these doses were equivalent to nominal daily intakes of 0.0075 , 0.3 , and 1.5 mg , respectively . 
  eggs were collected twice daily . 
  the animals were killed about 24 hr after admin of the final dose , and tissues were obtained . 
  of the administered radiolabel , 28-42 % was recovered in excreta , 15-18 % in eggs , and 1-5 % in tissues ; the total recovered was 52-58 % . 
  the greatest total tissue residues after admin of the highest dose were found in peritoneal fat ( 56 ppm ) . 
  the levels in eggs were also high ( 30 ppm in yolks ) after this dose and had not plateaued by the end of the study . 
  the levels were lower in skin ( 17 ppm ) and much lower in liver , egg white , and muscle .

  i 'm assuming that it 's gon na have to work its way out of the chicken 's systems to the point that the eggs are safe again before they can start using the eggs again . 
  giant omelette festival ? 
  that looks more like a giant scrambled eggs festival . 
  i do n't see how they could flip that thing whole . 
  well ... there 's [ steganogrqphic networks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steganography#network ) . 
  tor 's pretty [ vulnerable to traffic analysis at the moment ] ( http://www.netresec.com/?page=blog&amp;month=2013-04&amp;post=detecting-tor-communication-in-network-traffic ) but if this turns into an arms race , my guess is that it is a potential recipient of more darpa funding . 
  [ wikipedia : tor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tor_\\ ( anonymity_network \\ ) )  the core principle of tor , `` onion routing '' , was developed in the mid-1990s by united states naval research laboratory employees , mathematician paul syverson and computer scientists michael g. reed and david goldschlag , with the purpose of protecting u.s. intelligence communications online . 
  onion routing was further developed by darpa in 1997 . 
  [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]   the alpha version of tor , developed by syverson and computer scientists roger dingledine and nick mathewson [ 18 ] and then called the onion routing project , or tor project , launched on 20 september 2002 . 
  [ 1 ] [ 22 ] the first public release occurred a year later . 
  [ 23 ] on 13 august 2004 , syverson , dingledine and mathewson presented `` tor : the second-generation onion router '' at the 13th usenix security symposium . 
  [ 24 ] in 2004 , the naval research laboratory released the code for tor under a free license , and the electronic frontier foundation ( eff ) began funding dingledine and mathewson to continue its development . 
  [ 18 ]   in december 2006 , dingledine , mathewson and five others founded the tor project , a massachusetts-based 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) research-education nonprofit organization responsible for maintaining tor .
