  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/28/armed-police-lifeguards-to-guard-french-beaches-amid-terror-fear/ )  officers of the crs riot police are deployed as lifeguards at beach resorts in july and august each year . 
  in the past they have abandoned their guns , flak jackets and helmets in favour of swimming trunks , sunglasses and t-shirts when taking up the much coveted perch on a lifeguard 's chair . 
    the officers in charge of beach first-aid centres and their deputies will now carry guns in sand-proof holsters , specially designed for use with beachwear . 
  bullet-proof vests will be kept near lifeguard posts .

   confidence ... plummets the poll asked :  industry leaders and politicians recently met at a summit to discuss the ongoing scandal over manipulated emissions test results for diesel cars from several automakers . 
  have you lost confidence in the german auto industry ? 
    57 % confidence lost okay , two points . 
  first , `` lost confidence '' can be treated as a binary thing , as when a parliamentary government can no longer command the confidence of its legislature : either it has it or it does n't . 
  it can also be an range of confidence , as in `` i feel * more confident * in this car after having driven it for a week in harsh conditions without it having problems '' . 
  my assumption is that the second sense is being used here . 
  and i think very few people , given the context of that first sentence , would honestly say that they 've reduced confidence in the second sense ... they 'd have to either see it not as a concern or say that they already expected this sort of thing . 
  so i 'm not sure how meaningful the result is : it might just be measuring loyalty to the german auto industry . 
  secondly , this poll does not quantify that loss of confidence . 
  saying `` plummets '' is hardly reasonable when there is no number to work with . 
  the smallest iota of a drop in confidence appears in these poll results as identical to a large drop . 
  in all fairness , our part of goal was to strengthen capitalist economies to eliminate the pressures that might generate support for communism . 
  it was n't just `` here 's a check , bye now '' . 
  while i 'd argue that having capitalist economies worked out well for the countries involved , it 's not surprising that the soviet union did n't want to buy into that . 
  also , i think that soviet mismanagement of the economies did much more to screw up eastern europe than us aid did to improve western europe . 
  it was n't * that * much money relative to decades of economic activity . 
  [ us department of commerce : italy country commercial guide : labor ] ( https://www.export.gov/article?id=italy-labor )  italy 's labor force participation rates are among the lowest in the eu , particularly among women , the young and the elderly . 
  low labor force participation may be partially attributable to the informal economy , which italy 's statistics agency estimates as 12.9 percent of italian gdp . 
  -  many italian employers report an inability to find qualified candidates for highly-skilled vacancies , demonstrating significant skills mismatches in the italian labor market . 
  many well-educated italians find more attractive career opportunities outside of italy , with large numbers of italians taking advantage of eu agreements on freedom of movement to work in the united kingdom , switzerland or germany . 
  there is no reliable measure of italians working overseas , as many expatriate workers do not report their whereabouts to the italian government . 
  skilled labor shortages are a particular problem in italy 's industrialized north . 
    on paper , companies may bring in a non-eu employee after the government-run employment office has certified that no qualified , unemployed italian is available to fill the position . 
  in reality , the cumbersome and lengthy process acts as a deterrent to foreign firms seeking to comply with the law ; language barriers also prevent outsiders from competing for italian positions . 
  work visas are subject to annual quotas , although intra-company transfers are exempt from quota limitations . 
  -  with the goal of modernizing italy 's notoriously inflexible labor market , the renzi government enacted the jobs act as the centerpiece of its structural reform agenda . 
  -  the jobs act removed a key obstacle to hiring new employees by removing employees ' unqualified right to seek reinstatement , almost always via lengthy court cases ( known as `` article 18 '' of the italian labor code ) . 
  the new law provides greater legal certainty to employers by permitting employee reinstatement only in discrimination cases . 
  article 18 also discouraged employers from hiring employees on indefinite contracts , with employers preferring to hire temporary employees . 
  the goi introduced a hiring incentive in 2015 for employers to hire workers on indefinite contracts , granting them a three-year exemption from employers ' contributions to social security for each new permanent employee . 
  -  as of january 2016 , the jobs act appears to be contributing to its stated goal of encouraging indefinite employment . 
  in 2015 , 1.44 million labor contracts received the hiring incentive , of which about one-third were conversions from temporary contracts . 
  from january 2015 to january 2016 , the number of employed italians has increased by more than 299,000 , marking the highest number of italians at work since july 2011 . 
  the number of italians on indefinite contracts increased by 426,000 over the same period , as employers increasingly converted employees from temporary to open-ended contracts .

   you are suggesting further isolating regions i 'd suggest that i 'm doing the opposite of that -- rather , further integrating them . 
   the people without an education are unable to move , i do n't see why . 
  it might be a pain in the butt to move , but they are n't locked in place . 
  people move from much poorer circumstances to the uk . 
  we 've had plenty of exoduses from poor areas in the us , like the [ okie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okie ) migration , or the [ great migration ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_migration_/ ( african_american / ) ) .

   obviously , being an upwardly mobile american it 's moving to areas where your labor 's needed that makes you upwardly-mobile . 
  if , say , one insists on living in a mining town after a mine closes up , one is n't going to be doing too well .

  my ancestry 's as extensive as anyone else 's . 
  these are romanians . 
  why are they going to be deported if someone finds out that they 're going to school , and working in the uk ? 
  that thing is due for a repainting . 
  i do not agree with some of the things that this index treats as being more free , like having unionized journalists . 
   association chief christian knill said the way austrian authorities interpret the law is a `` permanent threat '' to companies and he expected companies to exit the austrian market gradually should such practices continue . 
  i * have * wondered whether that would be a good idea . 
  i think that broadly speaking , most would agree with economic convergence as a goal of the eu . 
  maybe there is disagreement about the best rate , but that it should tend to happen does n't seem like a hard argument . 
  current eu policy does tend to encourage the movement of labor from poorer to wealthier eu members . 
  this is advantageous to , the economy of say , germany , and disadvantageous to the economy of , say , greece . 
  that has effects that are , in my eyes , advantageous : it tends to mix up populations , forming cross-eu cohesion . 
  however , people do -- the uk and brexit being an obvious example -- not much enjoy many people moving * en masse * to where they live . 
  some of that is no doubt dissatisfaction with job competiton , which must happen to some degree for economic convergence . 
  but some of it might also be a sense of having one 's home being culturally changed . 
  i do n't know how much of it is due to each . 
  instead of having workers tend to go to companies , companies * could * also tend to go to where labor is , and the eu could tend to adopt policies that produce this effect . 
  it could focus on policy that encourages eu-spanning multinationals , like providing subsidized `` eu business '' schools in each country , working to eliminate legal differences that affect businesses , establishing a common process for establishing a business , filing tax data for multiple countries . 
  the eu could permit countries more leeway in delaying movement of labor . 
  this will have the effect of producing higher unemployment in wealthier members : wages will still fall . 
  gdp will tend to rise in poorer members and fall in wealthier members relative to what happens today .
