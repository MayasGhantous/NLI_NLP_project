  you know , it 's actually pretty impressive to see what a government can do in a short period of time by seizing the media and going balls-to-the-wall ... 
  also , we use red for our right wing and blue for our left . 
  and `` libertarian '' normally refers to a position that 's fiscally-right . 
  you know , both nato and the us have a bureaucracy , just like the eu . 
  they would n't work without it . 
  and the eu bureaucracy is far smaller and more limited than the us bureaucracy , as the eu is a confederation with many things happening in member bureaucracies . 
  the eu budget is [ 143b eur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union ) . 
  the us federal budget is $ 3.3 t , twenty times as large . 
  if one wants to call the eu bureaucracy heavyweight , fine , but then the us is an odd example to use in comparison . 
   if you want a quick trade deal you 'd probably be better off joining nafta it 's not an either-or ( that 's kind of the point of leaving a customs union , what the upside is -- you have no real limits on who you establish ftas with ) . 
  the uk will probably seek to establish ftas with both the us and eu . 
  nafta is an fta and permits financial services , though -- ftas clearly can . 
  canada is n't a member of the esm ... it just has an fta . 
  no , though both france and the uk are a quarter of the eu military budget . 
  with the uk leaving , unless eu members bump up their spending , france will be a third of the eu 's military budget . 
  that 's not as big as the us is in nato ( over two-thirds of nato ) , but it 's pretty hefty . 
  the dutch dream of filling in the baltic fulfilled ... 
   seems to me we all have a lot more to gain on this particular subject working together than the contrary i mean , it seemed to me that you all have a lot to gain by working together on * all * subjects , but apparently voters do n't agree . 
   i rate them on the level of the daily mail . 
  you either have an incredibly high opinion of the dm or an incredibly low opinion of the economist .

  trade always balances in the long run . 
  it 's not advantageous to try to collect trade surpluses . 
  if i had a referendum coming up , it 'd be high on my list of important things too , whether i was for or against . 
  the difference is that in the one true seven continent model that all countries should use , there is no `` america '' continent . 
  there is a `` north america '' and a `` south america '' , so it 's unambiguous to use `` america '' as shorthand for the us . 
  but with europe , there is direct conflict . 
  how does the ukrainian government come into this ? 
  the problem is that modern agriculture is n't very labor-intensive . 
   it does not confer a right to work in the eu . 
  maybe not , but with the wage disparity , it 'll be profitable as hell for both people in ukraine and businesses in the eu to do business under the table . 
  the political process sounds kinda like estonia and the abortive attempt with finland , the two that i do know about . 
  i just had read it not as `` there was no coercion '' -- i did n't know about that position but is n't a huge surprise -- but rather that the association , like `` no , lithuania was never politically-affiliated with the ussr '' , which i was having a hard time seeing work as a narrative . 
  the link in the comment is to it . 
  apparently other people like it a lot more than i did ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania  in english , the name of the country was formerly spelt rumania or roumania . 
  [ 19 ] romania became the predominant spelling around 1975 . 
  [ 20 ] romania is also the official english-language spelling used by the romanian government . 
  [ 21 ] a handful of other languages ( including italian , hungarian , portuguese , and norwegian ) have also switched to `` o '' like english , but most languages continue to prefer forms with u , e.g. 
  french roumanie , german and swedish rum\u00e4nien , spanish ruman\u00eda , polish rumunia , and russian \u0420\u0443\u043c\u044b\u043d\u0438\u044f ( rumyniya ) . 
  [ scanned english-language map of europe , 1911 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/europe_1911.jpg ) . 
  you can see the old spelling . 
  apparently not in the * eros * sense , though ... 
   there is absolutely no point in providing incentives for families to have more than 3 children . 
  if you treat children from a family as [ fungible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fungibility ) -- which i would think for this purpose they are -- then i do n't see why not . 
  when [ ursula von der leyen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ursula_von_der_leyen ) had her seventh kid , it filled a hole that some other family that had only one kid did n't fill . 
  i 'd imagine so . 
  but unless the country intentionally adds a loophole to facilitate getting a dual citizenship with japan ( which seems unlikely ) , it 's probably equally a pain ( i.e. 
  probably need permanent legal residency for years and so forth ) to regain citizenship in the first country . 
  filthy plebs !, 
  well , change it , dammit . 
  romania stopped being rumania , and czechia * just * became czechia . 
  tell the un , they update their register , and bam !, 
   that the soviet occupation is a myth . 
  ... what ? 
  while the article felt like a * the new yorker * article and i really did not like it , the * new york times * had someone watch russian television for a week , every waking hour of the day . 
  this was way back in early 2015 , before all the election business . 
  they wrote a pretty critical article : [ ` out of my mouth comes unimpeachable manly truth ' ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/out-of-my-mouth-comes-unimpeachable-manly-truth.html?_r=0 ), 
  actually , ireland is nearly the only place in europe that is managing to just about maintain population . 
  gingers are doing something right . 
  well , he did show that poland is neither getting immigration * nor * polish babies . 
  iirc , the black plague wiped out , in the places in europe that were worst-hit , like around italy , about 30 % of the population . 
  the next 80 years will be significantly-worse than that for poland unless either the birth rate rises or people start immigrating to poland . 
  well , there * is * one way to trivially , reliably , legally get us citizenship , but your parents had to plan ahead . 
  as long as you can afford to pay your own medical costs [ ( ~ $ 16k for a c-section , ~ $ 10k for a vaginal birth ) ] ( http://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby#1 ) , it 's perfectly-legal ( i.e. 
  you do n't even need a visa waiver -- it 's not something that will cause a visa to be rejected ) to travel to the us for the purpose of having a kid . 
  the us always \u00b9 grants us citizenship to anyone born on us soil . 
  if you miss that window , though , it gets much , much , much harder . 
  \u00b9 [ mostly always ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_clause ) . 
  foreign diplomats on us soil ca n't do it , and it does n't count if you 're a soldier belonging to a hostile power participating in an occupation of us soil . 
  broadly-speaking , always . 
  [ population pyramid graph for poland ] ( http://www.populationpyramid.net/poland/2017/ ) . 
  it looks like people who already have japanese citizenship are permitted to acquire new citizenship elsewhere but `` new japanese '' being naturalized must surrender them . 
  well , it seems like it 's hard to support a claim about a correlation if you 're saying that the input is something that i can not measure or see measured . 
  [ population density map ] ( http://www.citymetric.com/sites/default/files/bodyimage_201505/population_density_europe.png ), 
  japan [ apparently has slightly less population density ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_territories_by_population_density ) than the netherlands or belgium . 
  the point about mountains is legit , though ... hmm . 
  i have seen some towns taking the entire tops off hills in hilly areas to get more flat ground . 
  at some point , i suppose that becomes viable . 
  maybe terrace for high-density residential area . 
  [ this looks steep ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/kisokoma1.jpg ) , but not so steep that you could n't build housing on it , given enough demand and engineering work . 
  https://www.justlanded.com/english/japan/japan-guide/visas-permits/japanese-citizenship  the application process can be lengthy . 
  the ministry of justice says the whole process takes from six months to a year . 
  citizens who have successfully completed the naturalization process report varying time frames , often it depends on how quickly you can gather all the necessary paperwork together . 
    the good news is , while it may take awhile to process your application , about 99 % of all applications are approved . 
  reported in the japan times : `` in 2010 , 13,072 citizenship applications were approved with just 234 rejected '' . 
  honestly , it looks way easier than getting us citizenship : http://www.tokyoimmigration.jp/eng/kika.html * 5 years residence . 
  * 80 % of time spent in japan . 
  * 20 years or older * no infractions/criminal record ( this is fuzzy , but that looks like what it 's saying ) * must be able to provide for yourself . 
  * no dual citizenship allowed -- must surrender your other citizenship ( s ) upon japanese naturalization * need to be fluent in japanese orally and have at least primary-school-level writing and reading ability . 
  i do n't know whether you 'll be treated identically to japanese natives . 
  but it looks very viable to get a citizenship . 
  eh , political parties can change their image and who they appeal to a lot faster than demographics can shift . 
  how do you measure feminism ? 
  you got ta admit , the pope is pretty celibate . 
   since migrants are a small part of the population ( despite what our extremists say ) , the gap is diluted . 
  the difference would be 0.1 point for the fertility rate . 
  ah , that is a good point , thanks . 
  ( in the us , it 's actually a meaningful difference -- most immigration today is hispanic , and the hispanic fertility rate remains somewhat-elevated for a few generations , so there 's a continuing effect that pulls the overall rate a bit higher . ), 
   that paper actually disproves your theory .
