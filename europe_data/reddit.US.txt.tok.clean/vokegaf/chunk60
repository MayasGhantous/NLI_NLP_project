  given that the eu has no common pension system , it would ease the wealth transfer from the pension system of poorer members to wealthier members . 
  it will tend to produce less mingling of population . 
  companies will derive more benefit from being multinational , and non-multinationals will be at a greater disadvantage . 
  i am not sure whether that is a good thing . 
  but it is another way that things could be done . 
  i think that it should still be a temporary tactic if used . 
  i do n't follow . 
  i understand that a tax must be applied without prejudice . 
  but budgets must surely act as a black box . 
  if i cut a form of taxes that locals pay at the same time as i raise alcohol taxes , i 'm effectively making it harder to come and get drunk without cutting into net revenue . 
  but that 's my point . 
  the borders on the south have n't moved -- it still refers to the states that tried seceding once upon a time . 
  the midwest refers to the same region it always has ( which ... actually is n't really in the western part of the us these days ) . 
  it 's not like states in the midwest are off insisting that they be re-affiliated due to cultural affinity or population movement . 
  it 'd probably violate child labor law , so , not , it 's not legal . 
  but ownership is not involved , so it 's also not slavery to have your kid doing work , whether it 's where you live or elsewhere . 
  if a kid lived on a farm through most of histroy , they 'd be expected to?be doing a fair amount of work . 
  that 's not slavery . 
   firstly , i do n't live in the u.k. fair enough . 
  from your other comments , it sounded like you were , due to being invested in the matter . 
  might be that scottish nationalism is simply a hobby of yours ; it just was n't my first guess . 
   thirdly , are you suggesting that scottish people or northern irish people should stop trying to improve the situation in their home regions and simply move en masse to the home counties if they are unhappy with how those in westminster are dealing with certain regions ? 
  well , personally i 'm a bit suspicious that there * is * such tremendous regional favoritism . 
  one constant to me on online forums seems that every region seems convinced that other people have it better and that they are subsidizing others . 
  but if it really is baked in the system ? 
  yes , absolutely i 'd say it 'd make sense to move . 
  it 's people that matter , not some turf . 
  i 've moved all over the us to where i think i 'm best-off and where opportunities are the best , as have other members of my family . 
  i can understand language barriers in a number of parts of europe still being a concern -- picking up a new language is n't a small deal -- but they do n't exist in the uk , and that 's something i 'd leverage . 
  not necessarily a bad thing . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orlando,_florida has walt disney world :  as one of the world 's most visited tourist destinations , orlando 's famous attractions form the backbone of its tourism industry : walt disney world , located approximately 21 miles ( 34 km ) southwest of downtown orlando in bay lake , opened by the walt disney company in 1971 270k people . 
   orlando ( / \u0254\u02d0r\u02c8l\u00e6ndo\u028a / ) is a city in the u.s. state of florida and the county seat of orange county . 
  located in central florida , it is the center of the orlando metropolitan area , which had a population of 2,387,138 , according to u.s. census bureau figures released in march 2016 , making it the 24th-largest metropolitan area [ 11 ] in the united states , the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the southern united states , and the third-largest metropolitan area in florida . 
  as of 2015 , orlando had an estimated city-proper population of 270,934 , making it the 73rd-largest city in the united states , the fourth-largest city in florida , and the state 's largest inland city . 
  62 million visitors per year :  orlando is also known as `` the theme park capital of the world '' and in 2014 its tourist attractions and events drew more than 62 million visitors . 
  for comparison , all of italy combined handles less than that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_italy  with 48.6 million tourists a year ( 2014 ) , italy is the fifth most visited country in international tourism arrivals . 
  but despite all that , people continue to want to live there :  orlando ranks as the fourth-most popular american city based on where people want to live according to a 2009 pew research center study . 
  sooo ... alcohol surcharge , give locals tax rebate to keep it revenue-neutral ?

  it might violate child labor law , but it 's not slavery . 
  if you truly believe that the uk is set up such that in benefits people living in southern england , why not just move there and reap the benefits of such a lopsided arrangement ? 
   they do n't see foreign men raping or targetting girls of their ethnic group as threatening , cause we are all human right ? 
  i do n't really think that the ethnic background of some guy raping people is really an important input into whether the raping should be considered threatening . 
  hell , i think that it 's bizarre how upset people get over turkey not being in europe or ireland not being in the british isles . 
   and where they stored their missiles to hit the dirty capitalists . 
  [ some things never change !, 
  ] ( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-missiles-kaliningrad-iduskbn13g0w9 ), 
  the us just adds new geographical groupings and less-relevant ones fell into disuse . 
  the north and the south are a lot less important than they once were . 
  the sun belt or the rust belt tend to get more use . 
  europe has a [ ton of different ways of grouping it stretching back over the centuries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_europe ) . 
  why not just introduce new terms for groups rather than changing the existing terms ? 
  when people in the us do it , we are n't trying to make a social statement about who is like or unlike whom . 
  we 're just trying to talk about a region of the continent . 
  the degree of concern about being in the right geographic `` club '' still comes off as profoundly weird to me . 
  i mean , i can get wanting some term to refer to other groupings of people , but why frantically shift existing terms ? 
  just leave those alone to avoid introducing confusion with all the existing material and make up some new ones . 
  that 's actually a really interesting idea in general . 
  normally , i 'm not really enthusiastic about most eu regulations that come up , but blocking companies from establishing unnecessary lock-in is efficient from a market standpoint , and it 's an area that the us is not very active in . 
  from the eu 's standpoint , there 's a secondary incentive in that it makes it more plausible that an eu-based competitor could enter the market . 
  i mean , you 're gon na pay $ 7.99 for that `` got ta have it now '' characteristic . 
  you missed `` no spending change is actually necessary , because we can do an org chart change , write ` eu army ' on the thing , and that will be about the same as actually funding our military , but without the expense '' .

  * rolls eyes * quick on the draw , are n't they , these trade associations ? 
   around 75 % of them will be welfare migrants for life , you think that 75 % of migrants will never work again in their lives ? 
  what 's your source ? 
  i 'm still suspicious that the migrant crisis flaring up at just that time was what flipped the tables . 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6slxyw/europe_is_running_out_of_butter/ ), 
  that 's pretty much what we mostly use cheese for too . 
  after the norwegians got to 'em , salmon sushi too . 
  misdemeanor and felony are not universal concepts -- they 're from english law . 
  russia may have a concept of different `` grades '' of crime that is analogous . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash it would take a hell of an effort to wedge explosives into this explanation . 
  they had plenty of material that was consistent and reviewed by both sides , and that would have to have been falsified . 
  you make an extraordinary claim , you need extraordinary evidence . 
  this is n't extraordinary evidence : it 's 9/11 truther or `` maybe a ukrainian fighter shot down mh17 '' level stuff . 
  the real world does n't have a history of elaborate coverups with tons of evidence that all fits together . 
  that actually probably took more effort than the bulk of submissions . 
  anatolia is n't , but the other part of turkey is in europe . 
  i did n't have a specific piece of data i wanted to raise in it . 
  i 'm using it as an example of a proper source : posting a list of anecdoes is not one when it comes to race and crime . 
  note that the us public still uses cold war east/west lines , though they do n't mean anything by it other than a geographical designator . 
  nobody is likely to have any idea what this `` northern europe '' and `` southern europe '' business is . 
   labeling countries from estonia to albania as simply eastern european only portrays how little a person can fathom beyond his own national borders . 
  you 're pretty optimistic . 
  the population on this sub lives in a pretty rarefied atmosphere .

  maybe you 're looking at sicily or sardinia or cyprus ? 
  well , the decomissioning bit does address it , but i do n't think that anyone is complaining about that part of the directive -- just all the other stuff that was attached to it . 
  oh , yeah , i get that the role is different , just that the standard was similar-sounding . 
  interesting article on the development !,
