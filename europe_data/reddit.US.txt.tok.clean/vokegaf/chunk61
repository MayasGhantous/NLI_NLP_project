  * calls the irish `` english scum '' .

  i ca n't see this producing any friction !, 
  well , sweden can also remove the pin keeping the exchange rate fixed whenever they want , which * is * an important difference . 
    you can not invade the mainland united states . 
  there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass . 
  also , japan never intended to try to invade the contiguous 48 us states in their war plans .

    it has been declared this attribution is `` unsubstantiated and almost certainly bogus , even though it has been repeated thousands of times in various internet postings . 
  there is no record of the commander in chief of japan 's wartime fleet ever saying it . 
  '' , according to brooks jackson in `` misquoting yamamoto '' at factcheck.org ( 11 may 2009 ) , which cites donald m. goldstein , sometimes called `` the dean of pearl harbor historians '' , writing `` i have never seen it in writing . 
  it has been attributed to the prange files [ the files of the late gordon w. prange , chief historian on the staff of gen. douglas macarthur ] '' . 
   following the american debates i 've always been puzzled by this argument . 
  do you really need semi-automatic rifles to hunt ? 
  how is that even a sport ? 
  the second amendment does n't really have anything to do with hunting . 
  sounds kinda similar to the [ strict scrutiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strict_scrutiny ) standard in the us . 
  i strongly suspect that free movement is advantageous to poorer people in poorer eu members . 
  implying that there was ever a point where america was n't great , the damn commies !, 
  czechia would n't an independent foreign policy or ability to sign treaties or fight wars : the eu would do each collectively or not at all . 
  the eu would very probably have more international clout than it does today in doing so . 
  it would be able to credibly make statements like `` the eu will do x '' without hoping that all eu members will actually agree down the line . 
  it would likely , though not necessarily , transfer more funds from wealthier areas to poorer areas . 
  czechia and other members would need to give up the right to unilaterally leave the eu the way the uk did . 
  in return , they 'd be able to rely on the fact that their neighbors would still be in union tomorrw , so can be more comfortable putting money into infrastructure or whatever . 
  there would probably be more laws that do n't fit quite as closely with what people in a particular member want , but on the plus side , they 'd be more standardized across members : one could travel from place to place and do business in different members with less legal differences . 
  the eu would be able to impose taxes on you . 
  the eu , at least theoretically , would be more militarily powerful than it is today , in part because there are limited mechanisms to avoid free-riding today , which tend to push down spending . 
  my own short take is that federation is a plus if you are comfortable `` marrying '' the peoples of europe to each other . 
  it is a minus if you think that you may not want to be part of the eu in the near future ( say , next hundred years ) . 
  okay , i chuckled . 
  have an upvote . 
  note that this could be resolved by moving to a qmv for trade deals sans federalization . 
  federalization would probably do that , but federalization also is n't required for that . 
  though states that lost in a qmv might br pissed and threaten to leave ... 
  i do n't think that federation would require any particular form of the executive . 
  could have co-emperors like the ancient roman empire did for some time , or whatever else you 'd want . 
  in practice , i suspect that there would be a `` leader '' -- that a juncker successor would be a lot more poweful than is the case now , and the individual heads of european countries less-powerful . 
  income , not wealth . 
  ah , thanks . 
  so ... that 's interesting . 
  as i understand it , transylvania is the mountainous part of the country . 
  normally , i associate mountains with poorer , less-densely-populated regions . 
  agriculture likes flat land , and trade and interchange likes rivers ( downstream , out of the mountains , where the river is large and slow and navigable ) , and ports . 
  looking at a [ physical map of romania ] ( http://www.freeworldmaps.net/europe/romania/map.html ) , the plains and rivers look to be south and east of the carpathians , as is ocean access . 
  but in romania , it 's transylvania that 's the better-off portion of the country ? 
  note that the czech percentage of the adult population with a concealed-carry license [ looks to be nearly at the present us percentage ( see graph on page 9 ) ] ( https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/concealed-carry-permit-holders-across-the-united-states.pdf ) , and that the us concealed carry permit rate has been rapidly-rising , whereas the murder rate has been falling . 
  well , okay , this one is a schengen area directive , i guess , but you get my drift . 
  first , pew is a major us polling company . 
  this is not a source that i would expect to try to skew things . 
  they publish the original questionaire with the instructions given the poll workers precisely so that you can look for framing or whatever else . 
  http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/appendix-a-methodology-8/ see question 67 :  q67   please tell me if you completely agree , mostly agree , mostly disagree or completely disagree with the following statements ? 
    ( read response categories )   ( show card with response options )   a. 
  voting gives people like me some say about how the government runs things   b. 
  a strong russia is necessary to balance the influence of the west   c. it 's in our country 's interest to work closely with the us and other western powers   d . there is a conflict between our country 's traditional values and those of the west   e . our people are not perfect , but our culture is superior to others   1 completely agree   2 mostly agree   3 mostly disagree   4 completely disagree   98 do n't know ( do not read )   99 refused ( do not read ) as polling companies go , i consider them to be quite good . 
  i ca n't think of a way that you could introduce much influence there . 
  hmm . 
  i guess that the poll worker 's tone of voice might affect things -- they do n't have a robot running this . 
  for multinational polling , they probably have to have a translated question asked , and afaik they just publish their materials in english , so i guess that translation error might be a possibility . 
  well , the cold war never turned into a major clash , though it did have proxy wars . 
  broadly-speaking , i agree with you , but then i 'm also suspicious that technology plays a role -- war is vastly more-destructive if you wipe out infrastructure today than it would have been three hundred years ago . 
  have a war in a world with lots of small farmers , and most people can more-or-less get back to what they 're doing . 
  have a war in a modern country today , and you 're obliterating most of its productive capacity . 
   the nash equilibrium of such a world is most likely the creation of fiefs dominated by the pole-centers that do n't overlap with each other , leading to inefficiency and animosity . 
  why ? 
  if the sample is random -- and that * is * important , but polling companies are also aware of the importance of doing so -- it is highly-unlikely that a 1,000-strong sample is very unrepresentative . 
  [ wikipedia : sampling ( statistics ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sampling_\\ ( statistics \\ ) ) . 
  sampling does n't rely on capturing a large portion of the source population . 
  if it did , we 'd have a hard time measuring most things that we work with -- it 'd be way too expensive . 
  it relies on the fact that if the sampled portion of the population is randomly-chosen ( well , and the actual values in the population approximate some distribution , which is probably overlooked more than it should be but afaik is not normally a major point of concern ) , it is very improbable that the result found from the sample is very far off what you 'd get if you polled the entire population . 
  large studies normally do maybe 1000 people . 
   and , i hate to say it but it 's true , especially in regat ? 
   the directive is discriminatory , because it contains an exception that is in reality applicable exclusively in switzerland hmm . 
  are eu directives not permitted to discriminate between individual eu members ? 
  i 'd assume it was opportunistic after the [ bataclan shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_2015_paris_attacks ) and the [ attempted thalys shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_thalys_train_attack ) . 
  if you 've got something that 's going to get people worked up security-wise , you have legislation ready and wait for a moment when there 's a crisis and the public 's politically-primed . 
  after 9/11 , the patriot act granted a bundle of law enforcement powers that had n't existed prior to that , and it was available in very short order . 
  well , not quite . 
  there 's the [ single-action revolver ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp52zvkdxlg ) that you 'll see in old western films , as well as the [ machine pistol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frp_6jph98k ) . 
  but , yeah , he should have probably said `` long guns '' . 
  you are not going to have every country have entirely flat population , make the world static . 
  india 's growing , but slowly . 
  i 'd be more worried about , say , germany , poland , japan or south korea ( rapidly-collapsing populations ) or niger or nigeria ( exploding populations ) . 
  it was developed to avoid under-rating children from a rural background . 
   their organic anti-lice spray i 'm wondering whether this meets whatever the eu happens to define as `` organic '' . 
  i think that the bad bet was more not being willing to put more urea in the car and thinking that it would be a good idea to try to get away with that as a low-cost fix instead of paying the weight cost . 
  it 's a little-known fact that all american eggs are given a thorough insecticide bath before shipping to customers !, 
  statistics , not anecdotes .

  clearly dairy subsidies are required !, 
  as i said , i have no objection to people talking about race . 
  i do not agree with the approach of posting anecdotes to build the point . 
  there are better sources available if you truly believe -- and i think that there 's a reasonable argument for it -- that there 's a disparity in race-based crime . 
   he posted the names of the people involved in this particular story . 
  that 's literally all he posted .
