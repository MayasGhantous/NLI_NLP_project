  you should be pulling up british race/crime statistics and submitting that .

  i 've got no objection to discussion about race and crime . 
  but i do have an objection to taking an approach that is vulnerable to giving a distorted view of the matter .

  i think that the point is that this is done publicly and there 'd probably be nudity involved . 
   congo had much better infrastructure then most east europe countries . 
  after they had revolution and declared independence . 
  they were sitting on land with most natural resources used in modern times and infrastructure . 
  they were far more advanced then most of the countries in europe at that time . 
  i bet that the congo 's population was not as well educated .

   you ca n't build a stable , democratic society if a country is mired in tribalism , lack of secularity , and strongmanship . 
  i am confident that secularity is not required . 
  hell , you could even have the head of the church be popularly-elected . 
  tribalism does n't seem intrinsically undemocratic either . 
  strongmanship i think i could buy .

  [ dup calls for mps to debate the death penalty ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/dup-calls-for-mps-to-debate-the-death-penalty-28679543.html ) [ top dup men support bringing back death penalty ] ( http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/crime/top-dup-men-support-bringing-back-death-penalty-1-7251718 ) i do n't know * why * it was being proposed , because the charter of fundamental rights of the european union and the european convention on human rights prohibit it , and this was all pre-brexit . 
  * doubtfully * i suppose that post-brexit , half of the barriers would go away , because the charter of fundamental rights of the european union would ( potentially , depending upon what gets incorporated into british law ) no longer be present . 
  you 'd still have british membership in the council of europe in the way . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanged,_drawn_and_quartered  to be hanged , drawn and quartered was from 1351 a statutory penalty in england for men convicted of high treason , although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of king henry iii ( 1216 -- 1272 ) . 
  convicts were fastened to a hurdle , or wooden panel , and drawn by horse to the place of execution , where they were hanged ( almost to the point of death ) , emasculated , disembowelled , beheaded and quartered ( chopped into four pieces ) . 
  their remains were often displayed in prominent places across the country , such as london bridge . 
  for reasons of public decency , women convicted of high treason were instead burned at the stake . 
  i think that the beheading happens before the quartering . 
  the idea being that you know that your body 's going to be mutilated after death . 
   normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them , prisoners were then hanged for a short period , either from a ladder or cart . 
  on the sheriff 's orders the cart would be taken away ( or if a ladder , turned ) , leaving the man suspended in mid-air . 
  the aim was usually to cause strangulation and near-death , although some victims were killed prematurely , the priest john payne 's death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs . 
  -  those still conscious at that point might have seen their entrails burned , before their heart was removed and the body decapitated and quartered ( chopped into four pieces ) .

  enough to buy logging rights to avoid it being logged ? 
  because in my eyes , that is what it comes down to : logging rights are the rights to block others from logging something . 
  if you do n't want land logged , buy logging rights and then do n't log it . 
  i see lots of people willing to write letters and engage in condemnations in legislatures . 
  if it 's honestly worth that much , it seemsto me that other countries or institutions should be willing to buy logging rights .

  the british government 's public position is still that freedom of movement will end on march 29 , 2019 , when the u.k. leaves the eu . 
  but seemingly contradictory statements from hammond , who has said it will be `` some time '' before full migration controls can be imposed , and rudd , who has promised businesses no `` cliff edge '' on migration , suggest the government is heading toward a compromise . 
  this sounds much more like a work visa . 
  the uk can unilaterally set that up and does not need to coordinate with the eu on it .
