  i do n't claim familiarity with the iraqi justice system , and i 'm sure that rape has happened , but why would you think that it 's routine for someone going to court to be raped ? 
   not sure if stupid or just incredibly naive . 
  being muslim is not equivalent to joining isis . 
  there are ~ 1,800,000,000 muslims in the world . 
  there are maybe 20,000 members of isis . 
  mind , [ roman polanski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_polanski ) is still running around in france . 
  while i do agree that this is iraq 's jurisdiction , not everyone who wanted to engage in an islamic revolution in iraq intrinsically wanted to kill off everyone else in the world . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arthur_lucas  arthur lucas , originally from the u.s. state of georgia , was one of the two last people to be executed in canada , on december 11 , 1962 . 
  lucas had been convicted of the murder of a police informant from detroit . 
  the murder took place in toronto . 
    lucas , along with fellow prisoner ronald turpin , was executed at the toronto ( don ) jail by hanging , [ 1 ] the only form of civilian capital punishment ever used in post-confederation canada , although the military employed execution by firing squad . 
  in 1976 , capital punishment for murder was removed from canada 's criminal code , but could still be used under the national defence act until 1998 . 
  when both men were informed that they would likely be the last people ever to hang in canada , lucas said , `` some consolation '' . 
    chaplain cyrill everitt attended the double hanging and in 1986 , shortly before his death , he revealed that lucas 's head was `` nearly torn right off '' because the hangman had miscalculated the man 's weight . 
   because german citizens do n't suddenly lose their rights just because they cross over a border . 
  those rights apply to german law . 
  i do n't expect to go to germany and expect to be able to run around with a nazi flag and rifle just because i 'm guaranteed that right in the us . 
  extradition is a `` favor '' that countries do for each other , and sometimes they place conditions on it . 
  it does n't mean that germans have immunity to laws abroad that conflict with them . 
  she might be hanged if she is sentenced to death -- apparently that 's iraq 's method of execution -- though i personally doubt that she will be . 
  iraq does n't use rape as a punishment . 
  i 've no statistics , but i 'd bet that she was much more likely to be raped in a lawless warzone than in the iraqi justice system . 
  not necessarily execution . 
  https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-11-29/what-happens-isis-fighters-when-they-are-captured  at the qayyarah court , the judge decides whether there 's enough evidence to pass the suspects on to a higher-level court for trial and sentencing . 
  the minimum for belonging to a terrorist group is 15 years in prison . 
  the worst offenders are sentenced to death . 
  why do you think that 's what was being said ? 
  it 's not the role of the dresden public prosecutor to try to pull her out . 
  that 'd be a matter for the foreign ministry . 
  eh , people only see him in photography . 
  can do a lot with that . 
  if that is the largest objection to be found to macron , i take it that he 's doing well ? 
  also , turing estimated human-level intelligence would be enabled by hardware around 2000 . http://loebner.net/prizef/turingarticle.html  i believe that in about fifty years ' time it will be possible , to programme computers , with a storage capacity of about 10 ^ 9 , to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning . 
  the turn of the millennium 's come and gone , and while he was right about the hardware , the software never made it . 
  generally-speaking , achievements in ai have really not lived up to the rate of expectation of advance . 
  i think that people have predicted the end of a need for labor for a long time on many occasions without it happening . 
  maybe this is it , but i 'm going to wait and see . 
  * checks wikipedia * [ alain poher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alain_poher ) was president twice , once for two-and-a-half weeks . 
  you 're telling me that he managed to piss off the french in that period of time ? 
   agreed , but really the westminster system , or any political system built around fptp voting , is also deeply flawed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem  in social choice theory , arrow 's impossibility theorem , the general possibility theorem or arrow 's paradox is an impossibility theorem stating that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives ( options ) , no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide ( complete and transitive ) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria : unrestricted domain , non-dictatorship , pareto efficiency and independence of irrelevant alternatives . 
  -  the practical consequences of the theorem are debatable : arrow has said `` most systems are not going to work badly all of the time . 
  all i proved is that all can work badly at times . '', 
   for example , many people in canada know about `` miranda rights '' , which is this whole `` you have the right to remain silent , etc. '', 
  spiel that the police give you when arrest you . 
  that 's an american law , not canadian . 
  note that while the [ bill of rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_bill_of_rights ) , and thus the [ fifth amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) , and thus the legal basis for [ mirandizing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miranda_warning ) does not exist in the us , it 's also not the case that the legal systems are entirely disconnected . 
  the two started from the same core of [ english common law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_law ) , and both do make use of precedent from each other 's legal systems as a source of legal guidance ( subordinate to their own case law ) , though not to the degree that the british and canada 's legal systems are intertwined : http://library.law.utoronto.ca/step-2-primary-sources-law-canadian-case-law-0  * prior to 1949 , canadian supreme court decisions could be appealed to the judicial committee of the privy council ( j.c.p.c. ), 
  in the united kingdom , and decisions from j.c.p.c. 
  up until 1949 can still be binding on all canadian courts . 
    * case law from other commonwealth jurisdictions can also have persuasive authority , particularly those from the english house of lords or court of appeal , and the australian high court . 
    * decisions from non-commonwealth jurisdictions may also have persuasive authority depending on the level of court of the decision , the reputation of the judge and the jurisdiction involved , decisions from the united states supreme court are one example . 
  what does that even * mean * ? 
  i 'm familiar with incorporation ( though my impression was that it was more-limited in scope , dealing with part of the bill of rights ) , but the problem was that i was n't aware that the legal doctrine had a basis in the fourteenth or an incorporated amendment -- had it not been , a state legal system might not have used it . 
  sure , not trying to say that it 's a good or bad idea for belgium to do this . 
  thanks for the expansion , by the way -- it 's a constant frustration to me that legal codes in europe ( and more-critically , explanation of them ) often are n't in english , so i wind up mostly using british law in my discussion if i 'm looking to talk about laws in europe . 
  google translate does not do incredibly well with legal text . 
  every now and then someone will pop in with a bit on french law or something , but usually it takes some legal expertise too , so there are n't a lot of people bringing up actual legal text in various european countries on here , and it 's something that i wish happened more . 
  looks like you 're right : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vagueness_doctrine  in american constitutional law , a statute is void for vagueness and unenforceable if it is too vague for the average citizen to understand . 
  there are several reasons a statute may be considered vague ; in general , a statute might be called void for vagueness reasons when an average citizen can not generally determine what persons are regulated , what conduct is prohibited , or what punishment may be imposed . 
  criminal laws which do not state explicitly and definitely what conduct is punishable for example are void for vagueness . 
  a statute is also void for vagueness if a legislature 's delegation of authority to judges and/or administrators is so extensive that it would lead to arbitrary prosecutions . 
  that being said , some tax code is local or state . 
  it 's not clear to me whether the doctrine also applies to state and local law . 
  < pokes around  okay , so the doctrine was based on the [ due process clause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/due_process_clause ) of the fourteenth amendment :  [ n ] or shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-14/54-void-for-vagueness-doctrine.html that applies to state law as well , so it 's universally applicable to tax law in the us . 
  agreed !, 
  thanks for the good point !, 
  you do law , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  hmm . 
  so i guess belgium addresses the issue by simply saying `` the word of the law * is * whatever the spirit was '' . 
  * thinks * in that case , i do still think that `` loophole '' would n't be the correct translation , because it would n't be in accord with the rules , since the rules themselves contain a blanket restriction on violating the spirit of the rule . 
  in the sense of the mirriam-webster above , assuming belgian courts interpret the will of the drafters correctly , there are no omissions . 
  hmm . 
  < reads comment again  maybe you 're right . 
  i still read it as just using a subsidization example , though . 
  i 'll be less generous to microsoft and google . 
  i do not know whether or not they violated the letter of european antitrust law , and my guess is that both had an argument that they did not . 
  but they clearly did violate the spirit . 
  microsoft had a monopoly on the desktop operating system market , so could use it to extend monopolies to other areas . 
  bundling internet explorer ( i do n't think that it was windows media player ) would be a way to get control of the web as well . 
  google has , by some definitions , a monopoly on search and on mobile phone oses , so putting links on their homepage that would give them an edge versus other competitors in establishing new monopolies in other areas , like internet retail , is not permitted . 
  well , one could argue that the ability to treat profits as generated abroad itself or defer recognizing profits until a us administration with friendly tax law is in place is itself is a loophole in us tax law . 
  subsidy rules can have loopholes , though , which is what his example was doing . 
  in english , the term `` loophole '' refers to finding a legitimate-under-the-rules approach that achieves some effect other than what was intended by the authors of the rules . 
  it explicitly does not violate the letter of the rules , though it does violate the spirit in which they were written . 
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/loophole  : a means of escape ; especially : an ambiguity or omission in the text through which the intent of a statute , contract , or obligation may be evaded if there is a word in belgium that means an illegality , it is probably a mistranslation to render it as `` loophole '' in english . 
  i suppose that might be what the people who are voting age there voted on . 
  which nato member do you feel is in nato against its will ? 
  nato has an explicit `` you can leave when you want with a one year delay '' clause . 
  hell , the eu presently also has one , though it 's a two year delay and probably a lot more of a hassle . 
  i mean , there have been elections in ukraine . 
  that was hitler 's justification for moving on the sudetenland . 
  sounds kinda like what some people said about the baltics . 
  both the us and the uk fulfilled all obligations under the budapest memorandum . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances  according to the memorandum , [ 14 ] russia , the u.s. , and the uk confirmed , in recognition of belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine becoming parties to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and in effect abandoning its nuclear arsenal to russia , that they would :  1 . 
  respect belarusian , kazakh and ukrainian independence and sovereignty and the existing borders . 
  refrain from the threat or use of force against belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine . 
  refrain from using economic pressure on belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine in order to influence its politics . 
  seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine , `` if belarus/kazakhstan/ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used '' . 
  refrain from the use of nuclear arms against belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine .
