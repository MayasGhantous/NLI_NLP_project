  that 's a valid concern , but as i pointed out before , the status quo with the current top 20 + uk trading partners with which there is an existing fta can be achieved with ( a ) a trade deal with the eu , which should be a top priority and ( b ) either nafta membership or bilateral deals with canada and the us . 
  the uk is currently the fifth-largest economy in the world . 
  she is decidedly smaller than the eu , but not radically so . 
  true , where [ customs unions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/customs_union ) exist , she will be negotiating with them rather than individual countries . 
  however , the uk is also singlehandedly larger than all of * those * other than the european single market -- which the uk is already going to have to deal with -- and [ mercosur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercosur ) , which is less than twice the size of the uk 's economy . 
   by contrast , the government treats every random statement about some great , very powerful , very quick trade deal , uttered from the mouth or keyboard of the terrifyingly unstable president trump , as if it were gospel -- conveniently forgetting that trump has been absolutely consistent about just one aspect of us international relations : america first . 
  this one i 'm more comfortable on . 
  i 'm pretty confident that dougan 's got the politics wrong here . 
  trump has actively-avoided specifics on trade . 
  he 's `` raised possibilities '' and let people infer what they will . 
  politicians talk about the popular bits of what they 're gon na do . 
  when a politician is hedging or avoiding committing , that 's where the bits that are n't gon na sell well are . 
  the `` complain about nafta but do n't be specific and push for more-open trade '' has been used in the past by republican politicians . 
  i was still uncertain until i saw the nafta renegotiation goals published by the trade administration this month . 
  everything there with detail will open things up other than , right up top to be visible , an `` improve trade balance '' with no specifics . 
  irma not just myself -- journalists took a glance at it , breathed a sigh of relief , and said `` same old , same old '' . 
   indeed , the contrast between the government 's haughty arrogance towards the eu and its obsequious desperation towards america hardly bodes well for our negotiating skill and credibility . 
  well , canada 's a smaller economy than the eu . 
  ditto for mexico . 
  nothing that i 'm aware of in nafta is considered particularly one-sided . 
  it 's not clear to me why the uk would be in a dramatically worse position than either . 
   let 's hope that the so-called left wing leavers feel proud of helping sweep a hard right movement to power and giving it the constitutional leeway it needs to realise its hard right objectives . 
  i 'd agree with a `` lexiters are unlikely to be happy '' argument . 
  i 'm pretty skeptical . 
  national governments might explore this , but this is n't a military matter . 
  it 's a political matter , not a military one . 
  the cia might have explored this . 
  i 'd say that is unlikely for nato to have done so . 
  [ at that point in time , when people were outside more , it might have been to some degree ] ( https://reddit.com/comments/6qv8dz/comment/dl0nyso ) . 
  but we do that less . 
  i 've got no objection to people wearing hats , but to there being an obligation to wear one , as there once was . 
  i think that i see about three types of hats worn today , all much-less-flashy , cheaper , and immune to being crushed or deformed : * [ bucket hat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucket_hat ) . 
  people spending a lot of time in the sun or being hit with rain , fishing . 
  * [ baseball cap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baseball_cap ) as a sun visor . 
  for people doing serious work in the sun , sometimes combined with a cloth in the back , like [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.com/flap-cap-outdoor-neck-shade/dp/b006hv5mbi ) . 
  * [ knit cap/beanie/toboggan / toque/watch cap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knit_cap ) . 
  for staying warm in cold weather . 
   u/pablopueblo has most probably seen , and acted upon [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6qvfoa/61_of_leave_voters_tell_yougov_that_significant/ ) on r/ukpolitics this was discussed on / r/europe as part of larger yougov results at https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qvkbe/yougov_the_extremists_on_both_sides_of_the_brexit/, 
  well , eu and nato are not interchangeable . 
  in the case of nato , the bulk of the aim of the organization was countering russia . 
  my guess is that if it reached the point that russia were joining , nato would simply wither into nothingness , unless there were some other major non-nato threat to europe that had emerged ( like india and china collaborating on establishing control of libya or something , which would be very unlikely in geopolitical terms ) . 
  both the us and russia have said that this would not work on various occasions , as well as suggested it themselves : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato%e2%80%93russia_relations  the idea of russia becoming a nato member has at different times been floated by both western and russian leaders , as well as some experts . 
  [ 114 ]   in 1990 , while negotiating german reunification at the end of the cold war with united states secretary of state james baker , soviet president mikhail gorbachev said that `` you say that nato is not directed against us , that it is simply a security structure that is adapting to new realities ... therefore , we propose to join nato . '', 
  however , baker dismissed the possibility as a `` dream '' . 
  [ 115 ]   in march 2009 , the polish foreign minister , rados\u0142aw sikorski , suggested including russia in nato . 
  [ 100 ] speaking to one of the main polish daily newspapers after the lecture , mr sikorski explained , ' i stand by everything i said , but that does n't mean i 'm inviting russia to join the nato . 
  i simply presented a certain hypothetical vision , a reference to a debate that took place in the nato in the mid-1990s . 
  then , under the clinton administration , there was a debate on whether , and on what terms , russia could become a member of the alliance . 
  ' [ 116 ] russian leadership , however , made it clear russia did not plan to join the alliance , preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level now . 
  in march 2009 , the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . 
  '' [ 100 ]   in early 2010 , the suggestion was repeated in an open letter co-written by german defense experts general klaus naumann , frank elbe , ulrich weisser , and former german defense minister volker r\u00fche . 
  the letter \u2032 s authors posited that russia was needed in the wake of an emerging multi-polar world in order for nato to counterbalance emerging asian powers . 
  [ 117 ]   in sept 2010 , in new york , the nato-russia council met for the first time after relations were suspended as a result of the 2008 russia-georgia war of 2008 ; on the eve of the meeting , the u.s. 
  permanent representative to nato , ivo daalder , mentioned the hypothetical possibility of russia joining nato . 
  while it 's not impossible , it would probably require a greater common threat to exist in europe than russia and require existing members to not consider russia a threat . 
  the ukraine business has probably pushed that well off into the future . 
  also , russia is n't aligned with countries that are aligned with the us in general , like japan . 
  and nato membership does n't buy russia that much : it 's got no serious threats of attack that it ca n't deter . 
  i see major obstacles and no major impetus . 
  nato membership does n't align countries . 
  alignment results in nato membership . 
  if russia 's interests align , sure . 
  but i doubt that that will happen in the near future . 
  the eu ... i do n't know . 
  same trust issues apply , if not moreso . 
  some members will be twitchy about potential large-scale russian immigration . 
  if people are still unhappy about the prospect of problems from ukraine affecting other countries in the eu , russia is going to be an even bigger impact . 
  also , i 'm doubtful that russia would sign on , as it would have limited influence on a per-country basis . 
  maybe if it could negotiate for more control of the eu or something . 
  i don.t know whether russians would want to break russia up to be `` multipe eu members '' , but that 'd also tend to permanently split russia . 
  the political conditions that the eu would impose to join would probably result in putin being politically-threatened . 
  i do not think that this will happen without a major change in leadership . 
  that * does * have a selling point for the eu : access to more natural resources . 
  my own bet is not in the near future . 
  the japanese article includes discussion of child pornography and sex crimes involving children and would include that factor . 
   electrocution is n't killing with electricity , it 's merely being exposed to a current of electricity . 
  that is not correct . 
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electrocution  definition of electrocute   electrocuted ; electrocuting   transitive verb   1 : to execute ( a criminal ) by electricity   2 : to kill by electric shock needs death to be involved . 
   you do n't die when you get zapped from a static , clothing induced , charge . 
  right . 
  that 's being shocked , not electrocuted . 
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shock  definition of shock   transitive verb   1 a : to strike with surprise , terror , horror , or disgust   b : to cause to undergo a physical or nervous shock   c : to subject to the action of an electrical discharge the term for non-lethal exposure to electricity is `` shock '' . 
   electrocution of a very specific type , within a certain range of ma , is lethal but otherwise est counts as electrocution . 
  no , it does not . 
  actually , there were a lot of factors . 
  the purge was a pretty big deal , and it 's correct not to chalk it up to superhuman abilities on the part of the finns , but also : * the finns * did * do pretty well . 
  * estonia provided some information on incoming air raids . 
  * soviet tanks were great in flat and open terrain , but not so good in forest . 
  * finns were issued skis and used them effectively . 
  the red army was not . 
  this led to finland having much more mobile infantry . 
  * many finns were rural dwellers who were used to tromping around in the cold shooting animals . 
  a substantial chunk of soviet soldiers used came from warmer climates , like ukraine . 
  * the finns had good cold weather gear . 
  the very cold winter was unexpected , and when combined with the finns holding out longer than expected , led to finns with winter clothing and white camouflage fighting soviet soldiers with dark clothing and summer outfits . 
  cold caused a lot of the casualties . 
  * many people on both sides were conscripts . 
  however , militia and the like tend to perform better when defending their homes than invading someone else . 
  we discovered back in 1812 when we tried invading canada with a militia army .
