  tonkin was one real attack and one misattributed attack . 
  neither qualify as a false flag . 
   how the u.s. see most of their wars like in vietnam uh ... how is that ? 
   could fuck america in one blow well , that part is true . 
   conspired against the soviets by surrendering to the nazis devious france strikes again !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_alliance  a military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security , when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance . 
  [ 1 ] military alliances differ from coalitions , as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known . 
  [ 1 ]   military alliances can be classified to defense pacts , ** non-aggression pacts ** and ententes . 
  [ 2 ] granted , i suspect that there are different definitions out there . 
   trump is turning off the federal faucet . 
  our sciences and culture will suffer . 
  this is what tax incentives drive .

  [ grigory kulik was an american agent !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grigory_kulik ) huh ... til :  one of the few positive historical actions related of kulik was his successful ( and uncharacteristic ) advocacy for the lives of over 150,000 enlisted polish pows captured during the september 1939 invasion of poland . 
  stalin , concerned with invasion from nazi germany , had ordered all of the captured poles to be summarily executed as potential fifth-columnists ; his decision was supported by lev mekhlis , polish front commissar , and lavrenti beria , chief of the nkvd . 
  kulik , commander of the polish front , twice strongly argued with stalin for their release , eventually extracting the concession that only the officers -- 26,000 -- would be executed , with the over 150,000 common enlisted men being let go . 
    despite mekhlis and beria 's protests , the enlisted men were dutifully released . 
  the 26,000 officers were executed less than a month later by stalin 's order ( many at the hands of nkvd executioner vasili blokhin ) in the katyn massacre . 
  i had no idea that stalin was going to kill all of the polish pows . 
   ( cold , empty , lack of warm water port access , lack of year-round navigable waterways ) that explains leasing port arthur from the chinese . 
  it does n't explain the winter war , dividing poland , invading ukraine , etc. 
  i 'd say that the war of 1812 and the vietnam war were both clearly losses . 
  however , by the same token , the korean war was a victory . 
  also , i think that you have a very incorrect perception of americans if you think that a majority consider the vietnam war a victory . 
  do it [ rashomon style ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/rashomonstyle ) !, 
   wow , a nation of 3,6 million people attacking a nation of 168 million people . 
  might sound crazy but yolo well , for most countries , i 'd agree , but then again ... after the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) , you guys * did * plunge back in to try to recapture your territory in the [ continuation war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) . 
  granted , this was in coordination with a german offensive , so it was n't purely one-on-one , but still ... 
  the stars on the eu flag do n't represent eu members . 
   19 % of remain voters view significant economic damage to be a price worth paying to to teach leave voters and politicians a lesson for pete 's sake . 
   the strasbourg thing was put on hold because brussels parliament is in bad condition , and will need renovation or replacement , soon . 
  how is that possible ? 
  wikipedia [ says that it 's only been in use since 1993 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/espace_l%c3%a9opold ) . 
  24 years until needing replacement ? 
  i think that `` driving '' would normally refer to something powered . 
  maybe `` wheeled '' ? 
  climate change ruined everything . 
  let invasive species like humans swarm over what was once pristine ice covering most of europe . 
   we 're willing to sanction russia , but not in areas where it would really hurt them . 
  that seems like a limitation that might render sanctions ineffective . 
  while the [ battle for singapore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_singapore ) was a pretty big clusterfuck , i do n't think that your take is correct either . 
  by the end of the war , the uk was back on the offensive in the pacific . 
  [ operation downfall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_downfall ) would have involved the british ( wikipedia says 5 million us soldiers , 1 million british ) . 
   obama is n't president anymore , trump ( or at least the us senate , who drives us foreign policy ) wo n't ignore another polish jet being sabotaged i assume that [ you 're talking about this incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) :  both the russian and polish official investigations found no technical faults with the aircraft , and concluded that the crew failed to conduct the approach in a safe manner in the given weather conditions . 
  the polish authorities found serious deficiencies in the organization and training of the air force unit involved , which was subsequently disbanded . 
  several high-ranking members of the polish military resigned , under pressure from politicians and the media . 
  it was not sabotage . 
   nor will they take kindly to putin shutting off the grid or stopping all the trains via hacking there 's no reason to believe that this is in the cards . 
  most countries probably do n't want to start a `` let 's sabotage infrastructure '' game , because most countries have a lot to lose doing that . 
  russia 's really into this high-chin position in parade . 
  i do n't think that that 's a prussian legacy , either , like the goose-stepping . 
   but ultimately , this change is necessary and good for people in the uk . 
  people do n't like to move on , but sometimes you have to . 
  could have also permitted taller buildings to provide a large-enough supply of housing for more people . 
   non-tariff barriers would remain . 
  i 'm not sure about this one . 
  i do n't claim to be an expert in [ ntb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-tariff_barriers_to_trade ) s , but the ones that i 've read about seem to center around product standards ( e.g. 
  car safety requirements ) , production standards ( e.g. 
  the `` chlorine chicken wash '' that 's a popular topic on this sub ) , labor standards , and things that the uk is already doing . 
  obviously , the uk wo n't have future input on eu ntbs , so eu companies that can influence the political process in the eu will probably seek to establish new ntbs that are disadvantageous to uk-based companies . 
  but on the first day that the uk is separate from the eu , i 'm not sure how many ntbs are actually going to have any impact . 
   it would lead to massive economic suffering , mostly on the uk side but not exclusively . 
  median eu tariff is iirc 4-point-something percent . 
  the uk probably is n't going to increase tariffs . 
  that 's a division , but i dunno if it 's sufficient to cause `` massive economic suffering '' . 
  it will definitely cause a hit . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't think i 've heard may contradict herself . 
  trump has done so , and frequently . 
  i have heard may contradict what her ministers have said . 
  yeah , that 's fair -- should have put that in my initial post . 
  i mean , if people do want to give their support to some representative who is n't going to represent them very well , why not let them ? 
  that is , why second-guess the voter ? 
  ( note that most us states * also * have thresholds , though 5 % would be high . 
  i 'm not saying that we do n't do them , just that i 'm not enthusiastic about them here either . ), 
   electing judges is , by the way , incredibly stupid , and ensures awful jurisprudence from a gaggle of sycophants . 
  i 'm really not all that enthusiastic about thresholds . 
  it benefits incumbents , and i do n't see any other major benefit . 
  if someone has to have a threshold , i do n't see why it ca n't be 0.5 % or something like that . 
   that i should rather be a terrorist , then a fagot . 
  `` fagot '' is the nato reporting name for the [ mig-15 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikoyan-gurevich_mig-15 ) . 
  `` faggot '' is a [ slur for some gay dude ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faggot_\\ ( slang \\ ) ) . 
   ca n't get any more german than this . 
  i mean , she could have a pretzel . 
   why not just raise the retirement age ( people are living significantly longer ) introduce legislation to allow more flexible work for pensioners/women and raise contribution rates ? 
  that could solve the welfare issue , as long as europeans are willing to postpone retirement , though it 's only a one-off in terms of avoiding relative european economic decline : ca n't keep raising the age into infirmity and death . 
   rather than encouraging and making it easier for europeans to reproduce nothing wrong with that , but it has n't happened thus far , and there are now decades of not having children to catch up on , even if someone made a policy that , starting today , managed to snap the tfr to 2.1 . 
  you 'd have to have countries like portugal have large families for a few decades to compensate . 
  no , i 'm saying that the eu does not and the uk post-brexit will not have an fta with china . 
  i 'm just looking for cases where the uk would be worse-off in terms of trade access post-brexit than pre-brexit and saying that china is n't one . 
   luxembourg 's law is pretty similar to the one president obama signed back in 2015 in that it gives mining companies the right to keep their loot . 
  both of them also take advantage of a loophole in the un 's outer space treaty , which states that nations ca n't claim and occupy the moon and other celestial bodies . 
  they do n't give companies ownership of asteroids , after all , only the minerals they extract and after they extract it . 
  no ownership of asteroids , but ownership of extracted materials . 
  sounds like a recipe for space mining companies to be duking it out . 
   also , ftas on banking do n't exist ( yet ) yes , they do .
