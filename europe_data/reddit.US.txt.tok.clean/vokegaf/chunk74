   this is quite a task , the eu has a network of fta 's around the world . 
  so they 'd have to replace those as well , ceta , but also lesser known fta 's with mexico f.e. 
  obviously , the uk 's trade will shift somewhat with brexit . 
  however , here is a list of present [ top british trading partners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_united_kingdom ) . 
  aside from the us , canada , and countries covered by any eu trade deal , you have : * china at # 5 . 
  the eu has no fta with china . 
  * hong kong at # 15 . 
  i dunno what their trade status is , but i assume that this is covered by china . 
  * japan at # 17 . 
  the eu has no fta with japan , though that may change . 
  * india at # 20 . 
  the eu has no fta with india . 
  * south korea at # 21 . 
  south korea has expressed interest in an fta with the uk . 
  if the uk joins nafta , which has been floated by the us trade administration as far back as under obama , it will cover canada , the us , and mexico at one go . 
  so , basically , joining nafta and an eu fta alone cover the uk 's top 20 trading partners ( nafta permits for financial services , so if the uk can also negotiate financial service access in the eu , which i am not confident of , that will actually double the size of her potential no-restriction financial services market relative to pre-brexit ) . 
  south korea is the first country where the uk would not be under an fta where the eu is ... however , it looks like that fta never took effect in the uk : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union%e2%80%93south_korea_free_trade_agreement  the ratification process was partially completed on 13 december 2015 , pending ratification by italy and korea . 
  [ 3 ] `` the agreement is not yet in force '' in the united kingdom [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and its future is yet to be clarified in the light of the united kingdom 's [ withdrawal from the european union . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/withdrawal_from_the_european_union ), 
   it also accused poland of sexual discrimination by letting women judges retire aged 60 and male judges aged 65 . 
  hmm . 
  does the eu not let member countries have gender-specific policies like this ? 
  are people who are not granted asylum given welfare ? 
   shintoists * japan 's fertility rate problems are as bad as the least-fertile countries in the eu . 
  not like japan can easily spare the younger people she has . 
  * japan is [ about on par with finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) in per-capita ppp-adjusted gdp . 
  it 's going to be hard to offer a drastically better life as an incentive to immigrate . 
  * language barrier . 
  english is the main european language learned in japan , and knowledge [ does n't look like it 's too good ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2011/05/why-english-is-tough-in-japan/ ) . 
   one thing should be clear to all europeans : immigration is here to stay . 
  and , as recent arrivals to italy have shown , we will mostly see an increase in economic migrants who are not entitled to asylum . 
  still need a lot more people than are presently coming if europe 's demographic hole from lack of having children is to be filled . 
  yeah , but based on past statements , my guess is that the uk will introduce some form of work visa . 
  because it 's not automatically-granted , it wo n't be free movement , and it will let the british government control inflow . 
   russia really is quite similar to australia and canada export profile wise [ russia 's export treemap ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/russia_export_treemap.png ) [ australia 's export treemap ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/2014_australia_products_export_treemap.png ) [ canada 's export treemap ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/canada_export_treemap.jpg ) russia exports overwhelmingly oil and gas -- it is very much a non-diversified economy . 
  australia has a huge primary sector ( checks wikipedia : mostly supplying china , japan , and south korea ) , but it 's spread over a greater number of items . 
  canada has a large primary sector , but , like australia , spread over a number of different items . 
  bad link . 
  delete and try resubmitting with the correct one . 
  * acquires [ `` it 's cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brass_monkey_\\ ( colloquialism \\ ) ) *, 
   the current wunderkinds of net-only news -- the buzzfeeds , the vices , the politicos , the huffposts the first time i 've heard buzzfeed or huffpost called a `` wunderkind '' ... 
   we have yet to see the us hack the russian presidential elections to install the candidate that they want to win . 
  yes , that 's true . 
  russia has 144 million people , not 180 million . 
  the election interference and ukraine are both listed in the bill . 
   legislation does n't just appear , trump could have lobbied against this or made a public appeal . 
  maybe . 
  was still going through . 
  you think that trump making a public appeal to not pass legislation that sanctions russia and removes his ability to lift the sanctions is going to carry the slightest bit of water with congress ? 
   at the very least he could not sign it as a sign of goodwill towards germany and the eu . 
  personally , i think that ns2 is n't in the eu 's interest in the first place . 
  but more to the point , it 'd be pretty unpopular domestically for him to do that . 
  i do n't really get the purpose of importing vodka to russia . 
  russia produces and exports a ton of vodka . 
  we banned russian vodka exports to the us back in 2014 , after the ukraine invasion . 
  ditto for a bunch of other countries . 
  there should be a glut of vodka in russia : [ russian vodka exports fall 40 % amid sanctions war ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russian-vodka-exports-fall-40-amid-sanctions-war-51842 )  last year , revenue from alcohol exports amounted to $ 111.9 million , which is a decrease of 40.2 percent from 2014 , when revenues stood at $ 187.1 million . 
    exports to ukraine -- the biggest importer of russian alcohol before the annexation of crimea and the conflict in the county 's east -- collapsed from $ 38.6 million in 2013 to a mere $ 3.87 million last year . 
    the revenue from exports to britain , latvia and germany also declined significantly due to sanctions , falling by 35 , 14 and 28.6 percent respectively , kommersant reported . 
  i guess maybe if you really like a particular foreign brand of vodka ... 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vignette_\\ ( road_tax \\ ) ) :  vignette stickers are usually constructed in such a way that detaching and reattaching them is impossible without destruction , ensuring that they can not be used on more than one vehicle . 
  i suspect that the real issue is that the pricing structure is crummy and penalizes people briefly using the road . 
  iirc , ukraine has several different methods to romanize cyrillic . 
  how does this compare to those ? 
  trump has no ability to stop them going through . 
  for a law to reach the president for signing , it must have 50 % support in each house of congress . 
  a presidential veto returns it to congress , which can then override the veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses . 
  a presidential veto thus only has ability to stop a bill if at least one house of congress has support for a bill between 50 % and 67 % . 
  this bill had near-unanimous support in both houses of congress . 
  it 's going through regardless of trump 's opinion on the matter . 
  well , some diplomats . 
  but , yeah , i 'm sure that some of the people expelled did spy . 
  no public ownership of the means of production , no socialism . 
  i mean , there was n't much of an organized church at the beginning . 
  but the [ nicene creed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicene_creed ) goes back to < checks wp  325 ad , so it 's pretty core at least as far back as that :  i believe in one god , the father almighty , maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible . 
    and in one lord jesus christ , the only-begotten son of god , begotten of his father before all worlds , god of god , light of light , very god of very god , begotten , not made , being of one substance with the father , by whom all things were made ; who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the holy spirit of the virgin mary and was made man ; and was crucified also for us under pontius pilate . 
  he suffered and was buried ; and the third day he rose again according to the scriptures ; and ascended into heaven , and is seated at the right hand of the father ; and he shall come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead ; whose kingdom shall have no end . 
    and i believe in the holy spirit , the lord and giver of life ; who proceeds from the father and the son , who with the father and the son together is worshiped and glorified , who spoke by the prophets . 
  and i believe one holy christian and apostolic church . 
  i acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins , and i look for the resurrection of the dead and life of the world to come . 
  amen . 
   what a bullshit note that [ `` bullshit '' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bullshit ) is a [ mass/uncountable noun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_noun ) . 
  you 'd want `` what bullshit '' . 
  it 'd be fine with me . 
   elsewhere , the mayors of paris , madrid , mexico city and athens say they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025 . 
  somewhere , gas , natural gas , or electric vehicle vendors are going to be making boatloads of cash . 
  pretty confident that russia was not framed as having invaded ukraine . 
   it certainly helped to have it enforced by the eu as well , but it was hardly relying on this . 
  i 'm assuming that this is more the whiskey lobby wanting the british government to protect their particular interest in trade negotiations with other countries , like us . 
  i am not very enthusiastic about a7 either . 
  as a disincentive , it 's risky -- you can penalize countries in many other ways . 
  removing political power is appealing as a tool to ram things through that countries do n't want . 
  if the eu chooses to try to mold the structure of eu member governments -- which the us federal government does n't do to states , but , hey , maybe it 's viable -- fine . 
  i just do n't think that stripping political power is a very good tool for applying pressure , though . 
  if you want to argue that the uk has some obligation in a moral sense or to purchase a trade deal , sure . 
  but in the context of talking about being `` a creature of law '' , i strongly doubt that there is any substantial portion of commitments that would be viewed as legally binding . 
  that 's the whole point of this `` brexit bill '' business -- so that the eu can make them legally binding on the uk . 
  i should start submitting carribbean news !, 
   some ethnic russians do but most of them either go to russia , god knows why , or to western europe and us . 
  i was going to say that outside of a few old believer villages in rural areas , i did n't think that we retained enough russian speakers ( that is , people tend to switch to english over a few generations when they immigrate ) .
