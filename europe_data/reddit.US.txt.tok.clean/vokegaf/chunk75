  but apparently , we have the largest population of the [ russian-speaking diaspora ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_diaspora ) in the world outside of the ex-ussr :  the largest overseas community is found in the united states , estimated at some 3 million people . 
  the next largest communities of russian speakers outside the former soviet union are found in israel and then in germany , both of unknown size but estimated in the six-figure range in israel and in the five-figure range in germany . 
   it has switched only for the younger generation and many young estonians refuse to learn russian in school . 
  does n't that hurt their academic rating or something like that ? 
  his nyt column is kinda political . 
   for now , france , spain and germany have declared their support for the tax while ireland , uk and the nordic countries are against . 
  so i guess that 's the end of dw and france24 links on google news ? 
  what 's wrong with vangelis ? 
  not into [ brutalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutalist_architecture ) , i see . 
   to prevent this , the uk/usa need to save and increase productivity saving is for the birds . 
  better to take out more debt and dump it into real estate !, 
   an average of 55 per cent of people across the 10 european countries surveyed wanted to stop all future immigration from mainly muslim countries . 
  ten countries that may not be randomly selected may not be representative of europe as a whole . 
  well , guy 's iraqi , probably knows people back home . 
  probably a ton of m-16s over there , given that we were equipping iraq 's military and isis captured a ton of gear . 
  you * can * , though some countries have promised not to do so . 
  well , what do you want ? 
  jailing or execiting them ? 
  i mean , the brits alone have [ killed somewhere over a thousand members of isis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_shader ) . 
   but this about people who have gone to fight for is . 
  though the legislation does n't require that when permitting for the stripping . 
  note that this article is several days old , from before the legislation passed . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_cuisine ) that you guys do shepherd 's pie . 
  * looks up [ kofte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kofta ) * meatballs at a game ? 
  you guys are really into this `` rape and sexual assault '' angle . 
  i think that there are some good reasons for not pulling in a lot of unskilled people , but `` rape and sexual assault '' is not all that high on the list . 
  ah , gotcha , thanks . 
  to be fair , in many countries legal temporary residence is a route to legal permanent residence , which in turn is a route to citizenship . 
  i guess you could use it to ping-pong from country a to country b to country c , though it 'd take some major planning and effort . 
  it 's not just `` you can walk from a to b to c , end of story '' , though , you 're definitely right there . 
  by `` superstate '' , are you referring to federalization ? 
  having a shrinking population is n't * intrinsically * an issue as long as you scale down gracefully ( i.e. 
  not like detroit ) and as long as you have shared costs with the rest of the eu for things like healthcare and pensions , where there 's a large wealth transfer from the young to the old . 
  problem is , healthcare and pensions are not pooled today , so emigration in the eu today strips poorer member countries of income to pay for their elderly . 
  edit : well , and assuming that you 're okay with decreasing international economic clout , if the population decreases . 
  man , if the uk leaves the eu specifically because its public is raging about large-scale immigration to the uk due to freedom of movement and then promptly * after * that freedom of movement is restricted , there are going to be some massively-pissed-off people . 
  plus , having polish workers evaporate is not good for the german economy . 
   the eu has no army . 
  any country can just step the fuck out . 
  well , the eu * is * a voluntary union , which i think is the real critical bit . 
  i do n't think that it 's the lack of an eu army that 's the critical factor , as the other eu members could always band together and whack them . 
  well , okay , depending upon the member , if they were unwilling and never signed a treaty that made membership mandatory , that might be grounds for a nato article 5 invocation . 
  but i think that you get my point . 
  it 's not that the eu military organizational chart causes that , but that the eu is intrinsically-structured around being a voluntary union rather than an involuntary one . 
  he means that the us has been projected to , long-term , become majority non-white due to immigration from latin america . 
  though , frankly , latin america is genetically mostly european ( spaniards reproducing like mad !, 
  ) , with a lesser amount of native american and a lesser amount of african genes . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_latin_america darker skin than the british-german-irish-italian mixture that made up a good chunk of the us , though . 
  in all fairness , i expected more of a hammering too , and i was wrong . 
  that being said , the currency drop * was * significant . 
  and we still do n't know what kind of impact will happen in 2019 . 
  let 's find out !, 
  [ new yorkers talk about bulgaria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jszw998ynys ) [ what americans know about poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jszw998ynys ), 
   especially that food topic attracts it . 
  i ca n't figure out what the meaning here is . 
   you poles are slapping everyone in the eu in the face by cutting down a unesco world heritage site ... 
  wait a minute . 
  whether or not this is a good idea , how is this an insult to the eu ? 
  i could understand if the eu had some sort of special tie-in , like `` we have a common eu national park fund , and you 're mowing down something that we all fund with the expectation of using '' . 
  but i mean , it 's a * world * heritage site . 
  if you think that it should be protected -- and i 'm not sold that everything on unesco 's list should be , but assuming that it should -- and that not doing so is insulting in the sense of not preserving mankind 's history , why is it something specific to the eu ? 
  unesco is a un agency , not an eu one . 
   then you buddy up with authoritarian hungary and threaten to protect each other from the consequences of violating eu law . 
  i also disagree on this one . 
  that is , if article 7 is something that can be defeated , i see this as a consequence and limitation of decisions made in the eu 's design . 
  the eu uses a veto-based system for many things ( which i do not like , and think that the eu would be better off with all majority or supermajority votes but i realize that it 's more-acceptable to members who might be dubious about joining the eu ) . 
  because of that , if one is to `` override '' a `` rogue '' member , one has to totally strip the ability to vote from them as a fix for abuse of the veto . 
  ( note that i do n't think that a permanent override is a good idea either -- i think that it should happen on a per-issue basis , but ... ) so then you not surprisingly have two-or-more country blocs set up to protect each other . 
  sure , it could theoretically work if everyone simply agreed to just work together , but , then , so could communism . 
  honestly , i think that it 's myopic to go after poland and/or hungary for this when the real flaw seems to be a design issue in the eu . 
  i would expect other eu members to ultimately do the same thing down the road . 
  that is , the fix for this is to eliminate the veto , not to whack poland and hungary for using the system in its present form . 
   a low quality country like ours `` low quality country '' ? 
  i mean , what does that even mean ? 
  you could call the union `` greater switzerland ! '', 
  note that the written chinese language is not tightly-coupled to the spoken language , so this is really two languages to learn . 
  ireland has a higher percentage of english speakers than the uk , if the idea is not letting any eu member get any advantage over any other . 
  [ interlingua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interlingua ) might be preferable to esperanto on technical grounds . 
  there are fewer users , but then ... if you 're choosing esperanto over all of russian , spanish , french , german , english , italian , and so forth , you 're already committing to teaching a lot of people a new language anyway and not being too worried about existing speaker count . 
  interlingua is probably more approachable to people who speak a latin-based language already . 
   nobody wants to learn a fake language with no history . 
  well , to be fair , * some * people clearly do , as evidenced by the use of klingon ... 
   we already have a situation where romania and bulgaria , countries that joined eu 10 years ago , ca n't still join schengen , even though they fulfill the technical requirements . 
  why is that , anyway ? 
  little human-shaped marshmallows . 
  nobody in that picture is libyan , either . 
  i would n't call it being an aggressor , no . 
  we probably would not like it either !, 
   no one forces a saudi potentate to drop the traditional clothing and don a savile row suit no , but there 's a difference between wearing traditional garb that is not inappropriate in the country -- maybe it looks unusual , but nothing offensive about that -- and wearing clothing that is a violation of local law or social norms . 
  the idea is not normally to try to use that to intentionally break laws . 
  if you 're a diplomat , you 're supposed to be establishing good relations with the country , not seeing how many you can flaunt . 
  i do n't agree that wearing a headscarf in islamic countries is inappropriate . 
  when you go to a country , you follow their clothing rules . 
  you are a guest . 
  it 's basic politeness . 
  let 's say that public nudity were common in the us . 
  i 'm still not going to wander around , i dunno , paris in the nude saying `` well , i do n't have to wear clothes back home and i 'm going to use my country 's clout to apply social pressure on france '' . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aggressor  aggressor ( plural aggressors )    the person or country that first attacks or makes an aggression ; that begins hostility or a quarrel ; an assailant . 
  russia may very well not like countries joining nato , but it 's hard to call accepting an applicant country being an aggressor . 
   why should the uk produce the figure ?
