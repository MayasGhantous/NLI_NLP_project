  `` the damage has occurred , the situation is still unsatisfactory but at least stable . 
  the companies are trying to make the best of the conditions and recall the great opportunities associated with european-russian cooperation . 
  `` since august 2016 the eu-russia trade has been recovering . 
  in the first four months of 2017 , for example , there was an increase of 27 percent in german exports to russia and 34 percent in german imports from russia . 
    although they are not responsible for the crisis , thousands of german companies have been adapting to the sanctions in the past three years . 
  `` to date , no clear case of the unlawful circumvention of eu sanctions regulations by companies has been documented in germany , '' emphasized the east committee chairman . 
  east german medium-sized enterprises with traditionally good contacts with russia were among the victims of the crisis . 
    b\u00fcchele called on the policy to analyze the economic activities and their results as a whole soberly and to discuss alternatives openly . 
  `` economic relations should not be used politically . 
  export-dependent germany , in particular , is hit on the loser 's road when sanctions become a panacea for politics . '',

  the sanctions are strictly adhered to by the german authorities . 
  in the specific case , siemens is doing everything in its power to ensure that the sanctions are adhered to . 
    the delivery of the gas turbines was carried out within the framework of a sanctioning agreement . 
  we expect the russian government to ensure promptly that the agreed terms of contract are fully respected .

  if there are no guarantees , appropriate counter-measures by the eu are necessary . 
  read : sanctions should never have happened , we 've been figuring out how to bypass them without getting whacked by german export control , siemens was totally above-board with the crimea turbines and russia will surely handle any sanctions violations there , any tougher restrictions must not apply to us and if not we need to do a trade war with the us .

  well , as i understand it , germany does n't extend welfare to anyone who is present illegally and who is legally supposed to be in italy . 
  so unless they 're surviving by stealing or something , if they 're supposed to be in italy and are instead in germany , they 're going to be working illegally ...

  if so : * you can feed the steam into a condenser and you 've got yourself a water distillation plant ; or * the hotter the water leaving the system is , the less of it you need as input . 
  throw a phase change in and you need even less . 
  dump a lot of steam into the air and you do n't need the power plant to drink anywhere near as much .
