  not sure if it 'd be classified as a mental illness or not at the moment , but ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rachel_dolezal  dolezal 's self-identification as black became the subject of controversy in june 2015 , [ 5 ] [ 78 ] after dolezal was asked by kxly-tv reporter jeff humphrey about a photo on the facebook page of the spokane naacp chapter of a black man identified as dolezal 's father . 
  after being asked if the man was really dolezal 's father , she said he was but would not answer when asked if she was african american . 
  she then walked out of the interview . 
  [ 5 ] [ 78 ]   dolezal 's parents later stated that their daughter had been trying to `` disguise herself '' as african american . 
  [ 10 ] they presented a copy of their daughter 's montana birth certificate , [ 79 ] and said that she is of german and czech heritage , [ 19 ] with `` faint traces '' of native american ancestry . 
  [ 80 ] [ 81 ] her parents said dolezal began to identify herself more with the african american community around 2007 . 
  [ 23 ] an investigation by professional genealogist elizabeth banas found only white ancestors over the last four centuries , including ancestors of german , dutch , swedish and czech origin . 
  [ 82 ] it later emerged that spokane 's police chief had tired of dealing with dolezal , and asked a private investigator to find out more information on her . 
  the investigator got in touch with dolezal 's parents , and discovered that she was really a white woman . 
  [ 29 ]   in subsequent interviews , dolezal stated that `` if , you know , i was asked , i would definitely say that yes i do consider myself to be black '' , [ 83 ] and that `` i would definitely consider myself to be black '' . 
  [ 84 ] dolezal has listed herself as black on at least one application , [ 9 ] and has said she is of `` african american , native american , german , czech , swedish , jewish and arabic '' heritage . 
  [ 85 ] [ 86 ] in an article she wrote for the inlander in march 2015 , dolezal includes herself when discussing black women through use of the `` we '' and `` our '' pronouns . 
  [ 87 ]   in a november 2 , 2015 interview on the real , dolezal publicly acknowledged for the first time since the controversy began that she was born white . 
  she said , `` i acknowledge that i was biologically born white to white parents , but i identify as black '' . 
  [ yes ] ( http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/17613479/images/1327121300320.jpg ),

  < doubtfully  well , maybe the water bottling plant ... http://www.jaegerplatoon.net/other_at_weapons1.htm  before the war finnish military had planned to manufacture molotov cocktails by hand in few small plants reserved for this . 
  few weeks before breaking out of winter war finnish military started making preparations for molotov cocktail production by buying large amounts of glass bottles for this purpose . 
  finnish military had organised five bottling plants of its own for the work . 
  these were presumably somewhat similar as one located in sorvali near viipuri . 
  in sorvali plant 40 women were manufacturing molotov cocktails to 2nd army corps under leadership of 2nd lieutenant kauko lehtonen . 
  but as the war started the shear volume of needed molotov cocktails proved overwhelming for these small plans to manufacture them . 
    however , buying empty alcohol bottles in large-scale got alko ( finnish alcohol monopoly , state owned company , which was the only company allowed to manufacture or sell hard liquor in finland ) interested . 
  this interest lead to fruitful co-operation between alko and finnish army as alko 's bottling plants had several production lines with highly effective bottle filling machinery . 
  this machinery was able to fill tens of thousands of molotov cocktails per day . 
  once finnish military became aware of this possibility of using alko 's bottling plant for the molotov cocktail production , finnish defence minister juho niukkanen effectively cut the red tape by directly ordering alko to bottle 40,000 bottles with molotov cocktail mix immediately . 
  rajam\u00e4ki plant of alko hired 87 women plus 5 men and started making molotov cocktails 24-hours a day . 
  this first order of 40,000 molotov cocktails was filled in only couple of days and the first deliveries from rajam\u00e4ki plant seem to have arrived to frontline in first part of december 1939 . 
  other parts of manufacturing process were done in vuorela hill and in town of riihim\u00e4ki . 
  finnish troops suffered from shortage of better antitank weapons , but thanks to alko 's riihim\u00e4ki bottling plant and other parts of production line finnish troops in least had enough molotov cocktails in their disposal . 
  during winter war alko 's rajam\u00e4ki plant filled 542,194 bottles with molotov cocktail mix . 
  also other smaller plants manufactured molotov cocktails , but even their combined production numbers were very small compared to this one large bottling plant .

  the us prosecutes a bunch of businesses and people each year for sanctions violations . 
  that means that there are companies violating sanctions in the us .

  we 're talking about a pretty small subset of germany 's population .

  and while they 're waiting for their asylum application ti be heard , they get to wait in immigration detention . 
  we presently have a multi-year backlog . 
  they 're using british english , not us english . 
  `` government '' in us english refers to all of the administration , the entire judicial branch , the legislative branch , and the millions of people in the executive bureaucracy . 
  `` government '' in british english means what `` administration '' does in the us -- the president , vp , and the people that they appoint , a handful of politicians that oversee that bureaucracy . 
  far , far smaller group . 
  i know , the first time i saw `` british government falls '' in a bbc headline , i thought that anarchists had seized power or something or that we were about to be evicting chinese soldiers house-to-house through london . 
  it 's a very confusing difference . 
  well , i suppose that 's true , but i have a hard time thinking of someone else who would be as well-informed on `` is observer status in this meeting important to the uk '' and as likely to have interests as co-aligned with your own . 
  maybe they did . 
  i suspect that wood does n't do too well over 5000 years in a lot of environments . 
  i dunno about `` heavily supporting '' . 
  as your document itself puts it :  the idea that a few million dollars of covert us funds might release a wave of irresistable mass pressure for federalism in europe was misconceived and , with hindsight , ludicrous . 
  huh . 
  in many ways , new york city is quite atypical of the us . 
  low use of cars , restricted firearms , very high population density , expensive housing , extremely multiethnic and multilingual population , use of mass transit , heavy international tourism ... 
  it seems to support my point : it lists support for anticommunist groups , said that there was support for groups who wanted a unified europe , and listed some brits who wanted the uk to be part of a federal europe and others who did not ( the more things change ... ) , listed churchill 's support for federation . 
  other people in the us saw the us model as being quite successful and wanted to encourage it elsewhere . 
  it does n't say that european integration is a us project , but that it saw support in a variety of ways . 
  for the us , in the aftermath of the war , the most immediate concern was that communism was a threat , political radicalism withers where people are not discontent and are well-to-do , and so promoting the things that had made the us wealthy in europe -- trade among european countries , modernized agriculture , etc -- was seen as a way to block communism from obtaining a foothold . 
  certainly the marshall plan aimed at doing that . 
  but i do not think that it is anywhere reasonable to say that because there was a significant degree of * alignment * on the issue , that the us owned european integration . 
  we still do n't know what britons from 5000 years ago were doing with their [ carved stone balls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carved_stone_balls ) .

   other of this size supermarkets would be biedronka , kaufland and some other ones i do n't remember right now . 
  and from what i 've seen they do n't sell clothes , and other stuff like lidl does . 
  aight , but what i 'm getting at is that if lidl is making money hand-over-fist on this , then they 've got a real incentive to enter the clothing market -- not like they 're stuck doing what they 're doing at the moment -- undercut lidl , and run off with their sales while still making money . 
  if they have n't , either they 're colluding ( not impossible , but risky , because i can order clothing online ) , their management is n't doing a good job and some new chain could come in and do a number on * them * .
