  it seems to me that the competition is very different from the us , even if it 's a populist right-winger against a centrist . 
  that was an outlying poll , right ? 
  how so ? 
  you get black market bulbs smuggled into spain via gibraltar . 
  we used decimal currency before europe . 
  eh , they 've already lost a big chunk of their life , then . 
  seems like the focus should be on improving accuracy if that 's the goal . 
  if they get booted out of spain , that 'll rise . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13952592  a survey for a jamaican newspaper suggests most islanders believe the country would have been better off if it had remained a british colony . 
    the poll , commissioned by the gleaner , found that 60 % of respondents backed this view . 
  but 17 % disagreed . 
    a thousand people took part in the survey , out of a population of 2.7 m. 
  the poll has a reported margin of error of plus or minus 4 % . 
    jamaica is due to celebrate 50 years of independence next year . 
    it is not clear what main reasons the respondents had for their choices . 
    but the island has struggled with high levels of poverty and crime . 
  legit point . 
  now , on the flip side : did labour in in 2015 advocate for the same points as labour in 1987 ? 
  or did they too shift their positions , aiming to get a bit over 50 % ? 
  because things like same-sex marriage clearly reflect different policy preferences . 
  green is used by islamic countries . 
  hmm . 
  apparently go to is harmful . 
  though on the flip side , they 're also more expensive where you 're running air conditioning most of the year . 
  * emitting gentle heat was specifically useful in things like chick incubators . 
  * works even in cold environments . 
  * comes on quickly . 
  * consistent brightness over lifetime of bulb . 
  * no electromagnetic interference . 
  ( though with high-frequency electronic ballast , at least the old audible 60 hz hum is gone ) . 
  * no hazardous materials . 
  * mature technology and consistent bulb lifetime . 
  i mean , in most ways , cfls are preferable , but there are legit reasons to want the option of incandescents . 
  i 'd vote to permit them . 
  `` oh , great . 
  bobby jenkins is in * my * class this year . 
  miss white , could i have a copy of your bobby jenkins microsoft word template ? 
  yes , thanks . '', 
  the southern half of thr us permits it in public schools and almost every state permits it in private schools . 
  plus , parents can use it . 
  [ legal almost everywhere in private schools in the us . 
  about half of the public school systems ban it . 
  it 's not used all that much in most places , but it 's usually still an option ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_corporal_punishment_in_the_united_states ) . 
  i think that `` gunboats '' are normally not for blue water operation . 
  so unless you 're thinking of the republic of ireland ... 
   offering a choice does n't imply a requirement to choose that option no , but the question itself may impart meaning . 
  `` have you stopped beating your wife ? '', 
  i mean , i would n't put it everywhere . 
  most places in europe should be familiar with preserved buildings to retain the feel of an earlier time in places . 
  the us does n't have as much of that but we do have some historic districts in older cities . 
  we 've got [ heritage railways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heritage_railway ) , i guess . 
  point is , if some place * does * want to use gas lights for the antique look , i would n't advocate for banning it . 
  by legal mandate , apparently : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pint  in the united kingdom , the imperial pint is still the primary unit for draught beer and cider , as it is for milk sold in returnable bottles . 
  ** in the uk , legislation mandates that draught beer and cider may be sold by the imperial pint in perpetuity ** , and in public houses can only be sold in a third of a pint , two-thirds of a pint or multiples of half a pint , which must be served in stamped measured glasses or from government-stamped meters . 
  i do n't think that * the independent * is simply all clickbait . 
  it is certainly pro-eu , and i recall reading ( on / r/ukpolitics ? ), 
  that the most-common political affiliation among readers was liberal democrat . 
  but they are no worse than the * telegraph * or * guardian * in taking a political position . 
   it was ` how many people can we get to agree to these shit policies so we can make fun of leavers ' that may be true . 
   i 'll miss the sane people , but surely not people who 're pro death penalty i 'm fine with the death penalty , but i 'm not going to want to dissociate with someone simply because they 're against . 
  does that really rank that high on your list of concerns ? 
   who think the look of their passport is an important issue the poll did n't say that it was important , but what percentage felt that it should be changed . 
  i think that brexit is a bad idea . 
  but , barring some major magic worked , it 's going to happen in two years . 
  burgundy is used to symbolize the eu . 
  would it be appropriate to continue using burgundy after leaving ? 
  hell , i personally think that the eu should use gold on blue , insofar as aesthetics go , and have the circle of stars embossed on the front . 
  it seems weird for the uk to be switching * to * gold on blue when leaving the only entity whose colors are gold and blue . 
  edit : okay , except ukraine ... i guess ukraine would also do blue and gold . 
  honestly , permitting gas lighting in historic areas might be kinda neat . 
  realistically , though , the fact that there was resistance meant that they were not sold well , even if good ideas . 
  simply taking umbrage at it kinda misses the more important point : what set people off , and could it happen elsewhere , and how could that be avoided ? 
  fwiw , i 'm pretty pissed off about the incandescent ban in the us . 
  sure , i did n't want to personally use them in most cases , but i want to be the one making that call . 
  also , some cfls had extremely poor lifetime , well below what was promised . 
  mandating cfls when some people did not consider them worthwhile forced them to transfer them to cfl patent holders . 
  either consumers were unaware that cfls had lower lifetime cost , in which case the fix should be only a labeling change , or they wanted to choose incandescents , in which case they should not have been prevented from doing so . 
  let 's say that some guy immigrates . 
  do you disallow family reunification for a woman that he is probably responsible for supporting ? 
  what about shared property ? 
  is the wife stripped of communal property in the eyes of the state ? 
  or the husband ? 
  what about spousal privacy rights ? 
  what happens to custody of any children ? 
  i mean , you 've got a real clash of social norms , but i think that it 'd make more sense to have some sort of status for a child-wife in a society that disallows marriage below a given age that reflects that status , even if you require domestic social norms ( e.g. 
  they may not sleep together until majority , wife has to elect a second time to be married at that point , etc ) . 
  i kinda suspect that if you just do n't recognize marriage , you wind up in a situation like that of some polygamists where people are effectively living together as spouses , but simply are n't * legally * married . 
  i 'm not sure whose interests that serves . 
  [ argos , greece ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argos ) is the oldest continuously-inhabited city in europe , dating back about 7,000 years . 
  * when humanity invented the alphabet , argos had been around for three thousand years . 
  * when the mammoth went extinct , argos had been around for two-and-a-half thousand years . 
  * when the first of the egyptian pyramids was built , argos had been around for over two thousand years . 
  * when humanity invented writing , argos had been around for about two thousand years . 
  * argos started out about the same time that humanity discovered the amazing new technology of the wheel . 
  * when argos was founded , the [ entire global population of humans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_population_estimates ) was somewhere between what norway ( 5m ) and what romania ( 20m ) have today . 
  * [ serfdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serfdom ) was still a thing in france and much of continental europe 230 years ago . 
  in the time that argos has been around , mainland europe could have gone from a society of serfs to the society that it is today thirty times over . 
  mostly for transport , not cavalry . 
  i think that a lot of people have an image of world war ii as being a purely-mechanized one -- i certainly did , had the idea that horses were really more part of world war i. 
  by the time the us was in the war , it was throwing a lot of resources in and had a great deal of vehicle production capacity available .
