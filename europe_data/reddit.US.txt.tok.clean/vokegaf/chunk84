  there 's a stock response on / r/ukpolitics that the leavers provide to criticisms of the form ( `` the eu pays for x in the uk , and brexit will end that '' ) , and i agree with them : the uk , on the net , provides funds to the eu . 
  that makes arguments of the form `` the uk leaving the eu will cause the uk to lose out on eu funds '' unconvincing . 
  the uk * could * always choose to allocate those funds to its institution itself . 
  if it does not do so , that means that that 's not where its government wants them . 
  that means that either ( a ) the eu system has to more-accurately reflect the concerns of the british public than their own government , which seems unlikely , just because of the other competing interests in a larger system , or ( b ) the argument for that spending priority is a minority position in the uk . 
  while ( a ) is not impossible , i 'm dubious , and it 's not at the core of any of these `` spending might change '' arguments that i 've seen thus far . 
  ( b ) is possible -- for example , maybe people in a particular town in the uk wind up receiving more funds from the eu than they do uk post-brexit . 
  but it 's also going to be a minority position -- that is , overall british preference will be against the particular allocation . 
  i think that the solid arguments against brexit tend to rest more on scale or benefits of cooperation . 
  that 's what the article author 's argument rests on , and i can see where he 's coming from . 
  however , i do n't think arguments about government spending allocation in the uk post-brexit are very convincing . 
   the long commutes and huge amount of traffic jams are a direct result of not having proper public transport . 
  well , then if your bar is `` car-based countries have insufficient infrastructure '' , then , sure , the us obviously is n't going to meet your criteria for having sufficient infrastructure . 
  my own take is that people in the us have the option to choose whether they want to use cars or public transport , and overwhelmingly , with the option to take either route , they 've chosen cars . 
  you can say `` i disagree with their choice '' , but couching that in terms of insufficient infrastructure seems like an odd way of critique . 
  to build more public transportation infrastructure would be redundant , as people want to use their cars . 
   bike infrastructure is usually terrible in the us . 
  some cities are improving it now , but it 's very small . 
  sure . 
  there is n't much because people do n't want to use bikes , for commuting , by-and-large . 
  my dad was one of the extremely unusual people who did so for some years , and i did so for a while . 
  i do n't do it any more -- back to using a car . 
  if i take a car , i have climate control , it moves faster , i do n't care about inclement weather , i can carry as much stuff as i want , i can carry other people if i feel like it at my destination , i 've got a more-secure place to put stuff , it 's harder to steal . 
  it 's simply preferable in almost all respects . 
   see . 
  you 're doing public transport very badly . 
  i disagree . 
  i think that we simply have the funds and space to afford a better alternative , and use that . 
   that 's what i mean . 
  every little gust of wind can cut your electricity ( tv , phone ) because of the flimsy over ground power lines used almost everywhere , instead of underground . 
  you are n't going to build below-ground power lines in low density areas . 
   the purchasing power of the lower classes is diminished and stays diminished as the immigrant 's wage is lower than the wage of native workers . 
  * particular groups of workers * can wind up worse off than other groups of workers , sure . 
  as i wrote :   it can cause shifts . 
  if relatively-few doctors immigrate , but many farmworkers immigrate , the wages of doctors will tend to rise , and the wages of farmworkers fall . 
  that , however , is not shifting things in favor of investors , which is what i was objecting to above . 
  / u/walrup had claimed :  immigration is used in every country by the capitalist class ( also known as the business owners ) to supress the negociating power of labor . 
  that 's not correct -- immigration is n't shifting things in favor of investors and against workers . 
  it may shift things in favor of one * group * of workers versus another . 
   2 ) if what you say its true it means polish judges are easily accessible and corrupted because if pis need to replace them it means there are loyal to the previous leftist snowflakes crybabies i do n't see why . 
  surely , even if you feel that pis is * actually * doing this with no bias , you can see how from what the public knows , it 'd be entirely possible for them to remove judges that are n't specially-loyal to any party and install judges that are ? 
  let 's say that they 're corrupt . 
  i mean , hey , i 'm on-board with fighting corruption . 
  why not charge them with a crime and prosecute them ? 
  if people are moving into the country , they 're producing demand . 
  they 've got the same needs as other people . 
  they do n't simply work and not have their hair cut , not eat food , and not have broken windows repaired for a couple years . 
  could be !, 
  i 've been using reddit for many years , and providing plenty of links with exactly the syntax i showed you . 
  it works fine .

   no drinking water for years in a major city like flint . 
  flint is a pretty unusual case , which is why it makes the news . 
  [ it 'd kind of like me highlighting the triangle of death ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triangle_of_death_%28italy%29 ) in europe and treating it as representative . 
  detroit has had its economy radically contract , and both it and flint had leaders that did an exceptionally poor job of managing that contraction . 
  it would have been perfectly possible , given available resources , to have cut early and in non-essential things , but they did n't , and now they have a ton of problems . 
   terrible public transport in manhattan , which is dense , you 'll have public transport . 
  a few other cities may be tolerable . 
  but almost no us cities are truly based on public transport -- broadly-speaking , the population is wealthy enough to be able to use car-based transportation , and there 's enough space available for cities to spread out , so that 's what the bulk of the country is built around , and public transport is , in most places , reserved for the poor . 
  that 's not a lack of infrastructure , but a different sort of infrastructure . 
  the automobile is ( generally , with a few exceptions ) privately-owned , and the state provides a road . 
  i had a co-worker once who moved out from germany to work in the us for a while . 
  i took him back to return his rental car . 
  i asked him if he was buying or leasing a car . 
  he said , no , he always just bicycled everywhere in germany . 
  i said that he * probably really wants a car in the us , and he 's really not going to like trying to live without one * . 
  he said that no , he was in good shape , and that he was perfectly-capable of bicycling . 
  i shrugged , we dropped off his rental . 
  next month , i was driving him out so that he could get a car . 
   * traffic jams everywhere i 'll agree with this in some places . 
  manhattan is perpetual traffic due to density . 
  los angeles freeways can turn into wide rivers of slowly-moving cars . 
  [ tomtom apparently publishes a metric of top congested cities ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/most-congested-cities-tomtom-traffic-index-2017-2/#25-london-uk-40-1 ) . 
  it has one european city ( london ) and one us city ( los angeles ) on it . 
  edit : oops , two european cities -- i missed bucharest . 
  four if you count st. petersburg and moscow -- not part of the eu , but part of europe . 
  edit2 : well , four-and-a-half , since half of istanbul is in europe . 
   * private toll roads not terribly common , but they certainly do exist . 
  aside from the transaction cost , i 'm not incredibly adverse to them -- you use the road , you pay for the road , someone does n't use the road , they do n't pay for it -- but most people who commute regularly through a toll road use an automatic electronic billing system , like [ e-zpass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e-zpass ) . 
  these are currently fragmented -- so even if you pay to commute in one area automatically , if you drive to the other side of the country you 'd have to manually pay at a toll gate -- but apparently they 're in the process of unified . 
  i do n't really see this as a lack of infrastructure , though . 
   black outs and brown outs are not uncommon . 
  i 've certainly seen blackouts when i lived in a rural , snowy area , where trees could bring down power lines . 
  i 've seen them occasionally in suburbia . 
  while they do * exist * in major cities , i think that `` not uncommon '' is stretching things . 
  there was the infamous [ 2003 northeast blackout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northeast_blackout_of_2003 ) , if that 's what you 're thinking of . 
  if does look like [ italy had a major blackout the same year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_italy_blackout ) . 
  i 've never seen a brown-out in my life , living in various places across the us . 
  what you * can * get is several brief voltage drops and surges , then a cut in power . 
  that happens if something is in the process of bringing down a power line -- i once had a friend describe it as an automated process done by the utility to try to knock off the branch or whatnot . 
  and i 'd add that [ germany is hardly in a position at the moment to be positively-comparing its power capacity to that of the us ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/28/germany-facing-mass-blackouts-because-the-wind-and-sun-wont-cooperate/ ) , due to her shutdown of nuclear capacity . 
   but it 's very clear you despise the idea of a uniform . 
  `` despise '' might be too strong . 
  i definitely do not like school uniforms . 
   have you been to school in a country which had them ? 
  i 've had friends who have , all of whom promptly switched to streetwear when they got to college . 
   i feel like you 've thought way too much about it and think the implications are far worse than they really are as it comes across that you 're painting a picture that children in 90 % of the world have no identity , are depressed or are unable to perform any activity because of the constraints of their uniform . 
  i do n't think that they have `` no '' identity . 
  i do think that it interferes with them producing their identity . 
  i never said that they were depressed , but that i think that seeing that lots of people wearing the same thing is depressing to me .
