  i do n't think that i said anything about `` being unable to perform any activity '' . 
   i mean of all the nations you decided to introduce as an analogy you picked north korea ? 
  it 's probably the only remaining country that engages in in that sort of mass demonstration at such scale . 
   we irish people on the other hand , have a history of awful behaviour ( including criminal ) in other countries . 
  have a read of how irish emigrants to the usa behaved meh . 
  large numbers of poor people fleeing homelands always did that in immigration waves . 
  not very specific to the irish . 
  give it a generation or two and some time to build wealth and it clears up . 
  italian-americans had the [ american mafia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_mafia ) .

  edit : also , a germane snippet from the jewish-american organized crime article that sums things up nicely , pretty much along the lines i just put it :  jewish-american organized crime was a reflection of the ethnic succession among gangsters , which has tended to follow the immigrant waves in the united states : english , german , irish , jewish , italian , asian and latino . 
  yeah ? 
  what infrastructure are you missing ? 
  * i suggest a default to permitting people to do what they want unless there is a strong argument against doing so is a good principle to work with . 
  there is no strong consensus in favor of uniforms being advantageous . 
  * there is a general shift in us society away from restricting clothing choices at work . 
  it seems odd to me to require children to do something in the face of such a shift , where employers can clearly tell that adult employees , people with the ability to leave work if they do not like it , dislike . 
  if we , as adults , do not see fit to live in a society in which we should all wear uniforms , i have a hard time swallowing that we 're in a good position to put children in the same position . 
  * if a child wants to wear a uniform-like outfit , he normally has the option to do so . 
  this only constrains children who do not want to do so . 
  * children normally live much-more-restricted lives than adults . 
  to some degree , this is because adults might have better judgment , but i think that it 's also because society in general has a tendency to try to over-prescribe the behavior of others , and in children 's case , they 've no real way to push back . 
  they 're already required by law to spend much of their day for many years on end attending a particular institution . 
  their speech is , depressingly , constrained in ways that would be constitutionally unacceptable for any institution other than a school to constrain . 
  they do not have the ability to `` quit '' their job . 
  they can not simply move wherever they want , as they are dependent upon their parents . 
  they do not have `` vacation time '' . 
  especially in the us , they have a very limited ability to determine where they can travel -- the car is critical to moving around . 
  their use of computers or phones may be constrained in various ways . 
  while i do n't think that alcohol or drug use is a particularly desirable thing , and that there are physical justifications for restricting its use , they are not permitted to choose to use recreational substances , whereas adults often are . 
  many families will not permit them to make their own religious choices ( obviously , someone can * think * whatever they like , but ... ) . 
  they have a limited ability to change the space that they live in . 
  they typically have a constrained budget , and can not just buy whatever they want to wear . 
  they can not vote in the political system . 
  it seems to me that letting children choose , within the set of clothes that their parents permit them to own and wear , what to wear in their daily life is the least that society can do . 
  * children are learning about the world . 
  part of that involves constructing an identity . 
  one 's appearance is part of that . 
  i think that exploring options is just fine . 
  * i just generally do not like things that promote the de-emphasis of the self relative to the collective . 
  maybe that 's merely a bias , but i do n't find things like thousands of north koreans wearing identical outfits and moving in perfect unison to be impressive . 
  i find it to be depressing . 
  it makes me think of the sheer number of people whose ideas and preferences and whims had to be tamped down to fit them in a box to pull that off . 
  sure , school uniforms are a drastically less-serious form of this , but i do n't really see much appeal . 
  * present school uniforms tend to be , imho , rather less-practical than typical streetwear . 
  i wear jeans and a patterned collar shirt , by choice , because the jeans are durable , the shirt makes for a nice way to keep a jacket from getting sweaty , and the pattern helps hide any smudge that might show up during the day . 
  school uniforms often involve pure-white fabric , which show smudges . 
  they often involve solid colors , which also show smudges , to a lesser degree . 
  they often have skirts ( which i think are probably a pain in the ass for girls -- if they want to wear them , they 're free to do so , but few seemed to want to do so when i went to a non-uniformed school ) . 
  they often involve dress coats , which are n't fantastic at keeping an even heat distribution . 
  they often involve dressier fabrics that are less durable than the denim that just about everyone wore in my school . 
  they may involve ties ( these are nearly dead in daily society in the us , and i shall shed no tears for the unnecessary annoyance that they represent ) . 
  * i do n't particularly think that using the students to advertise the school ( in the case of private schools ) is a good thing . 
  * they 're inconvenient if someone wants to do something else that involves different clothing near school . 
  for example , i can just wear hiking boots instead of sneakers if i 'm going to be clomping around in the woods afterwards .

   it is n't . 
  yes , it is , because `` labor '' is inclusive of doctors . 
  my comment avoids the fallacy because i 'm not making claims about labor as a whole . 
   the opening of borders for economic immigrants puts downward pressure on those low wage workers ( such as farmworkers ) not to call for a higher and therefor more livable wages as they simply get replaced if they do and most of the time get replaced anyways as the immigrants are willing to work for less . 
  this is what he was talking about . 
  it can be ( and in the case of the uk , was , since intra-eu immigration to the uk was disproportionately unskilled workers ) the case . 
  if you bring in mostly skilled workers , the opposite happens . 
  but that is the shift that i 'm talking about -- it is certainly the case that immigration can produce winners or losers among subgroups of labor , depending upon composition of the immigration . 
  however , i disagree with your claim that immigration is normally favorable to people who live off investments in a country and unfavorable to labor as an entire group . 
  the uk has a bit of a historical economic involvement with east asia . 
  maybe it 's people thinking about hong kong and singapore ? 
  [ fixed link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) ) . 
  ppp-adjusting the overall gdp does n't measure economic power , though . 
  i ca n't really think of anything useful that you 'd use it for . 
  i 'm gon na guess that most of the world 's population spends a lot less time throwing around national statistics than people on this sub do . 
   edit : reddit is stupid and does n't allow links with parenthesis in them . 
  but the link is on that page . 
  use : [ linktext ] ( linkurl ) syntax , putting a backslash before any parens . 
  okay , but ppp is only really useful for anything that i can think of on a per capita basis . 
  on a per capita basis , it measures standard of living to some degree : it takes into account the fact that people buy a lot domestically . 
  nominal gdp measures international economic power . 
  why would you ppp-adjust the gdp as a whole ? 
   an \u00e0 la carte program if you pardon my french * * a la carte * is part of the english language now -- [ it 's a loan phrase from french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%80_la_carte ) . 
  * you may not want to use the phrase `` pardon my french '' . 
  as a phrase in english , it means [ something rather different than the literal meaning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardon_my_french ) . 
  `` to put it in french '' would avoid the issue . 
   there is no border wall with mexico , there 's not even funding for it . 
  there 's a border wall . 
  not along the whole thing , but trump never promised that . 
  bush made similar promises and built some . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secure_fence_act_of_2006  but illegal border crossings have dropped and people in central america that were planning to walk north to the u.s.a. are dropping their plans trump has fuck-all to do with this . 
  it 's a function of the relative state of the economy north and south of the border . 
  [ the net number of illegal immigrants in the us had been falling since 2011 , years before trump was near the white house .
