   we never say of there is a massive eu debt crisis . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_debt_crisis looks reasonably like it 's going away to my ten-second glance . 
  is it still a crisis ? 
  still got ta describe a politically-acceptable implementation of `` closing borders '' for people using the current approach via sea . 
  climate change and war zones are both insignificant factors compared to birth rate in terms of upcoming population pressures in africa . 
  well , maybe not war zones , if you 're only looking at proximate cause of migration , as population pressure itself can manifest itself as war . 
  all you need is a single hyphen if you just want a break . 
   they could probably return if they wanted . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_bangladesh  in 2016 , per-capita income was estimated as per imf data at us$ 3,840 ( ppp ) and us$ 1,466 ( nominal ) . 
  pay kinda sucks . 
   germans in high positions who have less than satisfactory skills in english german is also the largest l1 language in the eu , so it 's probably the easiest non-english language to get along with at an eu level . 
  i bet you 're gon na have a harder time being monolingual and , i dunno , estonian and doing business at an eu level . 
   at least you could make the argument for choosing eu since the eu 's combined gdp is larger than the us 's no , it is n't . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states  $ 18.558 trillion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union  $ 16.518 trillion the european single market is larger than the us , though , so you could say `` the european single market is the largest single market '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_single_market  $ 19 trillion, 
  the land rover example you 're giving has nothing to do with acquiring companies . 
  it has a chinese company that duplicated the exterior look of a nicer-end vehicle selling in china . 
   when xi said he wants a open global economy he meant the suckers in germany or us , not china . 
  investors are big boys . 
  if they do n't want a non-controlling share in a chinese company , they do n't need to buy it . 
  i mean , if you want to buy a company for its intellectual property assets , why is that more objectionable than acquiring it for its brick and mortar assets ? 
  in short , fdi is a vote of confidence in your workers , managers , and business institutions . 
  it 's saying `` i trust these guys to make a return with resources they 're entrusted with more than i do people in my country '' . 
  it funds your startup industry . 
  it lets your companies expand . 
  it drives up your wages . 
  it gives your government some degree of control over the assets of foreigners -- if you impose sanctions , you wield the assets of foreign investors as well . 
   ... company if such a move is deemed to threaten public order or national security . 
  national security ? 
  fine . 
  public order , though ? 
  seriously , is this law * honestly * saying if germans riot , we 're gon na block fdi ? 
  send it this way , china !, 
  possible . 
  [ us racial distribution maps maps in many cities are highly segregated ] ( http://demographics.virginia.edu/dotmap/ ) , so even if the poor ca n't afford to live wherever , the wealthy are choosing not to do so . 
  that 's a good argument for the respondee answer not lining up with their actual actions . 
  that being said , it could be that the people being asked the question are mentally-substituting someone who is identical to them in terms of income , education , cultural background , and only different in race . 
  [ bet you would n't like a life sentence in solitary confinement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jesse_pomeroy ) or [ a death sentence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_stinney ) , then . 
  probably . 
  of course , the same is also probably true of the people from various other countries that have been trying to overthrow the iraqi government and on whom we 've been dropping munitions for a while . 
  and on the people involved in 9/11 and similar attacks . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  more privacy than censorship , i 'd say . 
  murdoch wrote * the guardian * to complain about them claiming that he said this , and says that the quote is not something that he said . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/19/rupert-murdoch-i-have-never-asked-for-anything-from-any-prime-minister  on a number of occasions now your paper has quoted me as saying : `` when i go into downing street , they do what i say ; when i go to brussels , they take no notice . ''   there is much fake news published about me , but let me make clear that i have never uttered those words . 
  i have made it a principle all my life never to ask for anything from any prime minister .

  that does n't prove your point when the bulk of the items listed do n't fit well with your thesis . 
  sure , you could try a bunch of patches ( minimum wage works poorly at transferring wealth when labor is going into a product that has high [ price elasticity of demand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/price_elasticity_of_demand ) , because it cuts into how much labor is needed ) but why bother ? 
  if your goal is to give the poor a larger piece of the pie , just have the government tax the public , give the poor money and stop there . 
  that 's a much more foolproof way to do what you want . 
  restrictions on the form of employment compensation are typically just an not-very-effective way to transfer wealth from a to b ) . 
  you could just have one single hard-to-defeat market distortion instead of a bazillion , many of which probably are n't very good at doing what you want . 
  i singled it out because it 's the only place where the ordering has serfdom ending way before the ir . 
  that 's not the case for the rest of these . 
  amusing factoid : apparently the us played some indirect role in normalizing spanish in latin america : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_spanish  in any event , in the sphere of spoken language the issue has become problematic since at least the 1950s , when the commercial demands on movie dubbing studios working with hollywood films began to call for the development of a spanish whose pronunciation , vocabulary , and grammatical features would not be recognizable as belonging to any particular country . 
  this goal soon proved to be an elusive one : even if the results could , on occasion , approximate a universally intelligible form , at the same time the process prevented the transmission of a familiar , intimate , or everyday tone . 
  nevertheless , its continued use has produced a degree of familiarization with a certain abstract phonetics throughout spanish america . 
  dubbings made in spain , are very particularly localized . 
  see , the problem is that iceland goes right in the ideal spot for legends on maps of europe . 
  what you need is a standardized inset location for iceland ... maybe south of ireland . 
  i do n't think that he 's american , unless he 's really , really into sweden . 
  i think his point is that the preference would n't have been as strong without framing the question in the context of the uk leaving . 
  ( or if that 's not his point , it 's my take ) . 
  past eu polls have certainly established that there is a strong preference for eu membership in ireland -- that 's not in question . 
  man , the uk has a * hufpo * branch too now ? 
  making it hard to fire someone does n't just give a worker free job stability . 
  it means that a worker 's compensation is required to be partly in the form of a stability guarantee : instead of paying an employee more , an employer factors in the cost of keeping people on the payroll who would have been fired or laid off and pulls it out of pay . 
  so french workers make less . 
  it also makes employers less-willing to hire , because they are subject to a not insignificant risk in doing so . 
  it also artificially drives up the use of temporary employment , which is not subject to this regulation ( though obviously this last is just a quirk of the existing system , as it could also be made to apply to temporary workers ) . 
  i think you want `` compared to romania in 1990 , romania today is unrecognizable '' , meaning that they are very different . 
  `` indistinguishable '' means the opposite : that they are so similar that it is impossible to distinguish between the two , impossible to see any difference . 
  gon na need some context for some of us to understand this . 
  what 's a `` circle of friendship '' in bulgarian politics ? 
  in the us , it 'd just be `` indian '' . 
  `` south asian '' is n't a term in general use . 
  but i think that your broader point is insightful . 
  smooth , mexico . 
  also , wow , was expecting a red japan . 
  also , turkey , for a country stemming from a famously multi-ethnic empire ... 
   the aosta valley was the first government authority ** to adopt modern french as the official language ** in 1536 , three years before france itself . 
  becoming the official language is not the same thing as being spoken . 
  if that were true , the us would n't speak any language at all . 
  < does a site search for site : uk `` public sector ''  but the `` public sector '' means `` run by the government '' in the uk too . 
  grrr , britain . 
  edit : god , that exact point is [ literally the second sentence of the wikipedia article on them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_school_\\ ( united_kingdom \\ ) ) :  a public school in england and wales is an older , student selective , fee-paying independent secondary school which caters primarily for children aged between 11 or 13 and 18 . 
  the term `` public '' should not be misunderstood to mean that these are public sector schools : they are in fact private sector . 
  maybe this dates back to monarchy ... yup , looks like it might :  soon after the clarendon commission reported in 1864 , the public schools act 1868 gave the following seven schools independence from direct jurisdiction or responsibility of the crown , the established church , or the government that is , the crown is n't running it : some member of the public is . 
  in the us , non-uniform use dominates , but there are schools with uniforms , and the number is increasing . 
  there is not a single national-level policy . 
  https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=50  from 1999 -- 2000 to 2013 -- 14 , the percentage of public schools reporting that they required students to wear uniforms increased from 12 to 20 percent . 
  i have a low opinion of school uniforms , and am not very enthusiastic about this change . 
  he may never receive a lot of love from many in the public for it , but those reforms do stand to make france a wealthier country . 
  he 's doing what 's advantageous for france here . 
  well , the greens were also pro-eu , iirc . 
  they have a lot less traction than the liberal democrats , though . 
   immigration is used in every country by the capitalist class ( also known as the business owners ) to supress the negociating power of labor . 
  this is the [ lump of labor fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lump_of_labour_fallacy ) .
