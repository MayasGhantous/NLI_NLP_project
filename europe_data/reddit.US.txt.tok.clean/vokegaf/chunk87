  as you bring in workers , you also generate more demand for all that other labor . 
  it can cause * shifts * . 
  if relatively-few doctors immigrate , but many farmworkers immigrate , the wages of doctors will tend to rise , and the wages of farmworkers fall . 
  there are some times when the idea of a fixed amount of labor is n't a terrible model , and you would have been right . 
  if the economy is mostly just agriculture and you 're already farming all available land , then the land becomes the bottleneck on production , not any one sort of labor . 
  people are forced to work more-and-more marginal land , and this [ diseconomy of scale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diseconomies_of_scale ) dominates . 
  during the black plagues , real wages rose : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consequences_of_the_black_death  the plague 's great population reduction brought cheaper land prices , more food for the average peasant , and a relatively large increase in per capita income among the peasantry , if not immediately , in the coming century . 
  this is true for the [ primary sector of the economy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primary_sector_of_the_economy ) . 
  however , the uk 's [ modern economy is n't tightly bound to the primary sector any more  ( http://www.economicshelp.org/concepts/primary-sector/ ) :  in the uk , agriculture , mining and extractive industries accounts for around 12 % of gdp, 
  the us does fine . 
  it excludes illegal immigrants from most forms of welfare . 
   without it , wages go down wages in the areas of labor in which people are disproportionately immigrating will always almost certainly go down . 
  they will tend to rise in areas where they are disproportionately under-immigrating . 
  i mean , economically it is most-efficient not to have the brakes . 
  politically it clearly turned out to be a larger issue than expected . 
  i still wonder if remain would have won if it were n't for the eu migrant crisis happening at the worst possible time . 
  the * new statesman * seems to me to be either wrong or intenationally misleading ( i do n't know its political positions ) . 
   the labour leader was pressed on his party 's attitude to immigration on the andrew marr programme . 
  he reiterated his belief that britain should leave the single market , claiming that `` the single market is dependent on membership of the eu . 
  the two things are inextricably linked . '', 
    corbyn said that labour would argue for `` tarriff-free trade access '' instead . 
  however , other countries which enjoy this kind of deal , such as norway , do so by accepting the `` four freedoms '' of the single market , which include freedom of movement for people . 
  [ european single market membership ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_single_market ) does normally require the four freedoms . 
  however , i would assume from the description that corbyn is advocating not for membership in the single market , but membership in the [ european customs union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_customs_union ) or a free trade agreement , both of which would be compatible with his quoted statements . 
  i doubt that the uk will go for customs union membership , which probably means an fta , the `` less-tight '' of the two options . 
  nothing he was quoted as saying there is incompatible with this . 
  hmm . 
  you did have non-free labor in the form of serfs , however . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution  the industrial revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840 . 
  with the exception of the ever-precocious united kingdom , serfdom abolition looks kinda late for much of europe to be driving the industrial revolution : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serfdom#dates_of_emancipation_from_serfdom_in_various_countries  * scotland : neyfs ( serfs ) disappeared by the late 14th century , but heritable jurisdictions survived until 1747 .

  the [ norse peoples pretty much were the scariest pirates in human history ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/denmarks-earliest-kings-were-also-pirates-180956439/ ) . 
  wow . 
  i knew about the horn of africa and southeast asia ... but i had no idea that there was a smaller cluster of piracy off west africa and even a few attacks around south america . 
  roman forum / r/rome, 
  hopefully pretty good in the future , though . 
   a large cause of the industrial revolution was the demise of slavery so maybe no . 
  i 'm suspicious that the cause-and-effect was the other way . 
  [ apparently , it 's heavily czechs , with poles and germans next up . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_slovakia ), 
  well , if those are mostly foreigners , then it represents a large transfer of wealth from foreigners to france . 
  i mean ... i get that it 's disruptive , and maybe france should manage it differently ( unlike the uk , i believe that france charges property tax , which handles some of it ) . 
  i mean , i 'm not saying that there 's no disadvantage to charging a fee -- there 's a [ transaction cost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transaction_cost ) that i have to hassle with , whereas if i fund it via taxes or something , i do n't need to deal with stopping and being checked . 
  i 'm sympathetic to that -- there is some real cost to having a turnstile or similar , have someone check that i 've contributed to something to be somewhere . 
  it 's just that those policies were made based on the environment that existed when they were created . 
  it 's changed -- travel is much cheaper and easier now , the people of the world wealthier , and it 's usually easier to adapt to the environment than to change the environment . 
  and , honestly ... having your assets in very great demand by much of the world and having to adjust how you manage access to them is n't a * terrible * place to be -- a lot of the world would probably enviously like to be there ... 
   western europe puts in nearly no effort to gain tourism all those times you see the eiffel tower all over everything is n't just random . 
  there 's a fair amount of money at stake . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_france  in 2012 , travel and tourism directly contributed eur77 .7 billion to french gdp , 30 % of which comes from international visitors and 70 % from domestic tourism spending . 
  the total contribution of travel and tourism represents 9.7 % of gdp and supports 2.9 million jobs ( 10.9 % of employment ) in the country . 
  [ 3 ] tourism contributes significantly to the balance of payments . 
  after other french people , nostly brits , germans , belgians , dutch , and italians . 
  you can vote to have the municipality do so . 
  well , the whole world 's population ca n't go there . 
  increasing prices based on demand is used for most things . 
  if that gnaws at the left-wing of your soul , consider that it 's redistributing wealth and that the municipality is maximally-benefiting . 
   it 's be nice if they were appreciated rather than be used as a stage for selfies . 
  i suspect that some of the draw of tourism is that you can show the people back home how cosmopolitan you are . 
  pictures help with that . 
  and , honestly , is someone taking a selfie of themselves at the eiffel tower * that * objectionable ? 
   the waste management company is put under pressure by them while they spend next to nothing are they bringing in things that the city is paying to dispose of ( like wrappers for brought-in goods ? ), 
  because if they 're buying something in the city and then disposing of it a public wastebasket in the city , that seems like something that can be addressed via fees . 
   people from cruise liners pay nothing as they use their money on the ship . 
  they are equivalent of leeches . 
  if that 's a problem , then there are various options : * have the port impose docking fees for tourist ships based on headcount . 
  * impose a municipal surcharge based on something other than housing that gets purchased , like food and drink . 
  provide an tax rebate on , say , income tax to locals to offset the increased consumption tax . 
  * avoid providing free resources . 
  that ca n't be done with * everything * -- for example , if there 's a towering monument that tourists can see from a distance , can hardly charge for access to it . 
  but if a free-access beach is getting swarmed , and that 's the tourist draw , can charge for access . 
   use as much free resources as available one might argue that free resources should n't be free to avoid that -- that is , if you need to fund this via taxes and issue a pass to locals and charge non-locals or something , do that . 
   `` around 2,000 people leave each year , '' he said . 
  `` if we go on this way , in a few years ' time venice will only be populated by tourists . 
  this would be a social , anthropological and historical disaster . '' why ? 
  i mean , yeah , people moved . 
  but venice is world-famous for being this city * in * the water . 
  zillions of people around the world want to see a city like that . 
  if they want to do so badly-enough , i 'd sell my house at some exorbitant price to them too and go live somewhere else . 
   `` there is no logic here . 
  europe is undermining its security by undermining israel . 
  europe is undermining its progress by undermining the connection with israeli innovation because of a crazy attempt to create conditions ( for peace with the palestinians ) , '' said netanyahu . 
    european ties with israel would determine whether the 28-member union would `` live and thrive or shrivel and disappear , '' he added . 
  whether-or-not it 's a good policy from the eu 's standpoint , i 'm reasonably confident that lecturing the eu about it is not going to go over well with them . 
  this is n't new , bibi ... https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/benjamin_netanyahu#quotes_about_netanyahu  who the fuck does he think he is ? 
  who 's the fucking superpower here ? 
  -- us president bill clinton in 1996 , after being lectured by netanyahu on the middle east, 
   i 'm sure he 'd put may 's snoopers charter , porn laws and internet policing shite where they belong , in the fucking bin i do n't know british politics , but i assume that pms do n't just go whip up legislation and pass it on a whim , but rather that the party feels that it politically makes sense . 
  combined police units would be a way to deal with enforcement communication . 
  i 'm not sure that this is an issue of that sort -- it 's not as if there 's some greater communication that would address this . 
  in fact , dumping garbage , if it 's just general household garbage , is probably not too hard to track back to the person whose garbage it is -- [ you get letters and stuff and they have addresses on them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpx2t7xof1k&amp;t=2m ) . 
  i suspect that problem is proving that the specific person is the one who actually dumped the garbage to the legal standard necessary to fine them . 
  maybe you can just call them up and get them to confess ... 
   at this point a lazy litany follows : bridges and roads are `` crumbling , '' broadband lines are too slow , and so forth . 
  yeah , the same schtick gets used over here too . 
  it 's vague and not quantitative , so easy to sell . 
  very federalist . 
  france does .
