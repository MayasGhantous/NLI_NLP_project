  however , her nuclear arsenal is a comparatively small one . 
  it is not something that someone would credibly threaten to use against russia unless russia had already hit france , since it would presumably cause russia to use her own weapons against france . 
  the us is the only country that has an arsenal large enough and delivery and defense mechanisms that might permit for [ first strike capability ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-emptive_nuclear_strike ) against russia :  in nuclear strategy , a first strike is a preemptive surprise attack employing overwhelming force . 
  first strike capability is a country 's ability to defeat another nuclear power by destroying its arsenal to the point where the attacking country can survive the weakened retaliation while the opposing side is left unable to continue war . 
  the preferred methodology is to attack the opponent 's strategic nuclear weapon facilities ( missile silos , submarine bases , bomber airfields ) , command and control sites , and storage depots first . 
  the strategy is called * counterforce * . 
  in practice , it is unlikely that either would touch off a nuclear war while other options remain , and plenty do . 
  why is that a concern for serbia ? 
  she 's not in the eu . 
   also , russia desperately needs sebastapol 's port , without it it 's economy would collapse having ports to use for trade is useful , sure . 
  russia has her own ports on the black sea , including [ novorossiysk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_novorossiysk ) . 
   this port was given to russia on a 10 years lease by ukraine it was leased to russia . 
  ukraine had been considering not allowing russia to renew the lease .

  stealth doctrine does n't involve being invisible , but in being able to see the other guy at ranges where he ca n't see you . 
  if you develop a radar better at picking out background noise , maybe increase detection ranges by 10 % , then that technology spreads around , and both sides can see each other a bit further away , but the stealthier aircraft still maintains an advantage . 
  the economic power gained was to the extent that people did n't leave . 
  and people are increasingly mobile today ... 
  germanic peoples came more from denmark and scandinavia . 
  turkic peoples came more from china . 
  both migrated ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_peoples  it is generally agreed that the first turkic people lived in a region extending from central asia to siberia , with the majority of them living in china historically . 
  historically they were established after the 6th century bce . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_peoples  archaeological and linguistic evidence from a period known as the nordic bronze age indicates that a common material culture existed between the germanic tribes that inherited the southern regions of scandinavia , along with the schleswig-holstein area and the area of what is now hamburg , germany . 
  [ 38 ] [ 3 ] additional archaeological remnants from the iron age society that once existed in nearby wessenstedt also show traces of this culture . 
  [ 2 ] exactly how these cultures interacted remains a mystery but the migrations of early proto-germanic peoples are discernible from the remaining evidence of prehistoric cultures in h\u00fcgelgr\u00e4ber , urnfield , and la tene . 
  climatic change between 850 bce to 760 bce in scandinavia and `` a later and more rapid one around 650 bce might have triggered migrations to the coast of eastern germany and further toward the vistula .

   according to the opinion polls getting more land from other countries is very popular among russians and stalin is the most popular historic figure . 
  it 's a dumb idea . 
  there 's not that much money in most land anymore . 
  russia has some of the [ most land per resident in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_territories_by_population_density ) and the most [ overall land in the world by far ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area ) . 
  if it 's not enough , it 's doubtful that a bunch more will solve much . 
  among the wealthy countries , an economy is mostly a function of the number of people you have and their skillset , not land . 
  the challenge is in getting and keeping them . 
  effective education , keeping birthrate sane , immigration . 
  it 's hard to keep people from leaving -- the soviet union tried to do it . 
  you probably need to make your country an appealing place to be .

   `` the effects of neutrality are everywhere around , '' said clive church , emeritus professor of european studies at the uk 's university of kent and author of several books on switzerland 's history and politics . 
  `` you tell me , '' he added , `` where is there bomb damage in any swiss city ? ''   the answer : nowhere . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombings_of_switzerland_in_world_war_ii#bombings  the daylight bombing of schaffhausen on 1 april 1944 by the united states army air forces ( usaaf ) was the most serious of all incidents . 
  approximately 50 b-24 liberators of a larger force misidentified schaffhausen as their target ludwigshafen am rhein near mannheim ( about 235 km north of schaffhausen ) , and dropped bombs that led to 40 fatalities , numerous injuries , and property damage . 
  at the insistence of the swiss government for an explanation , allied investigations into the incident found that bad weather broke up the american formation over france , and that high winds that nearly doubled the ground speed of the bombers confused the navigators . 
  ( two other widely scattered cities in germany and france were also mistakenly bombed during the same mission . ), 
  as schaffhausen is situated on the right bank ( north side ) of the rhine river , it was apparently assumed to be the german city . 
  by october 1944 , 4 million dollars had been paid in restitution . 
  -  on 22 february 1945 , thirteen usaaf air attacks took place with stein am rhein receiving the most damage . 
  other places included taegerwilen , rafz , and vals . 
  overall these attacks led to 21 fatalities . 
  -  on 4 march 1945 , six usaaf b-24h bombers hit zurich with 12.5 tons of high explosives and 12 tons of incendiaries resulting in five fatalities . 
  the intended target had been aschaffenburg near frankfurt am main ( 290 km north ) . 
  the six bombers had gone off course and believed they were bombing freiburg im breisgau . 
  at virtually the same time , other bombers dropped 12.5 tons of high explosives and five tons of incendiaries on basel . 
  -  during 1940 , minor attacks on geneva , renens , basel , and zurich were conducted by the royal air force . 
  [ 1 ] -  on 1 october 1943 , bombs were released by the usaaf over samedan leading to property damage . 
  1944 saw attacks that included koblenz , cornol , niederweningen , and thayngen . 
  attacks in 1945 included chiasso twice . 
  basel was bombed on 4 march 1945 . 
  the last air attack occurred in brusio on 16 april 1945 . 
  in the us , the president holds two positions combined , which are separated in many countries : first , the [ head of government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_of_government ) . 
  this is the decisionmaker role . 
  second , the [ head of state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_of_state ) . 
  this person is the face of the state . 
  there may be a number of reasons , and the wikipedia articles i linked go into detail , and i think that sometimes the head of state is cruft from a monarch being stripped of their real powers . 
  the point i find most compelling for a separation is that the head of government is inherently political . 
  he sets policy , and you may or may not like his policy . 
  if you do n't like his policy , shaking hands with him or having him conduct a ceremony is n't going to be as impressive . 
  for many americans , i think that having donald trump come to their birthday party would not be a plus . 
  the head of state is n't tied to policy in that way -- they can act as the likeable face of the country . 
  i think that most britons more-or-less like their queen and would be proud to have her visit them , even if they dislike may or corbyn . 
  because the united states does not have a separate person to identify with as a symbol of the country , i think that we usually use nonhuman symbols unusually heavily . 
  `` america '' is the flag , or a bald eagle , or the statue of liberty . 
  you can respect what they stand for whether you 're republican or democrat , green or libertarian . 
   and i 'm talking about a monarch like britain , where the monarch uses its `` power '' on the advice of the government britain 's theory of legal power is complicated compared to most countries . 
  i 'd say that it 's because of a * very * long-running institution of government with organic growth of things , plus what amounted to a very slow , still-ongoing revolution that took the uk from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional republic over hundreds of years . 
  some complicated legal contortion was required to justify some of the changes .
