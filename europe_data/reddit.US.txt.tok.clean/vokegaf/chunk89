  so what i 'm hearing is that the eu already has a company with expertise in immigration detention available ? 
  i am suspicious that price fixing is quite widespread in industries with a few large companies . 
  i 'd be interested in seeing better ways of dealing with it . 
  maybe statistical analysis , or requiring disclosure of input costs . 
  i think that he 's talking about citizenship , not race , though it 's certainly not very civil . 
  with the benefit of hindsight , knowing that hitler would engage in [ operation barbarossa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa ) and invade the ussr , it more-likely would have been ... but there was no way to know in advance whether this would have been the case . 
  remember that war plan rainbow four was made at a time when the [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) was in place and the ussr and nazi germany had just worked together to partition poland . 
  that eastern flank was , for all intents and purposes , secure in the near term in the world 's eyes . 
  finally , unless the us had a way to be certain of this , it would plan conservatively anyway -- the us was going to be fighting a war spanning most of the earth 's surface against the labor of rather larger populations , and it did n't have room for gambling wrong . 
  operation barbarossa 's surprise element was a complete success , causing even the soviets , who had the most interest and ability to pick up on it , to be entirely unprepared . 
  that was hardly something that the us could count on happening in the short term . 
   i agree that germany goal would be to seize naval asset , i just do n't think they would 've had any reasonable chance . 
  probably . 
  i 'm just saying that after a successful invasion of britain , nazi germany would have been able to exert a lot of pressure , and had been willing to do so to date in occupied territories where problems could n't be easily militarily-solved . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_punishment#by_germany  during the nazi occupation of poland , the germans applied collective responsibility : any kind of help given to a person of jewish faith or origin was punishable by death , and that not only for the rescuers but also for their families . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] this was widely publicized by the germans . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] during the occupation , for every german killed by a pole , 100 -- 400 poles were shot in retribution . 
  [ 11 ] communities were held collectively responsible for the purported polish counter-attacks against the invading german troops . 
  mass executions of roundup ( pol : \u0142apanka ) hostages were conducted every single day during the wehrmacht advance across poland in september 1939 and thereafter . 
  [ 12 ] poland lost over 5 million citizens during the occupation by nazi germany , mostly civilians . 
  [ 13 ]   germany also applied collective punishment elsewhere . 
  in the summer of 1941 , nazi troops executed several hundred people in kondomari , alikianos , kandanos and elsewhere in retaliation for the participation of cretan civilians in the battle of crete . 
  during its occupation by the axis from 1941 to 1944 , greece suffered a remarkably high death toll due to reprisals against the support and involvement of the population in the resistance . 
  large-scale massacres were carried out in places such as domeniko , kommeno , viannos , drakeia , kalavryta , mesovouno , distomo , kedros , chortiatis and many others . 
    in yugoslavia ( now serbia ) , nazi troops killed 434 men in three villages near kragujevac on october 19 , 1941 as punishment for previous actions of the serbian resistance movement . 
  in the next two days , the nazis also killed more than 13,000 people in kraljevo , kragujevac , and sumarice , including 300 students from kragujevac first high school . 
  in 1942 , the germans destroyed the village of lidice , czechoslovakia ( now the czech republic ) killing 340 inhabitants as collective punishment or reprisal for that year 's assassination of reinhard heydrich by nearby commandos ( the village le\u017e\u00e1ky was also destroyed in retribution ) . 
  in the french village of oradour-sur-glane 642 of its inhabitants -- men , women , and children -- were slaughtered by the german waffen-ss in 1944 . 
  [ 14 ] in the dutch village of putten [ 15 ] and the italian villages of sant ` anna di stazzema [ 16 ] and marzabotto , [ 17 ] as well as in the soviet village of kortelisy [ 18 ] ( in what is now ukraine ) , large-scale reprisal killings were carried out by the germans . 
  if nazi germany stated that they would make use of collective punishments in britain if royal navy ships were not surrendered , it 's not clear to me whether the remaining british authorities would see their primary obligation as being to the british civilian population under occupation or to maintaining the independence of the remaining fleet , with no clear way that it could be used to immediately protect the bulk of the british population . 
  it would certainly have been an unpleasant decision to make . 
  in any event , the us was going to make war plans using conservative assumptions . 
  if they did n't go as badly as had been planned for , great . 
  if they did , then at least things would n't fall apart . 
   this issue with the french navy is because there was concerns the french would n't scuttle their own ships , i do n't think that holds true with the royal navy , they would know the best chance for the uk is a weak germany navy . 
  sure . 
  but the french were n't dumb and were similarly aware of the consequences of the loss of the french fleet . 
  ordering the fleet destroyed immediately would still have given up one of their few remaining bargaining cards to use in their interests . 
   i do n't think it 's at all likely that germany would 've gone after america straight away and directly . 
  the usa was self sufficient and a huge arse country . 
  whilst it was n't at full military strength , on home ground it was more than a match for a nazi * expeditionary * force . 
  at most it would 've tried to set up a base in one of the more friendly south american countries . 
  yes . 
  but that 's also what the us would have sought to prevent : it would have shifted the conflict to a less-favorable one for the us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_offensive_plans_controversy  while most agree that stalin made extensive preparations for an eventual war and exploited the military conflict in europe to his advantage , the assertions that he planned to attack nazi germany in the summer of 1941 , and that barbarossa was a preemptive strike by adolf hitler , are generally discounted according to david m. 
  [ 1 ] however most historians agree that war between the soviet union and the axis was inevitable due to their vast ideological differences . 
   tbf there was never a risk of the royal navy falling into german hands . 
  possibly . 
  i do n't onow what german war plans subsequent to a successful [ operation sealion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_sea_lion ) would have looked like , but germany 's best bet at knocking the us out would have been in acquiring those fleets and using them as quickly as possible to impose blockade and establish a beachhead in the americas , before it turned into an industrial race . 
  germany would be in a strong position to exert pressure on the uk -- control of the fleet would have been a major bargaining chip that the uk could have used in negotiations . 
  british concerns about the french fleet were similar to those of the us vis-a-vis the british and french fleets -- that they could be quickly used against the uk , where naval dominance against germany was essential to blocking a german invasion of the british isles , with the british [ attack on mers-el-k\u00e9bir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attack_on_mers-el-k%c3%a9bir ) against the french fleet after the franco-british loss in the [ battle of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_france ) aiming to secure that continued balance of power . 
  note that two years later , when germany invaded vichy france , an aim was in acquiring the french fleet there . 
  germany came extremely close to [ capturing the french fleet in operation lila ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scuttling_of_the_french_fleet_in_toulon#operation_lila ) , and it was only due to quick action on their own initiative by french naval officers and a few small errors in the german operation that led to vichy france sending part of her fleet abroad and mostly scuttling it . 
  in some cases , the french were still scuttling while german troops had seized control of the ship . 
  hmmm . 
  i was going to say that that looks pretty old , but this is current and shows the same trend : http://lenews.ch/2017/03/27/most-swiss-support-eu-agreements-says-poll/  only 15 % think switzerland should join the eu . 
  it 's spelled `` ominious '' .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ex_post_facto_law  retroactive application of law is prohibited by the article 3 of the polish civil code , and the legal rule prohibiting such retroactive application is commonly memorised as a latin sentence lex retro non agit ( `` a law does not apply retroactively '' ) . 
  the said article , however , allows retroactive application of an act of parliament if it is expressly understood from its text or purpose . 
  now , of course , when it comes to retroactively changing interpretation of eu tax law , there seems to be more enthusiasm ... 
  [ continued from parent ] so in effect , you have : * us seizes , allies with , or controls pretty much everything in the western hemisphere as quickly as possible , aiming to lock down the ocean around it . 
  * us plans for massive industrial race/naval war with the axis . 
  * germany takes europe , including iceland . 
  * japan takes her planned empire , including the us territories of the phillippines and guam , which the us does not intend to try to hold in the short term . 
  * the us tries to keep japan from fighting the us for as long as possible . 
  * the ussr is expected to be unfriendly to japan and the us , but not actually at war . 
  * the us aims to steadily spread naval control across the pacific and atlantic , with an ultimate goal of landing in western africa ( just guessing : i assume that this would be difficult for germany and italy to attack without naval control , and would provide a land base across the atlantic . ), 
  [ continued from parent ]  the `` concept of war '' established by u.s. war planners declared that hostilities with the, 
  [ continued from parent ] http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1133&amp;context=masters  concluded in 1940 , rainbow four presumed that great britain and france had already, 
  today , the us has a large web of international alliances and the greatest degree of global involvement of any country in the world . 
  however , for most of her history , the us was quite isolationist . 
  it was the progress of world war ii , during 1940 , that produced that radical switch , and the question of whether-or-not to support the united kingdom . 
  it was during 1940 that us analysis of the evolving situation concluded that : * the uk could not defeat the axis in europe without support . 
  * the uk falling would move the us to a defensive position , likely needing to fight the remainder of the war herself . 
  by late 1940 , the us -- though still technically neutral -- had committed to a goal of the axis falling , the uk not falling , and thus us involvement to greater or lesser degree . 
  what wound up happening was in good part , activation of [ war plan orange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_plan_orange ) in the pacific as a secondary priority and war plan rainbow five ( take on germany with remaining allies in europe ) as a top priority . 
  however , before that , in early 1940 , us noninvolvement had still been possible , and the us had no alliances or commitments in place . 
  prior to the us deciding to support the uk , if the uk had surrendered the royal navy and the isle of great britain to germany , this would have made the resources and fleet capabilities of the european naval powers available to nazi germany . 
  the us response would have been activation of war plan rainbow four . 
  this would have started industrial and military mobilization , aiming to place the us in a race to build naval power against the axis , with the us locking down the western hemisphere , and using increasing naval pressure to seek favorable terms . 
  all european possessions in the western hemisphere would have been seized and political control established over the americas to cut communication with the old world and block any form of coordination to build up an axis landing in the americas that would permit the axis to fight anything other than a naval war . 
  the goal would have been to force the war to be naval , which would maximize us military clout -- the us could probably outbuild in an extended naval war . 
  depending upon progress of the naval race , any us landings , establishing land control on the other side of the atlantic , would have been ultimately aimed at western africa . 
  [ plan follows in child ], 
  french guiana is really having a tough run of it in this thread . 
  i doubt that switzerland will never join . 
  the programs she is a part if encourage her to do so ... 
   this includes * all kinds * of sexual crimes , from exhibitionism , child porn , rape and even groping . 
  * hopeful * maybe americans are just really exhibitionist in germany . 
   after the police takes up the case they hand them over to u.s. military police and you never hear from it again . 
  sure , they may face disciplinary action , but you 'll never know . 
  i think that very few members of the military are ignoring the prospect of a peacetime court martial . 
  us military sentences are not gentle compared to german civilian sentences , and [ the ucmj specifies up to a death sentence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uniform_code_of_military_justice ) for rape -- a life sentence or merely many years in prison might also be imposed . 
  in fact , the last time the us military executed someone , it was for a rape and attempted murder in austria : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_a._bennett  bennett was born in virginia to a family of african-american sharecroppers . 
  he was epileptic , but managed to enlist in the u.s. army when he was 18 . 
  [ 1 ] days before christmas 1954 , [ 2 ] a heavily intoxicated bennett left his base to find a brothel , but chanced upon an 11-year-old austrian girl . 
  [ 1 ] he raped her in a meadow and tried to drown her . 
  [ 3 ] he was soon arrested , tried and convicted by a court-martial of first degree child rape and attempted first degree murder one month later and sentenced to death four times .
