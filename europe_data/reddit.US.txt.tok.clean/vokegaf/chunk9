  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/mechanized-juggernaut-military-anachronism-stackpole/dp/0811735036 ) the italians had a major [ successful world war ii cavalry charge against the soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charge_of_the_savoia_cavalleria_at_izbushensky ) -- sabres and all -- that will probably be the final significant cavalry charge in human history , barring a collapse of civilization or something . 
  there was also an earlier less-successful-but-ballsy [ italian cavalry flank attack on a column of british armored vehicles in africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amedeo_guillet ) . 
  the us had already had the [ patton sabre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/model_1913_cavalry_saber ) retired from its cavalry by world war ii , and had retired much of its horse-mounted cavalry , but did manage a minor cavalry charge [ using pistols ] ( http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/charge-philippine-scouts-last-horse-cavalry-charge-u-s-army/ ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horses_in_world_war_ii the major problem with using horses for hauling is mostly that the fuel -- grain , hay , whatever -- is very bulky . 
  so much so , that as supply lines lengthen , more-and-more of the supply line 's capacity goes to simply hauling fodder for the horses that are powering the line . 
  eventually , there 's a maximum length that can be maintained . 
  especially in mud , there were real limitations on how far an army could operate -- the us in the 1865 american civil war was constrained , as well as germany in the world war ii operation barbarossa . 
  gasoline or diesel , on the other hand , are much less bulky , and so moving to a vehicle that can use them greatly reduces restrictions on supply line length and capacity . 
  if you could move to powered vehicles , you probably wanted to do so . 
  [ politifact ] ( http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jun/13/ken-paxton/us-army-was-smaller-army-portugal-world-war-ii/ ) :  some online searching led us to the army 's compilation of gen. george c. marshall 's reports on the army 's progress during the war , covering july 1939 through june 1945 . 
  marshall , who was later secretary of state , was the army 's chief of staff . 
  the foreword says : `` for the feat of transforming the miniscule interwar army to the great force that defeated the axis in africa , europe , the pacific , and asia , no one could claim more credit than marshall . 
  when he took office , the 174,000-man u.s. army ranked nineteenth in size in the world , behind portugal and only slightly ahead of bulgaria . 
  its half-strength divisions were scattered among numerous posts , its equipment obsolete , its reliance on the horse increasingly anachronistic . '', 
    we also reached out to the u.s army center of military history at fort mcnair in washington , d.c. by email , the center 's james tobias provided a document tallying active-duty u.s. army soldiers year by year from 1930 into 2011 . 
  according to the document , there were 187,893 active-duty army soldiers as of june 30 , 1939 ; the army ballooned to nearly 8.3 million active-duty soldiers , its record high , by the end of may 1945 . 
    our ruling   paxton told delegates : `` at the beginning of world war ii , we had a relatively small army , smaller than portugal 's . '', 
    the u.s. army was relatively small at the war 's outset and the army itself has said the army was smaller than the army for portugal . 
  we rate this statement as true . 
    true -- the statement is accurate and there 's nothing significant missing . 
  that 's the way * the express * tells the story .

  * france has a larger exclusive economic zone ( the area up to 200 nautical miles offshore ) than any other country on the planet . 
  * in 1939 , before world war ii kicked off , portugal had a larger army than the united states did . 
  * san marino had been around for three centuries by the time islam arose . 
  * europe has almost exactly the same amount of area as canada , and is less than 60 % of russia 's area .

  religious people are the primary driver for homeschooling today , and that 's got healthy support . 
  i bet that it would do just fine if it came up in court again . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homeschooling_in_the_united_states  from 2003 to 2007 , the percentage of students whose parents reported homeschooling to provide religious or moral instruction increased from 72 percent to 83 percent . 
  in 2007 , the most common reason parents gave as the most important was a desire to provide religious or moral instruction ( 36 percent of students ) . 
  typically the religious belief being represented is evangelical christian . 
  -  since the late 1980s , the focus on the legality of homeschooling in general is no longer in serious debate ...

   religious freedom should n't mean that religious people have more rights than unreligious ones . 
  hmm . 
  in the us , it does . 
  the amish do n't have to pay into social security ( and can not collect from it ) . 
  some native americans can use normally-illegal-for-everyone-else psychoactive drugs that were historically used in shamanism . 
  until the conscientious objector ( `` will not fight in war '' ) status was broadened , it was a religious exception , so people like the quakers and similar religions were the only ones that it was applicable to . 
  sikhs are among the very few groups that can deviate from us military uniform requirements . 
  by doing so , it avoids placing the state in a position of fighting a religion . 
  to the greatest extent possible , the state will seek to accomodate real religious beliefs . 
  because religion can strongly-motivate people , it avoids fighting a bunch of fanatics over things . 
  can it be abused ? 
  sure . 
  but the state can also seek to remedy that -- conscientious objectors might be subject to doing things even more-expensive or dangerous than fighting on the front line , for example . 
  i suppose that maybe one might argue that we live in a more-secular world , and that there is a miniscule number of people who honestly do things for religious reasons today . 
  not sure . 
  if so , i suppose that that might be an argument in favor of removing such religious freedoms . 
  certainly the decision to extend those freedoms was made in a time when religion was more-influential . 
  i would add that i do not think that , in practice , extending such rights has caused any significant problems , whereas historically attempting * not * to do so has tended to cause quite a bit of friction . 
  yes , it would be , because lisbon i mandating that the eu accede to the echr is the only reason that the echr need have any authority in the eu whatsoever . 
  eu members are free to limit or remove that authority wrt the eu through follow-up treaties , and without that , italy can freely choose to not permit the echr jurisdiction over its actions in international waters , specifically over the question of non-refoulement , or simply to entirely remove echr jurisdiction over italy . 
  it may be that you * want * the echr or non-refoulement interpretation . 
  it may even be a * good * interpretation , and worth any costs imposed . 
  but one can not use the `` it can not be done , because some higher authority binds our hands from acting '' excuse , because that is not the case . 
  i think that the echr adopting an interpretation that is in line with that of some other countries is probably a lot more likely . 
  it would also presumably be possible for a lisbon ii to limit the areas over which echr may have authority . 
  it is , after all , only the will of eu members that extended that authority . 
  if the effect of doing so is really damaging to the eu , that authority could be removed . 
  some years back , the us granted the international court of justice compulsory authority over itself . 
  it turned out that this caused problems for the us -- granting jurisdiction had been a mistake . 
  so the us withdrew its grant of that jurisdiction to the icj . 
  now the us opts in on a case-by-case basis to permit the icj jurisdiction on issues involving the us . 
  it 's possible that the italy echr ruling was a major portion of what let the migrant crisis get underway . 
  that in turn may very well be what tipped the scales in terms of brexit . 
  that 's a serious matter . 
  courts and laws are n't chains to weigh down countries . 
  they 're tools to let them work well . 
  in all fairness , i believe that it 's mostly infantry weapons from europe , like the swedish at-4 or the beretta , not things like warships . 
  similarly , european countries tend to source domestically . 
  afghanistan was in response to 9/11 . 
  that was in north america . 
  i think that if the uncivil bits of this post were excised , that it 'd be a lot more interesting . 
   the uk leaving the eu will have no negative impact on the eu 's military capabilities because the eu does n't have any military capabilities . 
  `` eu '' here refers to collective capability among eu members . 
   `` it is no longer sustainable for the us to maintain a disproportionate share of nato 's defense expenditures , '' tillerson told the foreign ministers gathered in brussels . 
  warns that the us does n't intend to do so . 
   the leading dutch gay rights organisation , the coc , heh . 
  this some new project ? 
  my point is that if the echr were to adopt a different interpretation , people could be intercepted at sea and returned without needing to split with international law . 
  concern over what turkey might do seems to me to be rather more of a greek issue than a british one . 
  why would the us push for the eu to dangle a never-ending secession thing up ? 
  first , it 's doubtful that the us has much direct clout on the decision to extend or retract an offer . 
  second , i suspect that the main concern that the us and turkey have as regards each other is military , and nato already covers that for both . 
  well , an echr interpretation of international law that is not universally shared . 
   political class politicians are n't a class . 
   remember when euro would work just smoothly and those pesky american and british monetary economists with nobel prizes like milton friedman were just mad ? 
  i am not familiar with the original rationale for the euro , but my guess is that there are several factors . 
  one article that i 've read was defending it on political grounds -- that the political benefits of it outweigh any economic imperfections . 
  as i understand it , the united states is not a single optimum currency area itself , even if it 's closer to it than the eu . 
  i also do n't know how much oca models take into account long-term shifts produced by use of a common currency . 
  it may be that greater social interconnection and wealth convergence is facilitated by having one currency and a low barrier to interchange , and that this itself makes use of a single currency more viable .
