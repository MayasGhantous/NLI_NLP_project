  what are they agreeing to , how much data are they sharing , and what license are they giving to providers ? 
  our experiment shows it 's all too easy to tick a box and consent to something unfair . '' no . 
  no , that 's not really the issue . 
  the issue is that eulas exist in the first place . 
  contracts are important . 
  we should not get rid of them . 
  they permit for people to agree to a legally-binding custom set of rules . 
  however , the real issue is that it 's completely impractical for people to be doing that on a day-to-day basis , like every time they go to the store and buy something . 
  and so , we have a set of laws -- [ consumer protection law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consumer_protection ) , and [ all sorts of other established legal convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-sale_doctrine ) -- that govern purchasing something . 
  that way , when someone buys a stick of gum , they do n't need to do legal analysis . 
  due to the specialized knowledge required and the overhead involved , my belief is that the typical individual should essentially never need to sign a contract . 
  common times when this happens ( at least in the us ) are : * [ eulas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/end-user_license_agreement ) , like this one . 
  * [ leases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lease ) * [ mortgages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mortgage_loan ) * cell phone plans * [ employment contract ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/employment_contract ) * [ cc&r s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/covenant_%28law%29 ) , the basis of the [ homeowner 's association ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homeowner_association ) ( hoa ) my suspicion is that 99 % of the time , there 's no * real * need for a custom contract , and so on most or all of these , people simply assume that the company across the table is reputable and signs off on whatever goes in front of them . 
  this is a crummy situation . 
  it 's crummy because companies pay lawyers a lot of money to go produce what are often more-or-less boilerplate documents . 
  if there 's a concern , it 's often a concern that affects multiple companies . 
  it 's crummy because people are taking on unknown legal obligations . 
  this is so one-sided that in situations where these [ contracts of adhesion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_form_contract ) exist , courts have found to various degrees that some things done -- are not binding on the party signing . 
  if something is completely unreasonable , it will simply be ignored , for example . 
  while this helps address the situation , in my eyes this is a bad patch on the problem . 
  it 's crummy because sometimes contracts of adhesion have terms that are objectionable and simply nullified . 
  in r&d jobs , for example , it 's common for an employment contract to grant an employer copyright of * everything you create * , at work or not , to try to weaken an employee 's grounds for stealing some sort of technology . 
  in california , employment law simply invalidates such clauses . 
  this is not applied evenly across states , and i 'm sure is not applied evenly across countries in the eu . 
  it 's crummy because it results in a lot of cruft and overhead . 
  if there was some unreasonable court case where a plaintiff successfully extracted a lot of money seventy years ago ( `` i could n't possibly know that this dog collar was not intended to be edible and require damages to be paid me !, 
  '' ) , contracts will attach some text to try to undermine future attempts along these lines . 
  this list only gets larger . 
  it 's crummy because lawyers rip off each others ' work . 
  i remember reading some amusing work where eulas -- intended to protect rights predicated on copyright -- often contained copyright-infringing text from other licenses that the lawyer writing the thing put in place . 
  it 's crummy because cc&r s can create unique and hellish legal situations long down the road . 
  to make up an example , because of concerns about noise created by mill wheels two hundred years ago , nobody can have a structure involved in a commercial enterprise on their property within n feet of the riverbank ... and it 's hard to get these terms eliminated on all properties , unlike with , say , local legal regulations . 
  it 's crummy because people have to work out how various licenses interact . 
  in this sense , standard open-source software licenses have partially-alleviated some of the pain . 
  a company 's lawyers can say in advance `` software under license x is permissible for use in our product . 
  software under license y is not permissible for use in our product . '', 
  if every software product had its own custom license , this becomes impossible . 
  even dealing with , say , five open source licenses is vastly-better than dealing with the custom license attached to every proprietary piece of software . 
  i am sympathetic that legislation is slow and takes a while to adapt to the real world , and may not adapt well to the unique and special ( often not as unique and special as a company might let on ) status of a company . 
  letting a company 's lawyers deal with it with terms in a contract permits for more agility than trying to write everything into law . 
  but what is happening now is just horrendous . 
  here are a few possibilities that i 've thought about before : * for areas in which contract-signing is normal , the state pays lawyers to come up with a `` model contract '' ( like a [ model law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uniform_act#non-nccusl_model_laws ) , a us way of standardizing non-federal law ) and make it available under a license such that companies can simply reference it as `` model mortgage contract v 2.1 '' . 
  this will be significantly-cheaper than paying lawyers on an in-house basis , and that may be enough incentive to get companies to use it . 
  * the same as the above , but with added legal benefits provided to the company in question -- for example , if a company produces their own contract , requiring the consumer to pass a state-designed quiz using a random selection of questions from a pool at the end to ensure that the consumer understands the contract being signed -- or the contract is invalid . 
  if they do n't understand their mortgage , it 's another 30 days until you can try again . 
  * creating some sort of incentive to encourage the adoption of contracts created in the private industry , the way open-source licenses have been in the software world . 
  if there were , say , five standard mortgage contracts , it 'd be vastly easier to write about them and provide guides to them and to address flaws in them . 
   so when you have a government that has a direct stake in its national carrier , its naive to think there wont be political implications .

  [ high-priced art works beautifully for money laundering ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no._6_%28violet,_green_and_red%29 ) due to the subjective value of artwork :  it was bought for $ 140 million by dmitry rybolovlev , in a private sale .

  but when someone sells an artwork at auction -- even something worth $ 100 million , much more than your house -- the identity is typically concealed . 
    oh , the paperwork might identify the work as coming from `` a european collection . '' but the buyer usually has no clue with whom he or she is really dealing .

  the model they 're using was probably not created before 1972 . 
  that means that they could have built it using data up until today . 
  they could easily have a model that [ overfits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overfitting ) past occurrences . 
  to put in simple terms : let 's say that my basketball team wins the championship three times in the past hundred years . 
  after the fact , i go start mining data , looking through many correlations , and discover that in every year when they won and * only * those years , all three of the following things were true : * milk prices were higher at the end of january of the year than the end of february of the year . 
  * the last two digits of the year were a prime number . 
  * the country was not at war . 
  so i make a model based on that . 
  my model has a * perfect prediction * rate -- it predicts all past years in which my basketball team won and all past years where it did not win . 
  is the model likely to work well in predicting future baskeball wins ? 
  nope , probably not . 
  that 's because if i just look at enough data , i 'm going to find * some * combination of events that can predict past wins , just out of sheer probability . 
  the model is looking at useless data , noise , but it 's still spitting out correct results . 
  the only real test of my model is if i narrow it down to , say , one model and then without revising it , see if it correctly predicts championship wins over decades of years of data that i * did n't * use in creating the model . 
  we 've no way of knowing to what degree , if at all , this model was tested in that manner .
