  i do n't know whether there are any vpns that attempt to be resistant to traffic analysis in just exposing their presence today . 
  [ tor -- well , not a vpn , but same idea -- does n't ] ( http://www.netresec.com/?page=blog&amp;month=2013-04&amp;post=detecting-tor-communication-in-network-traffic ) . 
  but i could believe that there will be . 
  well , i can guess at some reasons . 
  say you want to replicate something of the `` blank slate '' that people could get at one point . 
  go back before the internet was everywhere , and if someone showed up in town , unless you really went out of your way to try to find out something about them , you did n't know anything about them . 
  no matter what happens , someone * could * kinda go start over somewhere else . 
  now , you 've got facial identification software and the ability to search people 's names and all sorts of things making it easy for anyone you know to tie you to your whole past . 
  maybe that 's good , maybe that 's bad ... but i can at least understand * wanting * to retain the ability to wipe the slate clean . 
  so people make [ steganographic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steganography ) vpns . 
   do n't you think that as a citizen of a country , you should speak at least one of the official languages ? 
  would be hard in bangladesh , japan , tajikistan , tunesia , turkmenistan , uzbekistan , or the united states . 
  your partners are still going to be next door tomorrow . 
  if your response is `` screw you , we wo n't work together '' , then you 've just closed doors . 
  if the response is `` this is a concern to us , and we want to make sure it does n't happen again . 
  let 's agree that we 're worse-off divided . 
  can we collaborate in such a way that it does n't happen again ? '', 
  then it can be water under the bridge . 
  as long as there are mutual gains inherent in collaboration -- and i think that there can be -- then i do n't think thatthis is a good idea to give up on . 
  what if there were an eu level organization tasked with vetting commercial deals of greater than some amount in russia ? 
  i do n't really think that the mh17 situation involved the eu being deeply harmed much . 
  russia did n't pay compensation to survivors , but the [ kal-007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) shootdown ( which was much more justified ) never had the soviet union pay compensation to survivors here either . 
  the reason mh17 was in the media so much was n't because of the grave harm caused , but because it punched a unpatchable hole in the russian cover story that russia 's military was not involved in ukraine . 
  that is , it was important not so much because of the shootdown itself but because in the propaganda fight , it was embarassing to russia . 
  russia was trying very hard to sell this as an internal revolt by ukrainians , both in russia and elsewhere . 
  i do not think that russia ignores the eu . 
  trade with the eu is extremely important to russia . 
  i think that there are things that the eu could do to strengthen its position , like having a single figure negotiate rather than many individually . 
  but i do n't think that the eu is considered ignorable by russian leadership . 
  i do n't really agree with the article 's premise of weakness , at least in most respects . 
   while the us and australia rightly pointed at putin and the filthy war the russian dictator had started in ukraine , european leaders treated the event like it was a regular murder case . 
  ` anybody could be behind this , we must not jump to conclusions ' , seemed to be their message . 
  there may be excellent reasons to operate as a tight bloc , but this is n't one . 
  australia is 24m people . 
  it 's not an issue of scale : if australia is big enough to do something , so can any one of germany , turkey , france , the uk , italy , spain , ukraine ( well , okay , ukraine sure did ) , or poland . 
  because google and major search engines have a business presence in the eu and thus the eu has jurisdiction and can impose penalties . 
  i suspect that this sort of thing is going to result in legal structures where mncs just own european subsidiaries to sandbox the portion of the company that can be affected if it becomes a major problem . 
  google ag or whatever would only handle payment processing and have no control over the search engine 's database . 
  but the eu can certainly try it . 
  at the end of the day , we do n't know how the internet will work out . 
  there are conflicting social norms , legal codes , wishes about information control , and all that , and some sort of meeting point has to be devised . 
  if this does n't get hashed out over this , it 'll be over some similar information law . 
  was gon na happen sooner or later . 
  might as well be on this . 
   what on earth could make someone think they have such a right ? 
  the right to make us forget things ? 
  well , any legal system can establish such a legal right . 
  the eu has chosen to create this . 
  i think that it has possibly insurmountable enforcibility issues as well as questions of jurisdiction . 
  but ... well , the eu is entitled to try to create such a thing . 
   the palestians are ruled by terrorists or `` former '' terrorists netanyahu is likud . 
  likud came from [ irgun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irgun ) , which was a terrorist organization . 
  [ begin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/menachem_begin ) led irgun , created likud , and became pm . 
  there are a lot of bloody hands in the levant ... 
   i 'm sorry but the moment the uk said `` no customs union '' it pretty much shot up and killed any supposed `` no border '' plan that it `` agreed '' with ireland . 
  it 's still gon na be an eu problem , not a uk one . 
  the state that someone is * entering * does customs controls . 
  as long as the uk has an across-the-board lower tariff schedule than the eu ( which i assume it will or can ) , it can say `` we do n't need customs being performed at the border '' . 
  ireland definitely does not want a border . 
  but unless the eu is going to ignore smuggling , it is going to need customs at the border . 
  otherwise , someone can import into the uk at the uk 's tariff schedule ( possibly zero on us goods , if the uk and us have an fta , for example ) , and then any person crossing into the roi can illegally import those goods into the eu . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_europe  according to eurobarometer ( 2013 ) , 69 % of citizens of the eu are in favour of direct elections of the president of the european commission ; 46 % are supporting the creation of a united eu army . 
  [ 28 ]   two thirds of respondents think that the eu ( instead of a national government alone ) , should make decisions on foreign policy . 
  more than half of respondents think that the eu should also make decisions on defense . 
  [ 29 ]   ** 44 % of respondents support the future development of the european union as a federation of nation states , 35 % are opposed . 
  ** the nordic countries were the most negative of a united europe in this study . 
  73 % of the nordics opposed the idea . 
  [ 30 ] a large majority of the people for whom the eu conjures up a positive image support the further development of the eu into a federation of nation states ( 56 % versus 27 % ) . 
   france , germany , sweden and other countries should and are free to act as they see fit , but they should n't dictate immigration policies from outside eu to any other country . 
  i do n't know whether i agree . 
  if you have freedom of movement * and * no influence on anyone else 's immigration policy , any one country can dump gobs of people into your country , with you having no control over it . 
  also any expats generate economic activity . 
  source ? 
  if the uk * were n't * , she 'd have a low tfr , like the rest of you . 
   polish people in the uk are probably younger than the general population back home . 
  younger people have children . 
  tfr compensates for age and is n't affected by that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/total_fertility_rate  the total fertility rate ( tfr ) , sometimes also called the fertility rate , absolute/potential natality , period total fertility rate ( ptfr ) or total period fertility rate ( tpfr ) of a population is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if :  * she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates ( asfrs ) through her lifetime , and   * she were to survive from birth through the end of her reproductive life . 
  [ 1 ]   it is obtained by summing the single-year age-specific rates at a given time . 
  so , basically , tfr is expecting each n women of age a in the country to have m children , and the m is n't fixed across age . 
  ( loftily ) not all countries can enjoy enhanced staying power . 
  we do n't do it for superstitious reasons . 
  we do it for tradition , and originally because males had this unhygienic tendency to * masturbate * that needed to be curbed .

  also , the sea level in the baltic sea will rise and the winter ice cover will reduce . 
  projections indicate that finland 's climate would change more in winter than in summer . 
    finland 's climate will change more in winter than in summer   in future , the average temperature in finland will rise more [ 1 ] and faster than the global average [ 2 ] . 
  in addition to warming , precipitation is estimated to increase . 
  the changes will affect winters more than summers [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] . 
  the following changes are expected to occur in finland 's climate :   temperature will rise   * the winter temperatures in particular will rise [ 2 ] . 
   * warming will be fastest in northern finland [ 3 ] . 
   * very low temperatures seem to become rarer . 
   * heat wave periods will probably become more common and last longer . 
   * the highest temperatures will probably rise . 
  [ 4 ] , [ 5 ]  * the growing season will become longer and warmer [ 2 ] . 
    precipitation will increase   * particularly in the winter half of the year , precipitation will increase [ 3 ] , [ 1 ] and it will more often fall down as rain rather than as snow [ 4 ] . 
   * heavy rain events are assumed to become more intense , and the change than average rainfall . 
   * the longest dry periods in winter and spring will become somewhat shorter [ 4 ] . 
    storm winds will change   * average wind conditions are not expected to change much [ 6 ] , [ 1 ] . 
   * storm winds are expected to increase over finnish sea areas and the coastline .
