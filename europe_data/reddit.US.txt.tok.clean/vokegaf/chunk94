  according to rcp4 .5 scenario storm winds will increase most probably near the southern and western coastline since storm winds are projected to increase over gulf of finland , baltic sea and sea of bothnia . 
  according rcp8 .5 scenario storm winds may increase over all finnish sea areas and also southern and central part of the country reaching southern lapland . 
  [ 7 ] , [ 8 ]  * climate change projection gain more support from the most recent research about past storms in europe . 
  the catastrophic storms when investigated over the period of 1951 -- 2010 have changed remarkably since 1990 which represents a change point in the storm series . 
  nearly all of the most catastrophic storms have occurred after year 1990 in an area that covers western , central and northern europe . 
  [ 9 ]   snow cover and soil frost will reduce   * the snow cover period will become shorter . 
   * the water equivalent of snow and snow depth will decrease . 
   * the amount of soil frost will reduce . 
  [ 4 ] , [ 5 ]  * during mild and rainy winters , the ground will often be wet and its carrying capacity reduced [ 10 ] . 
    cloud cover will increase and sunshine will decrease   * winters will become cloudier and there will be less sunshine [ 1 ] . 
   * in summer cloud cover is likely to remain largely unchanged or sunshine to become slightly more common . 
  [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ]   sea level in the baltic sea will rise and the winter ice cover will reduce   * water level in the gulf of finland may begin to rise and in the gulf of bothnia the sea will recede slower than before [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] . 
   * winter ice cover in the baltic sea will reduce and become thinner [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] . 
  obviously , could be revised still . 
  california was supposed to get drier for the past twenty years of models and now i understand that it 's supposed to get significantly wetter ( and newer models are apparently increasing precipitation predictions globally ) . 
   they want to be pushed by eu into a second-level eu . 
  hmm . 
  how would this level differ from the current eu status ? 
   pis electorate is 50 + years old that say that communism was better < doubtfully  for * poland * ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_poland  since 1990 poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization and its economy was the only one in the eu to avoid a recession through the 2008-2009 economic downturn . 
  in all , as of 2017 the polish economy has been growing steadily for the past 26 years , a record high in the eu . 
  such growth has been exponential , with gdp per capita at purchasing power parity growing on average by 6 % p.a. 
  over the last 20 years , the most impressive performance in central europe . 
  i mean , okay , with russians , i can see it , because things sucked for them . 
  but poles ? 
   and nobody wants fucking turkey in eu . 
  well ... liberal turks ... though i guess they 've got bigger problems at the moment ...

    88 ) get rid of the h-1b visa program because it 's `` very , very bad '' for american workers . 
  ... etc, 
  no large-scale immigration into georgia . 
  does n't matter who or what it is , have large numbers of a group immigrate into an area and compete for jobs , and you get racism for a generation . 
  and every single other ethnic group during large immigration waves !, 
  ireland and scandinavia are pretty pasty white . 
  the aryan romani were awkward !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porajmos  the nazis established the racial hygiene and demographic biology research unit ( rassenhygienische und bev\u00f6lkerungsbiologische forschungsstelle , department l3 of the reich department of health ) in 1936 . 
  headed by dr. robert ritter and his assistant eva justin , this unit was mandated to conduct an in-depth study of the `` gypsy question ( zigeunerfrage ) '' and to provide data required for formulating a new reich `` gypsy law '' . 
  after extensive fieldwork in the spring of 1936 , consisting of interviews and medical examinations to determine the racial classification of the roma , the unit determined that most romani , whom they had concluded were not of `` pure gypsy blood '' , posed a danger to german racial purity and should be deported or eliminated . 
  sucks when you are n't gypsy enough !, 
   10b-5 ... [ 10b-5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sec_rule_10b-5 ) ? 
  you 're a finance dude , right ? 
  you thinking [ h-1b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h-1b_visa ) ? 
  because if so , i think that the criteria for h-1b are bullshit -- `` ca n't find an american to do the job '' is meaningless , as you can always hire * someone * at some wage level , yank 'em from another job -- and present only so that it could be passed and were always intended to be ignored ... but that having a skilled work visa where those criteria do n't exist * should * be the norm . 
  jobs , dude . 
   in america , poc absolutely do live in fear day to day .

   decimated europe given that that represents the death of ten percent of the population , in some countries ... [ yes ] ( http://topforeignstocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/world-war-ii-death-toll-by-country.jpg ) . 
  and that 's not even counting [ various ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_purge ) kinds of [ prewar deaths ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_famine_of_1932%e2%80%9333 ) or postwar deaths . 
   i was under the impression that railway companies make most of their money with freight transport and hyperloop is supposed to be passenger-only . 
  musk was proposing the hyperloop in the us as a replacement for a [ proposed chunk of rail in california ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/california_high-speed_rail ) . 
  the rail will cost about as much as air travel , but be significantly slower . 
  also , rail is mostly slow freight in the us and canada and mostly fast passenger in europe . 
  http://www.economist.com/node/16636101  america 's railways are the mirror image of europe 's . 
  europe has an impressive and growing network of high-speed passenger links , many of them international , like the thalys service between paris and brussels or the eurostar connecting london to the french and belgian capitals ... amtrak 's passenger services are sparse compared with europe 's . 
  but america 's freight railways are one of the unsung transport successes of the past 30 years . 
  they are universally recognised in the industry as the best in the world . 
   the us is only a more developed and democratic russia um . 
   dispute ? 
  it 's an island fit for birds at max .

   hyperloop is an `` answer '' to us 's lack of interest in high-speed trains trains in general . 
  trains make sense when you have high population density ( higher capacity , less congestion ) and short-enough runs that airplanes do n't become preferable . 
  cars are preferred by a lot of people ( go directly wherever you want , privacy , etc ) . 
  planes for long-distance travel . 
  the only places where [ commuter rail ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commuter_rail ) gets much serious use is along the [ northeast corridor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northeast_corridor ) . 
  we have only a single city where [ most households do not own at least one car ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._cities_with_most_households_without_a_car ) . 
  [ compare europe and the us on population density ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:world_population_density_1994_-_with_equator.png#mw-jump-to-license ) . 
  it 's only a small area around new york city that 's on par with europe in population density . 
  thanks , but what about czechia ? 
   what does that have to do with what i just said ? 
  for the foreseeable future , the defense and security concern in europe is in the east . 
  / u/pindar _ mc proposed removing all british military support , and you said that that was incredibly stupid . 
  my point is that while i agree that i think that it 's not a very sensible opinion , it 's already what ireland 's been doing . 
  it 's just that the uk has been doing it in the past , so there 's amperhaps a sense that the uk is expected to keep doing it . 
  true , ireland 's only five million , but if you simply take a map of the eu and draw lines on top of it and say `` no one piece here is very large , so there 's no real point in any one country doing anything , as in isolation they would n't amount to that much , somehow with no material change , the entire eu is considered toothless . 
  it 'd be as easy to draw lines on a map of the us , but somehow people do n't do that ... and , yes , ireland 's neutral . 
  but that 's no law of nature , but a position that ireland chose to adopt . 
  finally ... i do n't have any way to prove it , but i do think that it has an effect . 
  i know that i 've heard some guy on here ( italian or dutch , i think ) say that he felt that it was completely unreasonable for him to be obliged to maybe die for finland 's good when finland did n't need to lift a finger in return , because of their exemption due to constitutional neutrality . 
  now , obviously the eu did n't force the issue -- there 's a hesitancy to tangle with constitutions . 
  so there 's no legal eu mutual assistance requirement for ireland or finland or austria to be non-neutral when other eu members wind up in deep trouble . 
  i do think that even in the absence of trouble , there 's some political cost to unity in not doing so . 
  we have a lot of conversations on this sub about how angela merkel is pragmatic or sensible for doing what voters want . 
  the only difference i see is that theresa may has n't bothered to do an interview saying that she 's had some personal ephiphany and seen the light . 
  they may be concerned about being shot .

  someone would be kind of hard to work with if they quit every time they were assigned to do something that they did n't personally favor . 
  `` don , i 'm going to need you to set up mysql on this server this week . '', 
  `` fuck you , postgresql is way better .

  maybe , though i doubt it .
