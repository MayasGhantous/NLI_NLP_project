  treason convictions are pretty uncommon , and executions for treason rarer ( even in places that permit it ) . 
  all right , this has confused me enough that i 'm gon na go look . 
  fortunately , there are some direct quotes , and google indexes everything that the internet sees , so a search for a quote quickly turns up [ the source material ] ( https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeucom/9/911.htm ) . 
  this is still a summary , but it looks suspiciously like the snp might be off doing #justsnpthings and the house of lords is humoring them . 
   we note the scottish government 's earlier stated aim that a newly independent scotland should remain an eu member state . 
  we also note the first minister 's announcement on 27 june that any independence referendum would be delayed until after uk withdrawal in 2019 . 
  it is not for this committee to comment substantively on the scottish government 's policy , but we note the european commission 's consistent view that , under eu law , an independent scotland would be treated as a third country , and would have to apply for accession to the eu . 
  `` no , scotland , you ca n't vote for independence and keep the opt-outs . '', 
   we also note the scottish government 's preference , should scotland remain part of the uk , for the whole uk to continue within the eu single market as part of the european economic area . 
  this option was ruled out by the previous government , and it is now for the new government , and parliament , to decide whether this remains the position . 
  `` noted that you want the uk to stay in the single market . 
  that 's up to westminster . '', 
  note that the current government [ has said that the uk will not seek single market membership ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38641208 ) . 
  which ruled out the `` fig leave to leavers and no major change '' option and means that scotland is n't going to be in the single market . 
   we conclude , on the basis of the weight of evidence submitted to this inquiry , that the scottish government 's further proposal , for continued scottish membership of the single market , through the european economic area , while the rest of the uk leaves the single market , is politically impracticable , legally highly complex and economically potentially disruptive to the functioning of the uk single market . 
  `` scotland is n't staying in the eu single market either independent of the rest of the uk . '', 
  probably was n't taken as a serious suggestion . 
  i would imagine that holyrood is quite aware of this and that the point of this was for the snp to demonstrate that it 's off fighting the good fight . 
   nevertheless , we urge the government to respect the particular circumstances in scotland . 
  while we acknowledge that the referendum was a uk-wide vote , giving a uk-wide result , the government needs to recognise the fact that the vote to remain in scotland , at 62 % , was the largest and most decisive ( either in favour of remaining or leaving ) in any nation of the uk . 
  `` yes , scotland . 
  you are special . '', 
   we therefore consider that , in the event that the uk government does not secure a uk-wide agreement that adequately reflects scotland 's specific needs , there is a strong political and economic case for making differentiated arrangements for scotland . 
    the scottish economy has particularly pressing needs , including its reliance on access to eu labour , which is acute in sectors such as health and social care , agriculture , food and drink , and hospitality . 
  we also note scotland 's demographic needs , and its reliance upon eu migration to enable its population ( and in particular , that of working age ) to grow . 
  scotland 's more sparsely populated regions are disproportionately reliant both on eu migration and eu funding . 
  many of our witnesses argued that the most pressing case , in view of scotland 's economic and demographic circumstances , would be for a standalone approach to immigration policy . 
  we address this issue in the next chapter . 
  okay . 
  this is what i was looking for . 
  i * think * that the issue here is that while `` immigration '' as a stand-alone word means `` coming to stay '' versus expats who may-or-may-not be intending to stay , `` immigration policy '' refers to the whole set of decisions about who crosses the border for any reason , including work visas rather than to immigrate . 
  the bbc ( misleadingly ) stripped off the word `` policy '' in its news story . 
  broadly-speaking , it is probably in the interests of a country on the whole to permit work visas where possible -- it 's economically-efficient not to limit the movement of labor , and you get to reap the benefits of someone else 's working years -- as long as your * own * public is n't too cranky about it . 
  if holyrood is enthusiastic about it and they can sell it to the public there and the rest of the uk does n't care enough , specifically allowing work visas from people in the eu to do even unskilled work in scotland would be a pretty smooth move for the uk , especially since you can typically boot someone on a work visa if they become unemployed , limiting welfare expenditure . 
  this may be just scottish business owners talking , but if there 's widespread support in scotland , might see the `` scotland work visa '' as a thing . 
  if it goes through , my assumption is that it would tend to be advantageous for scotland 's economy as a whole , though disadvantageous specifically for unskilled scottish labor . 
  that 's ... actually a really politically clever way of selling work visas , which are typically not popular with the public ( [ the people who compete with the imported labor are very aware of the costs , but the people who benefit from the imported labor are typically not very aware of the benefits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em&amp;t=3m35s ) ) . 
  i wonder if the us should have some sort of federal work visa program that permits states to opt into allowing work visas on a state-by-state basis . 
  [ snip ]  any attempt to amend the devolution settlements ahead of brexit would be complex and politically controversial , and we doubt that either the uk government or parliament has the capacity to undertake such a task at the same time as achieving a successful brexit . 
  on balance , we therefore conclude that , for the duration of the brexit process , the statutory balance of competences between the uk parliament and the devolved legislatures should as far as possible be unchanged . 
  this is not the time to embark on controversial domestic constitutional reform , either by conferring additional competences upon the devolved institutions or by ` re-reserving ' competences previously devolved . 
  `` you 're not getting scotland more powers during the brexit process , snp , so let 's not start off trying to use that as a lever . 
  we 've got enough headaches to deal with without having that going on in the middle of negotiations . '', 
   gas is pretty much the only thing that keeps it alive . 
  well , there 's oil . 
  no state has been bailed out by the federal government , including california . 
  i doubr that spain and the uk are going to go to war over gibraltar . 
   ukrainian officials contend that russia wants to show the world , and the united states especially , that it can keep the crisis in a suspended state and deepen it if need be < doubtfully  maybe . 
  i do n't think that russia 's ability to make the situation more confrontational was ever in question . 
  he 's not very diplomatic , but i 'm not sure that ireland is in a strong position to be complaining about other countries not contributing sufficiently to security obligations in eastern europe , either . 
   but the status of victim can be a dangerously comfortable one , especially when an `` honor culture '' like turkey 's encourages you to be easily offended . 
  the us south had an honor culture as well , but [ deriving from britain . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_honor_\\ ( southern_united_states \\ ) #background ), 
  ... * is * that sad and pathetic ? 
   they have essentially revoked their citizenship in going off to fight for a foreign power against their country of native birth . 
  in the united states , it is essentially impossible to strip someone of us citizenship for any reason without their consent . 
  you may theoretically face treason charges and execution , but you will die a citizen . 
  changing this would require modifying the constitution . 
  as of 2006 , the [ british government apparently gained broad powers to strip british citizenship from dual citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration,_asylum_and_nationality_act_2006 ) , but only dual citizens . 
  this applies only to dual citizens , and probably does not cover many people involved with isis . 
  germany apparently [ just adopted identical measures ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/11/dual-nationals-who-fight-for-terror-groups-to-be-stripped-of-ger/ ) . 
  free markets only lead to efficient allocation in the absence of externalities . 
  pollution is an externality and thus can cause inefficient outcomes unless the externality is internalized . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pornography_in_the_united_states  according to a 2006 paper , porn up , rape down , by northwestern university law professor anthony d'amato , `` the incidence of rape in the united states has declined 85 per cent in the past 25 years while access to pornography has become freely available to teenagers and adults '' . 
  well , this should be an interesting sociology experiment , running it in reverse . 
  yo , we are n't banning internet content . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pornography_in_europe  in lithuania , commercial distribution of pornographic material is prohibited by the article 309 of the country 's criminal code which states that `` a person who , for the purpose of distribution , produces or acquires pornographic material or distributes such material shall be punished by community service or by a fine or by restriction of liberty or by imprisonment for a term of up to one year . '', 
  you hand out prison terms for selling porn , man . 
   edit : downvote away , russian trolls . 
  i thought the whole pis/po thing was internal polish stuff . 
  can you update me on russia 's interest in the outcome ? 
  is it just because pis is euroskeptic ? 
   reporters without borders has violently criticized the so-called network enforcement act in this form and warned that it could serve as a model for repressive states . 
  i do n't agree with germany on the act , but this is a argument that will fail . 
  as i underatand it , germany 's position , rightly or wrongly , is that this is necessary to avoid german society going down the tubes again when jackass far-right types try getting a movement going again , because that did n't work out well for germany . 
  this is a social value . 
  a fairly peripheral concern like `` someone might copy it and do it * wrong * '' is not gon na change anyone 's mind . 
  you 're gon na have to argue that it 's not necessary to address the problem that it aims to solve . 
  it 's like telling the english that they need to get rid of the jury trial , because it 's being abused somewhere in the world , or the us get rid of guns because someone in the world is abusing them . 
  this is n't going to carry any weight . 
   major eu countries ( germany and france ) refused to let ukraine even try to join nato . 
  to be fair , that was a decade ago . 
  i 'm not sure if franco-german positions are still the same : https://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html?referer=  mr. bush 's position -- that ukraine and georgia should be welcomed into a membership action plan , or map , that prepares nations for nato membership -- directly contradicted german and french government positions stated earlier this week . 
  it also risked upsetting efforts to get russia to soften its opposition to positioning a missile defense array in eastern europe . 
    mr. bush failed to win over a consensus of nato members in a debate at a dinner of nato leaders , a senior german official said wednesday night , with at least seven countries lined up against him . 
  the [ german and italian publics appear to still be opposed , but not the french public ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/nato-publics-blame-russia-for-ukrainian-crisis-but-reluctant-to-provide-military-aid/russia-ukraine-report-30/ ) . 
   there is a `` strong case '' for scotland having different brexit arrangements from the rest of the uk in some areas , peers have said ... it said this could include scotland setting its own eu immigration goals after brexit . 
  damned if i know how imigrating to scotland but not the rest of the uk would work . 
  so a naturalized immigrant would be be a uk citizen but only within scotland , not the rest of the eu ? 
  how is that gon na work abroad ? 
  then you have border control along hadrian 's wall and on the ferry to ni ? 
  maybe they 're talking about expats coming in on some sort of work visa , not immigrants ? 
   trade specialists are however , less optimistic about the idea , not the least because of the diversity of countries inside the commonwelath that 's actually not an argument against . 
  a fta 's value is a function of the [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) between the countries , which increases as the economies become more different . 
  two countries with absolutely-identical economies do n't benefit from trade . 
  you * want * different economies to trade . 
  there are reasons to see it as not a good fit . 
  distance is a real concern ( though transport and communication has shrunk distances since the last time that the commonwealth was anl successful economic bloc ) . 
  but having different economies should not be an issue . 
  i suspect that modern mbts are not vulnerable to gasoline bombs .
