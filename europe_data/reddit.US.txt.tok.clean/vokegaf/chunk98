  i hit a paywall , but bi seems to [ cover the incident ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/author-of-article-50-lord-kerr-stop-brexit-2017-7 ) as well . 
  well , i cover in my comment why i doubt that that is politicallly viable . 
  i think that your perception of `` the left '' is based on a small , highly non-representative group of activists . 
   the people who beat this couple up need to be deported immediately . 
  i do n't care where they are from . 
  no appeal , no second chances . 
  why would you disallow appeal ? 
  i mean , that 's a mechanism there for a reason . 
  not implausible , but you 're gon na need to show me some numbers from a reputable source . 
  russia may not be * nice * to gay people . 
  but russia as a whole is also not killing gay people . 
  i really do n't think that being gay in russia alone would warrant asylum . 
  by `` mishandling of irish water '' , do you mean installation of water meters and charging a fee based on water usage ? 
   so we blockade the mediterranean - it is ours and we have the power to control it , place sea mines , destroy any and all who enter without our permission . 
  the uk may well have the military clout to do so , but in legal terms , she does not own international waters , be they in the mediterranean or elsewhere , nor have peacetime authority to control shipping in them , nor to do so in turkish nor libyan territorial waters . 
  the uk is not at war with refugees . 
   if some war were to break out and the us and ireland were to call in conscripts , you could have to serve in two armies at the same time . 
  if that happened , you almost certainly want to renounce one citizenship . 
  serving in either army would cause you to commit treason in the other country . 
  the penalties are severe . 
  [ the us can give you the death sentence ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381 ) :  whoever , owing allegiance to the united states , levies war against them or adheres to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort within the united states or elsewhere , is guilty of treason and shall suffer death , or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $ 10,000 ; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the united states . 
  [ ireland will give you a life sentence with no parole for forty years ] ( http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1990/act/16/section/2/enacted/en/html#sec2 ) :  2 . -- a person convicted of treason or murder shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life . 
  -  4 . -- where a person ( other than a child or young person ) is convicted of treason or of a murder or attempt to commit a murder to which section 3 applies , the court --   ( a ) in the case of treason or murder , shall in passing sentence specify as the minimum period of imprisonment to be served by that person a period of not less than forty years , i suppose that you could decide to gamble that one side would conquer the other and force the other to pardon treasonous citizens , but that 'd be a dangerous gamble on not having a severe sentence hanging over one 's head . 
   dual citizenship needs to die . 
  it looks like the trend is generally towards permitting multiple citizenship , not away . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_citizenship  at the 1930 league of nations codification conference , an attempt was made to codify nationality rules into a universal worldwide treaty , the 1930 hague convention , whose chief aims would be to completely abolish both statelessness and dual citizenship . 
  it proposed laws that would have reduced both , but in the end was ratified by only twenty nations . 
  [ 2 ]   however , the consensus against dual nationality began to erode due to changes in social mores and attitudes . 
  by the late 20th century it was becoming gradually accepted again . 
  [ 2 ] many states were lifting restrictions on dual citizenship . 
  for example , the british nationality act 1948 removed restrictions on dual citizenship in the united kingdom , the 1967 afroyim v. rusk ruling by the u.s. supreme court prohibited the u.s. government from involuntarily stripping citizenship from americans over dual citizenship , and the canadian citizenship act , 1976 , removed restrictions on dual citizenship in canada . 
  the number of states allowing multiple citizenship further increased after a treaty in europe requiring signatories to limit dual citizenship lapsed in the 1990s , and countries with high emigration rates began permitting it to maintain links with their respective diasporas . 
  [ 4 ] -  today , most advanced economies allow dual citizenship ; [ 42 ] notable exceptions which restrict or forbid it are austria , germany , japan , the netherlands , norway , singapore , south korea , and spain . 
  i mean , it would be possible , if they wanted , to extend an exception ( e.g. 
  maybe a one-generation dual citizenship , where parents must choose their children 's citizenship ) due to the unusual circumstances of brexit . 
  wikipedia does note that german europe has made exceptions : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_citizenship  germans and austrians can apply for special permission to keep their citizenship ( * beibehaltungsgenehmigung * ) before taking a second one ( for example , both austria and the united states consider arnold schwarzenegger a citizen ) . 
  in general , however , any austrian who takes up a second citizenship will automatically lose austrian citizenship . 
  that looks like it 's laid out in tex to me . 
  given the number of eu documents in word , that 's a pleasant surprise . 
  * you do n't need a port to launch a rubber boat . 
  * blockades are an act of war . 
  the us can sink boats now . 
  the us is n't going to sink boats because that would be an utterly absurd solution . 
  if eu members have the political will to do so , they can not accept or deport people , and there are clear and explicit legal paths to doing this , like withdrawing from the refugee convention . 
  however , all of those approaches are preferable to just gunning people down . 
  you do n't solve a political issue -- lack of political will to deport -- by gunning people down at sea . 
  if you 've got the political capital required to kill people at sea , you 've got the political capital required to stop extending asylum ... and the latter is a lot less-harmful . 
  `` shoot them at sea '' is a cry of frustration from people who do n't want immigration and want a suitably extreme measure . 
  it makes no sense to sink ships , not even as a disincentive -- simply consistent deportation or detention alone is a sufficient disincentive , were it applied . 
   `` as for kadyrov 's interview , frankly speaking , very often , his words are taken out of context , '' vladimir putin 's spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters on monday . 
    peskov added that if the comments were considered in the correct context , `` nothing out of the ordinary was said there . '' fair enough . 
  let 's include the surrounding text from the interview transcript . 
  could be that they make sense , like he was talking about some sort of hypothetical . 
  https://www.outsports.com/2017/7/14/15973178/chechnya-gay-mma-ramzan-kadyrov  hbo 's david scott : `` i wanted to ask you about the alleged roundup , abduction , and torture of gay men in the republic . 
  what , mr. president , do you want to say about that ? ''   ramzan kadyrov : `` why did he [ scott ] come here ? 
  what 's the point of these questions ? 
  this is nonsense . 
  we do n't have those kinds of people here . 
  we do n't have any gays . 
  if there are any , take them to canada . 
  praise be to god . 
  take them far from us so we do n't have them at home . 
  to purify our blood , if there are any here , take them . ''   hbo 's david scott : `` but do you not get concerned when you read these accounts of young men who say they 've been tortured for days ? 
  does it concern you as a matter of law and order in the republic when you hear these stories ? ''   ramzan kadyrov : `` they are devils . 
  they are for sale . 
  they are not people . 
  god damn them for what they are accusing us of . 
  they will have to answer to the almighty for this ... america is conducting an anti-russian policy against the country 's leadership . 
  they know that i 'm ready to give my life for russia , and that i have a good army capable of attacking and defending . 
  we 'll see how things go for everyone . ''   hbo 's david scott : `` do you regard the united states as an enemy of your country ? ''   ramzan kadyrov : `` america is not really a strong enough state for us to regard it as an enemy of russia . 
  we have a strong government and are a nuclear state . 
  even if our government was completely destroyed , our nuclear missiles would be automatically deployed . 
  we will put the whole world on its knees and screw it from behind . '' ... 
  the context here is not really making kadyrov sound more reasonable at all to me . 
  `` we do n't have any gays . 
  if there are any , take them to canada . '', 
  sounds a lot more level-headed -- if socially-conservative -- than `` we will put the whole world on its knees and screw it from behind '' . 
  yeah , i do n't buy food security being a risk for the uk . 
  there are a couple of ways in which food security could be a concern . 
  if the uk is cut off from the rest of the world -- what nazi germany was trying to do to the uk seventy years ago . 
  given that the uk has coastal access and can already single-handedly stomp nearly all countries in the world from a naval standpoint , that the eu is only 20 miles away with a tunnel and channel transport and is allied , that the us is the world 's overwhelmingly-dominant naval power and is also allied ( to say nothing of canada , which is another large grain exporter and put out one hell of a prompt and respectable effort to simultaneously run anti-blockade efforts and feed the uk in world war ii ) , this scenario seems staggeringly implausible . 
  * inability to purchase food on the global market because every single country is unable to produce surplus and passes laws to block export of food when people are locally lacking food ( the opposite of what the uk did during the irish potato famine ... ) . 
  staggeringly unlikely . 
  you ca n't have a region of the world short of food -- you 'd have to have all the countries colluding . 
  * inability to purchase food on the global market because of global shortage of food and inability to outbid other countries . 
  the uk is one of the wealthiest countries in the world on a per-capita basis , [ ranked # 19 here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  if the uk is starving at its current level of relative wealth because of poverty , human civilization will have pretty much shut down . 
  maybe if the uk economically-collapsed ... but then , arguably the uk should be expending resources on rebuilding its economy , not unlikely food scenarios . 
  all of these seem pretty implausible to me . 
  above-and-beyond that , there was some vague discussion of expense and price instability . 
  the uk has been in the european union customs union . 
  this will not have lower-than-world-market prices : it has import tariffs on agricultural goods . 
  claiming `` food security '' is , i suspect , a common-and-typically-not-true rallying cry from agricultural lobbying interests , rather like `` dumping '' is from the steel industry . 
  i 've seen some us policy argued for by people claiming concerns about us food security . 
  there are few-if-any countries less-plausibly faced by food security issues than the us -- a large agricultural exporter specializing in bulk production of staple foods with a lot of land compared to population , unfettered and unblockable access to two oceans , the ability to outbid just about anyone else , neighboring agricultural exporters , and diverse production . 
  if people are going to cry `` food security '' here , i 'm damn well convinced that they 'll use the same cry anywhere . 
  well , the link is to an [ alex jones ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/alex_jones ) website , which * astonishingly to me * is not on the / r/europe banned sources list , given the staggering amount of conspiracy theory bullshit they spew . 
  for the uk to be in the single market , it will crash into freedom of movement . 
  either the uk or the eu must yield ground on freedom of movement . 
  but everyone cleverly tied their political hands ahead of time .
