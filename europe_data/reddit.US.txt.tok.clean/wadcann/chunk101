  if obama * was * going to raise some sort of information or agreement or similar that would change the situation , that presumably would have been done some time back , not now , and i doubt that he 'd be doing it personally anyway . 
  so i 'm just assuming that this is a nice-for-the-public statement . 
  [ this kind of football ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/30/418725724/womens-soccer-game-tonight-features-the-worlds-top-2-teams ) , i think , but then we 're unfamiliar with these euro sports . 
  europe has * really * , * really * wanted the us to recognize its pdos for a while , and i believe that in past trade agreements , this has been a major goal . 
  from 2014 : http://capreform.eu/geographical-indications-gis-in-the-us-eu-ttip-negotiations/  the us agriculture secretary , tom vilsack , was in brussels this week , among other things to have lunch with eu agriculture ministers during their monthly council meeting . 
  he also took the opportunity to have a discussion with commissioner ciolos on some of the agricultural issues that are proving difficult to resolve in the ongoing negotiations on the us-eu transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) free trade agreement . 
    one of these issues is the eu demand that the us should recognise and protect the eu 's list of geographical indications ( gis ) . 
  geographical indications are defined in the wto as `` indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a member , or a region or locality in that territory , where a given quality , reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin '' . 
  i 'm sure that there 's going to be some stuff that the us wants that the eu will hold their nose swallowing and some stuff that the eu wants that the us will hold their nose swallowing . 
  from a us standpoint , the eu is asking for ownership of valuable brands that have become widely-used generic terms * after * they were probably only widespread in the us * because * of the generic status . 
  the us itself rarely has geographically-bound brands . 
  on the other hand , from the eu standpoint , the us was always making confusingly-labeled knockoffs . 
  i suspect that this is just going to be a `` suck it up and live with it and let europe have it '' sort of affair in the us . 
  if it 's true that the equivalent us goods are comparable in quality and marketing , then us producers of various goods will ultimately be able to establish their own brands ( or , preferably , their own cross-industry generic terms ) as replacements for the pdo term . 
  there will be a big chunk of money lost in the meantime , but whadda gon na do ? 
   `` the raw material is whole , fresh buffalo milk . '', 
  well , * that * should create a storm in the us pending ttip going through . 
  i wonder if we 're going to have another champagne -  sparkling wine type scenario . 
  hey , rooskies !, 
  just so you know , your copy of our copy of greek architecture is inferior to our copy !, 
   there have been shortages of certain food items ( nothing crucial though ) i 'm sure that russia is n't at risk of starvation -- it 's a major food producer . 
  just less variety . 
  it looks like [ some of the the most impacted foods ] ( http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd33e2ca2718fee6ed91653bdfef0e87?convert_to_webp=true ) are fish , poultry , fruits , cheese , and pork . 
   their morale noticeable degraded after recent news about us deployment of heavy weapons in europe that 's odd . 
  i would n't have thought that that was strategically-significant -- it was a comparatively-small amount of hardware . 
  i would have expected the sanctions to generate more concern from the start , but the military actions to generate less . 
  new york was named [ back when the brits took it from the dutch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/province_of_new_york ) . 
  it was n't an american revolutionary war concept . 
  i 'm reasonably comfortable saying that poland does n't want russia staying over for a night or two . 
  russia and china did both back [ north korea 's invasion of south korea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ) , and both put military forces in . 
  that 's a proxy war , mind , and not a nato conflict , the invasion was neutralized , the cost of supporting the war was pretty unpleasant for china , and afterwards it made for a really great example for the us to hold up of two economic systems side-by-side , but insofar as deterrence went , that did n't seem to go so smoothly . 
  well ... that 's kind of a complicated question . 
  lincoln kinda straddled the fence on that . 
  politically , there were grounds on which he very much liked the concept that states had no right to secede , and that was typically the official claim that was made . 
  but then other things were done that were very dubious if that * was * the case , like stripping southern states of their legislative powers and voice in federal government until after the republican party had pushed through its own agenda ; not something that the federal government had the power to do if the states had not seceded . 
  the confederacy had its own share of legal justifications that were pretty sketchy too . 
  going '' [ bankrupt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bankruptcy ) '' is n't the same thing as being broke , even if sometimes it 's used that way in common language . 
  being `` bankrupt '' is a formal legal status that , among other things , can halt ( or even cancel ) obligations to make payments on debt . 
  there is n't a `` bankrupt country '' status in international law . 
  maybe there should be , but there is n't . 
  whether-or-not syriza has made bad moves , greece was in a pretty bad state already due to decades of the two major greek parties by the time that they got into power . 
  i have a hard time placing more blame at syriza 's feet than theirs , and i 'm not very politically-aligned with syriza 's goals at all . 
   germany and others want a quota system , but others block it . 
  that 's not quite the same thing as what i 'm proposing , though . 
  my guess is that other countries see an amnesty as likely , and this as a back door to get them to accept permanent immigration . 
  that seems like a fair objection . 
  let 's suppose that the following happens : * eu nations collectively state that they are withdrawing from the 1951 un refugee convention . 
  australia [ was considering this ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/refugee-convention-withdrawal-an-option-20130718-2q7xs.html ) . 
  * eu nations produce an alternative refugee treaty that addresses their concerns as well as meets the concerns that they feel would be valuable in terms of providing temporary sanctuary . 
  for example , it seems that a common concern from residents is that refugee status is being used as a back door to immigration . 
  all right , that 's not a problem -- provide a guaranteed safe haven refugee camp on an island , say , and guarantee n years of temporary refuge . 
  that 's not in accord with the 1951 refugee convention , but it would presumably address the issue of genocides * and * address the issue of mass illicit immigration . 
  the eu states that it will provide transport to a destination country that will accept them upon request : these are not prisoners . 
  * italy intercepts illegal immigrants , fingerprints them , and takes them to the refugee camp . 
  * the eu as a whole funds the process . 
  now italy is n't in a position where it has a strong financial incentive to facilitate illegal immigration . 
  the eu has to pay for food , housing , and care for legitimate refugees , but i do not think that this is truly a point of widespread objection : i 'd expect that most people object to the refugee system being abused to bypass immigration restrictions , not to refugees being given temporary safety during a war . 
  legitimate refugees have a way to escape war . 
  the people who wind up unhappy are people who are attempting to make use of refugee status not to dodge war , but to engage in economic migration . 
  their incentive to do so vanishes . 
  if it truly is the case that the eu does not want to facilitate economic migration but does want to protect people in danger of being killed off , that would seem to be a lot closer to the ideal . 
  if italy is having to house those migrants during the review period , are other eu countries contributing to those expenses ? 
  i 've no objection to the eu changing its policy on how it deals with refugees -- it does seem that there are some very legitimate concerns . 
  that might fix the problem . 
  but just dumping costs on one country and expecting that country to secure your border is n't solving anything . 
  were countries like germany and france and denmark willing to fund the costs of enforcing immigration control in italy , which was the the theoretical new border ? 
  if not , sure looks like the alternative is to impose control at state borders . 
  seems a bit silly to me , but ... 
   it 's surreal that an administration in a developed country could submit something like that . 
  of all the things to worry about , the typesetting on a document is of concern ? 
  it gets the point across -- who cares ? 
  i mean , complain about the referendum or the political stance taken by the parties or corruption or unwillingness to reform or everything else , but a `` the greek government is backwards because they produced a badly-formatted communication '' seems kind of petty . 
  i do n't really think that it 's fair to lay the blame of all that at his feet . 
  yes , he was an assassin . 
  i do n't know whether he 's the best person to glorify . 
  but he killed one man , albeit an important government figure , and his wife , and certainly did not do so with any intent of creating world war i. 
  it is an array of world powers that were responsible for the millions of deaths .

  google translate output of the [ linked interfax.ru story ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/450574 ) :  moscow . 
  june 30th . 
  interfax.ru - russian prosecutor general 's office began checking the legality of recognition of the independence of the baltic republics by the state council of the ussr in 1991 , `` interfax '' on tuesday , a source familiar with the situation . 
    `` legally , the decision to recognize the independence of the baltic states is defective due to the fact that it takes an unconstitutional body , '' - said the agency interlocutor corresponding parliamentary inquiry into the main supervisory authority . 
    in his opinion , the answer to the appeal `` would be the same request to the crimea . '', 
  source agency said that prosecutor general 's office has recognized the illegal decision on the transfer of crimea in 1954 of the rsfsr in the ukraine , but , according to him , this decision has no real legal consequences . 
    `` prosecutor general 's office only stated a fact , namely , that the transfer of crimea to ukraine in the days of nikita khrushchev did not occur on a constitutional basis , since the relevant decisions are not taken by the competent authorities '' , - said the agency . 
    according to him , `` in the present circumstances and realities that no authoritative body that could reverse this decision . '', 
  `` although such a need has not . 
  crimea is again a part of russia , and the question went to the political plane , '' - said the source . 
    however , he believes that the answer to the request of the prosecutor general should be `` more balanced '' .
