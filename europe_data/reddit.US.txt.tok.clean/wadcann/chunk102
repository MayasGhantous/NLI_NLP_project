  `` recognizing the illegal or that fateful decision , one can go too far - until the problem of the legitimacy of the soviet union and other countries '' - said the source . 
    because , he says , when making such decisions on a deputy 's request `` should take into account not only the legal but also the political aspect of the issues raised . '', 
  so are democracies simply doomed ? 
  i 'd think that the response would be the criticize a particular system of democracy , not to go after the public . 
   why is n't this anywhere else ? 
  from what it looks like in terms of numbers , that would n't make us national news either if it happened in the us ; it does n't look like a very substantial riot .

   if you want to say something bad about v-man , you should say that the dude claimed 1h before the capital controls were enacted that no capital controls would be enacted . 
  why ? 
  if his job is to enact effective capital controls , for which it should be beneficial to have as much capital as possible available to drain real value from , would n't it be desirable to have him making a compelling case that no capital controls would be instituted ? 
  that 's a europeen .

  but the [ trend of massive immigration ended a while back ] ( http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/04/23/net-migration-from-mexico-falls-to-zero-and-perhaps-less/ ) :  the largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the united states has come to a standstill . 
  after four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants -- most of whom came illegally -- the net migration flow from mexico to the united states has stopped and may have reversed , according to a new analysis of government data from both countries by the pew hispanic center , a project of the pew research center ... it is possible that the mexican immigration wave will resume as the u.s. economy recovers . 
  even if it does n't , it has already secured a place in the record books . 
  the u.s. today has more immigrants from mexico alone -- 12.0 million -- than any other country in the world has from all countries of the world .1 some 30 % of all current u.s. immigrants were born in mexico . 
  the next largest sending country -- china ( including hong kong and taiwan ) -- accounts for just 5 % of the nation 's current stock of about 40 million immigrants . 
  another interesting statistic -- i was reading about gang violence a while back and was absolutely bowled over by the statistic that about one-third of el salvador 's population was in the us . 
  finally , mexico is not part of [ central america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_america ) . 
  all right , fair enough ; thanks for clarifying . 
  it 's just that there have been a lot of people , like mr. krugman , saying what could be read as `` without different currencies or some intergovernmental system of transfers , you can not maintain a balance of trade '' . 
  and that , at least to me ( not a professional economist , mind ) did not sound correct ; at best a misleading oversimplification . 
  it might be more disruptive to economies to take this route , and in particular , dealing with volatile differences in what each can produce would be an issue -- for example , if year-by-year greece 's gdp relative to that of its primary trade partners wildly swings , that would be terribly problematic , no doubt . 
  but if the issue is simply a straightforward `` germany produces things n % more-efficiently than greece '' , i 'd think that that would be the most-viable case for the `` disruptive '' approach to the trade equilibrium being maintained that i described above . 
  thanks for responding -- that 's been bothering me for some time , and i wanted to hear another voice say `` no , you 're not crazy '' . 
   perenially surplus generating regions i do n't understand this . 
  if you have a trade imbalance , at some point , i 'm going to have to give up something that i value more-and-more to get whatever i want from you . 
  at that point , i 'm not going to buy your thing . 
  across currencies , okay , we agree -- the currency adjusts in value . 
  that 's * one * mechanism by which this process can happen . 
  maybe it has benefits , because it 's not all that internally-disruptive . 
  everyone can stay in their jobs -- it 's just that their savings are worth less in real terms and their job pays them less in real terms . 
  but if i have a common currency , i do n't see any reason why the same adjustment in wages can not happen . 
  it will perhaps be disruptive , in that people will be laid off , maybe businesses will go out of business , and new businesses will have to be created hiring people at a lower rate -- the system of prices and budgeting in place internally will create more of a shock . 
  but it 's not as if an economy can not adjust wages relative to other economies in the absence of its own currency , yes ? 
   the marketplace ( free flow of goods ) + monetary union means that the southern markets are flooded by imports from the industries of northern countries . 
    the south 's ability to export to the north is limited by differences between both groups ' capital bases and the economies of scale they generate . 
  is your position that international free trade can not function , then ? 
  it seems like the same concern would apply to many , many countries , far beyond the ez . 
  perhaps without a currency to adjust , changes would be more painful , if they had to happen via unemployment and then re-hiring at a lower wage rate , but ... 
   the northern europeans should write a check and make this go away . 
  they should accept the fact that greece is not going to pay most of its debts . 
  i assume that if the concern was the existing debt , that would have happened by now . 
  after all , if greece is going to not pay in europe , it can also not pay outside of europe . 
  however , i 've heard other concerns listed : * the political fallout of greece having an anti-austerity party come in and shut down reform requirements may be unacceptable due to what it would do to the rest of the ez . 
  * as more money is sent to greece , it might keep being burned . 
  that means ongoing losses if this is at a rate that the ez accepts and wants to have happen , that 's fine ... but then i think that other things would also need to happen . 
  if greece wants a subsidized standard of living , then other members would surely also want subsidies . 
  * i understand that part of the goal of the ez was to accept stable members . 
  while greece was ( secretly ) not within acceptable parameters , i wonder if perhaps the scope of this was beyond what the people making the original call had expected and that the revised estimate is that other ez members are , on the net , better off without greece , even taking into account all the other factors . 
  * if this were to be done , it seems to me that it would have made more sense to do this six months ago rather than now . 
  to do it now would be to accept the economic harm from the banks in trouble , the political harm from sitting on the brink and having unpleasant politics show up , and so forth ... and it does n't seem like it would buy anything . 
    obviously [ the bnd ] actually can do something   `` we are so stupid , we ca n't even stop the us from spying on our chancellor '' they may not be able to , in a legal sense . 
  is domestic counterintelligence within the bnd 's purview , or is that the [ bfv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_office_for_the_protection_of_the_constitution ) 's ? 
  the us has a strict split between the cia and the fbi -- my understanding is that the cia does not do domestic counterintelligence . 
  there was a lot of discussion about `` intelligence sharing '' after 9/11 , but as far as i know , that wall is still in place . 
   as well as being a little bit dense , the greek ballot also controversially puts the `` no '' option - favoured by the greek government - above the yes option , leading some to accuse it of bias . 
    it is an `` unusual '' format , said katie ghose , chief executive of the uk electoral reform society . 
  who cares ? 
  it 'd be as easy to just rephrase the question so that `` no '' is `` yes '' . 
  if you 've got a real concern about influence from order , print up half the ballots with one order , half with the other , randomize them , and distribute . 
  i do n't know what legal conflicts with schengen exist , but as an related note , california internally [ has border checkpoints within the us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbwpnw210qg ) to check for and restrict flow of certain fruits and vegetables that they are worried might contain disease that might harm california 's agricultural industry . 
  that 's abnormal as states go , but insofar as the us would be an analog of a federal eu , it does exist where it 's necessary . 
  i still think that schengen area members would be much better-off just creating a pool of money to fund border control at the edge of schengen . 
  without that , you 're relying on good will for some other country to protect your borders . 
   why would anyone in the 21st century even consider war a viable option ? 
  you mean in * general * or in response to greece not getting more loans ? 
  well , the bottom right of that page has '' [ 10 things you did n't know about germans ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-germans/g-17184010 ) '' . 
  i guess that if you ca n't beat 'em , join 'em . 
  edit : although the list drew me in , and # 8 is interesting :  germans call their dinner meal `` abendbrot , '' or `` evening bread . '', 
  that 's because they prefer having a hot home-cooked meal for lunch and a quick cold meal for dinner . 
  my understanding was that this was the original meaning of `` dinner '' and `` supper '' in the uk , too . 
  then why is the american english italicized ? 
  also from the same article :  `` there 's no one in the administration or in d.c. that 's contemplating a federal bailout of puerto rico , '' [ white house spokesman josh ] earnest said . 
   but the two satirists of the new show - claus wagner and max uthoff - follow a very facts and numbers based approach , which , to my mind , makes it easy to decide whether you want to agree with what they are saying or not . 
  which is something that is to be commended . 
  so , at 20:16 , for example , the show raises the fact that greece paid interest , but did n't include the fact that the rates paid were well below market rates , that the subsidy was due to this difference . 
  i 'm not sure that that 's the most objective way to put this . 
  surely there are people who feel that the alternative would be worse who are not explicitly being paid off ? 
   the us is n't exactly an even comparison i know but we are willing to give billions to poor states ( and billions to puerto rico ) year after year and expect nothing in return but all of the `` bailouts '' given to greece are expected to be paid back . 
  [ six hours ago , usa today : `` puerto rico facing historic default on its $ 72 billion debt '' ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/06/29/puerto-rico-debt-crisis-default/29458475/ ), 
   the severity of the austerity forced on the greeks exceeds that forced on the irish . 
  the greek deficit in 2009 was 15.6 pc . 
  and by 2014 it was 2.5 pc , an unprecedented and brutal `` adjustment '' . 
  hmm . 
  that sounds like successful reform happened , though . 
  i do n't think that switching from eur to usd would avoid any of the problems that greece is currently facing . 
  greece would want the drachma not because it just wants to switch currencies , but because it would want to be able to generate inflation in that currency . 
  it could n't do that with the usd . 
  i realize that that was a goal , but but it was also pretty clear that greece was n't going to get more funds without accepting terms that were already rejected , yes ? 
  i assume that nobody thinks -- i certainly did n't have the impression -- that the recent statements were merely posturing from the troika . 
  but the comments in op 's link from mr. varoufakis post-date the termination of negotiations , yes ? 
  i just went searching through english-language news , and the only polls of greeks that showed up were the alco-for-proto-thema poll and the kapa-research-for-to-vima poll . 
  if there are other polls , i do n't think that they 've made it to english-language media yet .
