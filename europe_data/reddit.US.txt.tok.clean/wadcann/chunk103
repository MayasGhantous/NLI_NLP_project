  this seems to have been a major point of discussion every time any topic comes up on this subreddit . 
  * illegal immigration * greece * eu financials in general * eu military * eu dealing with russia * trade negotiations it 's like everything gets viewed in a lens of `` how could this possibly cause eu failure within the next year '' ? 
  nobody gives [ these guys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2vpnqqbdgg&amp;t=2m5s ) flak for having a silly walk , though . 
  my guess is that the queen 's guard and soldiers in a similar situation as the one in op 's video probably get explicit instruction in how to deal with this . 
  this seems like a pretty big deal to me . 
  i 've seen a lot of people claiming spying on companies , but this is the first time i 've seen someone produce evidence of same . 
  [ greek export treemap ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/greece_export_treemap.jpg ) . 
  well , sure , from a common-sense if-i-were-building-a-currency-scheme standpoint , i would n't think that they would . 
  but i do n't totally understand how else to reconcile ( a ) what / u/kin-luu is pointing out above , that greece will want to move away from the euro in order to have a functioning monetary system in a couple of days and ( b ) statements from the greek government that they will try to block removal from the eurozone and that there is no way in which they can be forced out . 
  i am not familiar with eurozone policy-setting , but i assume that greece , as well as other members , has a vote as to setting euro policy . 
  let 's say that greece * de-facto * moves to the drachma . 
  does that inherently mean that they lose any their policy-setting influence on the eurozone , even if it 's not the currency that greece is working with ? 
  even if it violates eurozone treaties , does violation entail removal from the eurozone ? 
  surely that that is something that greece would find value in retaining ; it would be like mexico having a voice in setting dollar policy . 
  i see that rt is having a field day with this . 
  at least someone is happy , even if it 's only russian propagandists ...

  and president obama is a lawyer . 
  however , he , just i 'm sure is the case with the troika officials , has access to a pool of advisors who are specialists , and i 'm sure that specialized policy is drafted by them and changes cleared with them . 
  it 's not as if political figures just sit down and just scribble up whatever comes into their heads . 
  while i think many people , including obama , would say that he is a bit of a dubious choice , it 's also worth pointing out that the nobel peace prize has never been an apolitical award . 
  just to be clear , krugman is not an official representative of the united states . 
  he is presently a political/economics pundit with a newspaper column . 
  comparing to my approximate area in the us : athens is a lot cheaper on a lot of things , but some things are surprisingly more expensive . 
  i wonder if some of these are from efficient us `` factory farm '' production : * gasoline * cheap restaurant food * milk * eggs * chicken breasts * prepaid phone costs ( over * three times * as expensive in athens ! ), 
  * clothing the areas where athens did better than the us by more than 50 % on were : * food that requires human labor to produce ( e.g. 
  oranges , tomatoes ) * alcohol * loaf of white bread ( a real surprise , since i 'd thought of that as something that the us would do well ) * bottled water * some transport fees * rent, 
  goat meat is not popular in the us ( lots of flat land to produce the fattier beef ) , but i discovered it recently and really like it . 
   we can try and shift blame to other people , but at the end of the day , the buck stops with greece given the context of the currency membership dispute , perhaps not the best time for that metaphor ... 
  this is interesting , but i do n't know whether i agree with all of the flowchart logic . 
  for example , on the flowchart , the following series of steps : 1 . 
  ethnic russian protest in narva . 
  nato urges calm . 
  moscow warns of impending genocide . 
  protestor clashes lead to some violence . 
  nato urges calm . 
  ... inevitably lead to `` far-right volunteers or ` little green men ' appear '' , which is what the flowchart states . 
  while certainly that 's not impossible , it seems exceedingly unlikely that un-uniformed russian special forces working to break estonia is a * necessary * result of what amounts to minor unrest and a diplomatic warning from moscow . 
  possible ? 
  sure . 
  necessary ? 
  no , i do n't think that that is the case . 
   well , reddit skews to the young - which in greece are the hardest hit group . 
  also , the young are presumably the least concerned about pension cuts ; their wealth is in the form of future labor , and they can save for retirement . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_of_the_earth  in about 1.1 billion years , the solar luminosity will be 10 % higher than at present . 
  this will cause the atmosphere to become a `` moist greenhouse '' , resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans . 
  as a likely consequence , plate tectonics will come to an end , and with them the entire carbon cycle . 
  [ 12 ] following this event , the planet 's magnetic dynamo may come to an end , causing the magnetosphere to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of volatiles from the outer atmosphere . 
  four billion years from now , the increase in the earth 's surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect . 
  by that point , most if not all the life on the surface will be extinct . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the sun in about 7.5 billion years , after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded to cross the planet 's current orbit . 
  europe is fucked . 
  just curious -- i looked up greece 's [ gdp ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp ) and [ us state gsp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_gdp ) . 
  greece is at $ 241.72 b. 
  that 's actually smack dab in the center of the list of us states . 
  hmm . 
  when did that happen ? 
  what if greece first repudiates existing debt , so that new lenders potentially do n't think that there 's someone senior to them with their hand out ? 
  that did n't happen last time . 
  i do n't think that i understand the situation and consequences well-enough to make that decision . 
  i 'd probably not vote , since i would n't really have useful input . 
  just out of curiosity , what would be required from the eu side to make you , personally , vote yes ? 
  it 's the only [ supercarrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supercarrier ) in the world outside of the us navy . 
  it 's a pretty substantial platform for projecting power . 
  [ 1927-1933 chart of pompous prognosticators ] ( http://www.gold-eagle.com/article/1927-1933-chart-pompous-prognosticators ), 
  it 's an interesting number , though , if you 're comparing having the private market handle services that the government could run . 
  now i want to see growth rates plotted against percent of gdp going to taxation . 
  we were talking about the suicide rates in greece a while back , and i pulled up numbers then . 
  there was a significant increase , but not 625 % . 
  the suicides were dominated by males , and iirc they approximately doubled . 
  ... i did n't at any point say that it would be a solution . 
  he says that if greece exits the eurozone , it will also exit the eu . 
  other people on this forum have said otherwise . 
  i was pointing out the split between the statements . 
  they 're so * slender * !, 
  hmm . 
  that map also looks like a [ population density map ] ( http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/france_departments_with_population_density.png ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polandball i never know what `` x germans '' refers to myself , anyway . 
  it 's not clear to me that people in the us would perform better than people in greece , given a similar situation , though . 
  and if they would n't , i 'd tend to think that the thing to fix would be less the greek people and more the democratic process . 
  looks like i 'm ordering even more latvian sprats . 
  just to clarify re : my comment , / u/nieuchwytnyuchwyt 's comment did n't originally have the `` thanks to your political spectrum ... '' bit on the end ; that was the edit . 
   i can tell you 've read the xkcd . 
  this was a pet peeve long before i read it , though it was satisfying to see randall complaining about the same thing . 
  well , there 's always australia . 
  edit : and italy . 
  i do n't care whether poland legalizes gay marriage or not . 
  why does poland care what 's happening in the us ? 
   to begin with , greece must exit not only the eurozone but also the european union . 
  this is non-negotiable and unavoidable . 
  i 'd been assuming , based on discussion here , that greece might ( perhaps it was even probable ) just leave the eurozone but not the eu . 
  this statement certainly conflicts with that possibility . 
   no country , not even greece , would taken on a debt that 's immediately payable in full . 
  the greek debt is n't immediately payable in full . 
  [ here 's the wall street journal 's timeline of when greek debt becomes due ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/ ) . 
  the current spat is over $ 1.5 b due june 30th . 
  / u/jfeldhaus said `` deficit '' , not `` debt '' . 
  the `` deficit '' is the amount by which the debt increases each year . 
  last i looked , greece 's debt was ~ $ 350b and the [ us federal deficit ] ( http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_deficit_chart.html ) was $ 474b , so he 's about right . 
   there is plenty of time till closing .
