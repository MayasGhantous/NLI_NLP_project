  a [ 9mm pistol round ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muzzle_energy#typical_muzzle_energies_of_common_firearms_and_cartridges ) has on the order of 383 ft-lbs ( 519 joules ) of energy , and pistols do n't normally incapacitate people immediately . 
  [ very large ( .50 caliber ) airguns ] ( http://www.topairgun.com/50-cal-air-rifles ) only reach something like half that . 
  here 's a [ clip with an anesthesiologist giving a talk on gunshot wounds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tku8yi68-ja&amp;t=14m34s ) , with the time marker on youtube set to jump to a clip of someone being shot multiple times with a pistol with his narration going on during the event . 
  one of his points is that pistol wounds are a lot less deadly than people think , and definitely do n't normally immediately-incapacitate someone -- the person shot keeps on doing whatever for a while , and it 's just typically slow blood loss that eventually becomes a problem . 
  the [ us has existing laws about this for us companies ] ( https://www.cov.com/~/media/files/corporate/publications/2012/04/us_antiboycott_laws_overview_compliance_strategies.ashx ) . 
  if the article is true , i 'd be opposed to this being added to ttip . 
  actually , i 'd kind of like to eliminate the us laws as well . 
  in theory , if the eu honors its defense agreements , finland should n't actually need conscripts ( either that , or the rest of europe should be conscripting ) . 
  you 're probably out-of-luck on the heating subsidy , though ... i do n't think that countries normally subsidize that ( though i 'll grant that they might ... probably need to be a country with a lot of north-south span , like japan ) . 
  border control and military are normally federal responsibilities , though . 
  < shrug  i do n't know the web of interlocking legal requirements , but any treaty that is an issue can be withdrawn from . 
  there is a real , concrete issue here , i think , in that laws about accepting refugees subject to persecution were in the wake of the holocaust , and it seems pretty clear that that is n't what 's happening here . 
  it could very well be that those treaties were poorly-designed , and not in fact the best policy that could have been adopted . 
  it 's fine to arrange for modification of them . 
  if what is happening * right now * is what the people of europe want , that 's just fine . 
  but if it 's not , there is no magical , higher-than-man requirement that they can not craft terms that more-reasonably address their terms . 
  for example , perhaps it would be reasonable to instead have a treaty requiring a finding that a genocide * is * a significant risk before the political refugee asylum status kicks in , and permit countries to house refugees elsewhere at their expense ( for example , an island ) . 
  that might better-capture the goals desired in ensuring temporary protection without permitting abuse . 
  well , to be fair , if libyan immigrants show up in italy with a coordinated invasion of '' [ 1,213 warships , 4,126 landing craft of various types , 736 ancillary craft , and 864 merchant vessels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normandy_landings ) '' , 200k naval military personnel working on getting them ashore over the objections of the defenders , 2,200 bombers , and tens of thousands of paratroopers dropped behind the coast to slow reinforcements , i think that the scope of the problem would be a titch different . 
  i guess that bulls in bullfights are * visible * , whereas bulls in slaughterhouses are invisible . 
  most people do n't live on farms anymore , so killing animals is something that happens at a pleasantly disconnected-from-them distance , and they simply experience nicely-packaged food materializing in the grocery store . 
  imagine j\u00e1sir ar\u00e5f\u00e4te ice cream with sweet apple syrup on top , bacon sprinkles , and a handful of sliced almonds placed on a fudge brownie base . 
  mmmm . 
  it 's reasonable to assume that those descended from ex-african slaves in america would have grown up in modern africa if slavery had never happened ; statistically , unless africa were dramatically-different , they would have been a lot worse-off . 
  slavery would probably be a current net benefit to them , albeit a net loss to their ancestors . 
  probably * also * statistically true for the criminals subject to [ penal transportation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penal_transportation ) who were kicked out to the us from the uk , though to a lesser degree . 
   everyone is to blame hey , now . 
  of a couple countries , maybe . 
  the article did n't even define `` european values '' . 
  well , you could generate that situation and see what happens . 
  give me a disgruntled bobcat and five minutes , and i can tell you if someone is tolerant of having a bobcat thrown at them . 
   based on my very limited knowledge , euro needs the `` problematic '' countries in order to survive . 
  although they never intended for it to reach such low conversion rates to the dollar , northern countries need it to stay below 1.4:1 in order to stay relevant in competing with us exports . 
  hmm . 
  this is interesting . 
  could you explain this to me ? 
  i 'd thought that it was not a fixed rate between currencies that was particularly important , but more the rate of change : because wages and other things are sticky , a shift in exchange rate produces a * temporary * shift in the balance of trade . 
  if the exchange rate moved to 1.4 and then hung there for a number of decades , i would n't think that there would be much additional change to the balance of trade after some fixed period of time . 
  i do n't totally understand why 1.4 is interesting : i 'd think that it would be `` stay below 1.4 before date x '' or something like that . 
  `` hey , barack ! '', 
  `` those sanctions ... you ready to end those ? '', 
  `` you planning on leaving ukraine yet ? '', 
  `` okay , probably going to stick with the sanctions . '', 
  `` all right . 
  well , talk to you later ! '', 
  `` okay , catch you later ! '', 
  sure , there are ways in which * that * data might have its own errors and you can attempt to analyze that , once it has been gathered and can be handed to people to analyze . 
  but that 's true of pretty much all recorded data , and that 's not a reason , at least to my mind , not to gather it . 
  the demographics are a bit different than the flood of people coming in from african countries in terrible state with minimal education that europe is seeing , though . 
  perhaps the eu should amend the echr to modify the requirement on refugee handling to make it less-vulnerable to economic migrants claiming refugee status , if this is such a fundamental issue ? 
  surely there 's sufficient member state support , given the above article ? 
  if not , it * does * seem reasonable for italy to ask for an eu pool of funds to deal with the issue . 
  if you want borders down ( which has value ! ), 
  between states , all states really do become responsible for those borders , and i do n't see the sense in having italy pay for the issue alone . 
  a german-led fortress europe ? 
  not again !, 
   false friends are words in two languages sometimes in * one * language . 
  [ wikipedia : list of words having different meanings in american and british english : a through l ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_american_and_british_english:_a%e2%80%93l ) [ wikipedia : list of words having different meanings in american and british english : m through z ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_british_and_american_english:_m%e2%80%93z ) `` oh , she must still be in bed ... i 'll go and knock her up '' has a * very * different meaning in british and american english . 
  or imagine a clause in some treaty that mandated that a periodic vote be held to elect a new official in the united nations , and that in the event of there being no majority , the existing official be retained . 
  sounds clear , but it does n't specify whether it is a us majority ( british absolute majority ) or a british majority ( us plurality ) . 
  oh , one other option : if cities * did n't * want to terminate licensing , another option would be to lift limits on how many licenses are granted , and simply have a fixed fee with an unlimited number granted . 
  let 's say the city charges , oh , $ 500 for the license exam or whatever it is that it costs them from an administrative standpoint . 
  that means that you open up the floodgates , * a la uber * , but you can retain restrictions if you * really * feel that they 're necessary . 
  further , require that the license fee be * yearly * , rather than a one-off fee -- that blocks incumbents from having any advantage over challengers . 
  eh , someone * can * throw a front-end on multiple services . 
  i mean , airlines would probably love me to just use their own booking interface and tie myself to that ( and thus the airline ) , but orbitz.com and travelocity.com and other web frontends to multiple airlines exist . 
  i 've no doubt that the new york times and other publications would * really * prefer that i just read their publication as they format it to get to the news , but google news scraping multiple sites commoditizes that : it means that i can bounce to any particular item . 
  think of , say , the popular metacritic.com , which scrapes ranking data from many sites . 
  of course , uber could claim that rating data is copyrighted owned by them ( hell , they probably have something like that in their eula where the author of a review/submission assigns them a license , so only the author and they have a right to use it ) , and could additionally protect it if they only expose an aggregate score that went through some sort of algorithm that they use . 
  but on the other hand , there are exemptions for * facts * and and it 's possible that scores could be treated as this , like in the failed attempt a while back to sue the [ maintainers of the linux timezone file ] ( http://www.computerworld.com/article/2501534/technology-law-regulation/astrolabe-withdraws-copyright-suit-over-internet-time-zone-database.html ) ; a book was used as source , but facts alone can not be copyrighted , and it may be that a count of acceptable or unacceptable service could be placed in this category . 
  i am sympathetic to the concern , but i do think that there are a number of options . 
  first , the `` internet economy '' is pretty new , and we * do * have the ability to pass legislation ( albeit with some constraints due to online enforcement ) if it does turn out to be a problem . 
  one possibility would be simply explicitly placing publicly-available comments/content , like those created for reddit , in the public domain , or at least establishing international fair use for them , or at least certain metadata on them ( e.g. 
  reddit 's publicly-available vote scores on comments might be given a fair-use exception ) . 
  it 's an interesting question , though . 
  i 'm also curious to see what happens with internet services in general . 
  certainly , investors dump money in internet services because they expect them to entrench their position and provide a return . 
  sometimes that might happen , but on the other hand , sometimes their position provides surprisingly-fragile . 
  i remember when yahoo was considered the almost-unchallengeable search engine behemoth ; google stomped them . 
  many people pointed to [ network effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network_effect ) in claiming that social network services would have immense lock-in . 
  certainly facebook has been doing well ... but then , myspace did well before that . 
  i thought that youtube would get stomped before now ( perhaps by someone who provided good video search indexing to multiple video streaming sites -- as google does itself for other websites -- and a better comment system ) , but it 's had remarkable staying power . 
  anyway , i do n't know what * will * happen , but whatever does , if it turns out to create widespread problems , i expect that countries will create a mechanism to ensure a competitive market . 
  on the whole , pretty much everyone wants to avoid a world in which you 've got a bunch of monopolies , and `` pretty much everyone '' is a potent force indeed in setting the rules . 
   greece will be shut out of any credit market until it pays back the imf at least . 
  why would lender x have interest in withholding loans to greece pending it paying back the imf ? 
  why would china or why would i refuse to lend funds , assuming that it felt that this time , greece would repay them ? 
   loads of high profile cases in the uk at the moment regarding pakistani rapists that 's still an anecdote , not a statistic . 
  additionally , what is covered in newspapers is often not a representative sample . 
  for example , spree shootings in the us attract * immense * media coverage , but your chance of being killed in a spree shooting is vanishingly-small : you 're vastly more likely to be killed by a not-newsworthy-incident of a driver crashing a car into you . 
  in particular , rape is something that historically pissed off a * lot * of people , and so it is possible that `` immigrant comes in and rapes a native-born woman '' simply gets more press , and that 's the dominant reason for what you see in the press . 
  that 's why i 'd want statistics or at worst , try to infer via native language statistics or similar . 
  i 'm more-than-happy to highlight a politically-uncomfortable `` group x commits crime y at a disproportionate rate '' , but if i do , i want it to * really * be happening and i want the data to be available to everyone , so that they can look for other possible correlations : for example , if males rape at a disproportionate rate , and immigrants of a particular group are disproportionately male , that might account for some of the difference . 
  all right , so non-native born people in finland rape at approximately four times the rate of native finns in finland ? 
  so the other question is if , as the article says , people are specifically irritable about somalis , we 're just using `` non-native-born '' as a proxy for `` somalis '' , what the first-generation-somali-immigration rape rate is on a per-capita basis . 
  it 's not clear to me that `` non-native-born '' as a whole are representative of first-generation somali immigrants . 
  finland * may * not gather this data . 
  the us does gather sex and ethnicity data on crimes for victims and offenders ( on the general grounds of more data being good ) , but broadly-speaking , i understand that european countries avoid gathering ethnicity data for crimes as policy ; this is seen as politically-inflammatory . 
  there have been studies in european countries that have used proxies to try to re-derive this information from information that * is * gathered , like native language , but it 's obviously looking through a clouded glass . 
   but the truth is that about 80 per cent of the rape suspects are still native finns .
