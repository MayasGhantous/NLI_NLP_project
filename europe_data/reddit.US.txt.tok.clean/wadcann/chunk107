  russia is going to avoid a conventional war with nato like the plague , because that 's a losing fight for russia ( and even when russia had a good shot at winning it , it would have been incredibly damaging ) . 
  in a hypothetical all-out nuclear war involving nato and russia 's entire nuclear arsenals , it 's pretty likely that things are going to be pretty unpleasant for anyone in europe or russia or the us or a lot of the northern hemisphere anyway , nato member or no nato member . 
  so what 's left ? 
  maybe russia trying a limited use of nuclear weapons that happens to specifically target finland ? 
  it 's getting down to a kinda narrow case . 
  * wow * . 
  okay , there 's clearly a huge difference between british and us trucking . 
   i think that approach is unfair on the drivers/truck operators . 
  i mean , crime in general is no fun , but it becomes factored in -- * everyone * would have to get a lock , and * everyone * would have to deal with an underbody plate , so they are n't at a competitive disadvantage ; it just becomes a fixed cost attached to shipping via truck . 
   the french politicals need to take responsibly for this collapse of law and order in their own country . 
  normally , my understanding ( and the uk and france may have a special arrangement ) is that it is incumbent on the country which has people entering it to control that entry , rather than the country which has people leaving to prevent their leaving . 
   the british politicals should be doing something to make these immigrants attempts futile and not expecting the french to deal with it alone . 
  fair enough . 
   use the army to search vehicles for stowaways . 
  could be done , but does the uk have a lack of police officers/border control officers available to do searching ? 
  it does n't clearly seem like an area where the uk would win by using the army , and i doubt that this is a fix that will just require a temporary band-aid from the army . 
  this will likely be an ongoing , long term issue that would want resources permanently allocated to it , right ? 
   ban ferries from calais docking at british ports when it gets like this . 
  that 's certainly a possibility . 
  that might be very disruptive to both french and british companies , though , since calais would inherently become an unreliable route . 
  i 'd think that searching might make more sense . 
   start deporting illegal immigrants . 
  that 'd also be viable , though it would require the large step of changing uk treaties to eliminate a guaranteed review period for people claiming political asylum . 
   stop paying them benefits . 
  during the refugee review process ? 
  i do n't think that would work . 
  you could just eliminate the possibility of getting a review process , but you ca n't just not provide food to someone waiting for a refugee review and keep doing those reviews -- you 'd have starving , desperate people in the uk then . 
  that 's a fair point -- i was actually thinking about the undercarriage issue . 
  you * could * probably put a plate over the bottom of trucks , but it would definitely exacerbate maintenance . 
  the canvas is n't something that i 'd considered , but how often are canvas-sided trucks used today ? 
  i can think of almost no cases in the us outside of military vehicles . 
  the only real current case i can think of are civilian small jeeps that sometimes have fabric sides , or some convertable sports cars , and neither would seem to be terribly at-risk ( you 'd notice someone climbing in on those ) . 
  my objection was that it 's required that someone pretend to be a disinterested party providing a neutral opinion to deceive the other person into thinking that an ordinary person did so ; this leverages the [ bandwagon effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandwagon_effect ) : people trying to adapt their views to that of what the majority thinks . 
  the users in question do n't pretend to be some disinterested british person saying `` hey ... i never was familiar with this putin guy , but i 've been seeing him recently , and he seems to be really sensible . 
  his arguments seem to be a lot more truthful than ukraine 's . '', 
  that would be shilling . 
  having some russian nationalist types come in and say `` ukraine shot down mh17 and then nato plotted with them to forge evidence of russian artillery in fake satellite pictures ... '' is not shilling . 
  it may be propagadizing , and it may be entirely-false , and it certainly does not need to be something that you accept , but it 's not shilling . 
  english historically must have had similar ordering , because i remember older english texts using the german-style numbers . 
  [ `` sing a song of sixpence '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sing_a_song_of_sixpence ) has :  sing a song of sixpence ,   a pocket full of rye . 
    ** four and twenty ** blackbirds ,   baked in a pie . 
   do you honestly not think that they have tried this ? 
  yes . 
  are there people with gasoline angle grinders taking the locks off , or is it just the trucks with flimsy locks being hit by people with bolt cutters ? 
   cant we just shoot them ? 
  i 'm from the us , and quite enthusiastic about firearms and civilian possession of firearms , so you hopefully are n't going to get a politically-influenced answer here : no . 
  and it 's for the same reason that you normally are n't permitted to shoot people outside of defending life in the us ( outside of a few oddball exceptions , like texas permitting people to shoot someone at nighttime if they do n't feel that they can otherwise safely stop them from spraying graffiti or similar ... [ texas penal code 2.9.42.2 . a ] ( http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/sotwdocs/pe/htm/pe.9.htm ) ) . 
  it 's because if that person feels that their life is at danger from * you * , then they become willing to try and kill you before you kill them , and things escalate , and the costs may become higher than any benefits . 
  if you can potentially make the situation static and then address it ( e.g. 
  large-scale roundups and jailing people ) or there are other alternatives , they 're likely preferable . 
  and while illegal immigration from calais may be a serious problem , and it may be very frustrating , and people may even feel that government is being less-than-responsive to their concerns , i think that most would agree that there are a number of less-costly alternatives that would plausibly work that have not yet been made use of . 
  that does n't mean that all the alternatives may be * nice * , but i 'd suggest that the uk should probably consider even major steps like withdrawing from treaties providing refugees a guaranteed position while their status is evaluated long before it simply starts having illegal immigrants summarily-shot . 
  perhaps the french labor market for unskilled african immigrants has become more-saturated than the british one is , if there 's been easier access for a long time to it ? 
  i am sympathetic to the idea that there are immigration issues to be addressed , but honestly , the problem of dealing with people stealing goods and trying to smuggle themselves into the uk and forcing goods that have had stowaways in contact with them seems like it should be easily-addressed . 
  just get yourself a new lock for your truck rear that is bolt-cutter resistant and lock the truck ; they wo n't be able to get in . 
  surely there are n't people running around with gasoline angle grinders working on the locks on trucks ? 
    was n't the mayor of reykjavik a former comedian   correct .

  new york has had [ both new york city trying to secede from new york state and new york state trying to secede from new york city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secession_in_new_york ) . 
  however , because us senate representation is granted as a fixed amount per state , and senate approval would be required , every other state has an interest in blocking this . 
  ditto for california 's [ many attempts to split itself up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partition_and_secession_in_california ) ; not going to go anywhere .

  also , i suspect that '' - lite '' in that role is one of the most common english examples ; [ as wiktionary has it ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lite ) :  2010 april 8 , `` sovereign debt crisis at ` boiling point ' , warns bank for international settlements '' , telegraph.co.uk :    the analysis bolsters claims by the tories that markets will not wait patiently as britain draws up leisurely plans for austerity - ** lite **,

   plenty of non-russians who shill for russia in their own country . 
  that 's not shilling ; the intent to deceive is a necessary component of [ shilling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shill ) :  shill typically refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers the impression that they are an enthusiastic independent customer of a seller ( or marketer of ideas ) for whom they are secretly working . 
  the person or group who hires the shill is using crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to purchase the goods or services ( or accept the ideas being marketed ) . 
  shills are often employed by professional marketing campaigns . 
  `` plant '' and `` stooge '' more commonly refer to any person who is secretly in league with another person or organization while pretending to be neutral or actually a part of the organization he is planted in , such as a magician 's audience , a political party , or an intelligence organization ( see double agent ) . 
  if someone comes into / r/europe with a russian flair and says `` russia is phenomenal and ukraine blows chunks and also the cia and mi6 did maidan '' , that 's not shilling for russia . 
  it 's just plain old supporting russia . 
  it may well contain factually-inaccurate claims , but it should n't be called `` shilling '' . 
  now that is a clear example of somewhere that should be outsourcing labor . 
  hmm . 
  is an `` intrinsic '' french adjective comparable in role to that of a [ compound noun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_compound#compound_nouns ) in english ? 
  this is satire critical of the imf 's practice of asking greece to cut government spending . 
  surely you 're not proposing that a bunch of outraged people from the imf are going to run into the * charlie hebdo * offices and start killing people ? 
   corporatism is destroying the economic base particularly of the anglophone nations mentioned i think that the english-speaking countries have pretty strong economies , and they are n't growing weaker . 
  in what sense do you mean `` destroying the economic base '' ? 
   i honestly believe europe is targeted by the tpp , tia etc as the anglophone response is to capture economic growth at the expense of their own people ( working , lower middle classes ) and europe . 
  well , trade agreements from a well-educated , wealthy country to a less-well-educated , poorer one will probably be at least immediately somewhat disadvantageous to less-skilled workers in the wealthy country in that they get a larger increase in competitive pressures . 
  if i can ask for $ n/hour to do a piece of work that requires no really complex skillset , and someone in china only wants $ 0.10 n/hour to do the same work for the same skillset , certainly my job ( which , in an ideal , efficient market , would be the job that i most want to be doing of the options available to me ) is going to probably evaporate ; the chinese farmer is n't going to be pushing an ox , but moved to a factory assembly line . 
  on the other hand , that also decreases cost of unskilled labor in that country ; that means that for some guy making a movie ( where the us * is * internationally-competitive in exports ) , his shoes are available more cheaply , which cuts his cost of creating the movie . 
  i do n't know exactly what lowering trade barriers between europe and the us would do ( or what the trade balance looks like ; it might be that europe would increase exports to the us , the us to china , and china to europe ) . 
  europe and the us are more-comparable economies , so i would n't expect it to have the same effect described above as lowering trade barriers between the us and china . 
   this is accurate . 
  most americans think europe is too liberal and far right politicians actually use `` euro-style socialism '' as a derogatory term as to where `` our country is headed '' . 
  please note that / u/jim _ laheyistheliquor is using `` liberalism '' here in the [ * american * sense of the word ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_liberalism_in_the_united_states ) , not in the international sense , just to complicate things a bit ; in his comment , `` liberal '' means `` left of center '' . 
  :-)  however , the government prefers the eu , as a united entity is easier to manipulate and control for military purposes and corporate interests like you mentioned . 
  i do n't have any special insight there , but i kinda doubt that . 
  nato is already a military organization , and certainly an eu has more independence than just a bunch of nato members in that it establishes another framework for military cooperation , and does n't include the us . 
  i guess that it might be easier to negotiate trade agreements with the eu as a one-off instead of doing twenty different negotiations , and that could be seen as benefiting us export companies if it results in opening markets , but ... 
  that came off as weird to me as an english-speaker when first running into spanish , but i had to admit that the romance approach makes a lot of sense . 
  with the romance style ( noun modifier modifer modifier ... ) , you get the general gist of what 's being said and then narrow it . 
  you do n't have to remember and mentally-retain a long , in-progress string of modifiers : you can narrow as you go . 
  with the english style ( modifier modifier modifier ... noun ) , you need to retain all the modifiers to start to convert them into meaning in your head . 
  think of the [ joke about the german language ] ( http://blog.ivman.com/fun-with-german/ ) , of which i 've heard a number of variants :  an american businessman goes into negotiations with a german company . 
  the company sends over a representative , who speaks no english .
