  it represented labor competition for non-slave workers , who did n't want wages to drop . 
  those are all negative things , but they 're still * practical * problems , things that you could address with a well-chosen policy . 
  how do you adopt a policy that can reconcile two sides in a religious war ? 
  it 's hard to horse-trade and compromise when you 're talking about someone 's fundamental views about existence and what people should do . 
  do you object to , say , israel spying on the us ? 
  also , keep in mind that in some ways the us enjoys certain special status . 
  it 's probably a * lot * easier for the us to compromise one of the major certificate authorities ( or simply get a us-based root certificate authority to participate in compromising something ) than it would be for , say , vietnam . 
  the us gets a certain amount of trust extended to it to sit in that position , and if it gets used that in ways that others do n't like , one might ask why others would n't object to that status . 
  actually , most us state flags are godawful . 
  embarrassingly bad . 
  they also never got the degree of usage that european nation flags got , so there probably was n't as much impetus to improve them . 
  state police stations probably have them , and various state administration buildings , but they are n't going to make a showing at , say , sporting events or major diplomatic affairs . 
  most of them were made back when the states were small , i assume did n't have a lot of money to go throw at frivolous things like some symbol being designed , and * very * frequently they just took a blue field and slapped the state seal on it . 
  state seals are detailed and hard-to-see at a distance ; flags are intended to be easily-recognizable at a distance . 
  they really do not mix . 
  a lot of flags have text on them . 
  some of them have some ... well , i would n't call them particularly nice color schemes ; think of [ nebraska 's state flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/flag_of_nebraska.svg ) . 
  a lot of them are kinda variants on the us flag scheme ( [ texas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_the_u.s._states#/media/file:flag_of_texas.svg ) falls for this , though its flag is so-well-known that i guess that it gets a pass , and it 's otherwise a well-designed flag , imho ) . 
  there are a few good us state flags ; [ new mexico ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_mexico#/media/file:flag_of_new_mexico.svg ) is my favorite , as it was designed to be a * flag * -- unique color combination , simple , easily-recognizable design , no text . 
  it 's evocative of new mexico , if you know anything about its history ; not just another combination of red , white , and blue , so it 's easy to remember . 
  my only wish is that its symbol was a bit larger , to make it even more-clearly recognizable at small size and at distance . 
  some of the states from the us south have better flags : simple , visible at a distance , because they got new flags after the confederate era -- newer , more thought put into them . 
  texas is n't my favorite , but it meets the bar for simplicity and recognizability , and it 's one of the few state flags that everyone recognizes . 
  almost all of the us states in the northeast have absolutely terrible flags , since they 're really old and tended to the state-seal-on-blue . 
  [ here 's the whole set of us flags ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_the_u.s._states#current_state_flags ) . 
  it means that / r/stateball often has extremely-difficult-to-recognize comics , even from a standpoint of us residents . 
  i 'd like to see most us states go out and produce a modernized flag , one designed to really be a flag . 
  a response might be `` but nobody knows or cares about the flag '' , and i 'd say `` that 's because nobody uses them because they 're so awful '' . 
  the ones that are nice * do * get used and recognized -- texas and new mexico , for example , do really show up . 
  few people are going to want to fly the [ state flag of idaho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_the_u.s._states#/media/file:flag_of_idaho.svg ) , though . 
  just waiting all year to be in-character ... 
  monitoring of internet backbone traffic in the us was widely considered to be conspiracy theory material at one point . 
  we tried that in 1812 . 
  * turns out that americans were n't very enthusiastic about invading canada or fighting to take it over . 
  * turns out that canadians were very enthusiastic about fighting back . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure that both sides are pretty happy with the existing arrangement . 
  where the borders were an impediment , the us and canada broke them down , as for nafta or for nato . 
  i understand that -- but i do n't really get the impression that the uk is just hell-bent on trying to cherry-pick positives , but wants to be part of a looser confederation . 
  i 've seen a number of people on here from the uk who are opposed to federation with the rest of europe say that they 'd be entirely happy not to have a veto on things that do n't apply to them -- they just want to have a limited union . 
  that might very well be something that can not be reconciled with what the rest of europe wants . 
  personally , i think that it * can * -- just because we today have a very fixed idea of a `` nation-state '' does n't mean that the eu has to look exactly like that . 
  the eu 's unusual in many ways -- forming peacefully , often having a venn diagram describing various sorts of memberships that * is n't * just `` in or out '' : heck , to us eyes , the uk itself looks like a pretty complicated venn diagram . 
  i think that it would be a shame if people who wanted a federation tried to force the uk to step in or step out , rather than having a mechanism to permit confederation for those states that want that . 
  the us and the uk and a number of other european countries have their * own * oddball relationships -- independent military alliances , territories with people who may-or-may-not have the same status as people living in the main country . 
  they were n't dead-set on homogenizing every inch of things . 
  true , what i 've heard proposed of the uk goes beyond that in many ways , but it 's not clear that it would be a bad thing for the eu or the uk . 
  the uk wants to have trade , and to have military arrangements . 
  it does n't want full schengen adoption . 
  it does n't want some finance issues to be merged . 
  as long as the uk is okay with things that do not apply to it being decided without it , why must it be expected to `` get in or get out '' ? 
  are the logistics of a limited membership truly that complicated ? 
  as long as the uk does n't actually restrict other members who do want to do so from creating a closer union , how does it hurt those other members for the uk to have a looser union ? 
  are they worse off for it in any way ? 
  that 's a good point . 
  i 'm not familiar with the program personally , but it has been brought up over-and-over on this forum whenever people talk about interacting with people in other countries in europe . 
  i admit that when i first heard the description , i was skeptical -- foreign-exchange never seemed like a society-altering thing in the us , though might be a fantastic intro for future diplomats or business folks who will be crossing national lines professionally on a regular basis -- but that does n't seem to mesh at all with the impression i get here , where many people talk about experiences via erasmus . 
  there are jokes about a lot of alcohol and sex , and people were semi-serious about it ... but it really does clearly seem to establish cross-country friendships and regard for other countries , and insofar as that was the goal , it seems like a success . 
  on the other hand , / r/europe may well not be a representative sample of europe 's population ... but certainly at least here , it seems to have some impact . 
  eh , the us has n't taken the first necessary step of competing in eurovision . 
  probably one of the easier unions to establish . 
  but let 's look at a couple of the logistical concerns/drawbacks : * how enthusiastic would the uk be in probably playing second fiddle to the us ? 
  * geographically , eliminates one thing that the us has liked , which is its geographic disconnect from a lot of unpleasantnesses . 
  i suspect that aussies have a somewhat-similar view about the northern hemisphere . 
  they 'd have to buy into more geographic involvement . 
  * two of those countries fought a bloody war for their independence from the uk ; while the us might have been a long time ago , ireland was very much not . 
  canada fought a war for independence against the us . 
  the other countries spent a long time diplomatically establishing independence . 
  are they all willing to reverse that ( albeit not being colonies , but members in a union ) ? 
  * the uk has the nhs and other social benefits that the us does n't . 
  does the uk become uncompetitive , or does the us adopt economic policies that have been anathema to it ? 
  and i see some concern from other parts of the uk for the wealthy , more-liberal london influencing policy in their parts of the country ... ireland even more so . 
  how much greater would this be were the uk to be attached to those other countries ? 
  * the us has the most-heavily-armed citizenry in the world by far ( [ partly as a result of the uk 's policies to try to block arms from anyone but the gentry to ensure political control ] ( http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa46.htm ) ) , and the uk hates having pocket knives being carried . 
  who gives up their cherished views on citizen possession of weaponry ? 
  * ireland avoided nato because its populace did n't like military involvement . 
  the us went from pre-world-war-i isolationist extraordinaire to poking its nose into every corner of the world . 
  how would that be reconciled ? 
  * religion more-or-less took a nosedive in the uk . 
  it 's substantially more-important in the us ( particularly because of central american immigration and poorer places in the us south ) . 
  australia 's also significantly more-conservative on a number of points . 
  how would the uk feel in abruptly being a relatively-small chunk of the population in a place that often has much-more conservative social values ? 
  * how would heavy uk drug use mesh with severe us federal drug penalties ? 
  * new zealand and australia are a major target for illegal immigration from southeast asia , which is at least a very large potential source of population . 
  how would the uk ( or the us , or canada , for that matter ) feel about their national border being in this region ? 
  * the uk still at least notionally has the royals . 
  the us took a very strong stand against royalty . 
  while in both cases , this might be somewhat-historic , it would still be merging one of the earliest anti-monarchist countries with one of the few remaining monarchies . 
  * the uk has a state religion . 
  the us has extreme strictures against state religion ( despite being relatively-religious ... ) . 
  this is probably less-interesting than it was three hundred years ago , but ... 
  i do agree that on many things , from a liberal economy and legal traditions to reliance on sea trade and language , that an anglospheria would make sense . 
  the uk controls a lot of the islands in the atlantic , and the us a lot of the islands in the pacific ; merged with australia and new zealand , it would create a vast range of ocean control . 
  the eu is in a formal legal sense , a much-closer agglomeration than the anglosphere , but the last time the anglosphere had a war between members was the war of 1812 , and they 've consistently come out to back each other since that time ( with the exception of the suez crisis , i guess ? 
  ) ; in that sense , the anglosphere has a higher degree of closeness . 
  and from the uk 's standpoint , i can understand some of the argument ; the uk is n't enthralled with a lot of eu policy , and feels both uncomfortable with a major country forming up next to it that it 's not part of * and * with adopting those policies itself . 
  on / r/europe , you can see enthusiasm on the continent for * forcing * the uk to adopt policies by using the lever of expulsion . 
  if you 're economically-liberal and in the uk , this would definitely permanently resolve your political concerns about , say , the eu ramming through a financial transaction tax on you , and you would n't need to worry about not being part of that country and being clobbered by in in 100 years . 
  ( on the other hand , if you 're left and in the uk , this would be very alarming ... ) but , yes , if the us were to merge with someone and were n't to do it on purely-geographic grounds , merging with part of the anglosphere beyond canada would probably make sense . 
  remember that the anglosphere already operates together , from [ spying on things ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes ) ( except ireland ) to military ( except ireland ) to free-trade agreements ( at least as of tpp and ttip , assuming that nobody manages to obstruct one , all of the above countries will be in a free trade zone ) . 
  the question would be whether unifying laws , permitting free population movement , and establishing common guarantees on rights and other legal practices would be desirable .
