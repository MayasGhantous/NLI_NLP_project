  just having an area where people can move around freely and regularly do so will tend to create homogenity , and having elites engage in trying to modify social norms via law seems likely to be difficult in * any * case . 
   one euro jobs , suppression of minimum wage [ shrug ] not much point , in my view . 
  if you want to subsidize people above market wage , just have the state give them money from taxes ( and if you 're really gung-ho on redistribution , make it be a wealth tax ) . 
  having the state mandate minimum wage just means that those jobs tend to be done elsewhere . 
  i suspect that the reason that minimum wage is permitted to exist is because it * does n't * have the degree of impact that proponents think that it does , so it does n't generate as much opposition from the other side of things . 
  not that i particularly want any of the above policies , but if one were a left-winger who wanted to successfully achieve wealth redistribution , that 's how you 'd want it to be done ; it would actually redistribute wealth . 
   complete disregard for massive anti-austerity movements ( austerity that even the imf considers to be harmful ) have those movements been dominant in the nations that would be extending credit-that-might-not-be-paid-back , like germany or france , or just in the nations that would be receiving it , like greece ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure that breaking up the eu would give greece less influence over its creditors and less ability to request those funds .

  well , it * does * refer to putting countries in a position of having to walk out the door or turn over powers to the eu . 
  that may or may not be a good idea , but certainly it does reflect sovereignty being turned over . 
  also , i 'd point out that : * it 's possible that there is some majority mechanism that could be used down the road to force states to stay in * there will be economic and other pressures that will make it difficult and economically-difficult to leave * trying to leave the eu of 2100 may look a bit different from trying to leave the eu of today , exit clause or no exit clause . 
  a us state could have left the us in 1777 without being attacked , but when they tried leaving in the 1860s , it meant war waged by the federal administration . 
  turning over sovereignty may be a good idea , but the eu * does * reflect handing over sovereignty . 
   maybe they 're just in the middle ? 
  come up with a consensus on where the `` middle '' is ; that just effectively hides the hard work that still has to be done .

  go back a couple decades and detroit had the highest per-capita income of any city in north america . 
  now it looks more-homogenous because people traveled around freely and intermarried for a couple centuries , but in the period when the us looked more politically like the eu does today , it definitely was n't all that homogenous in culture ( or even language , though it 's true that english was more-widespread then than europe started with ) . 
  ( thinks ) * the eu was created in the first place ; that 's a pretty big deal , and the disagreements are over the extent of it . 
  * europe is vastly more similar in social policy internally than it is with most of the rest of the world . 
  * adopting english seems to have become pretty widespread , and watching how much people in the us kick and scream over the not-remotely-plausible-threat of spanish becoming more-prevalent , that seems like a pretty big barrier to have gotten over . 
  heck , trying to people get the metric system was pretty tough here , and europe did that without problems . 
   we do n't pronounce ' - iz ' , we pronounce ' - is ' hmm . 
  that 's not how i 've heard brits pronounce the word , but just to confirm , i just checked both [ an online british spelling/pronunciation guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgtqojkuhsq&amp;t=3m9s ) and the [ oxford dictionary ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/civilize ) , and both seem to have a `` z '' sound in their pronunciation rules . 
  phase 1 is presumably more politically-acceptable than phase 2 . 
  i 've certainly no objection , but i think that you 're going to have some difficulty selling the populace of europe on ( a ) the us first amendment ( '' * nazis * ?

  [ 42 ] however , the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) recommends - ize and notes that the - ise spelling is from french : `` the suffix ... whatever the element to which it is added , is in its origin the greek - \u03b9\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd , latin - iz\u0101re ; and , as the pronunciation is also with z , there is no reason why in english the special french spelling should be followed , in opposition to that which is at once etymological and phonetic . '', 
  the oed lists the - ise form separately , as an alternative . 
  i 'm very sympathetic in asking schengen area countries to pool funds in doing border control , but non-schengen area countries ? 
  if france has logistical reasons for not simply letting all traffic over to the uk and letting the uk search * inbound * traffic ( which is one way of solving incentive issues , that it 's counter to french interests to successfully catch people that france does n't want to have to pay for ) , why not simply adopt a policy where french border control that finds anyone trying to illegally cross into the uk simply hand over those illegal border crossers to uk law enforcement ? 
  that certainly seems reasonable to me , and i ca n't see how the uk could complain about that . 
  what 's the uk upset about , people getting onto uk soil and then claiming refugee status there ? 
  i 'd think that the french would have the same complaint , after all . 
  i 'd think that the uk could find some loophole , like having people handed over to an offshore processing facility ( or , perhaps more-realistically , revising the refugee treaties if it turns out that there is n't a realistic way to make them work acceptably ) . 
   however most people who took part in this protest seem too dumb to know the difference between those two . 
  or they feel that refugee policy is simply being used as the most-viable route for immigration . 
  i 've seen what i 'd call fairly-compelling arguments for this position raised here , including : * unhappiness on the part of people claiming refugee status to stay in areas that are n't economic centers in europe ( e.g. 
  small towns in scandinavia ) . 
  if someone 's primary concern is finding temporary asylum to save their lives rather than to make more money , one would think that this would be less of an issue . 
  * the strong emphasis on young men coming over . 
  this is consistent with historic economic migration behavior , but not with refugee behavior . 
  * the fact that europe is not the easiest place to claim refugee status , yet the strong efforts to do so . 
  i 'm sure that there are other arguments that people have raised , but i find those reasonably-convincing . 
  i also read ... the name escapes me at the moment , but an autobiography written by an iraqi refugee to the uk ( who was successfully given refugee status ) . 
  certainly he had * some * argument for refugee status ( he had decided to skip out on his military service , and he would have been punished for doing so ) , but he clearly wanted to live in the uk , and his family viewed this as something of an investment . 
  the book illustrated some of the concerns that other people may worry about ; in this case , he got a job at a financial services company and stole a large sum of money to help fund other people in his family coming over . 
  destruction of passports to block ejection if a refugee application failed , another complaint , was also used by the author on multiple occasions certainly the book explained his rationale for doing so , and i suppose that it 's certainly possible to be sympathetic to his position , but it also very much supports the complaints of people who are not happy with that immigration . 
  also , i believe that the treatment of refugee status today may be a product of the holocaust , and the situation seen today is clearly not on par with what jews were dealing with during the holocaust . 
  mandatory military service may very well suck , but it is by no means a genocide of a people , nor is it viewed internationally as an unacceptable policy for a country to make use of . 
  i think that perhaps the issue is that refugee status was left intentionally somewhat-vague to permit courts to have flexibility in applying it ... but the downside is that if it was written to create a way of dealing with genocides , it is not being applied today in the way that its authors intended . 
  all that does not mean that perhaps europe should permit more legal immigration ; maybe a population is too-enthusiastic about trying to drive up wages by blocking any immigration , or that a population may over-estimate the cost of integration . 
  but it seems to me that trying to use refugee status as a loophole for that is a very bad idea : people naturally feel aggrieved if they clearly did not sign up for something and political leaders or advocates are attempting to exploit that policy to bypass the democratic process . 
  i do think that if someone * does * want more immigration , and particularly in a democratic , welfare-heavy state , where immigration has very real effects on how the treasure and political power of the country is allocated , it is incumbent upon them to make that argument honestly and convince the population . 
   eu-forced immigration down people 's throats has been a complete disaster in western europe for at least schengen area countries , i 'd think that having the eu set a unified immigration policy is pretty reasonable . 
  if it did n't , it 'd be possible to just immigrate to another schengen area country and then move to the desired country . 
  now , the present immigration policy may not be a good idea , but if you do n't have internal borders in an area , i do n't see what it buys to have different policies on immigration . 
  you 're going to wind up with whatever the immigration policy is being `` shoved down the throat '' of the countries involved , regardless of whatever it finally comes out to be .

  wikipedia says that it [ was to address counterfeiting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/made_in_germany ) :  the label was originally introduced in britain by the merchandise marks act 1887 , [ 1 ] to mark foreign produce more obviously , as foreign manufactures had been falsely marking inferior goods with the marks of renowned british manufacturing companies and importing them into the united kingdom . 
  most of these were found to be originating from germany , whose government had introduced a protectionist policy to legally prohibit the import of goods in order to build up domestic industry ( merchandise marks act - oxford university press ) i do n't really understand why they would n't just enforce trademark law , though , rather than deal with country-of-origin , were that the case .

  the reference to the fruit of the tropical plant ( from resemblance of shape ) is first recorded 1660s , and pine cone emerged 1690s to replace pineapple in its original sense except in dialect .
