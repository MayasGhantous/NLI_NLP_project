  it 's patently-obvious now and always was that euro and eu entry is not irreversible .

  where are these investors who are incapable of opening their eyes until a grexit suddenly does so for them ? 
  maybe it would start other undesirable-to-federalists trends , like the public in other countries starting to think about leaving as more of a viable option for themselves , but investors ? 
  right now , as i understand it , the people who would eat losses from debt forgiveness would be those taxpayers , since they shifted the debt to their countries . 
  if french and german and so forth taxpayers want to vote to eat the greek losses and then resume with the subsidies , i do n't think that anyone will stop them . 
  china went from having the state encourage large families ( because mao felt that insufficient population was making the state weaker ) to having the state adopt [ one child ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one-child_policy ) ( because post-mao reformers in the late 1970s were concerned about what would happen to the country if over-populated ) . 
  direct result of state policy-setting , and a good illustration of what the state can do if it wants to do so . 
  mostly , though not always : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic-economic_paradox  roughly speaking , nations or subpopulations with higher gdp per capita are observed to have fewer children , even though a richer population can support more children . 
  a couple comments :  1 . 
  parents can assume all their children will live to adulthood it 's not merely compensating for mortality , because population is actually growing in poor countries . 
  you do n't need to think of relying on them utterly in your old age . 
  that 's true , though perhaps our society factored in something of an incentive to having children around . 
   if we were smart about solving the huge immigration crisis in north africa - we would concentrate on helping the people there get richer . 
  i 'm not sure that that 'd be a great way to address overpopulation in africa , but it 'd sure make it a more-competitively-appealing place to live . 
   of particular contention is a clause that would allow users to sue companies who process data , such as cloud storage providers , as well as those that own it or collect it . 
  companies including amazon and ibm have warned that it could kill off europe 's cloud computing industry . 
  well , this is entertaining . 
  last year , everyone was talking about how the us 's * lack * of privacy meant that it would kill off the us 's cloud computing industry . 
  seems that you really ca n't win in the cloud computing world . 
   over 2010 to 2012 , members of the ecb executive board , such as lorenzo bini smaghi regularly gave speeches depicting the depicting a potential greek default as provoking `` an economic meltdown '' . 
  for example , bini smaghi argued that a default should be avoided because it would `` punish patient investors '' who believed in the adjustment program could restore sustainability , that a default would discourage investors from providing money to any euro-area member state and that `` the payment of debts should be enforced , through sanctions if need be . '' or gunboats perhaps . 
  if those investors were * wrong * , would n't it be just fine for them to feel pain ? 
  the publication changed the article and listed the change at the bottom as having been an error in the original article . 
  do any of these things actually threaten the eu 's existence ? 
  i mean , sure , they are n't great , but i could see this sort of thing showing up in another country , and it would n't immediately result in people saying that the country would be about to fail . 
   the imf is looking at by far the largest nonpayment by a borrower in its history . 
  true , there are good reasons to think enough foam has been placed on the runway to prevent financial contagion . 
  yet , this was asserted with respect to long-term capital management , subprime mortgages and the fall of lehman brothers . 
  perhaps the world , broadly and in general , should not extend itself as far as it has on debt ? 
  or are we always to be finding and fighting against the one weak beam that risks bringing the whole tower down ? 
   they are just a bunch of teens who smoke dank kush and dont have any direction what to do . 
  i doubt that this will go anywhere , but i 'd point out that you can probably look back and find that the bulk of small countries probably started out with a handful of teens or just-out-of-teens . 
  you can see the author 's other articles , and they 're [ more-or-less in line ] ( http://www.salon.com/writer/alex_henderson/ ) with this one .

  if that 's the case , and you 're concerned about the specific community rather than just wanting an abstract to rabble-rouse , why not name said communities ? 
   in the us it means being progressive and/or left wing . 
  yup . 
  is n't that the opposite ? 
  the uk is ( potentially ) pro eu , but not pro eurozone . 
   in that context , we want to make good use of our place in the international organisations we participate as a european country , but also with traditional friends like russia i 'd understood that there was a chance that greece would get booted out of the eurozone but not the eu , but if it 's offering an eu veto to russia , i assume that the other members will probably be less-than-thrilled .

  the us can and does send in the national guard in exigent circumstances .

  the question of their children is interesting ; this was mentioned recently here in a discussion about gypsies , and i went to read about it . 
  generally-speaking , the americas ( not just the united states , but both geographical continents ) adopt the policy of [ * jus soli * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) , by which if someone is born on the soil of a country , regardless of whether their parents had any legal right to be there , they become a fully-legal citizen . 
  so if a family from central america illegally-immigrates to the us , and has a child , that child will grow up as a legal us citizen , as long as their birth was on us soil . 
  their parents may never become legal citizens or residents , may stay in the shadows , but this is no more than a one-generation long affair . 
  the rest of the world , including europe , generally makes use of [ * jus sanguinis * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=jus_sanguinis ) , by which someone 's parents must also legally be citizens of a country in order for them to receive citizenship . 
  it seems to me that there are some advantages and disadvantages to each , depending upon one 's goals . 
  if someone 's primary concern is that a * people * not show up illegally , * jus sanguinis * is certainly more-appealing . 
  it permits barring people from becoming citizens unless they are permitted to do so . 
  if someone 's primary concern is that a person not raised in the country ( e.g. 
  not having gone through its educational system , raised with its values , etc ) , then * jus soli * makes more sense . 
  if you do n't care where someone 's ancestry was from , just how they were raised , this sort of model makes more sense . 
  the original discussion that i was reading was talking about how gypsies as a class could exist in europe -- the point was that a landless people could exist , because they simply did n't get legal citizenship in the country where they lived , and their children wound up in the same position . 
  it was an interesting read . 
  in the context of illegal immigrants from africa wandering europe , it made me wonder if another , similar , landless class without legal citizenship anywhere might again be established , based upon the present immigration . 
  because soldiers and militia ( at least in the us : i realize that sometimes the lines are more-blurred in some countries , where the police and the military are more-similar ) are structured to apply force to a matter . 
  police are structured to apply a limited amount of force to a matter , to keep it from spiraling out-of-control , and to limit damage . 
  if you want an example of soldiers/militia being used where police would have been a better idea , think of the [ kent state shootings in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kent_state_shootings ) . 
  you had a protest which dramatically-escalated as a result of use of the state militia where the additional force that they could provide was n't really required and where the lack of familiarity with limiting a response turned out to be really important . 
  you had a bunch of scared , armed state militia with rocks and tear gas canisters being thrown at them . 
  the tools that they 're trained to use and had available were the bayonet and the rifle , and those were used . 
  there 's a time and a place for that , but kent state was not quelling a civil uprising : it was dealing with a protest or perhaps a minor riot . 
  the end result was very harmful to the goals that the people who called up the militia wanted -- it led to a huge political backlash , and a political loss for them . 
  police could n't apply as much physical force as the state militia or the army , but they were easily capable of maintaining public order , and they would have been much-more-effective at achieving the political goals here . 
  let 's say that you call up the french military . 
  true , the particular illegal immigrants in question would not stand against them -- they 'd be forced back , and some might be killed .
