  but there 's no real question of the police lacking the ability to maintain order , though perhaps they might need to call up reinforcements ; the military is not yet necessary . 
  in calling * up * the military , you make it more-likely that there will be killings , and that politically , this appears to be a war . 
  that may very well not serve the interests of the country , if it leads to international condemnation , or sympathy for the illegal immigrants , or terrorism in other countries as a response . 
  i 'm not saying that the ottoman empire was ideal , just that it did n't adopt the practice of killing off europeans in areas that it controlled . 
  those are h1b visas , and there are not many issued . 
  ( unfortunately ), 
   run like hell to silicon valley . 
  http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/tech-careers/a-snapshot-of-software-engineering-salaries-at-silicon-valley-startups  for engineers who have n't yet moved into management , according to the riviera partners ' study , c/c + + and java developers pulled in an average of $ 143,000 annually , with python developers slightly behind at $ 141,000 . 
  ( spectrum 's most recent ranking of popular programming languages puts java on top . ), 
  for engineers with some experience in working with distributed-computing framework hadoop , however , the average salary jumps to $ 150,000 . 
  these numbers are all up from 2013 , when riviera found that senior engineers specializing in java averaged $ 135,000 and c/c + + $ 119,000 ; hadoop experience was n't analyzed at that time . 
    the picture changes somewhat when engineers move into management . 
  in 2014 , managers of c/c + + teams had the edge , at $ 161,000 , followed by python at $ 159,000 , hadoop at $ 152,000 , and java at $ 151,000 . 
  at present conversion rates , $ 143k/yr is $ 10,500 monthly . 
  additionally , taxation is lower over here . 
  churches are not-uncommonly associated with providing food to a community in the united states , either via providing space to prepare and serve food and affiliated with other charities , or the food itself . 
  what does `` bankrupt '' mean in this context ? 
  within a country , it 's a legal status to establish protection from debtors , either deferring or canceling debts , but that obviously does n't apply * to * a country . 
  yeah , was n't trying to criticize your statement -- i was kinda unclear . 
  i 'm just regretting that things seem to work that way . 
  some of the most-objectionable policies that i can think of seem to come from incidents like that . 
  that did n't happen in the ottoman empire , which spanned africa/asia/europe . 
  it just had people from all three continents . 
   guess what , they never in their life had the same kind of stable school system etc like we have in the eu . 
  i 'm not saying that `` provide worldwide schooling '' is a bad public-policy solution , but : * it 's not clear that it can scale to global levels . 
  you 're talking about trying to reconstruct the lives of many , many people . 
  or , perhaps you 're thinking about some subset of those , but then perhaps you 'd want to consider how you 'd control the extent of the policy scaling up . 
  if you want to , say , pull in 10m people from the third world and educate them and convert them into comparable members of society , how do you intend to then `` turn off the tap '' at that point ? 
  * i would be willing to wager that you 'd find that subsidizing overseas education to the tune of $ n would be more-popular than pulling in the world 's population and then funding education to $ n. 
  that 's both because of the `` i do n't want change in my domestic environment '' concern from all the people who do n't want large-scale immigration , * and * because it seems strange to adopt a policy that disadvantages those who do not break the law and illegally-immigrate and advantages those who do . 
  * if that 's the goal , i think that i 'd be upfront about it . 
  this seems like a very roundabout way of going about such a policy . 
  why not simply propose `` we plan to adopt , as a goal , funding worldwide education ? 
  '' , and then shift the debate to that ? 
  and let 's say that germany * does * want to import large numbers of people . 
  okay , that 's a fair goal -- i could see wanting this to address population concerns . 
  why on earth not simply say `` we are accepting , at any of our our embassies , applications for 10m immigrant slots ; no skill , education , civil knowledge , or language requirement applies to these slots '' ? 
  that seems like a vastly-smoother way to handle that issue . 
  you eliminate the problems created by people trying to operate outside the law . 
  you do have to sell that policy to the public , but that really should also apply to the * status quo * . 
  in general , i 'm not a huge fan of the `` single incident becomes massively publicized and then there 's a huge backlash '' approach to policy-making . 
  < shrug  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_local `` the local ab ''  the company also owns the largest english-language discussion forums in germany ( toytown germany ) and switzerland ( english forum ) . 
  the initial [archive.org ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20040416015335/http://www.thelocal.se/ ) snapshot of the website has it appear to have started out as a pretty humble english-language news site that grew from 2004 on . 
  i do n't know of any state funding sources , if that 's what you 're asking about . 
  the webserver is hosted at 46.20.229.3 , run by a colo company `` melbourne '' out of the uk ; the same address is reached regardless of the nameserver forwarding the request , even if located in sweden . 
  their [ contact page ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/page/view/contact ) pretty openly lists employees ; [ emma l\u00f6fgren ] ( https://twitter.com/ekjlofgren ) is one , and [ paul rapacioli ] ( https://twitter.com/paulrapacioli ) another . 
  it looks like the swedish branch staff [ resides in sweden ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/page/view/aboutus ) . 
  `` vassal '' is an exaggeration . 
  sure , he 's trying to use the possibility of military force to influence sweden ... but * many * countries do that to other countries , including smaller countries against larger . 
  and if you read the article text , it can easily be read as doing nothing more than insinuating that in the event of a nato-russia conflict , it would result in sweden being involved , as well as russia performing the preparation for that . 
  there 's no explicit threat of a ukraine or a georgia against sweden . 
  `` egg freckles ? '', 
  seriously , you 'd think that we could at least manage a 5,000,000-americans-in-jail scandal . 
  yeah , you should travel abroad to watch people watching us movies and thereby enrich yourself !, 
   one thing will surely come out of the whole thing , and that 's quantum encryption . 
  at least for armies and other state-level actors ( over fixed links , ca n't get reliable entanglement over the air ) . 
  not clear that this is viable for practical use . 
  and [ one-time pads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one-time_pad ) are available now , are pretty well-understand , and do n't rely on any special physical properties to work -- just information theory . 
   you see , the mortar and pestle was perfected some 12000 years ago or so , and has n't changed since . 
  [ welll ... ] ( http://www.amazon.com/kitchenaid-kfp1466er-14-cup-processor-system/dp/b00lewutbs/ ) do n't get me wrong -- i 'm not saying that quantum mechanics does n't have important materials science implications , but i 'd be very skeptical about `` quantum computing '' being the next big technology/society/science-of-the - world-shifting technology just because the transistor was the last . 
  i 'd be more inclined to favor artificial general intelligence getting important breakthroughs -- we 're well-behind where a lot of people thought that we 'd be . 
  and we 're pretty confident that this can be * done * , that there are no fundamental limitations -- it 's just a matter of figuring things out . 
  the market blesses the arbitragers . 
  they appear to have someone on-staff who is [ really gung-ho about quantum computing ] ( http://www.economist.com/topics/quantum-computing ) . 
  i guess that 's not totally-crazy , since the transistor miniaturization drove a lot of the economic changes around the world for the last hundred years , but it 's not at all clear that anything important will come from quantum computing . 
  well , they spend a non-minor amount of time complaining about us gun rights and us prison policy ( the latter showing up on this cover , in fact ) . 
  i think that they 'd just like a more-economically-right uk . 
  did you know that between the two , the term `` blockbusting '' [ referred to the american practice of acquiring blocks of real estate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blockbusting ) by inserting a black family into a block , triggering white flight to get out before real estate prices collapsed , which * itself * induced real estate price collapse , and then buying up the land on the cheap ? 
  well now you know , and knowing is half the battle !, 
  i was just [ talking with some other users here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3a1vxs/german_source_european_court_of_human_rights/cs99fxy ) about what exactly `` human dignity '' means , and they pointed out that you can learn what it is from watching how it is applied by legal bodies . 
  i continue to learn ... 
  i understand , but that 's not quite what i 'm asking -- that 's explaining why other europeans might be irked . 
  i 'm saying that if you 're the greek government , the syriza-and-company coalition , what would you have done differently for the last six months , given the constraints present ? 
  the actions above seems to be what the greek public did or were reported to do , not what the greek government did . 
  i 'm guessing that the organization ( `` russian investigative commission '' ) is a slightly-mangled form of the [ investigative committee of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/investigative_committee_of_russia ) , the federal police that answer to the russian executive . 
  that leaves two questions for me : how high is his actual role , and was he speaking in an official capacity here ? 
  [ this article ] ( http://en.sledcom.ru/press/interview/item/1325/ ) seems to indicate that he 's the top pr guy in that organization ... i guess that this might be comparable to whoever the head public relations guy is at the fbi in the us . 
  it * is n't * clear that he was definitely speaking in an official capacity from the article , though . 
   so they would have to pay the old debts before even being considered in the international bond market . 
  < shrug  i 'd think that it would depend on how much this debt being paid off or not actually impacts the expectation of lenders that future debts would be paid off . 
  if lenders look at the present debt and think `` yeah , i would n't pay that myself '' , but then they lend money under terms that they find would be plausibly paid-back , then i do n't think that greece need lose access to lenders . 
  as lender bob , i do n't have any real reason to have solidarity with you as lender joe . 
  if i think that you made a dumb lending decision and got burned for it , i 'm not going to pass up a viable opportunity myself for it . 
  i 'm doubtful that this debt being paid off is that interesting to lenders . 
  i mean , i 'd be more willing to purchase a greek bond if greece considered itself to have zero * other * outstanding debt than if greece considered itself to be overwhelmingly in debt . 
  consider this scenario . 
  the greek people pass something weighty , like a constitutional mandate , which zeroes debt and then establishes bounds on debt -- maybe that no more debt can be taken out once debt passes 25 % of gdp , say , and that any new debt acquired beyond 50 % of gdp will never be paid by the state in the future , even if it turns out that gdp or debt numbers had been fraudulent at the time . 
  they claim that they 're doing a [ solon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solon ) -- a one-time wipe of debt necessary for the state to go on . 
  i find that plausible , and i believe that the greek people are willing and able to conform to this and pay on future debt . 
  i buy their bond offering . 
  greece pays . 
  where does greece get cut off from credit in this scenario ? 
  oh , existing creditors are angry , but can they do anything other than cutting off greece from their own funds , or maybe trying to pressure new creditors ? 
  i simply do n't see how one could plausibly prevent greece from offering to sell ious . 
   rich people have capital gains , stock holdings and property that ca n't be legally taxed more than 2 % a year . 
  that makes us capital gains tax look brutal . 
  if you were the greek government , what would you do differently , presuming that you were going to default ? 
   just like if you stop paying a credit card , you 're first priority is to get your personal situation in order before paying back what you owe ... but you still owe it . 
  i do n't understand why this is absolutely true . 
  if creditors can apply pressure , they probably will .
