  certainly , they have no reason to ever consider the debt gone if they have hope of collecting on it . 
  but the flip side is that there 's no reason to believe that it 's impossible for a debt claimed to simply be ignored and never be collected upon , either . 
  i 'm sure that you can go back through history and find many claimed debts that were never collected on . 
  did anyone ever get as deeply into the hole with the imf before ? 
   that 's kind of his point - that the excuse for americans aresting fifa people is incredibly flimsy . 
  americans did n't arrest fifa people . 
  other countries arrested fifa people and are extraditing them . 
  the extradition is happening because those fifa people committed fraud via us banks in a business deal , and the impetus because that plausibly caused the us to lose out on a bid for an international sports event . 
  i do n't see anywhere in the article or the translated column that the investigator is complaining that the excuse was flimsy . 
  his complaint centers around the idea that the us investigating people for corruption is the * real * corruption . 
  i await the results of his investigation with bated breath . 
   will the ~ ~ western propaganda machine ~ ~ you people stop ? 
  if you 're referring to me , and i 'm part of the `` western propaganda machine '' , then i 'm disappointingly behind on receiving my checks , and i want the darn things to hurry up and start coming through . 
  you 'd think that if [ * russia * can manage to pay a worker a fair day 's wage for an honest day 's work ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/putin-kremlin-inside-russian-troll-house ) , that the us could darn well manage to do so too . 
  at singaporean levels of density , ireland could apparently house about 104 times its current population : this would be over 100m more than the entire european union 's current population . 
  [ liberia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberia ) has a rich tradition of being the dumping grounds for unwanted first-world african immigrants . 
  if the us did it , it * must * be a good idea !, 
  right , i got you -- the same is true of the folks that i 'm complaining about over here : these are not die-hard religious reformers , but rather wanting a popular point that they can focus on as a proxy for whatever cultural/religious shift that they do n't like . 
  i 'm just saying that it 's a bit funny when the point being chosen is n't terribly well-aligned with the history of people fighting for it . 
  it 's as if , oh , ukip started saying `` we need to keep those french out . 
  they ca n't truly be proper british , as they ca n't cook a good curry . '', 
  the act itself winds up appropriating something a bit foreign . 
  i 'm saying that if they do n't want 'em , we 'll take 'em !, 
  i 've always been amused by that sort of thing , since in the us , most of the people worried about cultural shift and complaining about a `` war on christmas '' seem to come from a conservative protestant tradition . 
  ironically , [ the only real attempt to prevent christmas from being celebrated in the us was from stringently-protestant immigrants who were opposed to catholic traditions , like the gaudy christ 's mass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_in_puritan_new_england ) . 
  looking over at denmark , the same situation seems to hold . 
  denmark has a protestant tradition as well , and a protestant state religon ; not where you 'd think of a die-hard christmas tradition to come from ( though it admittedly does n't have the same connection to anti-christmas puritanism that the us does ) . 
   a danish person marrying an american will most likely have to settle in usa and not here . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denmark  denmark proper has ... a population of 5,668,743 ( april 2015 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_american  there are approximately 1,500,000 americans of danish origin or descent ... the library of congress has noted that danish americans , more so than other scandinavian americans , `` spread nationwide and comparatively quickly disappeared into the melting pot ... the danes were the least cohesive group and the first to lose consciousness of their origins . 
  '' [ 4 ] historians have pointed to the higher rate of english use among danes , their willingness to marry non-danes , and their eagerness to become naturalized citizens as factors that contributed to their rapid assimilation , as well as their interactions with the already more assimilated german american community .

  eyeballing the chart , it looks like it centers on [ about 1.3 greek suicides/day ] ( http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/1/e005619.full ) from a pre-austerity maybe 1.0 greek suicides/day . 
   `` we are not contending that they did not fly [ to the moon ] , and simply made a film about it . 
  up next , not contending that the cia murdered jfk and not contending that 9/11 was an inside job !, 
  i do n't think i like [ that metric ] ( https://cpj.org/imprisoned/2014.php ) . 
  i think that it should be imprisoned journalists per capita , or it just clobbers populous countries . 
   this is completely irrelevant as the theory of odious debts is not recognized by international law . 
  well ... i do n't know about that . 
  the creditors may not care directly , but if the ruling causes greece to be unwilling to pay , it seems like it would be relevant . 
   in 2010 greece had a primary deficit of 18 % of gdp ... huh . 
  and the gdp dropped by about 18 % from 2010 at the bottom in this chart ? 
  that 's actually ... not much of a multiplier effect . 
  balancing the budget would mean cutting gdp by 18 % anyway , yes ? 
  the us issues placed stress on the financial systems in other countries , but it did n't create the greek issues . 
  at some point , greece was going to have to undergo a moment of truth with its debt . 
  this might have made it happen sooner than would have been the case , or might have made it more-difficult for the greek issues to be dealt with , but you 'd have a hard time convincing me that those problems were going to just vanish or be permanently-ignorable . 
   parliamentary committees are like this in every country . 
  the whole idea of them is that you appoint the politicians that you do n't want near any position of actual power to circlejerk in a committee for the whole day so that they do n't interfere with the business of actually running the country ... or the american climate change committees which are led by climate change deniers ? 
  the us does n't use a parliamentary system , and i 've read discussion here describing us legislative committees as powerful . 
  < shrug  i do n't have expertise to compare the us and europe here , though . 
  the entire greek debt crisis being discovered to be an accounting error would make for a pretty good * onion * article . 
   what does this mean practically for future loans ? 
  how can a bond buyer be sure that his bond is not declared `` odious '' by the next government ? 
  norway , the uae , liberia , saudi arabia , and some other nations maintain a sovereign wealth fund rather than having a net national debt . 
  i do n't know what the long-term drawback of doing that would be ( aside from the obvious short-term pain of trying to build the thing ) , but i expect that it would be possible to run a state without national debt . 
  i 'm not convinced that disconnecting representation from geographical regions is a good idea . 
  however , the idea that one vote , fptp is an undesirable system is one that i 'm very sympathetic to . 
  i 'd definitely rather have some form of ranked voting . 
  the only drawback i can think of is maybe voter confusion from a more-complex system . 
  also , fptp can be expected to support incumbents , so change would be tough to get past the existing parties . 
   because you are effectively being ruled by the same parties as the result of the status quo what if it 's not a result of inertia , but rather because people are reasonably-happy with the incumbents relative to the challengers ? 
   and to make coalitions easier by limiting the number of parties in parliament ehh ... i do n't know . 
  you 'd think that that would be a self-resolving problem . 
  let 's say that , hypothetically , the worst-case scenario came true , and you had fifty small parties , each with one seat . 
  i 'd think that they 'd start forming their * own * smaller coalitions to act as a unit anyway . 
  in that case , you have people who negotiate and cut deals for a living having it * strongly * in their self-interest to find a way to make a deal . 
  i would n't be too worried about it . 
  no , i 'm more-suspicious that it tends to kill off challengers to an incumbent -- it means that any new challenger party needs to hit a significant threshold before voting for them no longer simply throws away a vote . 
  that 's a system that , at least to me , sounds like it has been flagrantly-structured to favor incumbents . 
   there is no way to make it safe and reliable to the standards required by democracy . 
  avoids issues of illegitimacy associated with `` hanging chads '' , though . 
  the computer speaks , and whatever the computer speaks must be true . 
  i 'm very skeptical of electronic voting systems and place a high weight on the risks ( though i normally am enthusiastic about use of computers ) , but it 's certainly true that there is n't much of a `` gray area '' and that that provides real practical benefits . 
   the snp just had the luck that their voters were all clustered together maybe it 's not so much luck and more that the party leaders had the foresight to create a party based on regional concerns in a voting system that tends to favor addressing regional concerns .

   it has happened that people use `` polish '' as a geographical indicator when they should have written `` in poland '' . 
  that 's not incorrect ( in english , at any rate ) . 
  it 's ambiguous , sure , but it 's not * wrong * . 
  also , this is in california 's bay area , smack-dab in earthquake country . 
  that 's a place that 's twitchy about its building standards . 
  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/06/16/berkeley-balcony-collapse/28797145/  city inspectors ordered the property owner to immediately remove the collapsed balcony , which will be taken to a city facility for further examination . 
  three other balconies were red-tagged as a precaution and declared off-limits until structural assessments are completed within 48 hours , said city spokesman matthai chakko . 
    authorities have not yet determined why the balcony collapsed , but berkeley police chief michael meehan said there was no indication of foul play . 
  the city said results from its investigation are expected to take several days . '', 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11680235/balcony-collapse-in-california-may-have-been-caused-by-dry-rot.html  `` it appears to be a classic case of dry rot , meaning water intruded into the building [ and ] rotted the wood '' that supported the balcony , said gene st. onge , a civil and structural engineer in oakland . 
  with more than a dozen people on the balcony , `` it gave way . 
  it did n't have enough residual strength , and it failed . ''   st. onge said the broken wooden beams protruding from the building that once held up the balcony show what looks like signs of dry rot . 
    `` it appeared to be shredded and darkened and had all the appearance of wood that had been totally compromised by dry rot , '' he said . 
  [ snip ]  another engineer who visited the scene on tuesday afternoon , darrick hom , president of the structural engineers association of northern california , said parts of the wood broke off in inspectors ' hands when they touched it . 
    `` it was decayed . 
  they were touching it with their hand and pieces were coming off . 
  obviously , if you touch a wood beam on your deck , it should not come off in your hand , '' mr hom said . 
   meanwhile , white house spokesman josh earnest said that both greece and its creditors should aim to restore the greek economy without disrupting global financial markets . 
  thanks for the input , mr. 
  earnest . 
  up until that point , i 'm pretty sure that juncker and tsipras were pretty hell-bent on disrupting global financial markets , but i 'm sure that this guidance will straighten them out . 
  what is the west worried about having happen ? 
   people with resources can leave , yeah ?
