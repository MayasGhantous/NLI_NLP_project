  [ well ... ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/euro-finance/eu-mulls-blocking-cash-machines-news-513248 )  as well as limiting cash withdrawals and imposing capital controls , they have discussed the possibility of suspending the schengen agreement , which allows for visa-free travel among 26 countries , including most of the european union . 
    `` contingency planning is under way for a scenario under which greece leaves , '' one of the sources , who has been involved in the conference calls , said . 
  `` limited cash withdrawals from atms and limited movement of capital have been considered and analysed . '', 
  that 's a three year old article talking about planning for this month , so not sure if behavior in the event of a default was ever announced ( or if it would even make sense to announce publicaly at all ) . 
   people can sell property deeds , i presume . . or is that land registry of greece still fucked ? 
  that does n't seem like a really interesting question . 
  any pressure that would apply to the seller to not want the land would presumably also apply to the buyer to not want the land , so you would have property values plummet if there was a reason to want to get out of land . 
  the 9/11 truthers have way-better conspiracy theories than that . 
  tsipras is n't even bothering to * try * .

  i think that when it comes to politics , the above conversation could apply to most things . 
  that does n't seem to define it , though , just to say that there 's a right to it . 
  when i look it up on wikipedia , i get :  in ordinary modern usage it denotes `` respect '' and `` status '' , and it is often used to suggest that someone is not receiving a proper degree of respect , or even that they are failing to treat themselves with proper self-respect . 
  there is also a long history of special philosophical use of this term . 
  however , it is rarely defined outright in political , legal , and scientific discussions . 
  international proclamations have thus far left dignity undefined , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and scientific commentators , such as those arguing against genetic research and algeny , cite dignity as a reason but are ambiguous about its application . 
  [ 6 ] there 's also a section on by-country definitions :  ** united states **   in 2008 , the president 's council on bioethics tried to arrive at a consensus about what dignity meant but failed . 
  edmund d. pellegrino , m.d. , the council 's chairman , says in the letter of transmittal to the president of the united states , '' ... there is no universal agreement on the meaning of the term , human dignity . 
  '' [ 42 ]   ** france **   in 1984 , france set up the national consultative committee for ethics in the life and health sciences ( ccne ) to advise the government about the regulation of medical practices and research . 
  in 1986 , the ccne said , `` respect for human dignity must guide both the development of knowledge and the limits or rules to be observed by research . '', 
  the ccne said that research on human embryos must be subject to `` the rule of reason '' and must have regard for `` undefined dignity in its practical consequences . 
  '' [ 39 ] the ccne insisted that , in research on human embryos , the ethical principles that should apply are `` respecting human dignity '' and respecting `` the dignity of science . 
  '' [ 39 ]   ** portugal **   the national council of ethics of portugal published its opinion on the ethical implications of cloning in 1997 . 
  the opinion states , `` the cloning of human beings , because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person , the equilibrium of the human species and life in society , is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited . 
  '' [ 40 ] if at no point the term becomes defined with a concrete meaning , it seems very difficult to give it legal meaning with much force . 
  it becomes on par with saying , oh , `` you have a right to live in a morally-just society '' -- it * sounds * nice and all that , because morality is a virtue , but what in blazes does it truly guarantee ? 
   if you do n't have any documents sooner or later you will need to leave nation hmm . 
  would n't the same legal status apply to illegal immigrant gypsies ? 
  it does n't seem to me that lacking documents has resulted in that situation ending . 
   collective of what problem ? 
  if you are n't going to have border control within the schengen area and you do n't stop people when they first enter the schengen area , you are n't going to have control of their movements subsequent to that either . 
  `` eu in complete unanimity over migrants crisis '' now * that * would be notable . 
  for people who do n't have two to three children , would any of the above make you want to have two to three children ? 
   it is weighed against other values like human dignity ... 
  does `` human dignity '' have any formal legal definition ? 
  honestly , concern over a nuclear response is one area where range probably is n't very significant . 
   so what is your plan for the nuclear war then ? 
  because that will happen if putin thinks russia will lose . 
  no nuclear power will be losing a war anytime soon on home soil , they 'll just nuke the person invading . 
  [ us war plans to respond to a soviet invasion of alaska were declassified last year . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11067608/americas-secret-plan-to-stop-russian-invasion-of-alaska-revealed.html ) they did not involve nuking the ussr , but rather in gathering information on what the soviet union was doing for a conventional counterattack . 
  granted , there was still a plan to respond ( i.e. 
  it 's not yet `` alaska is lost '' ) , and even then , losing in alaska is n't losing the whole country , but it did n't involve a nuclear response . 
  i think that it 's a reference to latvian jokes that mention potatoes . 
   being bankrupt and having nuclear weapons is a great combination . 
  indeed , north korea truly * is * a utopia !, 
  yeah -- the cost of drafting the rule and having another rule is going to exceed a few replacement lights . 
  if one does n't want excessive regulation , * that * would seem like it 's avoiding it . 
  talking about local election error seems kinda disingenuous itself -- if you 're voting on any kind of local policy , it 's very common that you 'd * have * to come up with just one policy . 
  if you 're voting on what to build in a vacant lot , you ca n't have 1/3 of a playground , 1/3 keeping the vacant lot intact , and 1/3 of a toxic waste dump . 
  it 's going to be one of those , and that 's going to create error ... but it 's not an artifact of the voting scheme , but of the fact that incompatible policies have to be chosen among . 
  unless you 're going to relocate * people * based on the policies they like , you 're kinda stuck with that . 
   the imf report said the way income is distributed matters for growth . 
  `` if the income share of the top 20 % increases , then gdp growth actually declines over the medium term , suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down . 
  in contrast , an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 % is associated with higher gdp growth , '' said the report . 
  hmm . 
  there 's no link to the original report , but that sounds like potentially a correlation-not-causation issue . 
  if i introduce , say , labor-heavy manufacturing to a country , and begin industrialization , i 'm making one of the biggest shifts one can make in gdp , and i am also happening to increase the income share of the bottom 20 % . 
  but that 's not the same thing as saying that if i then give the bottom 20 % a bunch of money , that it generates ongoing growth in economic strength , which is what the * guardian * article seems to be claiming . 
  well , a `` i want numbers '' request is certainly fair . 
  < slogs out looking for a paper documenting rate-of-change across languages  http://newstar.rinet.ru/texts/starostin_glotto.pdf on page 7 , you 'll find a table describing rate-of-change among different languages , where \u03bb represents the replacement of the proportion in the basic vocabulary of a language in a fixed period of time ; extracting this value provides :  | language | \u03bb |  | - | - |  | japanese | 0.11 |  | chinese | 0.1 |  | english | 0.14 |  | german | 0.08  | french | 0.09 |  | spanish | 0.07 |  | rumanian | 0.09 | of these , english is the most-rapidly-changing language listed in the table . 
  are you saying that english compares well to other major written languages in terms of stability , how viable it is to read an old work ? 
  i listed the outer bounds of what i can read ; a chinese friend of mine can comfortably read multiple-thousand-year-old chinese works . 
  this sounds from the title like it will be an objective and emotion-free look at the merits of eu membership . 
  the degree of impact would be important . 
  look at a country with a lower frequency of meat inspection , compare mortality rates from food poisoning , and you 'd have a much-more-interesting article with a starting point for numbers . 
  i really , really hope that we do n't wind up with a clinton running against a bush in the upcoming election . 
  that would just be * embarrassing * . 
  poland is near the top of the european states willing to fight in the polls that have shown up here . 
  that criticism does n't seem particularly-applicable to poland . 
  if russia wanted to do so , it has the capacity to make life unpleasant for nato countries . 
  it will probably wind up making russia more-miserable than nato members , but it could be done . 
  it 's not as if russia 's hands are tied . 
  while i do n't know what the us position on the eu is or has been , broadly-speaking , the us has promoted post-wwii european unity , including integration of trade and military efforts . 
  the [ marshall plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) might be the strongest influence that the us had on european structure :  the marshall plan also played an important role in european integration . 
  both the americans and many of the european leaders felt that european integration was necessary to secure the peace and prosperity of europe , and thus used marshall plan guidelines to foster integration . 
  in some ways this effort failed , as the oeec never grew to be more than an agent of economic cooperation . 
  rather it was the separate european coal and steel community , which notably excluded britain , that would eventually grow into the european union . 
  however , the oeec served as both a testing and training ground for the structures that would later be used by the european economic community . 
  the marshall plan , linked into the bretton woods system , also mandated free trade throughout the region . 
  there are also things like the us opposing a `` grexit '' , but i suppose that theoretically that last could be merely-superficial , supporting whatever obama thinks is popular in europe . 
  i 've only seen `` octopi '' in us english , and i do n't think i 'd say that it is incorrect ( though it might be a more-rational way that things could have worked out ) . 
  from wiktionary : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/octopus  the plural octopi is hypercorrect , coming from the mistaken notion that the - us in octop\u016bs is a latin second declension ending . 
  the word is actually treated as a third declension noun in latin . 
  the plural octopodes follows the ancient greek plural , \u1f40\u03ba\u03c4\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ( okt\u1e53podes ) . 
  the plural octopii is based on an incorrect attempt to pluralise the word based on an incorrect assumption of its origin , and is rare and widely considered to be nonstandard . 
    sources differ on which plurals are acceptable : fowler 's modern english usage asserts that `` the only acceptable plural in english is octopuses '' , while merriam-webster and other dictionaries accept octopi as a plural form . 
  the oxford english dictionary lists octopuses , octopi , and octopodes ( the order reflecting decreasing frequency of use ) , stating that the last form is rare . 
   barbarisms that occur . 
  [ `` barbarisms '' is most apropos ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/barbarian ) . 
  etymology  from middle english , from medieval latin barbarinus ( `` berber , pagan , saracen , barbarian '' ) , from latin barbaria ( `` foreign country '' ) , from barbarus ( `` foreigner , savage '' ) , from ancient greek \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( b\u00e1rbaros , `` foreign , non-greek , strange '' ) , onomatopoeic ( mimicking foreign languages , akin to ` blah ' , ` blah ' ) , cognate to sanskrit \u092c\u0930\u094d\u092c\u0930 ( barbara , `` barbarian , non-aryan , stammering , blockhead '' ) .

  there are heavy metal band names -- take english , add umlauts . 
   to give a specific example of where this is a problem , there are a lot of proponents on / r/europe for a unified eu military . 
  having personally taken part on joint training operations with other european forces , i can tell you that had you been in my shoes you would - never - advocate for such a thing because it was a complete mess and this is not an arena where conveying the gist of something someone says is even close to sufficient . 
  even standard english is n't sufficient , to the point that militaries develop formalized terminology for radio communication .
