  ditto for aircraft radio communications . 
  an ordinary english-speaker unversed in these radio procedures may not be able to understand these communications , and probably would not be able to craft them . 
   here also comes the argument that a lot of scientific research is in english and the new terms brought by them find their place in every day speech eventually , especially by the help of media . 
  interesting . 
  i guess that historically , that `` language of science '' would have been latin , but latin did n't really see ( that i 'm aware of today ) the same popularization in pop culture . 
   english/french/latin , does n't make that much difference . 
  things i like about english : * no gender . 
  gender seems to me to add unnecessary complication . 
  * rules for tenses are simple compared to other languages i 've seen . 
  not true for pluralization . 
  * it 's already the big language and i want one language . 
  this is really the deciding factor . 
  * writing system is connected to spoken system ( unlike chinese ) . 
  this lowers the bar for literacy . 
  things i dislike about english : * spelling is n't very phonetic . 
  * pluralization rules for loanwords follow source languages and are full of completely-unnecessary exceptions ( e.g. 
  octopus/octopi , muskrat/muskrats , goose/geese , deer/deer , ox/oxen ) * young compared to many languages . 
  i remember that leo frankowski pointed out that a modern-day english speaker would have great trouble with english from 600 years ago and be totally unable to read english from 1000 years ago ; this does n't compare well with polish or chinese . 
   which is why american english is basically as utilitarian as possible i do n't think that even any artificial language comes close to that bar , much less a natural language , much less us english . 
   which europe bombed welll ... in fairness , we got involved there too , albeit at european request . 
  i did n't downvote you , [ but ] ( http://www.caperi.com/illegal-immigrants-from-eritrea-second-largest-group-in-germany/ ) :  the vast majority of illegal immigrants came from war and crisis-torn countries like syria with 14,029 cases , followed by eritrea with 7945 and afghanistan with 3756 cases . 
  [ sudan was also listed a number of places ] the syrian civil war kicked off years into when obama was in office , and i do n't think that the us was a major factor . 
  afaik , the us was n't significant in eritria . 
  afghistan , yes . 
  however , i think that it would be pretty hard to sell someone as requiring asylum from the current regime there . 
  sudan , no , us not a driving factor . 
  john oliver is a political-comedy show host in the us . 
  he agreed to eat some products that he described as distasteful if sepp blatter were removed , [ and did so ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_csi_begl_u ) . 
  i 'm sure that his people can work up a new skit where he regurgitates all the food . 
  no fear . 
   taking the rest of the sentence into context however paints a different picture . 
  grexit is possible but it 's not the sensible thing to do . 
  to be fair , that 's an english-language summary written by probably an american . 
  it 's been simplified for a general-audience , potentially summarized to make a more-exciting story , and maybe modified by an editor . 
  it was maybe translated from some other language ( german or greek ) or at least in a language that may not have been mr. varoufakis ' first language . 
  this was after it was written for political effect , may-or-may not be honest * and * maybe after it 's been vetted by some political guy on the greek end . 
  i 'm not sure how much signal can be read from subtle hints among all the noise . 
   while it is rather ludicrous that the banks are basically too big to be allowed to fail so we had to take those steps thats the sad reality of the situation . 
  < shrug  if you had a hundred smaller banks that all made the same mistake , would you be better off ? 
  i wonder if the right answer is having a system where banks are collectively subject to systemic failure . 
  harder to fix that , though . 
  if it were just a matter of shrinking banks , i 'd think that there 'd have been breakups by now . 
  i do n't directly see the benefit of having merkel present , but is germany in particular criticized by the greek public ? 
  maybe he 's looking for a public head-to-head where he can score some concessions for domestic political points ? 
  mistral ships are [ amphibious assault ships ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amphibious_assault_ship ) . 
  you use these for minimizing the time that you 're exposed to defenses while attacking over a beach , or * maybe * for anti-submarine warfare . 
  other than being a ship , they are n't terribly-useful for fighting pirates . 
  other ships could do the same thing more-effectively and far more-cheaply . 
   either way calling for more cooperation between eu states is the right way ahead . 
  not * necessarily * . 
  it was in at least some of the [ proposals that i listed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39tu5e/2000_migrants_just_arrived_in_greece_they_are/cs6pk6e ) , but / u/ewannnn also mentioned withdrawing from treaties that involve accepting refugees , which would be another option : it 's * also * possible that this could simply be seen as a broken design in those original treaties . 
  fair enough -- just making it clear re : the topic title . 
  to clarify , i do n't think / u/modada is trolling so much as that he 's turkish and probably is n't enthusiastic about having said immigrants staying in his country , which is pretty much the same position you guys are taking ( just as regards his own country ) . 
  wow , i wrote a [ nearly-identical comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39tu5e/2000_migrants_just_arrived_in_greece_they_are/cs6nyjo ) without having read your own . 
  this is my point , though . 
  it 's not that the eu should spend more because the us does , but that frontex itself is n't acting as a route for inner countries to fund control of borders , which it should be . 
  if you looked at , say , greece , there will be counties/provices/whatever-greece-has in the interior that really do n't need to worry about border issues directly -- but * everyone * in greece has to pay into the border control pool in greece , because everyone benefits . 
  if it were * only * the outer areas that had to fund it , then the outer areas would n't bother trying -- it 'd be easier to let people in and dump them on the interior as quickly as possible . 
  my point is that the same is true for the eu as a whole , just as it is for greece and regions within greece . 
  this could take many forms : * direct cash transfers to countries with border issues , and those countries have a border service that does enforcement/processing . 
  * having individual nations have their border patrol cycle through duties at primary illegal entrance places to the eu * moving immigration enforcement out of the country-level and to the eu level entirely , with an eu-operated and eu-funded enforcement organization . 
  of course , all of this becomes a non-issue if european countries other than greece and italy are happy with the * status quo * of a lot of illegal immigration . 
  but if they do want border enforcement , it does seem like for it to be performed , they would need to chip in too . 
  i 'm not familiar with it , but a quick skim shows that it has a [ budget of $ 89m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex ) . 
  the [ us border patrol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._customs_and_border_protection ) alone has a budget of $ 14,000 m ( and that 's not counting the [ other two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._immigration_and_customs_enforcement ) federal [ customs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_citizenship_and_immigration_services ) agencies ) . 
  that probably means that whatever frontex is doing is primarily merely coordinating operations , not funding the border control : they are n't spending anywhere near enough to be doing that . 
  the issue i 'm thinking of is that there 's a positive externality to border control for the inner nations -- they benefit , yet because they do n't pay into border control , it becomes under-funded relative to the benefits it provides , and you wind up with inefficient resource allocation . 
  did n't you dig a hole under that thing a while back ? 
  i do n't understand how creation of the schengen area did n't entail shared funding of border control : at that point , the `` border control '' for internal countries started to happen on the exterior country 's borders . 
  surely it is in their interest for this to be funded , and it would be disadvantageous for them if that border control did not happen . 
  i read an article posted here the other day saying that the troika ca n't hope to get much in any negotiation because * they * have no leverage , and greece is n't going anywhere . 
  hmm . 
  http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article  in the last 15 years , madagascar ( population 13 million ) has accounted for 45 % of the cases of plague in africa ( 1 ) . 
  for that to be true , the uk would have to potentially be a state of the us * and * in the eu . 
   the league is very well when sparrows shout , but no good at all when eagles fall out . 
   with all the history of europeans being weak and afraid to confront others with hard truths , ? 
  it was certainly not , however , `` open and democratic '' by western standards , regardless of whether it adopted progressive social policies . 
  i do n't have any special expertise here , but if i had to guess : if one is engaging in a surprise attack , one wants to have as small a gap as possible between whatever is the target of the attack attacking , so as much damage as possible can be done before a response . 
  if one is defending , on the other hand , one wants to have as much time as possible to respond to an attack , where no one successful attack is sufficient to knock out your ability to respond ; hence [ defense in depth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defence_in_depth#military_defence_in_depth ) , where you 've important forces pulled back from wherever an attack would come that can then be used to respond to an attack once it happens . 
  :  while untested , [ defense in depth ] was also the planned nato strategy in europe during the cold war at the [ fulda gap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fulda_gap ) . 
  http://www.the-american-interest.com/2014/12/02/a-preclusive-strategy-to-defend-the-nato-frontier/  nato strategy today is implicitly based on the first concept , defense-in-depth . 
  however , defense-in-depth is not incompatible with having a small [ tripwire force ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/tripwire ) up front , which currently is not the case . 
   a full brigade 's worth of equipment -- formally called the european activity set -- would include about 1,200 vehicles , including some 250 m1-a2 tanks , bradley fighting vehicles , and armored howitzers , according to a senior military official . 
  `` european activity set '' ? 
  it ... sounds like an expansion pack or something . 
   as the proposal stands now , a company 's worth of equipment -- enough for about 150 soldiers -- would be stored in each of the three baltic nations : lithuania , latvia and estonia . 
  enough for a company or possibly a battalion -- about 750 soldiers -- would be located in poland , romania , bulgaria and possibly hungary , they said . 
  honestly , i do n't think that this really is sufficient to deal with what the baltic states were asking for . 
  they want something in the country that the us would be unwilling to have attacked , thus ensuring credibility of a threat of us action in the event of a russian attack . 
  stationing soldiers there means that a russian attack immediately leads to fighting with the us ; that would do it . 
  however , the currently-proposed supply dump is not sufficiently-large to affect the us political or strategic decision-making process . 
  feel free to update wiktionary if your country 's laugh is missing ( there 's actually an outstanding request for serbo-croation on the page , and i 'll bet that there are some serbs or croats here ) : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/haha#translations,

  the size of the population you 're measuring is not connected in any important way to the sample size . 
  in a study , you do n't need to increase your sample size because your population is larger . 
   so , for example , most young flemings would pronounce tomato as `` to-may-do '' `` to-may-do '' or `` to-may-toe '' ? 
  i do n't think any americans use the former definition ... normally it 's `` to-may-toe '' versus `` to-mah-toe '' . 
   so when the uk intercepts russians planes in international airspace russia is a bully , and when russia intercepts us planes in international airspace russia is also some kind of a bully ?
