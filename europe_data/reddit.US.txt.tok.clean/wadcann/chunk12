   eu is nothing like that , its a economic union where different and completely independent countries trade and do border control together . 
  i 'd say that it 's currently more-tightly-bound than just an economic union -- though obviously much more loose than the us .

  well , requests . 
  if it required it , nato would have very few members based on current funding levels .

   zero tolerance policy towards illegal immigrants is a must . 
  if you let 5000 in , 500.000 will come . 
  that 's what 's happening now in europe . 
  i disagree . 
  this is not an argument that europe should not let anyone in , but i think that it * is * possible to say `` we 're running a lottery , we are accepting 5,000 , and we are only taking applications at camps in turkey '' . 
  that does n't need to create bad incentives . 
  you 'd be in violation of/need to withdraw from the 1951 refugee convention ( which does n't permit for caps on refugee acceptance ) , and you 'd still have a question of how to deal with people who have already illegally immigrated . 
  not without issues , and i 'm not trying to advocate for this , but i do n't think that it 's * impossible * to accept a limited number of refugees . 
  the current approach is `` maybe we 'll take some ... well , the number is undefined , but we 're probably going to be first-come-first-serve in terms of how strict our acceptance criteria is '' , which obviously will generate unbounded numbers of people flooding in trying to be the first before regulations become more strict . 
  that * will * produce large numbers . 
  [ whatsapp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whatsapp ) is a silicon valley startup . 
   google is also a fluke that ca n't be reproduced . 
  you fund a lot of startups , and the majority flop , some do all right , and a few do extremely well . 
  the question is whether you can aim that funding to a pool of startups that overall does well . 
  you do n't need every startup to be a google to be funding startups . 
   european investors are highly risk averse < dubious  you can spread risk by spreading funds out over a number of startups . 
  either startups on the whole are a good idea or they 're not . 
  not going to happen . 
  it got negotiated to up to 10k already as of a week ago . 
  edit : though it would probably be the best thing to ever happen to trump . 
  edit2 : and note that the us has a multi-year backlog and that the 10k will just come out of the existing backlog . 
  if there was going to be an ever-closer union to federalization with merged citizenship , it was always going to ultimately be an eu problem , albeit maybe in the future , since any immigrants to germany would eventually be immigrants to the eu . 
  that will definitely go a long way to rebuild that relationship with cuba that we 're currently working on ... / s, 
  well , it depends on what you mean by `` the same '' . 
  australia is a signatory to the 1951 refugee convention . 
  instead of withdrawing from it or starting the process of revising it , it is simply ignoring it . 
  this seems to me to be a sub-par approach -- i do n't think that establishing a precedent of ignoring treaty obligations is a good idea . 
  i 'm very open to the idea that the 1951 refugee convention is flawed -- certainly , i think that at the bare minimum , it should include some sort of limits on how many people a country must take in at most , since it 's not possible for some countries to accept every possible application that might come in . 
  however , i think that the right response to a flawed treaty is to fix or terminate the treaty , not to ignore it . 
   it 's not 3 million . 
  35 million people , mainly from africa and pakistan are heading for europe . 
  one might hypothesize how that might happen , and there is some evidence for the bulk of national populations to move . 
  the number of salvadorans living in the us are equal to one-third of el salvador 's population , for example . 
  it 's not currently the case that this is happening , though , and that 's just a prediction at the moment . 
   in america , this is a very big deal . 
  the us is the kingdom of consumerism , and you should never ever lie about a product as important as a car from the get go . 
  in america , like everywhere else , the vast bulk of people do not care about their own car 's emissions . 
  if you did n't figure that out from sporadic siemens international bribery scandals over the years ... 
  i do n't think that the typical consumer feels that vw 's image has been harmed much at all anyway . 
  it 's not like * they * normally care about what their own car is emitting . 
  it certainly does n't extend to < random_other_german_company_brand  .

     the right to seek asylum does not supersedes the rights of a sovereign state . 
  germany and every country in the eu has the right to limit the number of asylums that they will grant . 
      is there any obligation to accept more than the quotas set by eu and or un ? 
    and the un has nothing whatsoever to do with all this . 
  well , the 1951 refugee convention does n't permit limiting asylum acceptance , and it is a un treaty .

   this will only stop once the entirety of africa is living in europe . 
  not at present rates . 
  http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_proj_continent.aspx africa is expected to grow by ~ 280m between 2020 and 2030 . 
  that 's a 2.22 % growth rate annually . 
  at that rate , even assuming africa 's population back in 2013 of ~ 1.1 b as a starting point , that 's an increase in population of about 24m people annually . 
  europe is not currently taking in 24m per year . 
  if europe is pulling something like 1m refugees this year and that produced the current refugee crises , it would have to be running twenty-four of the current refugee crises simultaneously , forever , just to keep even with population growth . 
  it 's not doing that , so it 's falling behind : the entire population of africa can not wind up in europe .
