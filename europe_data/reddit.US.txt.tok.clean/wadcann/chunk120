  i do n't see divestment as in any way an effective policy tool . 
  capital is marvelously fungible and fluid . 
  unless the investment was * foolish * in terms of return ( in which case the investment should be terminated on unrelated grounds to divestment efforts ) , if you leave a gap , someone else will simply jump into it . 
  i * do * think that divestment tends to go hand-in-hand with corruption , since it 's grounds for an investment fund to seek to do something other than maximize its investment . 
  once that happens , it opens the door for trouble -- [ calpers was a recent example ] ( http://www.city-journal.org/2013/23_1_calpers.html ) in the us of problems . 
  if you want to reduce coal usage , sure , limit your own usage , or sign treaties that block usage by other countries . 
  but divestment ? 
  no , i do n't think that that 's an effective mechanism , and the market operates specifically to minimize any impact it has . 
  i 'd be more concerned that this is driven by people who are interested in indirectly pulling money out of that sovereign wealth fund , a fat target if there ever was one . 
  same thing as ol' calpers ... 
  i think i liked it better back when got was just a well-written low-magic fantasy book series . 
   but yeah it irritates irish people when an americans says `` i 'm irish '' just a clash between language differences . 
  saying `` oh , yeah , he 's dutch '' or `` he 's chinese '' probably is n't talking about citizenship . 
  i 'm guessing that this is because in the us , you do n't * have * lots of countries next to each other , and everyone 's an immigrant , so it 's kind of assumed that you 're american , and that you 're talking about where your family is from ( and people 's families came from all over , so that * is * a more-common point of conversation ) . 
  but progressive , pragmatic , left-wing ones !, 
  since akp may not control the government , does this mean that the threshold will be likely to change , then ? 
  i 'm curious whether akp voters personally-strongly-approve of erdogan as a leader or just see any alternative as harming islam in turkey . 
   we can discuss the merits of various proposals , but only if the discussion is held openly . 
  the merits of the document that the negotiating teams come up with can be discussed , however . 
  i do n't like that clause , but it 's the above claim is not interesting -- i do n't care about the intermediate stages , but whatever is actually potentially going to become law . 
   people moving from montana to colorado are still paying into more or less the same health care system and pension plans . 
  actually , they 're not . 
  the us has private forms of both of those , so even switching companies goes to a different pool . 
  there are the limited medicare and medicaid systems , of which the latter is primarily a state-level system , and the also-limited social security , but beyond that ... nah , no giant pool . 
  edit : good heavens . 
  okay , strike that . 
  i always considered social security to be minimal and the state pension in the uk to be pretty substantial , but the average us social security payment rate appears to be far more than what the uk pays out . 
  the uk [ apparently pays a * maximum * of # 115.95 / week ] ( https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/what-youll-get ) , or $ 709/mo , and the [ us ss * mean * ] ( https://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/ ) is $ 1,219.04 / mo. 
  although if spending were in line with those ( limited ) revenues , there still would n't have been a collapse . 
   so , the us lost 25 times more soldiers than france ( 88 ) , the eu country with the highest losses not counting britain . 
  ehhh ... not per capita . 
  absolute numbers are n't very interesting here : the way you presented the statistics seriously loads them against small countries . 
   there has n't been a war between rich nations in the past 70 years and not one rational government of a rich country would go to war with another one . 
  i would point out that ( a ) a substantial factor in that is probably because there have been alliances against wars have not been realistically-winnable , and ( b ) [ arguments of the `` we have an interconnected economy so war will not happen among nations '' form were made in the run-up to world war i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_illusion ) . 
   what kind of help could we expect from europe if war were to break out anywhere in the pacific ? 
  countries that also happen to be nato members were [ in the vietnam war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnam_war ) , but nato does not bind them to do so . 
   leaking germany does n't consider [ vitrification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radioactive_waste#vitrification ) ? 
   last week the former german foreign minister , joschka fischer , warned the uk against `` wishful thinking '' . 
  the eu , he pointed out , had other more urgent issues than dealing endlessly with the british problem : `` angela merkel will do nothing which will endanger the basic principles of the common market of the eu . 
  fair enough . 
   and she has a much bigger problem to address -- how to find a compromise in the currency union with greece . 
  that 's her priority number one now . '' that sounds on par with `` i need to wash my hair tonight '' as an excuse . 
  germany 's diplomatic system should be capable of dealing with two different issues simultaneously . 
   `` putin proposed the option of a peaceful coexistence with the west . 
  russia would keep crimea , but would refrain from further expansion into ukraine , '' said piontkovsky , who based his speculation on the talks between putin , foreign minister sergei lavrov and u.s. secretary of state john kerry held last month in sochi . 
    `` it is clear that this offer was rejected and now putin has no choice but to escalate the situation , '' he said in a phone interview . 
  or , of course , leaving crimea ( or negotiating with ukraine for it ) . 
  unless obama is saying something different at g7 from what the [ department of state is saying ] ( http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/03/238897.htm ) :  this week , as russia attempts to validate its cynical and calculated `` liberation '' of crimea , we reaffirm that sanctions related to crimea will remain in place as long as the occupation continues . 
  the united states continues to support ukraine 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and right to self-determination . 
  the romans had a hell of a time with the jews over that . 
  my understanding is that the bulk of the illegal immigrants entering europe are not from libya . 
  even if this approach were successful , i do n't see how it resolves the issue . 
  europe is wealthier and a rather nicer place to live and work than africa . 
  unless that changes , there 's an incentive to head on over . 
  i assume that this is because the british want to extend welfare benefits promptly to those britons who travel abroad , establish residency there , and then return . 
  still involved the us because of european interest , though . 
  the points that people have raised , like temperature and working conditions , would probably apply to a lot of arab nations , though -- saying `` no world cup '' for qatar is kind of like saying `` no world cup '' for any arab nation . 
   migrants are now russia 's problem hmm . 
  does n't mean that they ca n't be bounced elsewhere . 
  [ cuba used the mariel boatlift ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mariel_boatlift ) to , among other things , dump undesirables elsewhere . 
   the mariel boatlift was a mass emigration of cubans who departed from cuba 's mariel harbor for the united states between april 15 and october 31 , 1980 . 
  [ snip ]  the cuban government subsequently announced that anyone who wanted to leave could do so , and an exodus by boat started shortly afterward . 
  the exodus was organized by cuban-americans with the agreement of cuban president fidel castro . 
  the exodus started to have negative political implications for u.s. president jimmy carter when it was discovered that a number of the exiles had been released from cuban jails and mental health facilities . 
  if i had to think of countries that come to mind as us `` closest allies '' , it would probably be canada and then the uk , and it would be very difficult for me to call either of their governments the worst governments in the world . 
  in fact , i 'm pretty sure that if i had to list the next ten governments , none would qualify . 
  mexico is n't ideal , and it 'd probably show up at some point ( though that probably has more to do with geographic proximity ) . 
  australia , france , germany , south korea , israel , japan ... all countries have warts , but i 'm pretty sure that most countries that do a lot of stuff with the us rank well relative to the world as a whole in terms of government , at least if you 're looking for low corruption and a western-style democracy . 
  i assume that you 're thinking of saudi arabia or maybe iraq ( due to having the us support its government ) ? 
  i 'm not sure that either of them ( * particularly * the latter ) would be considered all that close . 
  saudi arabia and the us each get something that they want from the other , but it 's not as if sa and the us share all * that * many programs or culture or trade . 
   yeah , the british head of state has extraordinarily gimped political power , though . 
  does the british head of state have any real religious authority today , aside form the notational bit ? 
  i mean , within the last hundred-and-fifty years , has the british sovereign exercised any meaningful religious role ? 
  someone posted [ this clip of hitler ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjd9v9h2uru ) to / r/russia the other day . 
  a country can be can be all of ( a ) pro-us and ( b ) democratic and ( c ) non-secular . 
  admittedly , i 'm having a hard time thinking of an example of a democratic theocracy . 
  stalin was not forced to acquire a sizable chunk of eastern europe . 
  it [ sounds like she was probably a little miffed with ireland ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/margaret-thatcher-ireland-haughey-north-861575-apr2013/ ) too :  having made her their number one target , the ira attempted to assassinate thatcher at the conservative party conference in the english seaside city of brighton in 1984 . 
   this is no time for european disunion i wonder at what point it would be time . 
   some privately express frustration at what they view as reluctance by the obama administration to get involved . 
    they contrast a `` leading from behind '' strategy in the middle east and europe with the more proactive u.s. stance in asia , where obama is acting diplomatically and militarily to counter growing chinese influence . 
  hmm . 
  in east asia , there are not really major powers outside of china involved in some of what 's going on . 
  japan , yes , but it 's not comparable to china . 
  a lot of countries there are interested in the us as a counterweight to china . 
  the us is popular in vietnam today . 
  that 's definitely not because of us actions fifty years ago there , but because china is a major concern for countries there and the us is the only realistic counterweight . 
  if the us takes some action that china does n't like , it does n't run the risk of dire consequences showing up in the way that individual nations are . 
  in europe , the eu is capable of , if it chooses to do so , addressing european situations in whatever way it wants . 
  in the 1940s , europe was pretty broken , was in serious trouble , and the us set a lot of the direction for postwar europe . 
  this is n't 1946 , though , and i 'd think that many people in europe would object ( and reasonably so ) to the us trying to officially tell the eu how to handle affairs on her border . 
  i 'd think that it would be rather strange if the us were trying to set european affairs as much today as it once did or taking the same role that it has in east asia . 
   their cuisine is delicious . 
  i was curious , since that 's one that i 've never heard of . 
  [ wikipedia has a summary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_cuisine ) , though unfortunately it 's a bit sparse on pictures . 
  a summary of wp has to say there : * major ingredients are lamb , eggplant , beans , lentils , and wheat bread . 
  * not heavily-spiced . 
  * walnuts , almonds , pine nuts , and hazelnuts are used for texture . 
  * fruits include apricots , quince , melon , sumac , grapes , plums , pommegranate , cheries , and lemons .
