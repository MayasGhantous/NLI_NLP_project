  it sounds like use of sour flavor is more-common than i 'm used to . 
  * the typical dishes listed were slow-cooked and involved meat . 
  * flatbread was common . 
  * boiling looks common , frying not . 
   most americans i met in real life were ... sentient human beings . 
  score one for america !, 
  i dug through a list of the distances that people from different countries stand when speaking . 
  scandinavian countries have some of the largest personal space expectations . 
  latin american countries have some of the closest . 
  the source describing it said that interaction between people from two widely-different standards tends to result in the one with the wider personal space constantly backing up to avoid becoming too-intimate , while the other one keeps moving forward to ensure that they are n't being too cold and off-putting . 
  another fun clash-of-social-norms example : i 've read a number of people describing travel to the middle east involving running into the people there as incredibly-hospitable , inviting them to eat dinner at their house , and so forth . 
  not saying that they 're * inhospitable * , but the middle east still has stronger social conventions for providing hospitality to guests . 
  in the us , asking someone over to eat with your family is something that one would be more-likely to do with relatively-close friends ; that might be a bit of a mismatch in terms of social norms sending the wrong message . 
  i expect that that 's just a translation oddity . 
  i assume that he speaks well and has well-prepared material in russian . 
  < shrug  i 'm sold on snowden . 
  i think that he 's done a lot to help improve the us -- it 's probably due to him that we do n't have mass-collection of us citizen phone call records by the nsa as of last week . 
  he 's an honest-to-god example of someone standing up and selflessly doing something that 's very personally-costly to fix something that seems broken . 
  i think that it 's a damned shame that he ca n't come home . 
  does n't mean that i 'm sympathetic to russia . 
  loosen up , rorschach . 
  no , no , that 's okay . 
  i want to hear the explanation of the [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) in the context of why world war ii was a sign that eastern europe should n't be concerned about russian annexation . 
   we have other things to think about , i assure you . 
  not crashing nuclear bombers running simulated attack runs at the uk into civilian aircraft must be awfully preoccupying . 
  well , `` hiding '' has a bit of a negative connotation , but i 'd that that there 's been a pretty substantial shift towards not being seen in military technology over the last century . 
  night-vision goggles on infantry and ir cameras on aircraft and vehicles . 
  camouflage . 
  stealth aircraft and surface vessels . 
  smoke grenades . 
  submarines . 
  yeah , it was mentioned on / r/europe a couple times recently . 
  maybe not international , but [ not having a trained minelayer crew can lead to unpleasant consequences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_port_arthur#subsequent_naval_actions_at_port_arthur.2c_february.e2.80.93december_1904 ) :  on thursday 11 february 1904 , the russian minelayer * yenisei * started to mine the entrance to port arthur . 
  one of the mines washed up against the ship 's rudder , exploded and caused the ship to sink , with loss of 120 of the ship 's complement of 200 . 
  * yenisei * also sank with the only map indicating the position of the mines . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_navy#21st_century  poland 's entrance into the north atlantic treaty organization has greatly changed the structure and role of the polish navy . 
  whereas before , most of naval high command was concerned with coastal defense and baltic sea operations , the current mindset is for integration with international naval operations . 
  the focus is on expansion of subsurface naval capabilities , and in the creation of a large submarine force . 
  with germany , france , and the uk * all on one side * ? 
  i 'm kind of curious what the source of the outlines was . 
  i 've occasionally wanted to dig up vector ship silhouettes . 
  this is the second military piece of german hardware i 've seen called * wiesel * in the past couple of weeks . 
  `` weasel '' generally has a negative connotation in english ; i wonder if that is different in german . 
  there 's the [ wild weasel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wild_weasel ) name ( which i 'd thought referred to a particular type of anti-sam aircraft , not a whole class ) , but that was apparently unintentional ... 
   mmmh , i do n't think so - as far as i know , the c1 lacks any kind of reactive armour ... reactive armor is an add-on for a number of tanks . 
  i assume that the same could be true for the c1 . 
  you 've got [ commercial space tourism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_tourism ) , albeit to earth orbit rather than the moon and only for the wealthy ( though it 's worth noting that commercial air flight was also fairly pricey to start out with ) . 
  i agree that generally-speaking , some hopes for the future did n't pan out well -- space travel was disappointing relative to what some advocates hoped to see ( though it is coming down in price ! ) . 
  we have n't yet tried constructing [ space elevators ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_elevator ) , for example . 
  our habitats do n't look all that drastically-different , and people did n't adopt jumpsuits . 
  but , on the other hand , our communication and computation capabilities are impressive and are available everywhere ; i think that past predictions of the future generally underpredicted these . 
  we have a lot of devices that eliminate or reduce domestic chores . 
  our movies and entertainment are pretty technically-impressive . 
  if you like this sort of thing , / r/retrofuturism is a wonderful read -- it examines what past predictions about the future looked like . 
  they were right about [ the jetpacks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m5itcxiszk ) . 
  you 've got safety concerns and a limited flight time , though . 
  well , we have [ real railguns ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4zqfejtgzw ) that are going on us navy ships , albeit in prototype form , starting next year 2016 . 
  that 's pretty much here now . 
  i 'm not sure what `` microfusion '' is , but a fusion reactor on a tank seems questionable ... 
  i 'm not sure what `` energised armor '' is either , but the uk and the us have been working on [ electric reactive tank armor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactive_armour#electric_reactive_armour ) , and i doubt that it will take 30 years . 
  * i strongly suspect that the descriptions were cribbed from elsewhere ; a quick check shows that the relevant wikipedia articles have a number of word-for-word identical sentences . 
  it may be that the * original * source for various articles for some of the other tanks were taken from marketing material , and the m1 from another source . 
  * honestly , who cares ? 
  even if the m1 is a good tank , do you truly need to have articles linked off / r/europe gushing about it ? 
  it 's not making false factual claims . 
  it 's just got less emotional load to the description . 
  < shrug  feel free to judge the articles for yourself ; you 've your own views on ukraine . 
  i 'm just pointing out what he 's written . 
  that 's not how weaponized lasers work . 
  they do n't aim at something and wait for it to slowly heat up and melt , the way you 're thinking of . 
  they 're [ pulse lasers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulse_laser ) , which put off an immense amount of energy in a very short pulse . 
  that energy tears the thing apart . 
  [ here 's an example video of the us navy using a laser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7khexq_dag ) against a floating target . 
  it 's not a claw . 
  you 're looking at just one side -- it has teeth on both sides . 
  it 's a giant zipper . 
  ah , you just have n't seen it do the transformation into either of its other two forms yet . 
  they 're more-impressive . 
  why , exactly , do you think that the american military keeps such a massive inventory of helicopters ? 
   nato is set up to only act on the outright war , while putins apparatus is capable to precisely plan and execute a broad range of those grey zone scenarios . 
  for all we 've seen , nato has been impotent in dealing with any of these so far . 
  that 's a fair point to raise , but nato members also do n't need to * just * act on article 5 either . 
  the recent sanctions are not just eu or just nato , nor was there any hard international obligation , but members were unhappy about russia annexing part of ukraine and were willing to take action over it , because they saw a coordinated response as having value . 
  that 's a fair question . 
  yes , i think so ( though that 's not to say that we could n't change the world and reach an environment where that was n't the case ) . 
  first , germany 's current interest is in growth via diplomatic mechanisms -- the eu is a diplomatic construct , not a militarily-gathered empire . 
  they 've a `` good '' ( assuming that you 're onboard with european unification ) route to growth , and i think that most people would agree that it is pretty-clearly in germany 's interests to pursue that route rather than the military route . 
  second , nato was established specifically to avoid having members be attacked . 
  outside of maybe germany attacking switzerland , germany could n't just jump out of nato and then start expanding germany without running face-first into nato . 
  germany 's world war ii efforts relied upon ( a ) being able to fight her opponents one-by-one and ( b ) the us not being involved . 
  third , germany is not really in the short term a military threat to any neighboring allied bloc ( outside of switzerland ) that she could invade , even ignoring the us and turkey , in terms of her military clout . 
  it would take substantial expansion of the military for this to change . 
  fourth , germany currently is almost the political dead-opposite of being enthusiastic about military expansion . 
  most of these do not apply to russia . 
  for ( 1 ) , russia * has * exhibited interest in military expansion -- there is no * novoroyssia * equivalent in germany today , and russia has not fared well in terms of competing for allied nations on economic grounds ; she may not like that game much . 
  for ( 2 ) , nato does not apply to the question of finland being attacked ( though if the eu provides a credible deterrent alone , the eu might ) . 
  for ( 3 ) , russia * does * have a military capable of taking over a number of her neighbors . 
  for ( 4 ) , russia has seen people raising concern over treatment of minorities in neighboring countries and been encouraging military involvement to protect these , much along the lines of what hitler was doing back prior to world war ii . 
  that does not mean that i believe that russia is immediately-intending to attack finland -- i think that there are some very good reasons for russia * not * to do so , not the least of which being that russia is more-than-busy with ukraine . 
  however , it does mean that i think that a russia-finland conflict is vastly more likely than a germany-against-all-of-europe conflict .
