  matters were made worse by the fact that the drastic fall in people 's income caused a collapse in tax revenues . 
  many soon were not in receipt of unemployment benefits as state governments could not afford to pay it . 
    it was in this economic chaos that the nazis and communists thrived . 
    crime and suicide rates rose sharply and many lost hope . 
  people deserted the democratic parties in droves and turned to either the communists or the nazis . 
  in the election of 1930 , the nazis made their electoral breakthrough winning 107 deputies while the communists won 77 . 
  both parties were opposed to the democratic system and used violence against their political opponents . 
  hitler 's brownshirts clashed frequently on the streets with their communist enemies . 
  to be fair , / u/yeawhat was saying that * if * there is a conspiracy , `` cui bono '' should be used to identify the conspirators . 
  he was n't advocating that it be used to determine whether-or-not there is a conspiracy . 
  it 's not that the loans at negative interest are themselves bad from portugal 's standpoint -- they 're great , as long as portugal does n't then expand its debt load to a point that could not be sustained if interest rates rose to a higher level . 
  my point is that when portugal pays off bonds , and needs money to do so , they need to issue more bonds to pay for those -- i 'm asking how long portugal can keep `` rolling over '' loans from one loan to the next loan at those favorable negative interest rates before interest rates rise . 
   i think i would be screwed if i went a few months without getting paid . 
  actually , i know i would . 
  on a tangent , you really should change that if at all possible . 
  one of the [ big personal finance things to do ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds ) is to build up a cushion so that if you hit a personal catastrophe ( job loss , etc ) , you do n't get clobbered for about six months , even without having to convert things to a more-liquid form . 
  my understanding is that producing inflation in your currency via expanding its supply buys two things : * it drains wealth from anyone holding that currency or assets linked to that currency and gives it to whoever is expanding the currency . 
  if you have a greek savings account and half of the real value vanishes due to inflation , that 's where it 's gone . 
  * it produces a one-off decrease in wages . 
  if wages are sticky , you will have a period where all your workers are working for less money , which makes them more-competitive . 
  the problem is that for the first point , i suspect that an awful lot of assets have already moved to where they ca n't be converted and devalued . 
  for the second point , my understanding is that wages * should * decrease anyway if you are n't competitive , since you will just see businesses going out of business , laying people off , and new ones showing up with less-appealing wages . 
  it 's just smoother if this happens via inflation , since you do n't need to deal with the overhead of the unemployment process . 
   getting loans from the markets with negative interest how long can those keep being rolled over into new loans at that rate , though ? 
   call me a pessimist but i think that if we 're left to our own devices , completely free from all e.u. 
  constraints the country would cruble in less than a year . 
  greece predates the eu by a bit and did n't disintegrate during that time period . 
   over the last 500 years , the relevant timescale for analysis of this economic worldsystem hmm . 
  why would the last 500 years be more-relevant than the last 100 ? 
  national governments around the world between 1915 and 2015 seem to much-more-closely approximate the structure of government and of economies today ( and in the foreseeable future , i 'd say ) than those between 1515 and 2015 . 
  in particular : agricultural land has become less-essential to the income of a country , and thus the route of `` acquire more agricultural land '' is less-interesting as a way of growing a country 's power . 
   the latest incarnation of that trend is the growing number of continental-sized semi-governmental institutions like free trade treaties , military alliances and other instruments ... just the things that happened to form the basis of the structure of states as we know it . 
  that 's true , and i 'd not disagree that trade agreements and military alliances have grown . 
  it 's not clear to me that this means that you wind up with one world country , though . 
  i believe two minutes for the first part , but went back with an edit because i felt that leaving out the marines ' hymn would be a disappointment . 
  yes , i took you seriously . 
  yes , i think that it would be not far off the libya situation . 
  what does living in america have to do with it ? 
   telling someone to shut up is also free speech , after all . 
  yes , but * forcing * them to do so is not . 
  modern russia does n't see [ lysenkoism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism ) . 
   it 's inevitable that we end up with some sort of world government eventually . 
  over the past hundred years , empires have tended to break down , not increase in size . 
  okay . 
  `` the uk has a state-run medical service that pays its doctors less than market rate in australia . 
  as a result , many of those doctors leave . '', 
  that 's pretty different from what the article is talking about : nobody 's worried about being trapped in the uk . 
   but once americans figured out where morocco was , you 're right , there would n't be much will amongst the public to go to war on spain 's behalf . 
  yes , [ the united states would obviously never fight alongside a european country against north africa . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_barbary_war ) after all , [ north africa is a long ways away ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_barbary_war ) from the united states . 
  certainly , the idea of [ us boots on the ground in morocco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_torch ) is just silly , much less [ anywhere else in north africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_african_campaign ) . 
  true , morocco is a little closer to the us than [ other places in africa that the us would be even less likely to fight in ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somali_civil_war ) , but still ... one has to ask oneself [ whether in modern times , africa is something that the us would be willing to fight in at european request ... and the answer is obviously `` no '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya ) even were us involvement in north africa to happen , it would be [ wildly at odds with us military tradition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marines%27_hymn#lyrics ) . 
   there are multiple contradictory and diverging national security interests in europe . 
  us states have had different concerns too , whether it 's border security to the south or defending two totally-different oceans and coasts ( particularly in an era where it was hard to move forces between one and the other ) or piracy or whatever . 
  there 's some overlap , sure , but the same is true of europe -- i think that the author is over-exaggerating the split . 
  the uk does n't particularly want russia stepping on the baltics . 
  russia in the arctic or russia on land are n't * that * dissimilar in concern . 
  it 's easy to transition forces to any coast around europe , and static defenses are less-in-vogue than they once were , so countries do n't compete as much over such concerns . 
  in an eu with free movement , nobody wants lots of illegal african immigrants flooding into the south of the eu . 
   you would n't loose constantly against goatfuckers and teens hiding in holes hmm . 
  what are you referring to , the post-us-leaving iraq ? 
   a make or break decade for europe ? 
  that seems melodramatic . 
  if european association is beneficial to members , i see no reason that they would abruptly stop wanting to dig deeper into it subsequent to the turn of the decade , or for more countries to join . 
  if european association is disadvantageous , i see no reason why countries could n't leave subsequent to the turn of the decade . 
  brexits , grexits , ukranian and turkish membership , the fine points of schengen area and currency and military and eu membership and eec and so forth and all that seem to really be subject to this question of long-term appeal . 
  and that long-term appeal does n't seem to me to really be correlated with the end of the decade in any meaningful way . 
  let 's say that all of the things the author described went as sour as they could . 
  * the uk splits off the eu , wanting to simply establish a tightly-bound-from-the-standpoint-of-trade europe , a confederation rather than a federation . 
  they go set up trade treaties . 
  * greece leaves , unable to come to an agreement over debt . 
  * russia plays hardball and retakes ukraine , and then re-acquires the baltics in a similar fashion , no nation lifting a finger to do anything . 
  it stuffs puppet leaders in place once again ... hey , and runs off with industrial hardware once again , why not . 
  * turkey gets not merely fed up with eu membership potential , but even with dealing with the eu , and heads off to try and dominate the middle east , to try and control and wield control over oil in that area . 
  * the eu 's economic activity shrinks relative to the us and china ( being larger than any particular one is clearly a psychological barrier ) . 
  * the us gets fed up with ttip and goes off to establish the tpp with asia . 
  * orban actually pulls hungary out of the eu . 
  * eu member state defense budgets continue to fall . 
  i think that hits everything the author raised as a concern and multiplies it . 
  aside from maybe lower defense spending , how are any of these things really worse than during the cold war ? 
  european nations * still * have the same incentives they had to interoperate then . 
  i was definitely expecting a scottish highlander-type situation . 
  the never-ending question of how to get an objective , descriptive title ... 
  ahhh , i get you . 
  it 's like voting in an eu tax on automobile manufacture would be for germany , except more-so . 
  thanks . 
  what is the deal with the popularity of advocating for financial transaction taxes in europe , anyway ? 
  well , i 've certainly no objection to taking actions that happen to make russia unhappy , but if done , they should be with a goal in mind , not just to vent upset . 
  if blocking russian travel across-the-board is a good way to address the ukraine situation and get russia out of southern and eastern ukraine , i 'd have no objection . 
  but it does n't make a lot of sense to disrupt most interchange , movement of journalists , family members , businessfolk , and so forth , just because russia is making the life of a few diplomats and political leaders unpleasant . 
  that 's just a disproportionate response ; it does n't make sense . 
  * russia * is doing this in response to having targeted sanctions imposed on some of its figures . 
  i think that it would be regrettable if russia took a proportionate response and the west took a disproportionate response . 
  again , just to drive my point home -- i 've no fundamental objection against any particular response , including a complete blockade , military action , harming russian control of chechnya , announcing that kaliningrad will be handed over to ukraine unless crimea is returned , or any other number of things that russia would really , really , really not like . 
  but those should be responses to `` country x is out invading and acquiring chunks of countries '' , not `` country x is trying to make the lives of diplomats unpleasant . '', 
  seriously , there could very well have been sponsorship pressure ; it 's not as anyone involved would announce this . 
  besides , oliver 's team will just work it into another entertaining skit . 
  because it would n't be a proportionate action to russia annoying some diplomats and political leaders , i expect .
