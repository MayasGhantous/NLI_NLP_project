  technically , [ a ten foot sailboat has right-of-way over an oil tanker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_regulations_for_preventing_collisions_at_sea ) , at least to the extent that the oil tanker * can * turn :  a power-driven vessel must give way to :   * a vessel not under command ;   * a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre ( this may include vessels towing one another [ 12 ] ) ;   * a vessel engaged in fishing ;   * ** a sailing vessel ** . 
  in practice , the ten-foot sailboat is probably going to try and stay the heck out of the way of the oil tanker . 
   sponsors are pulling out as they may face criminal charges in this corruption mess . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  fair enough . 
  i guess that with last year 's civil unrest over fifa , brazil is probably particularly willing to get on board , and the more important teams already onboard , the easier to sell everyone else . 
  so restrict the type/amount of pesticides used on a given crop , if there 's a real health concern about that pesticide . 
  could you clarify the question ? 
  obviously there will be differences in that , for example , laws in the us would differ from those of , say , france ; i 'm sure that ttip wo n't unify that any more than nafta unified us , canadian , and mexican law . 
  are you asking whether ttip is `` fair '' in that it gives the same restrictions and privileges to everyone ? 
  well , i 've no expertise in trade negotiation , i have n't been closely-following the deal , and the final text of ttip is n't available , so that 's hard to know . 
  however , assuming that the negotiators involved are all competent , i 'd assume that everyone is comfortable that the deal is a net benefit for them and not simply letting someone else put something over on them , so i 'd assume that it could be expected to reasonably approximate that . 
  also , the tories are a political party : they and everyone else are expected to take stances other than just center : in a democracy , that 's * how * you get a variety of options available to voters . 
   mr hansen 's plan is that instead of playing the 2018 tournament , uefa 's nations would withdraw from fifa and play another european championships , inviting some of the biggest south american nations to compete as well . 
  hmm . 
  why is north america excluded ? 
  this seems like kind of a mish-mash of issues . 
  one issue that kept being raised was the idea of one side of a road having totally different laws from another . 
  that 's inherent to having a line drawn somewhere at all -- you 're going to have * that * unless you force having a gradient of policy between areas or force everyone to follow the same rules . 
  maybe in a world with less well-defined borders and limited state control over the borderlands , things would be a bit more hazy ( and things were once like that in much of the world ! ), 
  but that seems to create innumerable legal difficulties and so forth , as well as being a catalyst for wars when disputes * do * arise over control . 
  that does n't seem all that weird to me , and i think that in a modern , non-warlike-environment where things do n't generally get resolved by someone from this clan going over and bashing the head in of someone from another clan across the river , that 's a pretty good way to deal with things . 
  certainly it was n't just arbitrary luck that things happened to work out that way . 
  second is the fact that the borders are * particularly * convoluted in the area being described by the speaker . 
  i do n't know enough of the history there to explain it , and i suppose that , as he said , in practice it would probably be better to have a simpler border , but for inertia and tourist draw ( and untangling property rights and so forth ) . 
  * that * probably is just plain luck , a quirk of history . 
  third is that centralized bureaucrats should decide on the rules rather than individual communities . 
  for every legal system that you deal with , you require more legal expertise . 
  one major benefit we have today is that we have enormous enterprises that can take advantage of scale , and thus produce things very cheaply . 
  it 's hard for those to function if they have to deal with a vast patchwork of laws : they 're better off if they can deal with legal standards * once * and more-or-less not worry about them outside of that . 
  yes , when you just had a blacksmith in each village , you can come up with whatever rules you want , but when you have an automobile manufacturer subject to liability , they care a lot about what exactly the laws are where they 're selling their vehicles . 
  i do n't think that this is just luck , but rather something that will arise if you have a similar economy and society to our own . 
  keep in mind that this is first-generation . 
  the us has had a [ long and rich history of ethnic ghettos in cities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghetto#united_states ) . 
  even if immigrant bob is really gung-ho on us average culture , his wife sally may-or-may not be , and may-or-may-not be comfortable with or want to learn english . 
  both bob and sally might miss the motherland 's food or being able to talk to people with a similar background or having enough people in an area to support a church/temple/mosque of their favorite sect from the motherland , and so settling in a same-ethnicity area might happen . 
  however , whether-or-not sally ever becomes proficient in english , their kids probably * will * . 
  they also wo n't grow up as steeped in memories of the motherland as their parents were . 
  they 'll very likely ( barring private , individualized education ) go to school with people of other backgrounds . 
  they 'll probably see mass media that incorporates all sorts of other material . 
  when they marry , some percentage will marry outside the ethnic group and disperse even more . 
  cultures that tend to discourage marrying outside an ethnic group , like judaism , might take longer to diffuse , but it * does * happen . 
  the only groups that i can think of that have really maintained a truly long-running ethnic isolation are those that go to extreme measures to eliminate the outside world -- no outside schools , no mass media , live in remote communities , etc -- like the amish . 
  even the prc has ( a multi-tiered ) representative system deriving from directly-elected representatives . 
  yes , it 's a one-party system , and no , it does n't look much like , say , the us or the uk , but what i 'm getting at is that it does n't look much like imperial china , either . 
  i think that it is very difficult to sell a government without democratic elements today . 
  no , was n't offended at all , and your post certainly has real concerns -- i agree that the `` global move towards a market economy with multiple parties and a democratic republic structure and a free press '' is n't necessarily quite as inevitable as people might have thought at one point . 
  but i do n't think that it negates a real , across-the-board move towards democracy . 
  crimea . 
  the transition towards , if not democracy , a more-democratic style of government is certainly a global phenomenon , and democratic nations have done well in many regards . 
  that 's something of an empirical endorsement of it over , say , monarchy . 
  i have n't seen eastern and southern ukraine returned to ukranian control yet . 
  until then , it 's just words .

   what is in belgium that is of interest to the nsa ? 
  brussels , where i expect a lot of the deal-making in europe happens ? 
  it 'd be interesting to compare the embassy personnel count various countries have in brussels -- i 'm guessing that it 's not small , and intelligence there is presumably even more of a concern for member nations . 
   it 's not like the us had just bombed romania or blatantly helped the regime with oppressing the people a country is a big place , lot of people . 
  i 'd think that the same points would apply to georgia , and yet a few years back , someone tried [ lobbing a grenade at bush ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_arutyunian ) . 
   economic inequality from wikipedia 's [ economy of hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_hungary ) page that i was citing above , hungary is one of the most-equal countries in the world , to the extent that i was wondering whether that equality might be a cause . 
  ( a ) i 'd think that that would be a disconnected issue from this . 
  ( b ) i think that you 're thinking of the [ g36 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_g36#overheating ) rather than the [ g3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_g3 ) . 
  an entire article and they never described what the actual dispute was about ? 
  i do n't think that anyone would expect the ussr government to be trying to knock nixon off so much as some random individual to do so . 
   first and foremost is greece 's alliance with nato and the united states . 
  it will be hard for allies to accept such an agreement . 
  why ? 
  i mean , it might produce conflicting incentives , but militarily , i do n't think any alliance in history would object to a potential opponent giving it control of its weapons production system . 
   secondly , co-manufacturing kalashnikov might mean that the greek army will have to replace the existing g3 rifles that are designed in germany . 
  is there some reason to believe that this is the case , like russia saying so ? 
   all we have to do is remove the incentives that brought them here in the first place . 
  no jobs . 
  no housing . 
  no services . 
  no benefits . 
  once we remove the incentives that brought them here , they will leave on their own .

  [ news story from the 2012 ruling ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/23/italy-human-rights-migrants-libya ) . 
  the case was * hirsi and others v. italy * . 
   * hirsi jamaa and others v. italy * is the first case in which the european court of human rights delivers a judgment on interception-at-sea . 
  in the present context the latter term is a short-hand for referring to the enforced return of irregular migrants to the point of departure of their attempted mediterranean crossing , without any individual processing , let alone examination of asylum claims . 
  unanimously , the grand chamber found a violation of article 3 echr prohibiting inhuman and degrading treatment on a double count ( risk of ill-treatment in libya and risk of repatriation from libya to countries where ill-treatment is rife ) , a violation of article 4 of protocol no . 
  4 prohibiting collective expulsion and a violation of article 13 echr guaranteeing a domestic remedy for any arguable complaint of a violation of the convention . 
  these verdicts , reached by the grand chamber unanimously on 23 february 2012 , undoubtedly put into question the kind of bilateral and multilateral agreements which have been signed by european states in the last decade or so in order to fight clandestine immigration , not to mention the fact that they indirectly require major aspects of european migration policy to be revised . 
   libya does n't want them . 
  does italy ? 
  now imagine [ trying to pack that silliness into one * city * , as happens in san francisco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_francisco_municipal_railway#statistics ) :  at powell and market streets and california and market streets , three types of rail gauges come within a few hundred feet of each other : bay area rapid transit 's 5 ft 6 in ( 1,676 mm ) broad gauge ( which is underground in the lower level of the tunnels ) , muni metro 's 4 ft 8\u00a01\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard gauge ( also underground in the upper level of the tunnels ) , and the san francisco cable car system 's 3 ft 6 in ( 1,067 mm ) narrow gauge ( at street level a few hundred feet away to the north of market street in both cases ) . 
  the f market heritage railway is also present here , at street level on market street . 
  the rail lines , however , do not physically intersect . 
   the nations of europe had a thousand years to work together '' in friendly cooperation '' for the benefit of all .
