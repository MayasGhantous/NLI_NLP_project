  they ( almost ) never did . 
  they never formed the eu either , so presumably there are also some fundamentally-different processes going on today . 
   international law does n't mean anything < shrug  international law is no different than any other form of law in the sense that it 's just a compact between members , at the end of the day . 
  maybe one they inherited , but , still , a set of conventions that everyone adopts . 
  if you start violating them successfully , you may have a hard time getting other people to conform to those rules . 
  apparently it 's possible to [ order latvian sprats from the united states ] ( http://www.amazon.com/latvian-smoked-riga-sprats-pack/dp/b00djgedly/ ) . 
  just saying . 
  while that has * also * been criticized for not being public , the [ no-fly list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_fly_list ) of people who are n't allowed to get on a public aircraft in the us is n't private to be aggravating , but because it leaks information about investigations ; if abdul muzafar joins some extremist group and shortly thereafter everyone else in the group shows up on the no fly list , abdul may not be long for this world . 
  in this case , russia is just banning eu politicians from russia to make a political statement ; she could release the list ( as she just did ) without any harm to russian interests . 
  < shrug  this is a dump of negative bits from wikipedia 's text on hungary 's economy . 
  i have no personal expertise on that economy . 
  both of those were listed as negative factors , but i ca n't say whether those two were dominant relative to other issues . 
  because it 's kind of annoying if one * did * want to go to russia to only find out at the border that they ca n't get in . 
  skimming wikipedia for possible causes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_hungary  the fact that the euro and the swiss franc are worth a lot more in forints than they were before affected a lot of people . 
  according to the daily telegraph , `` statistics show that more than 60 percent of hungarian mortgages and car loans are denominated in foreign currencies '' . 
  [ 37 ] that probably sucked a lot of wealth out of the public ...  the 2006 pisa report concluded that while students from comprehensive schools did better than the oecd average , pupils from vocational secondary schools did much worse . 
  [ 92 ] [ snip ]  hungary 's gini coefficient of 0.269 [ 93 ] ranks 11th in the world . 
  [ 94 ] the graph on the right shows that hungary is close in equality to the world-leader denmark . 
  might be an inefficiently-flat distribution of wealth . 
  wikipedia is critical of the business system :  twenty years after the change of the regime , corruption remains to be a severe issue in hungary . 
  [ 107 ] according to transparency international hungary , almost one-third of top managers claim they regularly bribe politicians . 
  [ 107 ] most people ( 42 % ) in hungary think that the sector most affected by bribery is the political party system . 
  [ 108 ] bribery is common in the healthcare system in the form of gratitude payment -- 92 % of all people think that some payment should be made to the head surgeon conducting a heart operation or an obstetrician for a child birth . 
  [ 109 ]   another problem is the administrative burden : in terms of the ease of doing business , hungary ranks 47th out of 183 countries in the world . 
  [ 110 ] the five days ' time [ 98 ] required to start a new business ranks 29th , and the country is 122nd concerning the ease of paying taxes . 
  [ 111 ]   in accordance with the theory of the separation of powers , the judicial system is independent from the legislative and the executive branches . 
  [ 112 ] consequently , courts and prosecutions are not influenced by the government . 
  however , the legal system is slow and overburdened , which makes proceedings and rulings lengthy and inefficient . 
  [ 113 ] such a justice system is hardly capable of prosecuting corruption and protecting the country 's financial interests . 
  [ 107 ] a large portion of the economy is run by the state :  in hungary , state revenue makes up 44 % and expenditure makes up 45 % of the gdp which is relatively high compared to other eu members . 
  [ 119 ] this can be traced back to historical reasons such as socialist economic tradition as well as cultural characteristics that endorse paternalist behaviour on the state 's part , meaning that people have a habitual reflex that make them call for state subsidies . 
   place the emphasis on high skilled economic migrants instead of refugees . 
  i do n't understand why the us does n't expand h1-b ( skilled worker visa program ) . 
  it seems like a no-brainer , something that tends to benefit someone in an economically-strong position and make them better off in the future . 
   it contracted a loan ( a loan , not a gift ) with a russian bank no other banks would issue the loan due to risk . 
  is this the sort of `` loan '' where no repayment ( at least in the form of interest ) is in-practice expected ? 
  i could see objecting to a lot of monitoring , but i 'd be very disappointed if there * was n't * any embassy security monitoring . 
  * embassies have been a target of bombing . 
  * i assume that it 's fun for a spy to hang around and watch an embassy and see who goes in or out ( though might just be cheaper to rent an apartment and aim a video camera at it ... ) honestly , much as `` terrorism '' has been used as a bullshit term at times in the past , us embassy bombings are very real , and that seems more-than-legitimate . 
   germany still hopes that putin reverses everything he did and we can ramp up trade again . 
  one would n't think that having a tripwire force in the baltics would be so objectionable -- the only reason it 'd be problematic would be if russia wanted to retake them by force at some point in the future . 
   or am i wrong and this needs an unanimous decision ? 
  i do n't know how nato makes decisions * either * , but : https://fas.org/man/crs/rs21510.pdf  consensus in the nato decision-making process   consensus in the nac is generally sought when allied governments must formulate policy on an important strategic issue . 
  ex amples include approval of nato 's strategic concept ( nato 's document that serves as a strategic guideline ) , relations with partnership for peace countries , the nato budget , ** deployment of forces for peace operations ** , and invocation of article v. consensus is clearly differentiated from `` unanimity , '' which nato does not seek . 
  unanimity would require an actively stated vote in favor of a measure . 
  [ snip ]  ** the nac achieves consensus through a process in which no overnment states its objection . 
  ** a formal vote in which governments state their position is not taken . 
  during the kosovo conflict , for example , it was clear to all governments that greece was immensely uncomfortable with a decision to go to war . 
  nato does not require a government to vote in favor of a conflict , but rather to object explicitly if it opposes such a decision . 
  athens chose not to object , knowing its allies wished to take military action against serbia . 
  in contrast to nato , the eu seeks unanimity on key issues . 
  unanimity characterizes eu decision-making when , for example , new members are invited to join , or revisions to the union 's governing treaties must be adopted . 
  from that thirty-second skim , it sounds like countries have a veto , but that they have to explicitly object , outside of the context of a vote , for this to happen . 
  yes he is . 
  wikipedia [ says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_air_force#aircraft ) that estonia 's air force has * two * training jets , not one . 
  edit : i was also really confused when a number of estonian users thanked the us profusely on this subreddit for giving estonia two light transport planes recently . 
  i thought `` okay , this is kind of embarrassing ... it 's just two relatively-small planes . 
  i guess estonia wants to build bridges and emphasize common ground and all that , but they 're clearly going over the top . '', 
  it was n't until i checked wikipedia that i realized that estonia 's air force had four fixed-wing aircraft up until that point , two of which were world war ii-era biplanes . 
  this represented a 50 % increase in the estonian air force 's fixed-wing count . 
  well , you 've a german flair and nearly all of your posts are arguing against ukraine and in favor of russia , so i assume that at least one person in europe is affected . 
  or , more likely , particular groups favor one position or another . 
  my guess is that the young are more in favor of a weaker uk and a stronger eu , and the older are more in favor of a stronger uk and a weaker eu . 
  the uk 's been pretty good at that sort of thing in the past . 
  australia , to resolve the australia-in-eurovision dilemma . 
  huh . 
  i guess they have observer status , then , and the [ wikipedia map is just out-of-date ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe#/media/file:council_of_europe_map.svg ) ? 
  aside from expressing disapproval , what would booting russia out buy ? 
  i mean , has russia used her position on the council in particular to do things that you 'd find problematic ? 
   it can precisely locate any radar that 's emitting further than it 's own radar can see . 
  well , that 's true of pretty much anything , f-22 or no : you can see remote radar emissions at much more than the range that you can see your own go out to something , bounce off an object , and then come back . 
  it does n't have to be just one or the other ; you could tie a pension * somewhat * to the number of children you have . 
  it 's not such a crazy idea , if you consider that raising a child is a positive externality for your pension system . 
  i 'm doubtful ( though , granted , i do n't have statistics handy ) that the main cause of low fertility levels is erectile dysfunction . 
  well , a better phrasing of the question would be `` assuming that x is n't an option , how would we solve problem y ? '', 
  or just ask reddit not to permit subreddits to show custom stylesheets in your preferences . 
  it 's considered bad form , though , to bypass that . 
  the issue is that reddit * has * no real `` upvotes only '' feature for subreddits to enable , though a number of subreddits do prefer that model . 
  it 's not much smaller than helsinki , it appears to be within easy commuting distance of helsinki , and unlike helsinki , it does n't appear to be geographically-constrained , which i assume means that housing prices are n't elevated . 
  this is not to argue that finland should accept `` refugees '' , but what about espoo ? 
  these laws are clearly signs of a strong and secure government that is n't concerned about domestic disapproval and is confident in their ability to explain and support anything that comes up . 
   finding these bombs would be much easier if there would be records of all bombs that did n't explode . 
    bombing runs were almost always done in a group of half a dozen or more bombers . 
  records from whom ? 
  germany was n't going to be able to keep records , and the us and the uk had a bunch of people being shot at dropping bombs with dubious accuracy . 
  maybe some bombs fell atop each other , maybe some were duds , maybe one aircraft got hit by flak just before or just after dropping ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/precision_bombing#world_war_ii  the us defined the target area as being a 1,000 ft ( 300 m ) radius circle around the target point - for the majority of usaaf attacks only about 20 % of the bombs dropped struck in this area . 
  that 's [ assuming that the right country was being bombed in the first place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombings_of_switzerland_in_world_war_ii ) . 
  aircraft navigation was n't all that great back then . 
  in all fairness , i 'm being loose with words -- niagra actually refers to three waterfalls , and the one flipped off there was the american falls . 
  the one you most-commonly see pictures of -- that big arc of water -- is the canadian [ horseshoe falls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_falls ) , which is by far the largest . 
  all of the three have never been shut down simultaneously . 
  we [ did temporarily dry out niagra falls ] ( http://photoblog.nbcnews.com/_news/2010/12/16/5661928-niagara-falls-without-water-as-seen-in-1969 ) , but i guess you 're right about the constraints -- the rhine is pretty straight there , and the whole area looks pretty built-up . 
  oh , you 're right -- looks like there 's actually seven , with four of them inexplicably with a smaller label than three of them . 
  the uk and the us had a lot more bombers . 
  i do wonder about unexploded shells , though . 
  also , a google does n't turn up much on land mine numbers , but those are probably pretty substantial . 
  yup . 
  also , the lancaster could haul a heavier payload than contemporary us bombers : [ wikipedia : avro lancaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avro_lancaster ) :  22,000 lb ( 10,000 kg ) bombs [ wikipedia : b-17 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_b-17_flying_fortress ) :  at overload-level capacity , 17,600 lb ( 7,800 kg ), 
  there are apparently three [ legoland theme parks ] ( http://www.legoland.com/ ) . 
  honestly , if it 's * that * common , and if it 's not possible to otherwise detect them , would it make sense to divert the rhine long enough to clear the bed ?
