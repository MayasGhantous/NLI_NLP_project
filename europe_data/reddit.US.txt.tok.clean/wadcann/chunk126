  i mean , that 's a lot of explosive sitting around becoming gradually more-unstable . 
   sorry about that . 
  actually , sounds like this one was our fault :  it is believed to be an american design guess yours had better fuzes . 
   let 's just say that norway is not famous for its culinary art . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_cuisine i do recognize [ jarlsberg cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jarlsberg_cheese ) , even from the us . 
   rod blagojevich the former governor of illinois from 2003-2009 is in the middle of a 14 year sentence for soliciting bribes . 
  good ol' [ kwame kilpatrick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kwame_kilpatrick ) , the mayor of detroit , got 28 years in prison from fraud and racketeering , in addition to some prior time from sentencing . 
  that 's a broad statement , though ... the degree of objection may differ significantly from field to field , though . 
  for example , a country might want to retain taxation control , but be comfortable with having an external agency to investigate corruption . 
  could even be opt-in or opt out ( that is , you could agree to have external investigations or not , but not veto individual investigations short of leaving the organization entirely ) . 
  interpol was a well-pre-eu example of international european cooperation , so it 's not without precedent . 
  in the us , the fbi played a role in cracking down on the mafia even where local police had been bought off . 
   imagine them stark naked with shampoo still in their hair , and it gets better when i first parsed this , i thought that you were referring to the navy seals . 
  was it that any individual european * country * was too much at risk ? 
  one of the more-popular elements of the eu seems to be a promise of cracking down on corruption . 
  i 've heard people on here cite the fact that eu grants had real oversight versus non-eu national grants in their countries , and so they tended to be more-effective . 
  i saw a huge flood of very popular articles here about romania 's efforts towards addressing corruption . 
  it might be popular for the eu to establish a corruption investigation organization , if such a thing does n't exist . 
  that avoids the `` no smaller country wants to step up and get burned '' issue . 
  fifa is european culture ? 
  people play soccer whether fifa is around or not . 
  [ japan has a 99 % conviction rate , and it 's not necessarily viewed as a good thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conviction_rate ) . 
  a new organization that 's willing to play by bribery laws and wants a piece of the soccer enthusiast market ? 
  `` politicians '' do n't operate in a vacuum , particularly on social values policies . 
  they 're driven by what 's popular with the public . 
  a lot of the * public * feels that a large chunk of the rest of the public requires their ( legally-imposed ) guidance as to how to live their sexual life . 
   the concern here is relying on one or two countries to produce the vast majority of europe 's food , allowing those countries to extort/blackmail europe just as russia has done in the past with its gas/oil leverage . 
  i want to be clear that i have not poked at this before ; this is an off-the-cuff responsible , but i 'm very doubtful . 
  with gas and oil , ( a ) there are only a few viable sources , and ( b ) switching to alternative fuels requires significant changeover time . 
  with food : * almost any country can ship to europe ( barring some sort of blockade , which you ruled out as a real possibility ) . 
  what kind of trade bloc are you planning on going up against that would be controlling sufficient of the world 's agricultural market to refuse europe food ? 
  sure , someone could make , oh , almonds exorbitantly-expensive , sure . 
  * europe has access to most of those markets , because it can outbid people around the world . 
  even * if * something went wrong , europe would be unlikely to be near the bottom of the totem pole . 
  remember ireland during the great famine being angry that english landlords were shipping food out of ireland to places that were wealthier because demand was higher elsewhere ? 
  that blade cuts two ways . 
  * we have the ability to sacrifice food quality for quantity in a number of cases . 
  i remember one fascinating statistic that the us * alone * could feed europe with no outside sources * or * any increase in us food production by the simple expedient of everyone not eating meat : for grain to be eaten directly rather than fed to cattle and other livestock , which is an energy-inefficient type of food to produce . 
  the same could probably be said of many other countries around the world . 
  * transitioning among , say , barley , wheat , rice , potatoes and corn ( which i assume is what you 're referring to , since they 're staples ) is pretty easy , since they all act as substitutes for each other . 
  * isolating a food market does not come for free . 
  what i meant by the admittedly-simplifying shorthand `` forced '' is that it means that : ( 1 ) all industries outside of the agricultural industry wind up being slightly-weakened by higher taxes so that the agricultural industry can be internally-competitive and ( 2 ) labor that would be more-efficiently spent in , say , an office is now out on a farm somewhere . 
  that cost may not be directly-visible , but it 's real . 
  there are many substances there are important to an economy . 
  iron ore , chemicals , food , energy sources , you name it . 
  you * could * mandate that the people and industry in the eu * must * get by on only what they can internally-produce , but that does place some pretty unpleasant restrictions on the economy . 
  if , for example , china wanted to do so , it could cut the us off from rare earth minerals at the current market price . 
  that would definitely be disruptive to the us , * but * : given time , the us can bring online alternate sources -- other mines can be expanded , recycling/reclamation improved , alternate technologies developed , and so forth . 
  so this is really a question of the short term . 
  china doing so would produce a backlash from the us with similarly-unpleasant restrictions , and so it 's a pretty good bet that china is n't going to be very enthusiastic about doing so . 
  cutting off the eu is no joke -- it 's a pretty hefty economic beast , and getting into a trade war with it is n't going to be much fun . 
   it also allows europe to more easily develop and implement the technological advances when dealing with agricultural production and crop growth . 
  probably , in the sense that shifting money into anything will tend to increase development in that area . 
  but what 's the clear win in trading off other things for agricultural science ? 
   it allows us to also stabilise food prices internally , so a drought/low yield in africa will have a much diminished effect on our food prices compared to those that import food from that part of the world . 
  the flip side being that it will stabilize at a higher price . 
  if i understand correctly , though , this article ( and the one it linked to ) were summaries from politicians talking about their own accomplishments . 
  there were n't really any concrete specifics , and i 'm not sure where the treaty text is . 
  for example , it 's plausible that however the thing was written left open the possibility of that control having a minimum bound be placed on it . 
  this is n't intended to say `` that should be accepted by the irish '' , but rather that i 'd just be very surprised to have a direct violation of an earlier treaty attempted . 
  it would presumably put the politicians involved in a pretty bad place . 
  i 'm not aware of city-scale successful communist environments , but there * are * [ communes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commune ) . 
  i 'm fairly sure that these never exceeded a few hundred people . 
  while these have a long history in the us , dating back to various types of reformers showing up on us shores from europe , they never really `` took off '' in the sense of spreading much . 
  the most successful long-running examples i can think of are : * the [ hutterites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hutterite ) . 
  these have been running for a long , long time , in the us dating back to early german immigration to america . 
  combined , wikipedia says that they * could * fill a town ( some tens of thousands of them ) , but each community is only maybe a maximum of two hundred people . 
  it 's worth noting that this is rather-interestingly close to [ dunbar 's number ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunbar%27s_number ) . 
  these are worth a read if someone * is * into communes , because they were probably what i 'd consider the most serious attempts to establish a commune-oriented society . 
  they did function well enough to last , but did n't manage successfully establish many-generation-spanning culture , and most of these were reformed to eliminate the communal property model in the last few decades . 
  it looks like the largest of these made it up to [ 1,400 people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ma%27agan_michael ) . 
  i do n't have a problem with people having a discussion of * policies * -- i reference us policies all the time in comparison to european ones -- but that 's not what i 'm complaining about . 
  it 's when the conversation collapses into one of a million variations of `` members of group a are a bunch of stupidheads ! '', 
  `` no , members of group b are a bunch of naive morons ! '', 
  and heads downhill . 
  few want to read that after about the third time , because it 's just zero-content noise . 
  sure , was just responding to your above comment about winning wars accidentally . 
  hmm . 
  those are german projects ? 
  i 've heard of some of those raised as examples of problems in consortium-based development . 
  * as far as i can tell from the [ eurofighter typhoon wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurofighter_typhoon ) , the production was consortium-based . 
  * again based on its wikipedia page , it * does * look like the [ eurohawk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_grumman_rq-4_global_hawk#eurohawk ) only involved germany in europe , but the issue there was over the fact that the eurohawk variant apparently did n't have tcas certification and that nobody wanted to pay the price for this at the low volume being produced . 
  arguably , that should have been ironed out earlier in the development process , but it 's not clear that that made it slow . 
  * for the puma , germany produced two -- [ one armored car ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sdkfz_234 ) during world war ii ( which sounds like it was turned out pretty quickly ) , and one [ today ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puma_%28ifv%29 ) . 
  it looks like something like 12 years between start of development and delivery of the latter finished vehicle , which i suppose is long ... but then again , at least in the us , it was aiming to replace the bradley ... and there are n't [ entire movies done to criticize the puma 's development process ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyprhozqby ) . 
  * i 've never heard of the idz effort until now , but i 'd point out that the us had what looks like a similar sci-fi-concept-drawing-marketing-material-adorned project called [ future force warrior ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_force_warrior ) that did n't go anywhere . 
  * [ a400m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airbus_a400m_atlas ) appears to be another consortium project . 
  our whole military is volunteer during peacetime . 
  are you saying that people were n't drafted into the army corps of engineers during wartime ? 
  it is during wartime , but my point is that it 's not the `` soldiers acting as contruction workers '' that i believe that you 're truly objecting to , but rather the 20 year conscription . 
   and from what i understand , germany is so overrun by turks these days it will soon be new turkey and they will be running your country . 
  i worked with a turkish guy for a while . 
  he was a nice guy . 
  the same thing happened with , say , irish immigrants in the united states ; about half of the us presidents [ have irish ancestry somewhere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_americans_of_irish_descent#presidents ) . 
  hard to say that immigration policy is n't related to geopolitics . 
  we [ do that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seabees ) over [ in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/army_corps_of_engineers ) too . 
  i can understand objecting to many of the policies , but not to ordering a soldier to build something . 
  let 's suppose that russia would take them , to bolster , say , land claims against china . 
  they get dumped in siberia . 
  they are n't going to be making much money the way they could in europe .
