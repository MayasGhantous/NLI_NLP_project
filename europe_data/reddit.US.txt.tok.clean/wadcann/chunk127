  it sounds like he 's opposed to culture and lack of education rather than race ; he just said that he 's from morocco . 
  the article states that this was predominantly heterosexually-spread . 
  no idea what metrics they used , but ... :  the reasons behind the hiv epidemic are twofold : intravenous drug use and unsafe sex . 
  more than 60 % of hiv-positive russians are thought to have used drugs , but the most common method of spreading the disease is heterosexual intercourse . 
   it 's interesting how much america has copied the traditional english lawn , specially in climates very different from the uk climate . 
  often to the extent of causing major problems . 
  `` i 'm going to have a great lawn here . '', 
  `` this is a desert . 
  you ca n't have a lawn here . '', 
  `` i 'll just keep pouring water on it . 
  you watch me . '', 
  it does n't even make * sense * any more -- most people spend way more time inside than outside . 
  the concept of having a fast-growing ( and thus fast-repairing ) plant that can be walked on serves no point unless you 're going to actually walk on it ... if not , you might as well be putting something more-interesting there . 
  well , us churches * are * normally tax-exempt , which amounts to a subsidy . 
  does germany have a reputation for slow engineering ? 
  i was n't aware of such . 
  the article described the [ eads talarion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eads_talarion ) , which apparently did n't generate willingness to purchase from the uk :  previous european efforts have failed . 
  france , germany and spain signed for a risk reduction study in 2007 and airbus invested at least $ 250 million to design a european male uav . 
    but the company closed its talarion project in the absence of government orders . 
  ( as an aside , the talarian wikipedia page does n't mention this ; should probably be updated ... ), 
  i 'm pretty sure that music has contained similar content for a long time in a lot of different places . 
   and national security officials complain they are under intense pressure to keep air and sea missions to a minimum , at a time when migrants from africa and the middle east are rushing to greece 's shores . 
  i still do n't totally understand the `` the border states must pay for border security '' when the eu permits freedom of movement . 
  i ca n't figure out what exactly positive incentive it provides : i 'd think that non-border states benefit from having border control . 
   we get it , you want to reclaim your world power title but that ai n't going to happen with your soviet era military and with 143 million people . 
  well , if the 143m is actually the source of the problem , then one obvious response is `` well , we need to capture more again '' . 
  ( more-realistically -- or raise fertility levels , or become an appealing place to live that people immigrate to en-masse . ), 
  the entire article was based on two sentence fragments from obama :  `` we had a chance to discuss the situation in ukraine and the increasingly aggressive posture that russia has taken , '' and  obama said this was a `` challenging and important time for nato . '', 
  neither of which say much of anything concrete . 
  there 's just not much meat to the article . 
  why not ? 
  okay , i 'm no expert on accounting or international business , but what 's the basis for saying that a system can not exist which is more-resistant to a multinational shifting where money is made on paper around ? 
  well , i guess theoretically they could establish a walled garden with hefty tariffs , isolate the eu 's economy , and then start passing minimum tax laws within the eu . 
  obviously , not going to actually happen , but ... for me it just comes back to `` if you 're irked about some company exploiting holes in your tax code , fix your tax code '' . 
  if the us is irate about apple not paying taxes because it paid a bunch of accountants to figure out how it could make use of laws and not repatriate money , the us needs to go fix its tax code , not say `` well , let 's just make sure that every country elsewhere has * higher * corporate tax than us '' . 
  doing anything short of that is n't going to address the problem via minimum taxation . 
   whereas large multinationals can structure their businesses in such a way that they do n't have to pay it . 
  maybe the real problem is that national tax codes are structured in such a way that they are vulnerable to this . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  okay , if it 's just built on exploiting flawed foreign tax codes , that 's one thing , but it 's no skin off my back if a multinational operating in the us has headquarters elsewhere . 
     migrants from ee are indeed younger , and they do contribute to the public purse in the short term , but they get old too , meaning a new wave of migrants is needed to pay for them as they get older . 
  do you know what a ponzi scheme is ? 
  this is not a ponzi scheme . 
  even if this is unsustainable and structured like a pyramid , a [ ponzi scheme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponzi_scheme ) * must * additionally contain fraudulent claims of returns as an element of the scheme . 
  it 's not an us-or-them question -- if you increase corporate taxes in an area ( okay , barring things like shell companies that just have a headquarters in an area , but that 's not relevant ) , you will pay into it via lower wages or higher prices . 
   they granted assurances who granted these , and in what form ? 
   tax haven that 's a separate issue -- you could deal with properly-accounting for money * earned * in one country not being classifiable under another country 's tax system without mandating a minimum tax level . 
   `` ( these companies ) produce food with high levels of fat , sugar and salt , with high levels of calories and low levels of micro-nutrients , '' the amendment read . 
  `` this is in contrast with the need to promote eating habits which are both healthier and more sustainable . '' i 'm not saying that it 's not a laudable ideal to eat healthily and all that ... but as a matter of perspective , we 're talking about a spat between pizza-makers and burger-makers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newspaper_of_record the * washington post * makes wikipedia 's list of examples for the us , for what that 's worth . 
  wikipedia says that that kind of line does n't really exist any more . 
  for example , i 'd consider the * wall street journal * to be in that group , would consider television news to have a much larger impact than newspapers ( due to their larger reach ) , and would consider the internet to be increasingly important ( it * is * successfully killing off most newspapers in the united states , after all ) . 
   is self reliance on food an `` insane '' policy ? 
  depends on the country . 
  it 's definitely insane for singapore . 
  just depends on where you draw the line . 
  i kinda think ( without familiarity with the specific concerns ) that it is n't a good idea . 
  the last time that large chunks of europe had no access to the global food market was the us-uk blockade in world war ii . 
  unless europe has plausible concerns about a combination sea and land embargo ( i do n't even know how that would happen ... turkey , russia , and the us all team up to block transport in and out ? 
  ) , mandating that all food produced for an industrialized , high-population-density part of the world does n't make sense . 
  if you must stockpile foods , that i could see , but subsidizing agriculture in such a way is just forcing people in europe into agriculture when they would more-efficiently be doing something else . 
  that being said , there may be domestic political reasons ( e.g. 
  farmers need to be bought off for one reason or another ) . 
  thanks . 
  that was a good read . 
  if they 're trying for an [ outline of the actual organ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heart ) , it 's not bad . 
   russia is never giving back crimea . 
  http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/03/238897.htm  this week , as russia attempts to validate its cynical and calculated `` liberation '' of crimea , we reaffirm that sanctions related to crimea will remain in place as long as the occupation continues . 
  the united states continues to support ukraine 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and right to self-determination . 
  going to be an unpleasant forever for russia , then . 
  ( in practice , i assume that paying off ukraine or swapping territory would be a more-viable alternative . ), 
  from a standpoint of direct , continental european interests , though , that may not be the case . 
  it might be a headache for the us ( and much more so for smaller countries in the area ) , but ... 
  / u/executivemonkey , one reason that i come here because i do n't like the d-r shitslinging in / r/politics ; for whatever reason , europeans seem to be able to be a bit more objective about issues ( or maybe i just see a non-representative sample on reddit ) . 
  please do n't start that up here and have this place wind up sucking as much as that hellhole . 
  understood , but i 'm kinda suspicious ( though no special expertise in the area ) that the exclusive use of the term `` communist '' in the cold war era had more to do with trying to avoid organizations in the east trying to co-opt socialist organizations in the west than anything else . 
  the drone portrayed does n't appear to be capable of carrying armament . 
  there 's some reason to believe that it 's [ not the drone type being actually used ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37bs7r/nato_to_deploy_drones_over_baltic/crlrkb9 ) , but i 'd caution in assuming that this involves more than just reconaissance aircraft . 
  the picture in the article ( which is n't identified ) is of a us navy [ mq-4c ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_grumman_mq-4c_triton ) . 
  however , the article did n't specifically identify it , and it might just be used to have a stock drone picture of about the right type . 
  the mq-4c apparently has a slightly-longer range ( 9950 nmi , or 18,427 km ) . 
  the article says that the range of the drone program is 16,000 km , which is suspiciously specific and shorter ; if we assume that that 's accurate , for the drones here , it might not be mq-4cs . 
  assuming that the range is correct , maybe something else . 
  the [ eads talarion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eads_talarion ) has the right range ( albeit an even-lower ceiling ) , but it does n't look like eads will have it finished for a while . 
  edit : it looks like talarion was canceled anyway . 
  iirc , / u/ltburtreynolds is an american who wants to pull out of international involvement due to expense and people getting angry over us involvement elsewhere . 
   the hainian incident was us entering entering in china economic zone that has been recognize by the un . 
  countries do not maintain air or marine control over [ exclusive economic zones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zones ) ( up to 200 nm offshore ) beyond the legal right to the marine resources found in them . 
  they differ from territorial waters ( up to twelve nm offshore ) , where they * can * start to impose restrictions . 
  and for what it 's worth , i have pointed out this wrt russian aircraft in the baltic sea on this sub in the last few weeks -- i 'm not only highlighting this because it 's the us , but because it 's incorrect . 
  the reason the brits do n't like having the bombers flying at them is because it 's a threat , a mock charge , not because it 's a violation of international law . 
   and . . china is claiming way more territory than it deserves . 
  any time you get into prescriptives , you run into difficult questions , though , because you 're outside of science and law and into questions of value . 
  china 's got a large population ... should it take land proportional to its population , for example ? 
  that 'd be a great system for india and china and singapore , but not so good for russia , canada , and the us . 
  according to international agreements , artificial islands do n't have territorial waters anyway . 
   deliberately enter in china airspace to spy on them . 
  the us does n't ( as far as i or any other member of the public knows , at any rate ) enter china 's airspace . 
  it does n't make a lot of sense to do so these days , anyway -- countries have had spy satellites for some decades now , and it 's a lot less objectionable to just use those if you want to see something . 
  [ the us used to have high-altitude reconaissance planes violate russian airspace way back before spy satellites were up , but that 's a thing of the past ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_aerial_reconnaissance_of_the_soviet_union ) .
