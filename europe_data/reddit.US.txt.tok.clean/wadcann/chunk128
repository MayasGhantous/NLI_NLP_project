  it 's politically-objectionable , expensive , has the risk of being intercepted , etc. 
  i expect that if the united states were carving off bits of countries in europe , people would feel rather the same way about it . 
  neither socialism nor anarchism mandate moneylessness , and none of the above require democratic councils , though that would not be incompatible with them , and some particular * forms * of them might mandate them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism  in political and social sciences , communism ( from latin communis -- common , universal ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is a social , political , and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society , which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production , absence of social classes , money , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and the state . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism  socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarchism  anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self-governed voluntary institutions , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] anarchism holds the state to be undesirable , unnecessary , or harmful . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] while anti-statism is central , [ 11 ] anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations , including , but not limited to , the state system . 
  ehhh ... nah , i think that `` fascist '' wins . 
  a lot of socialist countries controlled by parties with the term `` communist '' in their name were described as `` communist countries '' , even though they had not , broadly-speaking , adopted communism . 
  but `` fascism '' has been used to refer to a much broader range of things , including little more than `` authoritarian '' . 
  no -- those are n't bombers . 
  that was an electronic intelligence plane that got hit by a fighter buzzing it . 
  it does n't carry bombs or other weapons . 
  edit : well , * maybe * the crew has pistols ( not sure if that still happens ) , but for all intents and purposes , the plane is not at risk of doing more than spying on radio transmissions ; it ca n't attack a country . 
  edit2 : well , i guess the crew could fly the thing into a building or something , but the same could be said of any aircraft ( and much more-so for large-bodied commercial airliners than that thing ) . 
   the simple fact of the matter is that they will never return it to ukraine . 
  [ us state department ] ( http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/03/238897.htm ) :  this week , as russia attempts to validate its cynical and calculated `` liberation '' of crimea , we reaffirm that sanctions related to crimea will remain in place as long as the occupation continues . 
  the united states continues to support ukraine 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and right to self-determination . 
  going to be a long and cold future for russia , then . 
  europe eats [ blood sausage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_sausage ) in all sorts of forms . 
  for whatever reason , while there are a lot of european foods in the us , this particular one never made it to the us , outside of a few tiny areas . 
  how would you describe the difference in taste and texture to meat-based sausage ? 
   `` the united states and turkey 's other nato allies should be urging ( erdogan ) to turn away from this destructive path , '' the new york times editorial said . 
    erdogan spat back `` who are you ? 
  could you say something like this to the us administration ? '', 
  i take it that mr. erdogan does n't read the * new york times * or other us media . 
  as far as i know , not these days ... but go back to the deepest , iciest pits of the cold war , and the [ us then makes russia 's sporadic strategic bomber runs look like nothing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_chrome_dome ) : in the 1960s , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , 365 days a year , there was always at least one us strategic bomber loaded with nuclear weapons on an inbound to russia ; by the time it broke off and turned around , one or more additional bombers were inbound . 
  i expect that it adds to [ alarm fatigue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alarm_fatigue ) on the other side . 
  i suspect that one role of nato is that the bar for getting in is lower than that of the eu . 
  a country in eastern europe can enter nato , not need to worry about being attacked by russia , do whatever reforms are required , and then join the eu . 
  if you want to do otherwise , i 'd think that you 'd need one of the following : * you need to assume that russia will not militarily involve itself in countries that look like they 'd like to associate with the eu ( given recent events , doubtful ) . 
  * you need to lower the bar to enter the eu . 
  as soon as a country looks like it would like to enter the eu , it needs to be accepted . 
  * you need to create a `` nato-lite '' that only involves european countries , another circle on europe 's venn diagram where a country can receive defense guarantees without economic integration ; `` full '' eu membership can be a later stage . 
  * you need to have the european army act not merely as a defensive organization , and go out attacking people who attack non-eu members who have asked to join the eu . 
  whether finland * does * actually plan to join or not , keeping the option on the table is probably the most-usable club the government has against russia ; it seems very unlikely that they 'd say `` okay , there is now no chance of us joining nato '' . 
  how many other high profile , pan-european competitions are there ? 
   and all it takes is fucking over a whole generation of people !, 
  sucks to be them , huh . 
  happens every time generation n borrows expecting generation n +1 to pay for their goodies . 
  there were similar internal russian predictions of how finns would do the same thing in the winter war . 
  however , i 'd point out that an `` expert '' on tv may or may not represent the * actual * take that the government has . 
  if you 're putting out propaganda , you want to sell the matter domestically as a liberation , not a takeover . 
  that does n't mean that the kremlin internally necessarily mis-called this .

  technically , us states are n't required to let people vote on the president ; just to elect the electors who do select the president . 
  in practice , that elector is today expected to follow a popular vote . 
  still , [ it is the case that the representative has differed in their behavior ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faithless_elector ) from what the people ask for . 
  it 's not a moral statement ( i 'm assuming that there 's some strength requirement that excludes them ; they apparently do serve on mlrs systems in the us army , from the same page ) , but asking whether germany even would wind up with women in tanks at all . 
   and tanks ca n't sail , too . 
  [ swimming tanks were sailing in ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dd_tank ) to end the occupation of france in the * 1940s * . 
  the contemporary [ chinese type 63 amphibious light tank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_63_%28tank%29 ) can swim for 120km . 
  the us sells gobs of military hardware to both .

  i dunno , all seems kinda familiar .

   proposing a 155mm tank gun is absolutely insane . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t30_heavy_tank that was a 67 ton tank with a 155mm gun . 
  granted , i do n't know what the t7e1 or t180 muzzle velocity was like , or what the mass of the round was . 
  it could fire ap rounds , though , so i assume that it moved at least reasonably-quickly . 
   the russians have taken a very different approach to armour . 
  the us also now [ optionally places reactive armor on the thinner side armor of the m1 in their urban warfare kit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1_abrams#tank_urban_survival_kit ) , though it also has composite armor . 
  hmm . 
  the us army [ does n't place women in tanks ] ( http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/combat/m1-armor-crewman.html ) , much less pregnant ones . 
  does the * bundeswehr * ? 
  oh , huh , someone said that he was from new zealand the other day . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  nothing in this article states that this was * quid pro quo * for anything related to nato . 
  < shrug  i 'm weighing your opinion on it versus theirs ( and thinkprogress is an opposed political website ; it 'd be like asking a website advocating for ukip about labour in the uk ) . 
  i do n't know how viable iter is , but i do n't think that they 'd have any particular interest in killing it if they saw it as viable . 
  but , all right -- let 's say that they 're wrong , and it * is * an extremely viable and lucrative technology . 
  other members can go ahead and fund it , and will certainly make back their investment many times over .

  the european union has more military manpower and a larger military budget than russia . 
  would n't you be a bit more irked about a * foreign * government having access to your information than your own ? 
  at what point was such a * quid pro quo * requested ? 
   the $ 35.4 billion bill would bump spending on doe 's basic research arm , the office of science , by 1.5 % to $ 5.144 billion . 
  you sure that it 's not just that the senate did n't see iter as particularly viable ? 
  well ... that * is * pressure , albeit not initiated by nato . 
  i do n't really see why having a tie-in with alexander the great is so important to * either * side . 
  he 's some military leader from 2300 years ago who ran an army that is by modern standards tiny . 
  yes , but knowing where to report to is part of getting that something to them quickly .

  hmm . 
  this is ten years out-of-date , but : http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_237.en.pdf page 8 , languages most-commonly used in the eu . 
  | rank | language | mother tongue | total | | - | - | - | - | | 1 | english | 13 % | 47 % | | 2 | german | 18 % | 30 % | | 3 | french | 12 % | 23 % | | 4 | italian | 13 % | 15 % | | 5 | spanish | 9 % | 14 % | | 6 | polish | 9 % | 10 % | | 7 | dutch | 5 % | 6 % | | 8 | russian | 1 % | 6 % | in this chart , russian is ranked below dutch , but it 's close enough to tie it back in 2005 in whole-number terms . 
  based on [ wikipedia : languages of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union ) , this sounds like it is in significant part because of 3.5 m germans ; i assume that this is a result of russia having controlled east germany for so long . 
   russian is also understood by a majority of ethnic latvians , estonians , and lithuanians born before c. 1980 , since , as official language of the soviet union , it was a compulsory school subject in those countries during the soviet era .
