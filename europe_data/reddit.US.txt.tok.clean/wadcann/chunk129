   and its unusually liberal economy . 
  ... which tends to include policies that produce income inequality ... 
  china is n't all * that * friendly with russia . 
  both of you were in the [ battle of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_france ) . 
   as for the boots that has nothing to do with the conversation fair enough . 
   russia produce its own in the name of accuracy , the us * did * send russia [ upwards of a million pairs of boots ] ( https://whatreallyhappened.com/wrharticles/pearl/www.geocities.com/pentagon/6315/lend.html ) . 
  i 'm sure that russia produced many of its own , though . 
  the putin youth will go far !, 
  [ that 's australia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emu_war ) , unless your statement is just going over my head . 
  good job , ireland !, 
   seems to me you are on the wrong sub if you oppose national health care and workers rights . 
  no , because i do n't come here because i 'm hoping for a circlejerk about my views ; it 's because i 'm interested in international affairs in europe . 
  `` human rights '' is a broad term , and is n't bounded in its scope . 
  with the iescr , specifically ? 
  * i 'm opposed to mandating that the state provide health care . 
  i view this as an essentially-unbounded black hole and introducing externalities to the market . 
  health care is a limited resource , and i want it allocated and funded the same way any other limited resource is . 
  there 's a reason that people fly from around the world to the united states for health care . 
  * i 'm opposed to mandating that the state guarantee the right to strike without the employer being able to penalize strikers ( e.g. 
  by firing them in direct response ) . 
  substantial areas of the us workforce are prohibited from striking , like police or air traffic control operators , due to the serious impact it has . 
  i view strikes as just as objectionable as any * other * monopoly in a non-labor field leveraging monopoly power ; it 's the same thing as companies colluding to set prices . 
  just as that leads to market failure for companies , so does it when labor does this . 
  i think that the rate of strikes causes serious economic harm in europe . 
  * i want the market to set workplace benefits , rather than the state . 
  an employer has every interest in choosing benefits in a form that maximize employee utility relative to how much it decreases their own utility , and i see that as efficient ; i do n't want the state saying `` benefits must take the form of this much vacation '' , for example . 
  it 's unclear to me how the state would be addressing any externality in that situation . 
  * i 'm opposed to mandating that the state provide housing or other benefits , if those have not been earned ( in practice , i suspect that broadly-speaking , the state is likely better-off doing so , because there are some associated costs in not doing so , but i do n't want any mandate in place ; i want that up to policy-makers to try various approaches ) . 
  * the us has a very weak definition of [ moral rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_rights ) in intellectual property law , and i am opposed to strengthening these ; i do n't see these as desirable . 
  they do n't seem to create any useful incentives to me . 
  * i 'm opposed to mandating that higher education must be provided by the taxpayer . 
  i * want * there to be strong disincentives to spending a lot of money on studying underwater basket-weaving . 
  i feel that studying a skillset that pays for itself * should * be a factor that people take into account when choosing their skills . 
  i also do n't see any reason for the non-university-educated to subsidize the university-educated . 
  these are all provisions of that treaty . 
   do people really complain about overly broad human rights ? 
  well , the us is n't part of the eu , but i think that rather than maintaining a core set of principles required for the eu to operate , it 's become a grab-bag of every idea that social reformers want , and thus becomes mandatory for everyone . 
  the us never ratified the [ icescr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_covenant_on_economic,_social_and_cultural_rights ) , and i 'd be opposed to it doing so , for example . 
  i 'm having a hard time seeing how those two statistics have anything to do with a conspiracy claim . 
  a $ 6m drone probably has a bit more r&d behind it than a gopro taped to a remote-control model airplane . 
  while the us backs israel , israel has had [ a history ] ( http://www.wrmea.org/1996-january/u.s.-military-technology-sold-by-israel-to-china-upsets-asian-power-balance.html ) of [ sending ] ( http://www.wrmea.org/1999-january-february/u.s.-israel-at-odds-over-israeli-defense-sales-and-technology-transfer-to-india-china.html ) military [ technology ] ( http://defensetech.org/2013/12/24/report-israel-passes-u-s-military-technology-to-china/ ) east . 
  it 's caused substantial friction with the us . 
  well ... i do n't know for sure how it interacts with * military * transport planes ( so it may not be applicable ) , but there is a [ freedom of the air ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedoms_of_the_air ) , which among other things grants the right for * commercial * air traffic to pass over another country without landing ( granted , you get cases like mh17 , but that 's not * supposed * to happen ) . 
  in this case , though , it 's a military flight to supply or transport russian soldiers ... i do n't know how that works . 
  [ ukraine is a signatory to this treaty ] ( http://www.icao.int/memberstates/member%20states.multilingual.pdf ) , so i believe that russia would still have the right to fly at least commercial air transit through to transnistria . 
  birth certificates do not define citizenship ( at least in the us ) . 
  useful to have as documentation , yes ... 
   you cant subside ukraine because it is corrupt as fuck and only 5 % of it would get to the troops at the front , also likely to make it worse . 
  assuming that we agree that elimination of corruption is possible , what processes should start in ukraine to address this ? 
   the russian army does not have the logistic capabilities to attack the eu and nato . 
  could you expand on that ? 
  what are the specific logistical limitations ? 
  i am absolutely-convinced that russia would lose a conventional war against nato -- it would n't even be a contest , and unless the eu screws up , the eu could probably also take on russia single-handedly ; it has the resources to do so , at any rate . 
  but the reasons you 're giving in your [ below post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36lfm5/president_poroshenko_talks_of_real_war_with_russia/crf9utc ) on why russia would be unable to support invading troops seem very dubious to me :  sure within their own territories , with their own road system and in peacetime settings . 
  if they have to do it in foreign countries with road-signs that arent even using their own alphabet , while under threat from airstrikes and artillery the case would be a whole lot different . 
  peacetime exercises and drills often tell more of the command structure and doctrine testing than it does of actual combat logistics . 
  i 'm lost here ; this does n't seem like any sort of real limitation . 
  yes , historically lack of road signs combined with bad directions from a populace could be a non-trivial issue ( in the american civil war , there often were n't even great maps of an area , and soldiers were sent in the wrong direction ... but even then , it 's not as if war could n't happen ) . 
  but we live in an era with satellite positioning systems and extensive maps available to everyone . 
  we are n't using horses to pull supplies , and there were sufficient logistics for invasions even then . 
   bear in mind i do not think that nato or the eu could keep combat operations going in russia either . 
  you do n't think that nato could supply its troops in a conventional war with russia ? 
  seriously ? 
   boris korczak   in august 1981 , an exposed cia double agent boris korczak was struck in his kidney by a similar ricin pellet fired from an air gun while he was shopping for food in virginia . 
  korczak also survived the attack and was convinced the kgb was responsible . 
  wow . 
  i 'd no idea that there was a plausible , albeit unproven , case of russia attempting to assassinate someone in the united states . 
  ( the uk , yes , france , yes , but that 's a new one on me . ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions summary ( note that this does * not * mean that all of these are immediately illegal , but simply that it is constitutional for a government to prohibit them ; the law is not invalid based on constitutional constraints ) : * ** incitement ** : `` advocacy of the use of force '' is unprotected when it is `` directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action '' and is `` likely to incite or produce such action '' . 
  you * can * say '' #killallwhitemales '' , because it 's not directed at incitement of a specific crime , and it 's not imminent . 
  you can not tell someone with a gun to someone 's head `` kill him '' . 
  * ** false statements of fact ** : the us is relatively-difficult to win slander/libel suits in . 
  celebrities , public figures , and the government are not normally protected under * any * case . 
  it requires an intent to cause harm , and a [ substantial collection of other criteria to be met ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_statements_of_fact ) . 
  * ** obscenity ** : material that has all three of the following three characteristics : ( 1 ) the average person finds drives sexual interest , ( 2 ) discusses sexual conduct or excretory functions , and ( 3 ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , political , artistic , or scientific value . 
  * ** child pornography ** : this [ must involve a depiction of actual children engaged in sexual activity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ashcroft_v._free_speech_coalition ) ; the restriction is limited to protecting childen involved in the creation of the material , not simply to portraying minors having sex ( e.g. 
  you could draw a comic with two thirteen-year-olds having sex , and the government could not constitutionally pass a law restricting this ) . 
  * [ ** fighting words ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fighting_words ) : this is speech that is likely to cause immediate violence by the listener in response against the speaker . 
  in practice , while this has n't been directly challenged or overturned in the supreme court , cases subsequent to 1942 claiming this as defense have not succeeded . 
  * ** death threats ** : barring hyperbole , it 's permissible for the government to outlaw calling someone up and telling them that you 're going to kill them . 
  * ** intellectual property ** : material covered by copyright , trademark , patents , and so forth may be restricted . 
  * ** commercial free speech ** : advertising may be subjected to false advertising laws ; the same sort of restrictions can not apply to non-commercial speech . 
  * ** government as employer ** : the government may fire an employee for speech within the scope of his job the same way that any other employer would ; it does not have special restrictions here because it is the government . 
  * ** regulator of airwaves ** : non-internet-based broadcast media may be regulated by content by the government . 
  traditionally , this derived from the fact that televisions/radios were in every house and there was no technical way for parents to control what was seen . 
  * ** government as educator ** : government-run schools are permitted a broader scope in limiting the speech of students when it `` materially and substantially interferes with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school '' . 
  * ** government-subsidized speech ** : the government is paying someone to say something , then it may constitutionally require that the subsidized speaker use the funds to actually say this as opposed to something else . 
  * ** government as regulator of the bar ** : state bar associations may constitutionally restrict the professional speech of lawyers that they license under professional ethics grounds . 
  * ** government as operator of military ** : the military , even though a government organization , can restrict speech among its members . 
  i do n't know the extent of this . 
  * ** government as prison warden ** : as long as the government also provides an alternate mechanism for this expression , it may restrict the ways in which prisoners speak , as long as that restriction is `` reasonably related to legitimate penological interests '' . 
  * ** government as regulator of immigration ** : the government may not criminally-punish non-citizens for speech that would be protected by a citizen , but * may * bar non-citizens from entry to the united states at the border based on their speech . 
  ( thus , when the democratic party was recently advocating to ban geert wilders from the united states , this would be constitutional , if ill-advised . ), 
  finally , note that there has been an overall and steady trend towards limiting the scope of exceptions ; often historical exceptions may not be eliminated , but may be narrowed when they later come up in a scotus case . 
  northern california is not a representative sample of the us . 
  trust me . 
  wikipedia says that this was [ a problem since way back ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irony_punctuation ) :  irony punctuation is any proposed form of notation used to denote irony or sarcasm in text . 
  written english lacks a standard way to mark irony , and several forms of punctuation have been proposed . 
  among the oldest and most frequently attested are the percontation point proposed by english printer henry denham in the 1580s , and the irony mark , used by marcellin jobard and french poet alcanter de brahm during the 19th century . 
  both marks take the form of a reversed question mark , '' '' .
