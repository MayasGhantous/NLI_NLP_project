    public relief   the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals . 
  [ not all countries are signatories -- for example , india is not -- but all of de , se , and dk are signatory members and bound by the convention ] ( https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetailsii.aspx?src=treaty&amp;mtdsg_no=v-2&amp;chapter=5&amp;temp=mtdsg2&amp;lang=en ) . 
  if they do n't provide this , they either violate the convention or must withdraw from the convention ( which they may do with a delay of one year after electing to do so ) . 
   neither europe nor america was ready for what is currently happening in europe . 
  this is why neither the european union nor the usa have adequate policies for this . 
  awright . 
   and if we continue along the line of hypothetical speaking and assume we are facing historically unprecedented refugee problem in europe , we should also ask ourselves : who has something against the european union ? 
  if we leave the arab world aside , then the only other side interested in a destabilization would be america . 
  politically speaking , only the usa can have an interest in a refugee crisis in europe . 
  of course , there are many more additional questions that could be raised here . 
  perhaps you and your listeners have asked yourselves who has been financing these refugees ? 
  it is very doubtful that they have been financing themselves , because , as i said , most of them are undereducated . 
  if the data about the amounts of money they pay traffickers is true , then it is highly improbable they are paying out of their own pockets . 
  what ? 
  i do n't actually think that the bulk of people would fit into either of the two described `` opinion '' buckets . 
  you can parallelize fence-building . 
  you can choose , say , 100 different points and start building fence at each and just close the gaps . 
  so as long as you have the vehicles to bring the fencing out and equipment and men to place the fencing , you can build it pretty much as quickly as you 'd like . 
   most of them are applicants who will be denied and sent back . 
  [ that 's not been true of recent decisions ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/09/daily-chart ) : ** germany has been accepting 41.6 % ** , and sweden 76.6 % of applicants . 
  note that these numbers are * vastly * higher [ than they were nine years earlier ] ( http://jugendserver.spinnenwerk.de/~asyl/english.htm ) :  in 2006 , 21,029 applications for asylum were filed in germany . 
  this is the lowest number since 1983 . 
  this is hardly due to a decrease of the number of refugees in the world but , in our view , is due to the fact that , in general , it has become more difficult to enter germany and to gain access to the german asylum proceedings . 
  also , the acceptance ratio is very low : ** in 2006 , only 0.8 % of the applicants were recognized as entitled to asylum ** , 3.6 % were granted protection from deportation , and deportation obstacles were determined with respect to 0.3 % of the applicants . 
  if you do n't eat pork , i 'd imagine that it 's probably hard to identify pork by flavor . 
  besides , tasting to determine whether or not something is acceptable probably is n't legitimate . 
  that being said , i doubt that this is widespread . 
   danish statistics shows that 85 % of asylum seekers commit a crime during the first year . 
  hmm . 
  that seems high . 
  does this include , say , illegal immigration ? 
  what is the corresponding percentage for the native-born ? 
  what is your source ? 
   27m are ** at risk of ** poverty or exclusion ... 
  note that this is not the same thing as being classified as being below the [ poverty line ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poverty_threshold ) ( not sure what `` exclusion '' is , if it 's even rigorously-defined anywhere ) . 
  i 've seen the `` at risk of '' phrase used a lot ; a similar term is `` food insecurity '' rather than people suffering from actual shortage of food . 
  given that both permit rather-larger numbers to show up than the stricter terms , i wonder whether there might be some political intent behind the use of them . 
  i 've no real objection to drawing a new line that includes more poor people if most people out there think that it 's a more-useful line to work with , but i do n't like having ill-defined terms that sound confusingly-similar to existing ones . 
  it might make more sense to create , say , eu definitions of `` p1 '' , `` p2 '' , `` p3 '' , and so forth referring to different levels of living standards . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danes  since the formulation of a danish national identity in the 19th century , the defining criteria for being danish has been speaking the danish language and identifying denmark as a homeland . 
  danish national identity was built on a basis of peasant culture and lutheran theology , theologian n. f. s. grundtvig and his popular movement played a prominent part in the process . 
  [ 22 ]   today , the main criterion for being considered a dane is having danish citizenship . 
  however , other criteria include people with a danish ancestral or ethnic identity ; people living outside of denmark such as emigrants ; and descendants of emigrants or members of the danish ethnic minority in southern schleswig , germany can be considered danes under a wider definition taking into consideration cultural self-identification . 
  wikipedia does n't seem to define welfare as being the centerpiece of danish culture . 
  thank you . 
  that seems like a pretty important point . 
  what type ? 
  in the us , processed cheese -- the big , homogenous , square block things -- is pretty dominant , unlike europe . 
  i prefer that for cooking , but for eating slices of cheese on crackers , i 've really been won over after experimenting with some traditional cheeses . 
  blues and sharp cheddars -- cheeses with strong flavors -- are pretty good . 
  i still do n't really `` get '' feta and other less-intense cheeses , since it just seems like calories without a lot of flavor . 
   * so how many people have been convicted of treason against the united states of america in all of it 's history ? 
  9   * how many people have been convicted of treason against the russian federation last year alone ? 
  15 many countries have laws that differ somewhat . 
  what constitutes `` treason '' may differ under russian law . 
  [ us definition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treason#federal ) :  to avoid the abuses of the english law ( including executions by henry viii of those who criticized his repeated marriages ) , treason was specifically defined in the united states constitution , the only crime so defined . 
  article iii section 3 delineates treason as follows :    treason against the united states , shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . 
  no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court . 
  [ russian definition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treason#russia ) :  article 275 of the criminal code of russia [ 22 ] defines treason as `` espionage , disclosure of state secrets , or any other assistance rendered to a foreign state , a foreign organization , or their representatives in hostile activities to the detriment of the external security of the russian federation , committed by a citizen of the russian federation . '', 
  you can have 1 without 2 . 
   refugees / migrants tend to stay . 
  not saying that you 're wrong , but do you have statistics to support this from past countries/immigrations ? 
  so far , this is an anecdote , not a statistic . 
  if tens of thousands start moving in the other direction , that will be interesting ... but it would be very strange if out of all those people , * nobody * was disappointed with the result . 
  ehhhh ... but if you know us law , i imagine that some businesses might support a full-time us law expert in finland . 
  say you were regularly doing up contracts for a finnish company with us companies that were governed by us law . 
  certainly kind of a niche . 
  and the media is going to isolate the `` wtf '' comments -- these probably are not representative of the refugee population as a whole . 
  well ... okay , now we 're dealing with the principles here . 
  my irritation is that the goal was to establish an infantry-comparable civilian populace , and today , the infantry has automatic rifles and the civilian populace is not generally permitted the same . 
  hell , i would n't even care about handgun bans all that much other than in the slippery slope nature of things and the violation of the letter of the law -- handguns are n't hugely-important from a military standpoint . 
  but the fact that standard-issue military rifles are generally-restricted is something that really bothers me . 
  again , this is speculation -- there 's not hard data available that would really support a much higher level of rape among the immigrants ; i 've seen statistics gathered only on a small number of somalians in finland re : statistical material supporting elevated frequency of rape . 
  he 's got a reasonable argument that states are infringing on the second amendment in some cases , though . 
  some of those have been overturned in supreme court challenges , and others have n't . 
  i 'm guessing that part of this is language , which i 'm sure is at least * something * of an input . 
  the us does n't have language barriers . 
  another point is that median wage does n't indicate coutnrywide wage -- it might be that either side of the border is pretty similar , and it 's just a wealth city in the country that does well . 
   my biggest concern is that the eu will be just like the usa - a massive machine that costs a tremendous amount to keep running while accomplishing very little more than a constant state of non-decision . 
  is the us in a constant state of non-decision ? 
   how i went from eu federalist to eu skeptic in 3 short weeks well , your account is only 4 short weeks old , so that 's a pretty quick shift ... 
  i admit that it might be easy for me to say , because it 's not my country at stake , but i think that people are getting way too upset about germany : * having a chancellor that made a statement that was ill-chosen and misunderstood . 
  * having a vice chancellor who made an aggressive statement . 
  there might be good reasons to split up the eu , but this is n't it . 
  you have n't even had your leaders sit down and talk it over yet . 
  it was painted . 
   a heavy american hand could work i am not so sure that the us wants to get deeply and publicly embroiled in internal-to-eu politics . 
  that seems like a good way to piss a lot of people in the eu off . 
   so , in short , germany is helping , but it 's helping in such a way that it helps itself first , and everyone else is more scared of a strong eu than it is of a strong germany , so they back those solutions . 
  so sign off on a commission that has authority to address the problem for a limited period of time and only for the scope of this and let it deal with it ? 
  the hungarian solution only worked because it was not a destination state . 
  if so , they 'd want demand for gold to be low before they buy a ton , though , not high . 
  the article says that russia loses out on a few tens of millions of dollars . 
  i do n't think that it 'd make any sense to start touching off nuclear weapons over that . 
   but would n't this result in less opportunities for the europeans themselves since the refugees are cheaper to employ ? 
  yes , for people who compete in the same labor market ( which i assume is going to be biased towards unskilled labor ) , but that would also happen to significant degree anyway if you just had people with refugee status in germany working in germany . 
   the other 85 % is a slow process which we call either ideological subversion or active measures . 
  or psychological warfare . 
  what it basically means is to change the perception of reality , of every american , to such an extent that despite their abundance of information , no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves , their families , their community , and their country . 
  it 's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow .
