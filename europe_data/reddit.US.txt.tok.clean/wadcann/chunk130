   mistral afaik is just a helicopter carrier . 
  [ according to wikipedia , that is correct ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mistral-class_amphibious_assault_ship ) :  at the design stage , the ntcd concept featured an aircraft lift on the port side ( like the tarawa-class ) , another on the starboard side , one in the centre of the flight deck , and one forward of the island superstructure . 
  these were later reduced in number and relocated : a main lift towards the aft of the ship was originally located to starboard but then moved to centre , and an auxiliary lift behind the island superstructure . 
  [ 11 ] concept drawings and descriptions created by direction des constructions navales ( dcn ) , one of the two shipbuilders involved in the project , showed several aircraft carrier-like features , including a ski-jump ramp for stobar aircraft ( allowing the operation of av-8b harrier ii and f-35 lightning ii-b aircraft ) , four or five helicopter landing spots ( including one strengthened to accommodate v-22 osprey or ch-53e super stallion helicopters ) , and a well deck capable of accommodating a sabre class landing craft , or 2 lcac hovercraft . 
  [ 12 ] a review by the french senate concluded that stobar aircraft were outside the scope of the cnoa , requiring the modification of the design . 
  [ 13 ] that does n't mean that usmc doctrine could n't change , but ...  they should sell them to japan . 
  japan would have one heck of an interesting collection of so-called `` destroyers '' building up ... 
  i do n't know about * that * , but i do n't think that you 'd be viewed as a very good `` welfare and diversity officer '' . 
  based on the -11 , / u/burningfox , you probably should have put a '' / s '' at the end of that post . 
  text does n't transmit sarcasm well . 
  * it 's not immediately clear that it would be a military win , other than the author pointing out that * america * - class ships are more expensive than * mistral * - class ships : is the us navy in need of them ? 
  the us already [ has ten more * america * - class ships on order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america-class_amphibious_assault_ship ) . 
  if the proposal is to cancel two of these and replace them with the much-smaller mistrals , unless the us navy did a poor job of selecting ships , it 's probably getting a less-desirable-to-it ship and aggravating whatever shipyard now gets its own broken contract . 
  * the author said that refitting to us standards would cost less than a new ship : `` while refitting the ships based on standards suitable for the u.s. navy may add as much as several hundred million dollars ... '' it 's not clear where he got these numbers from ( * i * do n't know what the us navy wants in an amphibious assault ship , after all ) . 
  * while obviously it 's a cost to france to eat the ships , it would also be a cost to the us , albeit proportionally-smaller . 
  * `` such a symbolic move would reassure nervous central and eastern european allies by providing a tangible example of nato solidarity and american commitment to europe . '', 
  while that 's a laudable goal , i do n't understand how , say , estonia , latvia , or lithuania are going to feel more-convinced that they will be defended if attacked by the us purchasing unwanted french helicopter carriers . 
  i can think of a lot of things that would probably be a lot more interesting ( like , as has been requested recently , permanently stationing a nato tripwire force there ) . 
  * the us * already * spends drastically-more than europe ( and france in particular ) does on its military , and has been meeting nato military financing expectations ; why is the us , other than its size , the country that should be expected to finance this ? 
  sure , the us requires force projection capabilities , but it 's also already arranged for those to be met . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i appreciate that it 's very politically-distasteful for france to cut the sale . 
  but it 's also russia attacking a * european * country that triggered all this : addressing war in europe is n't * just * the us 's responsibility . 
  embargos are going to burn both sides of the embargo ; that 's just the name of the game , and it 's one of the things that had to be accepted when adopting a non-military , economic approach .

  the next year , [ substantial growth was seen in gluten free categories of food ] ( http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/05n0279/05n-0279-ec87-attach-1.pdf ) . 
  this might have helped kick things off ; more [ articles in 2006 point out that subsequent to the labeling showing up , far more people started purchasing them ] ( http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2006/066/ ) . 
  by 2007 , it was [ being described as a massive fad ] ( http://scdlifestyle.com/2013/10/12-billion-gluten-free-health-fad/ ) . 
  [ by 2008 ] ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/painter/2008-08-17-gluten_n.htm ) :  marketers estimate that 15 % to 25 % of consumers want gluten-free foods -- though doctors estimate just 1 % have celiac disease , the best-defined and most severe form of gluten intolerance , says cynthia kupper , executive director of the non-profit gluten intolerance group of north america ( gluten.net ) . 
  it 's presently a huge fad diet , at least in the us , where all sorts of people who do n't have celiac disease think that they ca n't eat wheat . 
  the new-agey `` there 's toxins in the blood '' sort crowd and snake oil websites are having gobs of fun with it . 
  a [ current article ] ( http://time.com/2912311/eat-more-gluten-the-diet-fad-must-die/ ) :  but here 's one reason , at least for marketers : gluten-free is big money . 
  as the journal reports , u.s. sales of products carrying the gluten free label jumped from $ 11.5 billion to $ 23 billion in just the past four years . 
  it 's also a strong argument for not having gm labeling -- the authority granted by the label tends to be taken as a source of legit health information by people . 
  this is very probably a primary reason for the actions among the gmo-label marketing crowd -- they want the legitimacy granted by a label . 
  both are surprisingly difficult to invade , too . 
   ca n't believe a nation as successful at colonising and ruling as us spawned you lot . 
  hey , now . 
  germany and japan got reconstructed , and there 's the phillippines and south korea , which are n't unhappy with the us . 
  you 're kinda picking the biggest black mark on the record when it comes to nation-building . 
  not saying that the us * should * be in the business of nation-building , mind . 
  i was thrown by the fact that the student union was involved . 
  it might be that everything he said about being poor and homeless is true ; it 's just that he 's looking for alcohol or drugs rather than food . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circumcision#modern_times  circumcision did not become a common medical procedure in the anglophone world until the late 19th century . 
  [ 81 ] at that time , british and american doctors began recommending it primarily as a deterrent to masturbation . 
  [ 81 ] [ 82 ] it 's been [ on the decline , though , and today almost half of infants are n't cut ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/circumcision_2013/circumcision_2013.htm ) :  across the 32-year period from 1979 through 2010 , the national rate of newborn circumcision declined 10 % overall , from 64.5 % to 58.3 % ( table and figure 1 ) . 
  during this time , the overall percentage of newborns circumcised during their birth hospitalization was highest in 1981 at 64.9 % , and lowest in 2007 at 55.4 % . 
  surely that would n't be an expulsion-deserving action ?

   but i will say that silicon valley was n't centrally planned ... all european govts can do is invest in research and education and wait . 
  your point that silicon valley was n't planned is very valid * but * that does n't mean that planning can not help reproduce a similar environment . 
  and some of what 's being done here is to look for * problems * that might be present and inhibiting startups in europe , and that certainly can be changed . 
  actually , the video game industry is one of the few where i * can * think of a handful of competitive european dev houses . 
  the problem is that i think everyone has their own pet wishes and has a bad habit of simply * asserting * that * their * favored policy is the answer , and then saying `` this is what you must do to meet with success '' . 
  do n't get me wrong -- i do agree that broadly-speaking , less-regulation makes for an easier life for businesses . 
  but the wsj is a conservative ( in the us sense -- think of * the economist * on steroids , very economically-liberal ) publication ; it 's going to likely have authors who prefer fewer restrictions anyway . 
  and [ as i point out below ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36hwv6/europe_is_struggling_to_foster_a_startup_culture/#cre7hbw ) and as / u/schlagv [ points out below ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36hwv6/europe_is_struggling_to_foster_a_startup_culture/cre9clf ) , there are some reasons to think that other factors might dominate one of regulation . 
  when you say `` fragmented '' , are you referring to the legal difficulties -- i.e. 
  registering a business in france does not simply permit it to trivially expand to the rest of europe -- or to language difficulties , where cost of translation of the product is prohibitive ? 
   google : garage   microsoft : garage   amazon : garage obviously , it 's us car culture that 's the secret !, 
  i had the impression ( i 've worked for one substantial european company before ) that at least officially , policy for trans-european companies is to make use of english internally , though . 
  is that not the case ? 
  i 'd think that a company trying to attract people from across europe in norway would do work in english , yes ? 
  fair point , and well said , though i admit that it comes off as a bit aggressive to me to acquire the term `` europe '' for the eu . 
  that being said , i suppose that the same could most certainly be said about manifest destiny ... 
    sure , subsidize anything sufficiently , and it 'll be successful . 
      the us is n't providing that sort of subsidy   if you thing the us does n't subsidize anything , you are very naive . 
  the us does subsidize companies ( agricultural companies are a first-rate example , like [ sugar ] ( http://www.economics21.org/commentary/sugar-subsidies-are-bitter-deal-american-consumers ) ) , but in this context we 're talking about startups : why europe does n't have the same high-tech startup culture that parts of the us do . 
  i 'm talking about the us not providing the sort of subsidy that 's being described ( in fact , to the extent that it subsidizes * other * businesses , it makes life harder for the companies in question , since someone has to bear that burden ) . 
  space travel , solar energy companies , and a number of other fields do rely heavily on federal funds , but i do n't think that those are quite the companies that people are thinking of -- the really-successful money-winners , like google , facebook , paypal , etc. 
  sure , subsidize anything sufficiently , and it 'll be successful . 
  the us is n't providing that sort of subsidy , though , and i think that few people want another uncompetitive industry on permanent life support from the state ( which equates to weakening other industries to strengthen that one ) . 
  also , it 's worth noting that lots of other places in the united states have tried producing their own silicon valleys , without a lot of success . 
  that might argue for inertia more than national policies . 
  my understanding is that some filmmaking has been done in new york city rather than hollywood , but hollywood is still , well , hollywood . 
  austin , texas , as well as a few other cities have built somewhat similar tech environments . 
  these have met with some success , but they also are n't comparable in scale to silicon valley . 
  it might be better not to look at national policy and more at what factors tend to result in inertia and figure out how to address those . 
  for examples , are investors and vcs adverse to long-distance travel to monitor their investments ? 
  how best to address that ? 
  what if it 's the good technical universities in the area ? 
  ( certainly that 's a * factor * , though it 's not as if silicon valley is the only place with technical universities . ), 
  what about wanting to work in an area where unemployment due to a company going under or just wanting to leave just means walking down the street and finding another of hundreds of companies hiring ? 
  that reduces risk of moving to an area . 
  are there ways in which that might be mitigated ? 
  another interesting tidbit , though i 'm not sure how much of a factor it is , and it 's not a matter of inertia -- normally , in my experience , research and development companies have an employment contract that grants them copyright over * everything * someone produces , in work or out-of-work , during the term of their employment . 
  this technically includes even , for example , personal letters , or contributions to open-source projects . 
  this is intentionally over-broad , so that if someone invents something for a company , it is extremely legally-difficult for them to go somewhere else , taking that technology , and go make their * own * company ... but it also makes it hard to go establish a new startup with something that they invented themselves . 
  this is * not * the case in silicon valley -- california is almost unique among us states that it [ nullifies this clause in employment contracts ] ( http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2870-2872 ) , and guarantees that anyone who invents something not using an employer 's resources has ownership of that thing . 
  that might encourage people to split off large companies and form small ones , since they can develop a technology themselves , in their own time , while working at a company , and then go start a company based upon it . 
  additionally , [ non-compete clauses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-compete_clause ) in employment contracts are also very widespread in the us -- these state that you can not work for a competitor in a similar area for a period of time ( typically a year ) after leaving one company . 
  california is * also * somewhat unusual among us states in that it [ nullifies these clauses in employment contracts ] ( http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=16001-17000&amp;file=16600-16607 ) . 
  these are certainly regulatory constraints , but i believe that they probably make california more-appealing compared to other us states for technical workers who are interested in moving around and maybe starting their own startup . 
   it 's way harder to convince a very good estonian programmer to move to move in an apartment in barcelona and start coding than it is to convince a winsconsinite to move to san francisco . 
  i spent several years at a ( successful ) us software startup . 
  the majority of the employees we had were immigrants to the united states , not just people moving within the country . 
  there were people from india , romania , italy , china , russia , australia , colombia , and the uk . 
  only a small minority of people were born in the united states .
