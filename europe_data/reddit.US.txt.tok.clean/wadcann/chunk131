  this has been roughly-on-par with my other experiences in silicon valley . 
  that just returns to the question of why american startups are doing so , though ; it 's not really an answer . 
  scots just publicly decided that they wanted to be in that union freely and without compulsion . 
  i think that / u/limitlessltd is talking about the * modern-day * uk , not the historic country . 
   united states of america and europe one thing that defines the united states of america ( and ultimately , if the eu expands to all of the continent , the european union ) is the ocean boundary . 
  that acted to make trade enforcement and defense more-viable . 
  there are exceptions ( hawaii and some territories for the us , some overseas territories for a couple of european nations ) , but despite faster and cheaper transport the ocean still has n't become small enough to not be a useful dividing line . 
  some thoughts : * the us is already , in the form of nato , militarily-bound to the defense of europe , which was unprecedented in us history until world war ii ... * but * it has the right to , with a year 's warning , walk away . 
  * broadly-speaking , my understanding is that the us is more classically-liberal than europe , outside of maybe , say , the south of england . 
  both citizens of the united states and the european union would have to swallow differences somehow . 
  would the us be willing to adopt a european-style state-run health care system , or the european union see privatization of organizations like the nhs ? 
  those would be significant shifts against what the current desires of the inhabitants are . 
  how would europe react to adopting us-style hardline free speech positions and let people freely fly nazi flags again , or the us react to cutting into treasured freedom of speech . 
  that being said , it 's certainly true that the european union and the united states are more alike than different ... but i want to drive home that there would most-assuredly be compromises that both sides would have a difficult time swallowing . 
  * ttip and any similar agreements will tend to more-closely-bind the european union and the us economically . 
  * in the eu , you had a lot of nations that historically had a lot of economic , military , and political clout banding together to establish a more-even footing with the new giants of the world . 
  in the us , you had a country with a history of isolation that does n't need to worry about being attacked or economically-clobbered being very dubious about giving up authority over its policies to a world government ; it does n't have the same return in increased clout . 
  things like the icc and the icj are a * lot * less popular in the us than in europe . 
   cultural differences are just too big but what happens when lots more people in the eu flow into germany for work , as is currently-happening ? 
  is a cultural , ethnic german still well-aligned with the national boundaries of germany ? 
  what happens when romanians and poles intermarry with germans and bring their own traditions and ideas , and raise their children with that fusion ? 
  that 's a cultural blending ( though i admit , your qualifier of `` as least for as long as each of us is alive '' might cover that ) . 
  it 's probably one of the most-fundamental questions facing europe , right ? 
  i mean , there 's no clearly-defined end game to the european union , and clearly it has a great impact on what europe will * be * . 
  i do n't get bored reading the comments about it ... 
  hell , you already have english across most of the * world * , and the queen still shows up as head of state all over the commonwealth ( though i 'm a little suspicious that the next british monarch may not hold that position ) . 
  the only thing there you * have n't * got more-broadly adopted than europe already is the pound sterling . 
  my guess is that free movement has more to do with , over time , obliterating national identity than anything else , and that 's one element that i think people are generally pretty-enthusiastic about in the eu . 
  i 'm not sure specifically what you 're talking about or why it would be tied to wanting federalism or wanting to avoid it . 
  there will * always * be differences between any two countries ; saying `` look at them , they differ from us ! '', 
  is n't really too broad to use as an argument against federalization . 
  that does n't mean that there are n't very good arguments against federalization . 
  i 'm upset about the federal government doing a number of things in the us that i view as jurisdiction of the states , and you might want to avoid that . 
  if you have free flow of population between countries * and * a different set of laws , you can choose where to live , for example . 
  new laws that seem very risky have an opportunity to be established in one state , prove themselves , and then spread . 
  a great example in the us is the [ `` right turn on red '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_turn_on_red ) , where you can legally make a right turn against a red light as long as you first come to a full stop , though all other traffic has right-of-way . 
  a lot of people were really concerned that this would lead to collisions and were dead-set against it , but a few adventurous states tried it , and it worked out ; the result was ultimately all other states choosing to accept it . 
  that is n't an available option if you 've centralized all your laws . 
   probably because the individual states in the us do n't have as much sovereignty as you think also , the us supreme court , which is part of the central government , is one of the important elements in determining state and federal jurisdiction , and has generally-leaned towards federal ( and individual ) power . 
  the [ commerce clause of the us constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commerce_clause ) has most recently come up over marijuana legalization , but it has often been used to justify further centralization of powers . 
  the idea of having , for example , federal police , was definitely not something that the founding fathers were planning for . 
  another factor is that if you 're a social reformer who wants to change how society as a whole works , you may want to go through the * federal * government rather than having to sell every individual national government . 
  so , let 's say that , for example , you want to guarantee women 's rights or ensure that religion is more-respected , or you want to end the use of tobacco , or you want to ensure that people do n't drink below a particular age . 
  in many ways , it 's more-convenient to target the federal government ( particularly if the federal government just needs a majority vote , rather than a unanimous one ) than it is to go country by country . 
  my expectation is that the eu would * tend * to see further centralization of power over time . 
  i 'm not sure how many political unions have seen ongoing decentralization of power ... the british empire , but i 'm not sure how many more i could name . 
  i do n't understand the occasional use of `` europe '' for `` european union '' , though -- that seems overloaded and ambiguous with the continent . 
  before someone promptly points out the obvious , i 'm not enthusiastic about the use of `` america '' for the united states either . 
   this can happen in the usa sometimes ( one example being weed legalization ) , mainly because states are n't separate countries . 
  a lot of people would say that that * should * legitimately be a state power ( and that 's why the 18th and 21st amendments existed for alcohol ) and the supreme court did not conform to the us constitution in ruling that the federal government had the authority to regulate this . 
  but you 're certainly right -- that is a real and legitimate concern about federation . 
  i should note that at the time that the us was formed , most people would have self-identified not as a `` us citizen '' so much as a `` virginian '' or similar . 
  that is , federation was n't actually aligned with self-identification . 
  if that were indeed the case , would n't your desire primarily be to reduce the role of democracy , rather than to federate ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederation  a confederation ( also known as confederacy or league ) is a union of political units for common action in relation to other units . 
  [ 1 ] usually created by treaty but often later adopting a common constitution , confederations tend to be established for dealing with critical issues ( such as defense , foreign affairs , or a common currency ) , with the central government being required to provide support for all members . 
    the nature of the relationship among the states constituting a confederation varies considerably . 
  likewise , the relationship between the member states , the central government , and the distribution of powers among them is highly variable . 
  some looser confederations are similar to intergovernmental organizations and even may permit secession from the confederation . 
  other confederations with stricter rules may resemble federations . 
  a unitary state or federation may decentralize powers to regional or local entities in a confederal form . 
  [ snip ]  ** european union **   due to its unique nature , and the political sensitivities surrounding it , there is no common or legal classification for the european union ( eu ) . 
  however , it does bear some resemblance to both a confederation [ 10 ] ( or `` new '' type of confederation ) and a federation . 
  [ 11 ] the eu operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws , which enable a single economic market , open internal borders , a common currency and allow for numerous other areas where powers have been transferred and directly applicable laws are made . 
  however , unlike a federation , the eu does not have exclusive powers over foreign affairs , defence and taxation . 
  furthermore , laws sometimes must be transcribed into national law by national parliaments ; decisions by member states are taken by special majorities with blocking minorities accounted for ; and treaty amendment requires ratification by every member state before it can come into force . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation  a federation ( from latin : foedus , gen. : foederis , `` covenant '' ) , also known as a federal state , is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central ( federal ) government . 
  in a federation , the self-governing status of the component states , as well as the division of power between them and the central government , are typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party , the states or the federal political body . 
  [ 1 ] [ citation needed ]   the governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is known as federalism . 
  it can be considered the opposite of another system , the unitary state . 
  germany with sixteen bundesl\u00e4nder is an example of a federation , whereas neighboring austria and its bundesl\u00e4nder was a unitary state with administrative divisions that became federated , and neighboring france by contrast has always been unitary . 
    federations may be multi-ethnic and cover a large area of territory ( e.g. 
  united states or india ) , although neither is necessarily the case . 
  the initial agreements create a stability that encourages other common interests , reduces differences between the disparate territories , and gives them all even more common ground . 
  at some time this is recognized and a movement is organized to merge more closely . 
  at other times , especially when common cultural factors are at play such as ethnicity and language , some of the steps in this pattern are expedited and compressed . 
  [ snip ]  ** european union **   the european union ( eu ) is a type of political union or quasi federation . 
  robert schuman , the initiator of the european community system , wrote that a supranational community like the europe 's founding european coal and steel community lay midway between an association of states where they retained complete independence and a federation leading to a fusion of states in a super-state . 
  [ 12 ] the european founding fathers made a europe declaration at the time of the signing of the treaty of paris on 18 april 1951 saying that europe should be organized on a supranational foundation . 
  they envisaged a structure quite different from a federation called the european political community . 
  [ citation needed ]   the eu is a three pillar structure of the original supranational european economic community and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , euratom , plus two largely intergovernmental pillars dealing with external affairs and justice and home affairs . 
  the eu is therefore not a de jure federation , although some [ who ? ], 
  academic observers conclude that after 50 years of institutional evolution since the treaties of rome it is becoming one . 
  [ 13 ] the european union possesses attributes of a federal state . 
  however , its central government is far weaker than that of most federations and the individual members are sovereign states under international law , so it is usually characterized as an unprecedented form of supra-national union . 
  the eu has responsibility for important areas such as trade , monetary union , agriculture , fisheries . 
  nonetheless , eu member states retain the right to act independently in matters of foreign policy and defense , and also enjoy a near monopoly over other major policy areas such as criminal justice and taxation . 
  since the treaty of lisbon , member states ' right to leave the union is codified , and the union operates with more qualified majority voting ( rather than unanimity ) in many areas .

   many films that are now considered crucial works were box office failures , fight club , brazil , fail-safe , children of men , they all did n't profit . . | movie | budget | box office | | - | - | - | | [ * fight club * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fight_club ) | $ 63m | $ 100.9 m | | [ * brazil * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brazil_%281985_film%29 ) | $ 15m | $ 9.9 m ( north america ) | | [ * fail safe * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fail_safe_%281964_film%29 ) | ? | $ 1.8 m | | [ * children of men * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children_of_men ) | $ 76m | $ 69.9 m | note that i do n't know whether wikipedia 's `` box office '' numbers include dvd sales and other forms of licensing .
