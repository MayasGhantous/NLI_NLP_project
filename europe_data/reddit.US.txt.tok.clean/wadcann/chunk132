  * did n't care about the walkout after the game . 
  it 's a handful of professional entertainers playing for cameras . 
  it has nothing to do with government policy or the broader populace of the country , and i regret that it gets used as a proxy for same . 
  not that [ we 're innocent either ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miracle_on_ice ) , but seriously i do n't understand sports mentality -- it 's like there 's some part of the brain associated with war-making that just gets enabled for professional sports that does not exist in my head . 
   moscow ( reuters ) - the kremlin reiterated on monday that there were no regular russian troops fighting in east ukraine , a day after kiev said it had captured two russian servicemen there . 
  there 's no link to the original text , but i 'd imagine that it would depend upon the definition of `` fighting '' ( `` providing support '' ? ), 
  and `` regular '' ( special ops included ? ), 
  http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/261061/feature-tackling-rape-culture-in-nz  the 2011 un report on the status of women , meanwhile , found new zealand was the worst of all oecd countries when it came to sexual assault . 
  i do n't understand why that would produce multi-year growth , though . 
  a change in definition should produce a one-off spike . 
  it 's not as if various groups in europe did n't have sex during their period living together . 
  if you 're just tracing matrilineal or patrilineal line , you might get more of that . 
  maybe that 's what you 're thinking of ?

  mcdonalds meals are n't actually terribly cheap compared to , say , eating some pasta or something . 
  however , it 's fairly cheap relative to the calories as * prepared * food goes . 
  also , strictly-speaking , you 've normally got infinite refills of soda at most us fast food franchises ( including mcdonalds ) , so technically it 's an infinite number of calories that you * could * consume , though you 'd just be drinking sugar water . 
  would n't be terribly-friendly to , say , diabetes ( sugar water is probably about the highest [ glycemic index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glycemic_index ) food you can find ) . 
  mcdonalds would probably do better to offer something like a bar of food that breaks down more-slowly but has a ton of sugar or fat in it so that it 's a condensed meal , plus the equivalent of a vitamin pill dissolved in it .

  that looks like about ten people in the unveiling ceremony crowd . 
  i mean , i 'm sure that there are more than ten people in russia who would like to move back to a formally-imperial system and anoint putin , but that 's not much of an impressive showing .

  maybe it 's possible to do nuclear sufficiently-cheaply and it 's just regulatory costs that make it more-expensive ; i 'm not sure . 
  but there are still opponents to nuclear power , like greenpeace , and fukushima did n't help .

   or maybe it was world war two because that was the event which caused the decline of the british empire and created the circumstances of today . 
  my understanding is that the empire was in substantial decline before this point . 
  certainly it was an important factor , but : * [ canada , new zealand , and australia had been slowly splitting away via political means for a century before world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_empire#changing_status_of_the_white_colonies ) .

  * palestine was in trouble before world war ii . 
  * ireland was already pushing for independence before world war ii .

   i think this government is the worst thing to have happened to macedonia since independence . 
  for those of us less-familiar with macedonia 's leadership , what are the specific concerns ? 
  are you referring to world war ii 's [ battle of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_france ) ? 
  the brits retreated there too , but i do n't hear comparable comments about the uk . 
  nor was the factor willingness to retreat , but a major strategic error ( not expecting germany 's armies to be able to traverse a particular area ) and some important errors in setting tactical doctrine ( what worked in mobile tank warfare was n't yet well-understood ) . 
  i would kind of like to read an overview of the left/reform phenomenon in the humanities . 
  there was a point in time where you had a number of fields in the humanities that had adopted inaccurate positions based on conventional wisdom of caucasian , european dominance . 
  if i go to , oh , some time back , i can find people using skull size as a measure of intelligence , or consistently erring on the side of not treating ancient african or asian civilizations as as-significant as they were . 
  there was a backlash and attempt to address these at some point . 
  i assume that the timeframe was different in different fields ( and maybe it always existed , and it 's just that it intensified at certain points in time ) . 
  a number of these reform attempts became politicized . 
  a culture of discovering reasons to * always * reject anything that might be seen as endorsing patrimony , being euro-centric , focusing on the well-to-do in society , etc became the norm , rather than just identifying and eliminating bias for the sake of identifying and eliminating bias . 
  this is stuff like : * an effort to focus on `` common people '' rather than political elites an archeology . 
  the lives of political elites were typically better-documented -- if you 're recording something in a form to last hundreds of years , like carving stone , it 's probably not going to be cheap in terms of effort . 
  as a result , our histories -- which were biased towards coverage of what they had information about -- talked disproportionately about the interaction of kings and lords , not the masses of the time . 
  * positions that incorporated conventional wisdom of racial superiority became incorporated in some fields ( [ phrenology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phrenology ) is a good example ) ; these views were n't necessarily data-driven . 
  part of science is divorcing oneself of preconceptions that might be tainting one 's results ... 
  attacking these began as real efforts to reduce bias in science . 
  the problem is that you wound up with areas that departed from identifying and removing inaccuracy-inducing bias and became more political advocacy , have managed in some cases are rather worse than the original situation . 
  here 's a paper on [ `` feminist geography '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feminist_geography ) :  '' ` cartesian dualism underlines our thinking in a myriad of ways , not least in the divergence of the social sciences from the natural sciences , and in a geography which is based on the separation of people from their environments . 
  thus while geography is unusual in its spanning of the natural and social sciences and in focusing on the interrelations between people and their environments , it is still assumed that the two are distinct and one acts on the other . 
  geography , like all of the social sciences , has been built upon a particular conception of mind and body which sees them as separate , apart and acting on each other ( johnston , 1989 , cited in longhurst , 1997 , p. 492 ) '   thus , too , feminist work has sought to transform approaches to the study of landscape by relating it to the way that it is represented ( ` appreciated ' so to speak ) , in ways that are analogous to the heterosexual male gaze directed towards the female body ( nash 1996 ) . 
  both of these concerns ( and others ) - about the body as a contested site and for the cartesian distinction between mind and body - have been challenged in postmodern and poststructuralist feminist geographies . '', 
  now , aside from the fact that this is gibberish from a technical standpoint ( [ cartesian dualism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dualism_%28philosophy_of_mind%29#cartesian_dualism ) has damned little to do with the thought processes above ) , the problem is that you 've got a field of academia that * stemmed * from an attempt to eliminate bias introducing its own embarrassingly-bad bias , one which has now become a field driven by conformance to particular political views , rather than being driven by data . 
  another example -- i 've listened to a number of anthropology lectures now that attempt to attach political values to the work . 
  for example , in a hunter-gatherer society or even small settled communities , it 's difficult to amass a whole lot of wealth ; you have a low wealth disparity across society . 
  most of someone 's wealth is tied up in their ability to provide labor in the future . 
  that 's a legitimate point , and talking about the causes and the effects of that is legitimate science . 
  but incorporating political arguments against today 's society * is n't * , and the joining-at-the-hip of the two taints science again . 
  science does n't make moral judgments -- it only makes predictions : if x , then y. 
  if i drop a ball , it will fall at a particular rate ; if the human mind is subjected to certain inputs , it acts in a particular way . 
  the word `` bad '' should n't come up in a scientific work : setting values is not science . 
  before we get a real slap-fest against germany going , it 's worth noting that the us and germany took the same position -- apply economic pressure . 
  if you 're not happy with what germany has done , you probably are n't happy with what the us has done either . 
  also , germany is n't the whole eu , much less all of europe . 
   actually soviet union was some kind of master of engineering and industry . 
  in [ agricultural science , not so well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism ) . 
  way more space stations than anyone else , though . 
  come on , it 's not going to spontaneously fall apart . 
   the us redditors are having to much influence in this sub , clearly trying to undermine eu member states countries interests in china and elsewhere . 
  redditors are ? 
   many mobile operators are frustrated that digital media companies profit from their high-speed networks without having to invest in the infrastructure behind them . 
  they pay for them -- it 's just as a commodity data-trucking service . 
  's what happens when a telco connects to the broader internet . 
   and to do that , they 're willing to consider what 's basically a high-tech stickup . 
  < shrug  they block google 's ads . 
  google probably blocks service . 
  they decide whether they want to try to permit some alternative service that customers like less that will give them a cut or to not charge google , and every mobile carrier has an incentive to defect to be the one that does n't have non-working websites . 
  also , kind of dubious whether anti-trust enforcement would like this ; it 's a natural monopoly trying to leverage the monopoly position . 
  true , most of google is foreign , but then again , also pretty egregious . 
  offf the top of my head , croteam from croatia did * serious sam * , remedy entertainment from finland did * max payne * , and 4a games from ukraine did * metro : last light * . 
   before any of these projects proves successful , google is not much more than a gigantic advertising company . 
  that * is * where a lot of their revenue comes from , but they have done a lot of pretty substantial technical work . 
   that makes it harder for a company to become monopolistic megacorp . 
  all of those were startups in relatively recent history ( i guess apple is starting to get up there in years now ) , and only two really have monopolies in an area . 
  yyyy.mm.dd sorts correctly : - /, 
  those are n't very good odds . 
   i know of a girl who went through law school who simply kept stripping after qualifying because she earns more doing that than she does via law practice .
