   saying `` kill all white men '' is n't incitement to murder ? 
  in the united states , no ; this is protected free speech . 
  incitement requires the commission of the crime to be immediate , and for the crime to be specific , like encouraging someone holding a gun to someone 's head to pull the trigger . 
  it can not simply be general and abstract , or referring to actions at some indefinite point in the future . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brandenburg_v._ohio  clarence brandenburg , a ku klux klan ( kkk ) leader in rural ohio , contacted a reporter at a cincinnati television station and invited him to cover a kkk rally that would take place in hamilton county in the summer of 1964 . 
  [ 6 ] portions of the rally were filmed , showing several men in robes and hoods , some carrying firearms , first burning a cross and then making speeches . 
  one of the speeches made reference to the possibility of `` revengeance '' [ sic ] against `` niggers '' , `` jews '' , and those who supported them . 
  one of the speeches also claimed that `` our president , our congress , our supreme court , continues to suppress the white , caucasian race '' , and announced plans for a march on washington to take place on the fourth of july . 
  brandenburg was charged with advocating violence under ohio 's criminal syndicalism statute for his participation in the rally and for the speech he made . 
  in relevant part , the statute -- enacted in 1919 during the first red scare -- proscribed `` advocat [ ing ] ... the duty , necessity , or propriety of crime , sabotage , violence , or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform '' and `` voluntarily assembl [ ing ] with any society , group or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism '' . 
    convicted in the court of common pleas of hamilton county , brandenburg was fined $ 1,000 and sentenced to one to ten years in prison . 
  on appeal , the ohio first district court of appeal affirmed brandenburg 's conviction , rejecting his claim that the statute violated his first amendment and fourteenth amendment right to freedom of speech . 
  the supreme court of ohio dismissed his appeal without opinion . 
  [ snip ]  the u.s. supreme court reversed brandenburg 's conviction , holding that government can not constitutionally punish abstract advocacy of force or law violation . 
  the majority opinion was per curiam ( issued from the court as an institution rather than as authored and signed by an individual justice ) . 
  [ snip ]  the brandenburg test was the supreme court 's last major statement on what government may do about inflammatory speech that seeks to incite others to lawless action . 
  it resolved the debate between those who urged greater government control of speech for reasons of security and those who favored allowing as much speech as possible and relying on the marketplace of ideas to reach a favorable result , leaving the law in a state along the lines of that which justices louis brandeis , and , post-schenck , oliver wendell holmes advocated in several dissents and concurrences during the late 1910s and early 1920s . 
  the brandenburg test remains the standard used for evaluating attempts to punish inflammatory speech , and it has not been seriously challenged since it was laid down in 1969 . 
  very few cases have actually reached the court during the past decades that would test the outer limits of brandenburg , so the test remains largely unqualified . 
  it 's a fair request . 
  placing a [ tripwire ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/tripwire ) there is n't comparatively-expensive , and it gives a stronger guarantee of military response in the event of an invasion . 
  any invasion * immediately * means military conflict between the armies of nato and russia . 
  note that russia has strongly opposed the permanent stationing of nato troops in the baltics : http://rt.com/news/246321-russia-nato-troops-border/  `` nato buildup on the eastern flank , or in the so-called ` front-line countries , ' is an unprecedentedly dangerous step that violates all agreements , including the russia-nato founding act , which is still in force , '' the ministry 's spokesman , alexander lukashevich , said at a news conference . 
  [ the text in question ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_25468.htm ) :  nato reiterates that in the current and foreseeable security environment , the alliance will carry out its collective defence and other missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability , integration , and capability for reinforcement rather than by additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces . 
  accordingly , it will have to rely on adequate infrastructure commensurate with the above tasks . 
  in this context , reinforcement may take place , when necessary , in the event of defence against a threat of aggression and missions in support of peace consistent with the united nations charter and the osce governing principles , as well as for exercises consistent with the adapted cfe treaty , the provisions of the vienna document 1994 and mutually agreed transparency measures . 
  russia will exercise similar restraint in its conventional force deployments in europe . 
  nato has [ explicitly rejected russian claims that this means that permanent troops may not be deployed in eastern and central europe ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_109141.htm ) :  russian officials claim that us and german officials promised in 1990 that nato would not expand into eastern and central europe , build military infrastructure near russia 's borders or permanently deploy troops there . 
    no such pledge was made , and no evidence to back up russia 's claims has ever been produced . 
  should such a promise have been made by nato as such , it would have to have been as a formal , written decision by all nato allies . 
  furthermore , the consideration of enlarging nato came years after german reunification . 
  this issue was not yet on the agenda when russia claims these promises were made .

   in 1861 tsar alexander ii freed 50 million serfs . 
  if `` freed '' is the word that 's wanted . 
  the serfs had no place to go except the land they were already farming , and if they wanted any of that , they had to buy it with the nothing they made as serfs . 
  [ we kinda did that too , albeit four years later and with 4 million ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forty_acres_and_a_mule ), 
   it leaves military bases and props up governments supportive to american interests . 
  there have been an awful lot of bases that have been closed , though : picking the now-closed [ subic bay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._naval_base_subic_bay ) :  in december 1991 , the two governments were again in talks to extend the withdrawal of american forces for three years but this broke down as the united states refused to detail their withdrawal plans or to answer if nuclear weapons were kept on base . 
  finally on december 27 , president corazon aquino , who had previously fought to delay the u.s. pullout to cushion the country 's battered economy , issued a formal notice for the u.s. to leave by the end of 1992 . 
  [ 15 ] naval station subic bay was the u.s. 's largest overseas defense facility after clark air base was closed . 
    during 1992 , tons of material including drydocks and equipment , [ 16 ] were shipped to various naval stations . 
  ship-repair and maintenance yards as well as supply depots were relocated to other asian countries including japan and singapore . 
  finally , on november 24 , 1992 , the american flag was lowered in subic for the last time and the last 1,416 sailors and marines at subic bay naval base left by plane from naval air station cubi point and by the uss belleau wood . 
  this withdrawal marked the first time since the 16th century that no foreign military forces were present in the philippines . 
  [ 17 ]   beginning in june 2012 , the philippine government said that the united states military could use the old base , as long as prior approval was granted by the philippine government . 
  this follows expanded military ties between the two nations , and an american pivot towards asia . 
  [ 18 ] this follows a visiting forces agreement made in 1999 , that saw annual visits of united states forces to conduct large scale exercises ( known as balikatan ) between the two allies . 
  [ 19 ] the sydney morning herald reported on 20 november 2012 that subic bay will host us ships , marines and aircraft on a semi-permanent basis which according to analysts will give the us a strategically important force posture for its shift in emphasis to the pacific . 
  [ 20 ] compare to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956  after announcing a willingness to negotiate a withdrawal of soviet forces , the politburo changed its mind and moved to crush the revolution . 
  on 4 november , a large soviet force invaded budapest and other regions of the country . 
  the hungarian resistance continued until 10 november . 
  over 2,500 hungarians and 700 soviet troops were killed in the conflict , and 200,000 hungarians fled as refugees . 
  mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter . 
  by january 1957 , the new soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition . 
  these soviet actions , while strengthening control over eastern europe , alienated many western marxists , leading to splits and/or considerable losses of membership for communist parties in the west . 
  it 's true that that 's not the case for all ; [ guantanamo bay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guantanamo_bay_naval_base ) , captured in the spanish-american war , was never returned , despite cuba wanting to boot the us out of the base . 
  but i think that you 're going to have a pretty tough time equating the interaction of the two with the world ; i 'm pretty comfortable saying that the world would be a very different place if the ussr and the us 's current roles were reversed . 
   so yes , your argument is invalid and just as silly as saying `` putin is trying to stop nazies in kiev and blah . . blah ... '' . 
  i do n't really think there 's any way in which you can realistically claim that a us occupation of russia is remotely on the same level of plausibility as a russian occupation of latvia . 
   then we are fine ... seems like we are all fine then . 
  [ ah , yes ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t2ubeinxao&amp;t=39s ), 
   that way you can manipulate them like you do with poland and romania to get their resources cheaply . 
  how so ? 
  well , russia kept trying to force people to do so via forcible soviet-era population transfers to ensure that china did n't extend any claims . 
  my understanding is that today , it 's depopulating . 
  well , nato did [ bomb serbia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ) fifteen years ago , and a ground invasion [ would have been a possibility at that time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_war ) :  by the start of april , the conflict appeared little closer to a resolution and nato countries began to seriously consider conducting ground operations in kosovo . 
  british prime minister tony blair was a strong advocate of ground forces and pressured the united states to agree ; his strong stance caused some alarm in washington as american forces would be making the largest contribution to any offensive . 
  [ 138 ] u.s. president bill clinton was extremely reluctant to commit american forces for a ground offensive . 
  instead , clinton authorised a cia operation to look into methods to destabilise the yugoslav government without training kla troops . 
  [ 139 ] at the same time , finnish and russian diplomatic negotiators continued to try to persuade milo\u0161evi\u0107 to back down . 
  tony blair would order 50,000 british soldiers to be made ready for a ground offensive : most of the available british army . 
  [ 138 ]   milo\u0161evi\u0107 finally recognised that russia would not intervene to defend yugoslavia despite moscow 's strong anti-nato rhetoric . 
  he thus accepted the conditions offered by a finnish -- russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within kosovo headed by the un , but incorporating nato troops . 
  that is a wee bit different from occupying russia , though . 
  that really * does * get cited too much , though . 
  someone * was * going to produce a common large-scale network protocol ; if it had n't been funded by darpa , it 's not like the internet would n't be around today . 
  it 's also not that much of an accomplishment compared to the great deal of work that came later on internet-related research and development . 
   th constant spamming of military propaganda is getting way too much as well you know , / u/didijustobama , coming from a guy who constantly posts pro-russian stuff on ukranianconflict , and has submissions like [ russia says has photos of ukraine deploying buk missiles in east , radar proof of warplanes in mh17 vicinity ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2bb0nj/russia_says_has_photos_of_ukraine_deploying_buk/ ) and [ hundreds of ukraine troops cross into russia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2clnlq/hundreds_of_ukraine_troops_cross_into_russia/ ) , that 's a bit rich ... 
  we would never buy such an excellent piece of hardware . 
  < shrug  i do n't know much about how they compare . 
  looking at their wikipedia articles , the two helicopters look fairly similar ( though the two pages give statistics for different loadouts , like with/without radar mast and with/without external fuel pods ) . 
  comparable price and armament ; the apache can fly higher , the tiger further . 
  also , my understanding is that typically there 's similar spatting over which us state various components of military hardware get constructed in during the contracting process , and thus the labor tends to get spread out , which is probably much of the same sort of thing . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_equipment_of_the_german_army ) , the * bundeswehr * uses the [ eurocopter tiger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurocopter_tiger ) rather than the [ ah-64 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_ah-64_apache ) as their attack helicopter , so i doubt that it 's part of the german military . 
  edit : i [ just pulled up an image of a us army ah-64 at ramstein ] ( http://www.planespotters.net/aviation_photos/photo.show?id=349008 ) , though ... and no cross on it . 
  that * is * kind of weird . 
  maybe wikipedia 's incomplete , and it is german ? 
  i have a really hard time believing that there 'd be a german national symbol on the craft and no us flag if it 's a us helicopter .
