  the us is ( as of recently , thanks to hydrofracking ; had n't been for a long time ) a net exporter . 
  < checks [ a timeline ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_lgbt_history#19th_century )  not us . 
  looks like it was the french and then the dutch . 
  you mean being a `` threat '' or `` invading and occupying '' the us ? 
  maybe the market is ripe for * [ red dawn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoeeuxhrt0 ) ii * ... ;-), 
  you thought * iraq * was a black hole for tax dollars ... russia , now ... 
  i do n't , all that much . 
  i had thought that the concern over which `` group '' a country was in and its associated status was a uniquely-european concern ( `` i 'm not eastern , i 'm central !, 
  '' , `` i 'm not central , i 'm northern !, 
  '' , etc ) . 
  i would n't have given it much thought , but i probably would have just used `` east '' and `` west '' , no northern or southern -- the first place i saw use of that split was in the british * the economist * . 
  the east/west split would follow cold war lines , but it would n't really have the sort of political meaning that i think that it does for many people in europe . 
  if i had to think of any other groups of countries collectively below the sub-european level , it 'd probably have these : * scandinavia , which includes finland . 
  * the baltic states . 
  * the balkans . 
  everyone else just gets their own country name ; if there are commonly-used `` group '' names , i do n't know them . 
  a few other group notes , outside of europe : * in the us , `` asia '' in casual conversation typically implies east asia -- japan , china , korea . 
  it does n't mean india or pakistan , the way it implies that in the uk . 
  * `` africa '' tends to imply sub-saharan africa ; i guess that this is kinda the same way people use `` america '' to refer to the us . 
  * outside of the - stans , i 'm not sure that i 'd normally use any other country groupings . 
  `` pacific islands '' , maybe . 
  a big chunk of the english non-phonetic nature is because of the [ french conquest of the brits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_vowel_shift ) . 
  i think a cool `` gift to our children '' project would be to update english spellings to make them phonetic again . 
  that 's require a * lot * of people and countries onboard and would cost a lot in updating material around the world , but making it easier for people to learn the language would be something that many generations would benefit from . 
  [ webster tried , and got some through ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/spelling-reform.htm ) into us english , but obviously it 's only a tiny chunk of the shift to making english phonetic again . 
   instead of wondering wtf is going on until it was halfway over . 
  well , to be fair , it 's a lot easier to look at a process in hindsight . 
  estonia has the benefit of being able to see what russia did in ukraine . 
  ukraine did n't have that . 
   eu is trying to establish geographic trademarks outside of the eu i do n't understand why the eu is spending their time with a special category for this . 
  government-operated organizations can establish trademarks anywhere , as far as i know , so why not just have the government of the region in question register the trademark and be done with it ? 
  unless it 's just fighting about ownership of existing terms ( `` has champagne been genericized or not ? '' ), 
  never is a long time . 
  we * could * do a `` post something you like about the greeks '' submission ... 
  ancient egypt was a pretty big deal . 
  another two millennia , i 'm not sure how many of our works will be visible , but those pyramids are probably still going to be around . 
  supposedly the [ hoover dam ] ( http://zidbits.com/2013/05/how-long-will-the-hoover-dam-last/ ) should still be around in ten thousand years , and so i assume that the [ three gorges dam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_gorges_dam ) would be too , but ... 
  http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/europe/belgium/price-history  there are many different opinions , but research generally suggests that belgian house prices are overvalued . 
  one view is that of the belgian federal institute of national accounts , which suggests that belgian house prices are overvalued by only about 9 % . 
  however research by the organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) has suggested that belgium 's housing market is overvalued by as much as 50 % , because income has not risen as quickly as house prices . 
  deutsche bank agrees that belgian homes remain 53 % overvalued , with house prices still 51 % higher than the historical average , relative to income . 
  and the international monetary fund ( imf ) also warned in 2014 that house prices in belgium remain well above historical averages in relation to incomes and rents . 
  the article says that more housing is being constructed , though , so that should drive down prices . 
  if `` fair '' is n't compatible with placing someone from mongolia and someone from your country on a more-level footing re : job opportunities , how would you define `` fair '' ? 
  i looked up [ vladamir antyufeyev ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_antyufeyev ) :  antyufeyev was born in novosibirsk , russian sfsr , soviet union . 
  [ 1 ] in 1974 , he graduated from a police academy in minsk , byelorussian ssr . 
  [ 1 ]   he is a former soviet omon special police major [ 2 ] and riga police deputy chief of criminal investigation . 
  he served as riga omon commander in 1990-1991 . 
  [ 3 ] in august 1990 , antyufeyev was one of the organizers of a meeting of the latvian mvd where some 80 % of the latvian police force made a decision not to recognize the popular front of latvia government and follow the constitution of the soviet union instead . 
  these police forces would later be involved in the kgb-led [ citation needed ] failed pro-unity coup attempt in january 1991 . 
  for these actions the latvian government accused antyufeyev of `` crimes against the state '' in august 1991 . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] he says he fled to moscow two hours before he was to be arrested . 
  [ 6 ] ... in 2003 antyufeyev defended a doctoral thesis on `` russia 's geostrategy in the southwest '' at the russian presidential academy of national economy and public administration . 
  [ 8 ] okay , so basically , his goal is to obtain land for russia ; great . 
  but what is * this * odd tidbit ? 
   in a mid-august 2014 interview with novaya gazeta antyufeyev claimed `` nobody 's to blame that our banks , shops , the airport [ in donetsk ] are closed -- except for the ukrainian fascists and the [ masons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freemasonry ) of the u.s. and europe '' . 
  okay , i 've heard jewish conspiracies be referenced , fascist conspiracies , but ... * seriously * , the freemasons ? 
  that makes / r/conspiracy sound [ exceedingly sane ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lvfhc/do_freemasons_have_a_hidden_agenda/ ) . 
  i think that it 'd be a * bit * hard to call canada the aggressor there ; the british empire was doing some unpleasant things , but the us started the actual hostilities . 
  wikipedia 's summary : there was a pretty clear attempt to at best hold canada hostage and [ at worst annex it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_1812 ) :  there is dispute , however , over whether or not the american desire to annex canada brought on the war . 
  several historians believe that the capture of canada was intended only as a means to secure a bargaining chip , which would then be used to force britain to back down on the maritime issues . 
  it would also cut off food supplies for britain 's west indian colonies , and temporarily prevent the british from continuing to arm the indians . 
  [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] however , a significant minority of historians believes that a desire to annex canada was a cause of the war . 
  this view was more prevalent before 1940 , but continues to be held by a number of historians . 
  [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ snip ]  american leaders assumed that canada could be easily overrun . 
  former president jefferson optimistically referred to the conquest of canada as `` a matter of marching '' . 
  it turns out that that assessment was n't all that accurate , and both american militia was n't very enthusiastic about invading canada and canadians were n't very enthusiastic about being invaded , which led to some awkward american defeats : * [ battle of lacolle mills ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lacolle_mills_%281812%29 ) : strength : british : 530 canadian militia and mohawk warriors , american : 6,000 result british/mohawk victory * [ battle of lacolle mills ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lacolle_mills_%281814%29 ) ( second attempt , two years later ) strength : british 80 ( with 420 reinforcements ) , american : 4,000 result : british victory * [ surrender of detroit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_detroit ) ( when canada decides to counter-invade ) : strength : british : 600 native americans , 330 regulars , 400 militia , 8 guns , 2 mortars , 2 warships ; american : 582 regulars , 1600 militia , 30 guns . 
  result : british victory casualties and losses : british : 2 wounded ; american : 7 killed , 2,493 captured . 
   the us has far more room for error when engaging with russia than germany does . 
  on the other hand , what i 've seen from poles and the baltics seems to be pretty in-favor of a hard-line approach , which would seem to conflict with that explanation . 
  be interesting to see a poll that included these places ... 
   anyone else noticed that crimea is now marked as russian , even on wikipedia ? 
  [ on its wikipedia page , i see ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea ) :  claimed by :   ** russia **   * ( de facto administration ) *   federal district crimean federal district   federal subjects republic of crimea   sevastopol [ 1 ]   ** ukraine **   * ( internationally recognised ) *   regions autonomous republic of crimea   sevastopol   kherson oblast ( northern part of arabat spit , henichesk raion ) what source on wikipedia are you referring to ? 
  that page at least treats russia 's occupation as illegitimate . 
  does n't show up the other way , though . 
  the * only * place i hear about ttip is here . 
  if i search google news for `` ttip '' , it 's all european media ( and [ good ol' ruskie propaganda outlets sputnik ] ( http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150511/1021989239.html ) , [ globalresearch.ca ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-ttp-and-ttip-trade-agreements-a-dystopian-future-in-which-corporations-rather-than-elected-governments-call-the-shots/5447643 ) , and [ rt ] ( http://rt.com/shows/documentary/252665-eu-usa-trade-agreement/ ) ) . 
  kill all subsidies , bite the bullet , and just rapidly urbanize ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  are you saying that they 're lying ? 
  huh , ditto for germany relative to america . 
  well , the holocaust and world war ii were combined in the poll . 
  world war ii certainly * caused * a lot of the current situation that germany has and set up a lot of the relationship today , but then again ... it was also a negative event , and obviously views of germany in the us are n't particularly negative . 
  having seen german , polish , and us polls on the german military , i 'm amused to note that germany 's old world war ii enemies trust germany drastically more with military power than germany does herself . 
  i 'm also interested to see the more-positive position on russia that east germany has than west germany . 
  other countries that were occupied by russia , like poland , seem to me ( admittedly , my impressions may be misleading ; they 're not a poll ) to be pretty unhappy about russia . 
  maybe it 's that east germans are less-concerned about being invaded than poland or the baltics . 
  i 'm just saying that i suspect that haiti did have access to $ 80m and could have repaid it , not that i think that it would be good policy for haiti to do so ; was responding to the `` they simply do n't have the money '' bit . 
  < looks at the wikipedia article for each  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haiti * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominican_republic the us has been much-more-involved in the dominican republic ( and ditto for spanish colonialism ) . 
  i guess that the earthquake aid was an exception , but i assume that you 're not saying that haiti 's condition is due to earthquake aid . 
  / u/yalodeciamiabuela was using the dominican republic as an example of governance done right on the dominican republic half of the island , in comparison to governance done wrong on the haitian side . 
  unless you 're saying that the dominican republic 's success was due to us and colonial involvement , but given the negative connotation of your sentences ( e.g. 
  `` puppet '' ) , i 'm assuming that you 're considering it harmful . 
  given / u/yalodeciamiabuela 's use of the term `` savages '' , which i 've typically seen on reddit as a euphemism from people criticizing sub-saharan africans , i expect that he 's referring to the fact that the haitian half is african-dominant , and the dominican republic european-dominant . 
  well , [ technically the us has committed $ 3.6 b in relief ] ( http://www.usaid.gov/haiti/earthquake/funding ) ; i 'd assume that [ at least $ 80m ] ( http://www.cgdev.org/publication/haiti-where-has-all-money-gone ) showed up one way or another in cash form in haitian hands . 
  granted , they probably had more-pressing needs , but ... 
   winston churchill trying to restore our countries monarchy , funding and pushing our country into a civil war after ww2 , so instead of recovering we had a civil war had churchill not been poking around , there probably would have been a violent communist takeover . 
  might not have been as bad as the civil war , but then again ... maybe it would have . 
   greece has a pretty strong military . 
  looking at their relative military vehicles , greece actually has more leopard 2 main battle tanks than does germany ... and that 's germany 's only tank model , unlike greece .
