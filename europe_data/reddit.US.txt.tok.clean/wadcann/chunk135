'', 
   way out in front , on 65 % was the power to control immigration between eu countries , an issue championed by ukip and identified by mr farage as his party 's top priority .

  gorbachev was n't going to [ tear down the berlin wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tear_down_this_wall ! ), 
  because of reagan off politicking and publicly-exhorting him to do so , but reagan was still off doing exactly that . 
  i expect that it 's for the same reasons -- domestic consumption . 
   the karen came closer to capsizing because when mr. murphy 's crew tried to release wires connecting the ensnared nets to the trawler , one cable jammed . 
  if both cases were actually submarine-net collisions , i wonder if it would be worth introducing some sort of more-reliable breakaway standard , or to provide a way to signal that nets are in an area ( like having a sound-emitting buoy trailing the net ) .

  well , you * were * running a pretty substantial chunk of the world by skillfully-playing one group against another not-all-that-long-ago . 
   for example italian courts move at a glacial pace for various reasons and their governments have a shorter expiration date than american bread . 
  < headscratch  i do n't think that the us has all that much by way of widely-known artisan bread types ( [ san francisco sourdough ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sourdough#type_i_sourdough ) , [ boston brown bread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_bread#boston_brown_bread ) , [ cornbread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornbread ) , and wikipedia says [ anadama bread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anadama_bread ) and [ banana bread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_bread ) ) , so i assume that you 're referring to [ wonderbread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wonder_bread ) - type stuff -- white , heavily-processed , mass-produced , not very dense , very inexpensive . 
  those actually tend to last quite a while without molding , because they contain preservatives . 
  ... i do n't think that anyone ever claimed that gdp was a moral endorsement of activity ... 
   the us system is set up to accept - to use the european term - `` economic migrants '' .

  h1-bs are the `` skilled worker '' path to get in and start the road to citizenship , but only ~ 100k are issued per year . 
  should arguably increase that number . 
   in america , you can quit but you will receive an `` other than honorable '' discharge which will kill your chances of getting a good job , when you get out . 
  is that true ? 
  i 've not heard of that , and that [ seems dubious ] ( http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/generalinfo/a/getout.htm ) :  you ca n't simply quit because you do n't like it . 
  you signed a contract , and you took an oath , and you are legally ( and morally ) obligated to complete the terms of the contract , even if you do n't like it . 
  wikipedia says that people * may * be [ given a dishonorable discharge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desertion#penalties ) , but that 's not the same thing as definitely having the ability to do so :  in the united states , before the civil war , deserters from the army were flogged ; after 1861 , tattoos or branding were also used . 
  the maximum u.s. penalty for desertion in wartime remains death , although this punishment was last applied to eddie slovik in 1945 . 
  no u.s. serviceman has received more than 24 months imprisonment for desertion or missing movement in the post-september 11 , 2001 era . 
  [ 36 ]   a us service member who is awol/ua may be punished with non-judicial punishment ( njp ) or by court martial under article 86 of the ucmj for repeat or more severe offenses . 
  [ 1 ] [ 37 ] many awol/ua service members are also given a discharge in lieu of court-martial . 
  [ 36 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ]   the 2012 edition of the united states manual for courts-martial states that :    any person found guilty of desertion or attempt to desert shall be punished , if the offense is committed in time of war , by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct , but if the desertion or attempt to desert occurs at any other time , by such punishment , other than death , as a court-martial may direct . 
   for example because of religion , allergies or personal dislike the allergy thing is actually an interesting example . 
  how do cullinary schools normally deal with that ? 
  well ... maybe . 
  my point is just that i 've seen a lot of vague references to industrial espionage , but no definite examples of it happening ( and i 'd expect that journalists would cover the most-concerning material ) . 
  it might be that people * do n't * want that spying happening , period . 
  it could be that the bnd is n't getting a sufficient return , or that regardless of the intentions , the process is abusable . 
  i 'm not trying to say `` everything is fine and dandy , and nobody should complain about something that they object to '' -- it 's just that every time i see a business or `` industrial espionage '' mentioned , i 've gone to read up on it , and it has n't panned out . 
  in some ways , reading the leaked material through the eyes of someone who has every * interest * in being critical is a good thing for the agency in question . 
  for example , when manning leaked the department of state memos , i was actually ... kind of more-suspicious of what the department of state was up to beforehand than afterwards . 
  oh , there were plenty of impolite and blunt comments about people -- ambassadors and national leaders who probably had red-faced apologies show up later -- but there was surprisingly-little exciting going on by way of cloak-and-dagger . 
  the snowden nsa leaks , on the other hand , have shown some things that should probably change . 
  they confirm some guesses security nuts like myself have had about what might potentially be monitored . 
  but by-and-large ... i think that the worst of the material has been extracted and aired , and [ of this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_surveillance_disclosures_%282013%e2%80%93present%29 ) material , while there are reasons to disagree with surveillance in general ( and particularly those of a foreign government to the extent that interests might differ ) , the efforts do appear to have been pretty much in line with the mandate that they have . 
  my concerns with nsa monitoring ( and obviously , given that this is from the standpoint of an american , concerns might differ ) are more along the lines of this : as technology advances , the nsa expects to make use of any new technological capabilities without explicit laws being made to restrict their use . 
  given that their activities are secret , it 's rather hard to pass any such laws . 
  and a secret agency that can do * mass monitoring * of a populace , rather than specific , targeted , limited-in-numbers monitoring , with no mechanisms in place to avoid abuse , seems to me to be in a position where it could too-easily slip into a stasi-like role , where the goal is controlling political opposition and the population as a whole . 
  the nsa has no reason to voluntarily restrict its own activities -- its goal is to fulfill its intelligence requirements , and so it would prefer to have every access that it can get . 
  however , by permitting that to happen * and * exempting the nsa from the regular , public oversight in the press ( barring exceptional cases like snowden 's leaks ) that most government operations are subject to , it means that monitoring may easily expand well beyond what the populace that the agency is supposedly serving may consider acceptable . 
  as far as i know ( i have n't been following it terribly-closely ) , * der spiegel * [ broke the story ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bnd-intelligence-scandal-puts-merkel-in-tight-place-a-1031944.html ) , and the writer simply guessed that it might be industrial espionage , based on the terms used :  in other documents from the snowden archive , the aerospace concern eads , which is now called the airbus group , is even connected to a specific name together with a saudi arabian telephone number . 
  [ snip ]  the fact that the us had also been using its cooperation with the bnd to conduct electronic eavesdropping against european defense company eads and its subsidiary eurocopter had been known by the government internally since 2005 . 
  in january 2006 , the satellite station in bad aibling cabled information about it for the first time to bnd headquarters . 
  in the message , the employee used the terms `` eads '' and `` eurocopter , '' in addition to attaching an excel spreadsheet with countless terms . 
  is it really plausible that the bnd president at the time was never informed of the suspicion the message documented -- namely that the nsa was spying on companies and perhaps conducting industrial espionage ? 
  or did it just wind up in a drawer somewhere in the bnd 's signals intelligence directorate ? 
  now , certainly it * could * be that the goal was to take industrial secrets and hand them off to competing military contractor companies , and that would certainly be a matter for concern . 
  however , it also does seem worth noting that in both the case listed by op and in the eads one , the question was one of military-critical information traveling from western military contractors to the east . 
  that 's also what you 'd want to look at if you were trying to identify spies trying to pick up military technology . 
  believe me , i can more than understand people being sensitive about it -- maybe they do n't want the nsa touching telecoms at * all * . 
  i 'd rather have my own communications unreadable , and i can certainly understand others wanting the same . 
  but it 's not clear to me that that was * industrial espionage * , which would be a pretty big jump from anything that i 've seen hard evidence of . 
  if industrial espionage were happening ( i.e. 
  someone in the nsa had been paid off to slip information to a competitor , or if the state had some sort of deal where they were * outright * handing off , oh , bids or other critical business information to particular companies ) , i would n't think that it would be limited to military contractors , and if the terms were available , i 'd kind of expect something more-useful , like `` bids '' or something else -- information that can be directly used for commercial advantage . 
  give it fifty more years . 
  you know , i do n't think that analogies are the best way to go about deciding whether such a policy is a good idea or not -- states do a lot of things that individuals do n't , and visa versa ... and there is no real analogy to immigration into a democracy . 
  i think that the interesting questions should probably look something like this : * what level of immigration does europe want ? 
  if less than sufficient to maintain the present population , is europe prepared to adopt alternate policies to maintain population or to prepare for the consequences of a shrinking population ? 
  * is there a preferable source of immigration than africa ? 
  for example , would europe prefer more indian immigration ? 
  * could the bar on immigration set to make it more-desirable ? 
  for example , would it be preferable to have a skills-based bar for letting people in , keeping in mind that they will probably also want to bring their family in ? 
  say , a large work-visa-to-citizenship program ? 
  * could the immigration * process * be made more appealing ? 
  for example , if someone already in europe wants high wages because of a less-competitive labor market that a large chunk of the immigrants are entering , that 's hard to address . 
  however , if the concern is , oh , i do n't know , spread of hiv or of lack of language knowledge , would providing disease screening or subsidizing language education be acceptable to address concerns about immigration ? 
  * finally , what measures are acceptable to enforce these rules ? 
  are you willing to kill or to imprison people who violate them ? 
  every time i hear facebook come up in the news , it just makes me happier that i avoid it like the plague . 
  how is that relevant to whether they can be taxed on it ? 
  was n't industrial espionage , though : according to the article , this looks like plain old international security :  in the latest report on a widening spying scandal , the newspaper said the u.s. national security agency ( nsa ) suspected that siemens was supplying communications technology to a russian secret service , said the newspaper , citing unnamed u.s. intelligence sources . 
  i 've still yet to see a concrete example of industrial espionage , though a number of articles now have used the term , including this one . 
   if america simplifies it , even america wo n't change .

  i suppose that it 's possible that it 's not * necessary * to fire faster ( though given the fact that i see lots of pictures of multiple artillery pieces near each other , that seems dubious ) , or that heat dissipation is a fundamental problem ( but i do n't hear about liquid cooling or similar systems ) or that the bound is ammunition hauling ( but then i 'd expect more ammunition-haulers ) .
