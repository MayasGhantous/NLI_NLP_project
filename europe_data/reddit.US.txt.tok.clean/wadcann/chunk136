  * using their standard * and putting it in more-concrete standard-of-living terms : [ real median household income in the united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/household_income_in_the_united_states#/media/file:us_real_household_median_income_thru_2012.png ) is around $ 51k/year as of 2012 . 
  half of that is $ 25,500 / year . 
  according to [ this calculator ] ( http://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2014/09/what-is-your-income-percentile-ranking.html ) , that is 25 % of all us households in poverty . 
  here 's a [ percentage graph of all us households which have various household amenities ] ( http://www.heritage.org/~/media/images/reports/2011/07/b2575/b2575_chart1600px.ashx?w=600&amp;h=586&amp;as=1 ) . 
  according to that definition , the household in poverty fits within the range that has : * a refrigerator * multiple televisions * stove and oven * microwave * air conditioning * clothes washer * at least one vcr * cable or satellite television * at least one dvd player * clothes dryer * cordless phone * cell phone ( obviously , not everyone that lacks one of those does so for financial reasons either , but for the sake of argument , let 's assume that everyone who could afford them bought as much as they could ) . 
  they * lack * : * ceiling fans * personal computer * non-portable stereo * coffee maker * internet service * computer printer * dishwasher * answering machine * more than two televisions * more than one vcr * separate freezer * video game system * more than one dvd player * big screen television * multiple refrigerators * photocopier * jacuzzi i mean ... yes , someone drew a line , but ... somehow i 'm not overwhelmed by horror . 
  we are ... or you and australia and new zealand are ? 
  two children is also an arbitrary choice . 
  we could move it up to * three * children if we wanted , or four , or five . 
  or , let 's say that we increased minimum wage and thus increased unemployment ; it would take fewer hours , but then it would be harder to become employed . 
   up until that point us policy -- under advisement of the letters left by ` founding fathers ' such as madison and jefferson -- primarily left europe alone . 
  and washington !, 
  [ excerpt from washington 's farewell address on foreign alliances , specifically with europe ] ( http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp ) :  observe good faith and justice towards all nations ; cultivate peace and harmony with all . 
  religion and morality enjoin this conduct ; and can it be , that good policy does not equally enjoin it - it will be worthy of a free , enlightened , and at no distant period , a great nation , to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence . 
  who can doubt that , in the course of time and things , the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it ? 
  can it be that providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue ? 
  the experiment , at least , is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature . 
  is it rendered impossible by its vices ? 
    in the execution of such a plan , nothing is more essential than that permanent , inveterate antipathies against particular nations , and passionate attachments for others , should be excluded ; and that , in place of them , just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated . 
  the nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave . 
  it is a slave to its animosity or to its affection , either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest . 
  antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury , to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage , and to be haughty and intractable , when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur . 
  hence , frequent collisions , obstinate , envenomed , and bloody contests . 
  the nation , prompted by ill-will and resentment , sometimes impels to war the government , contrary to the best calculations of policy . 
  the government sometimes participates in the national propensity , and adopts through passion what reason would reject ; at other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride , ambition , and other sinister and pernicious motives . 
  the peace often , sometimes perhaps the liberty , of nations , has been the victim . 
    so likewise , a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils . 
  sympathy for the favorite nation , facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists , and infusing into one the enmities of the other , betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification . 
  it leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions ; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained , and by exciting jealousy , ill-will , and a disposition to retaliate , in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld . 
  and it gives to ambitious , corrupted , or deluded citizens ( who devote themselves to the favorite nation ) , facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country , without odium , sometimes even with popularity ; gilding , with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation , a commendable deference for public opinion , or a laudable zeal for public good , the base or foolish compliances of ambition , corruption , or infatuation . 
    as avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways , such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot . 
  how many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions , to practice the arts of seduction , to mislead public opinion , to influence or awe the public councils . 
  such an attachment of a small or weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter . 
    against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ( i conjure you to believe me , fellow-citizens ) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake , since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government . 
  but that jealousy to be useful must be impartial ; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided , instead of a defense against it . 
  excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side , and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other . 
  real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious , while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people , to surrender their interests . 
    the great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations , to have with them as little political connection as possible . 
  so far as we have already formed engagements , let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith . 
  here let us stop . 
  europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none ; or a very remote relation . 
  hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies , the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns . 
  hence , therefore , it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics , or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities . 
    our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course . 
  if we remain one people under an efficient government . 
  the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance ; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected ; when belligerent nations , under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us , will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation ; when we may choose peace or war , as our interest , guided by justice , shall counsel . 
    why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation ? 
  why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground ? 
  why , by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of europe , entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of european ambition , rivalship , interest , humor or caprice ? 
    it is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world ; so far , i mean , as we are now at liberty to do it ; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements . 
  i hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs , that honesty is always the best policy . 
  i repeat it , therefore , let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense . 
  but , in my opinion , it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them . 
    taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture , we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies . 
    harmony , liberal intercourse with all nations , are recommended by policy , humanity , and interest . 
  but even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand ; neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences ; consulting the natural course of things ; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce , but forcing nothing ; establishing ( with powers so disposed , in order to give trade a stable course , to define the rights of our merchants , and to enable the government to support them ) conventional rules of intercourse , the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit , but temporary , and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied , as experience and circumstances shall dictate ; constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another ; that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character ; that , by such acceptance , it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors , and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more . 
  there can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation . 
  it is an illusion , which experience must cure , which a just pride ought to discard . 
  it 's to support it . 
   it was only a matter of bombing and starving britain until we capitulated . 
  the problem with starving britain is that britain controlled the ocean and could more-easily starve europe than the other way around . 
   their geographical position was virtually unassailable [ wikipedia : american theater ( world war ii ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_theater_%28world_war_ii%29 ) , attacks on us mainland : * one group of 30 german spies .

  * a third group of two unsuccessful german saboteurs . 
  * a japanese capture of some remote aleutian islands near the tip of alaska .

   well , if the alternative is some anonymous dude , on the other side of the pond , deciding who lives and who dies , then definitely yes . 
  if this action was a result of the french attack , i doubt very much that the us simply up-and-killed him without france being in the loop . 
   not good . 
  it would have been good to catch this guy , put him in front of a judge , make it clear to everyone what he did and why then lock him up in a nice french prison for the rest of his life . 
  probably , but : * no sense in letting him get a shot at killing policemen or soldiers sent to arrest him . 
  * yemen is n't in quite the state where it can go arrest and extradite people the way a country normally would . 
  * no drone technology yet capable of grabbing someone and yanking them off through the air ( yet ) .

  just a reminder , since a lot of media reporting russian actions has not been terribly clear on distinctions : this was in lithuania 's [ eez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone ) ( up to 200nm offshore ) , not within their [ territorial waters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_waters ) ( up to 12nm offshore ) . 
  lithuania has the exclusive right to harvest the fish , extract oil , etc within its eez , but not to control marine traffic : that 's only within territorial waters .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_immigrant_population sweden has a higher percentage of immigrant population than the us , but inter-european movement also counts towards sweden 's immigration levels , whereas inter-state movement does not in the us . 
  that being said , most of our illegal immigration is from north or central america rather than africa , so it 's not quite the same thing . 
   black people in the us werent immigrants . 
  they immigrated , albeit not by choice . 
  immigration to the us comes from different sources than immigration to europe . 
  central and north american countries have problems , but nowhere on the scale of the countries that people are leaving in africa to head to europe .
