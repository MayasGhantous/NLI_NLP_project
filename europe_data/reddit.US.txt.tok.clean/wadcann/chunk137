  what is that , a large mcdonalds fries * for ants * ? 
  i feel like i 'm missing something critical , then . 
  / u/mkvgtired makes it sound like the country in question * wants * to have low taxes . 
  i do n't understand why a country , absent eu mandate , would n't just lower that tax rate , or even directly offer tax subsidies to a company if it thinks that there 's some strategic benefit to itself in doing so . 
  there should be no reason for that company to need to make use of some esoteric loophole in that case , yes ? 
  the impression the article gives is that whatever was done was not intended by the country , but was legal ; in that case , one would think that a country would want to shut it down by adjusting their tax law . 
  ... oh , the concern is that the eu mandates a minimum tax rate , and that countries are trying to compete on that tax rate ? 
  * `` the eu wo n't be civilized until it grants the right to bear arms . '', 
  * `` europe 's persecution of jews was driven by envy . '', 
  * `` let 's be honest : the eu is the fourth reich , just reached via diplomacy . '', 
  * `` erdogan has announced that ... '', 
  you 're on a roll .

  i 'm all for arranging 1:1 swaps . 
  while certainly i do n't like the sound of that , i ca n't judge this bill without an english translation of the actual bill 's text . 
  the material here is a very vague summary from a hostile journal . 
  edit : here 's [ a google translate-generated text ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.assemblee-nationale.fr%2f14%2fdossiers%2frenseignement.asp&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  edit2 : i 'll attach what appears to me to be the important bits :  for the sole purpose of preventing terrorism , the prime minister or one of the persons delegated by him may , after consultation with the national commission for monitoring of intelligence techniques , impose on operators and the persons mentioned in article l . 
  851-1 setting work on their networks of a device for detecting a terrorist threat on the basis of automated processing only the information or documents referred to in article l. 851-1 same , without identifying the persons to whom such information or documents relate and without proceeding to the collection of data other than those that meet the automated processing design criteria . 
  this appears to be a warrantless wiretap , not under control of the telecommunications company who runs the network to which this is attached . 
   `` art . 
  - the data collected as part of the setting implementation of technical intelligence permitted under this book are destroyed at the end of a fixed term for the technique used by decree of the state council , within twelve months or , for connection data , five years after their collection . 
    `` if strictly necessary and for the sole purpose of technical analysis , those of collected information containing elements or cyberattack that are encrypted and decrypted information associated with them , can be kept beyond the time mentioned in the first paragraph of this i , to the exclusion of any use for the monitoring of data subjects . 
  this is a good restriction , and i would like to see concrete retention bounds on par with this in the united states . 
  i 'd like to see criminal penalties attached for violation of this . 
   `` the prime minister defines the terms of the centralization of the conduct of the authorized interceptions or failing and exceptionally , the centralization of correspondence intercepted by a device or a technical device mentioned in the second paragraph of article l. 851 -5 . 
  correspondence intercepted by the equipment or technical device are destroyed as soon as it appears that they are not linked with the project authorization . 
  that 's vaguely-pleasant , though it 's rather non-concrete . 
  what if , for example , nobody ever bothers to * ever * determine that they are not linked with the project authorization ? 
   ` notwithstanding article l. 821-4 , the license is issued for a maximum period of two months and is renewable under the same conditions of form and duration than the initial authorization . 
  fair enough ( though this could obviously easily be turned into a rubber-stamp ) . 
  - the service mentioned in article l. 561-23 may require any ground transportation company , rail , sea or air or any travel operator or stay the identification elements of people with paid or received delivery and the dates , times and places of departure and arrival of these people and , if applicable , the information in its possession concerning the carriage of baggage and cargo . 
  road transport operators offering international services are required to collect the identity of passengers and keep this information for a period of one year . '', 
  i am not very enthusiastic about this . 
  that is detailed monitoring of movement of a population . 
  i skipped over the small insertions and deletions in the bill ; some of these may be extremely-important , but they really require examination of the original bill , which is difficult for someone whose main way of reading french is google translate ; bad translation is also not very friendly to legal terminology . 
  i remember , for example , [ mitch glazier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitch_glazier ) making a small change in wording to federal legislation in an attempt to shift huge amounts of money from performers in the us to their record labels . 
  for a non-native speaker unversed in us law , it would have been very difficult to identify this simply by reading over the bill text . 
  i 'd really be more interested in a paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of a french lawyer attached to some civil liberties organization . 
  illegally , or not ? 
  if they committed tax fraud , that 's one thing . 
  if they hired a bunch of tax experts to identify every loophole they could find and then made use of those ... < shrug  ... then it just means that the tax experts that they 've dealt with are earning their keep . 
  start ironing out those loopholes . 
  the article sounds like the latter is the case . 
  http://fsr.eui.eu/documents/presentations/transport/5erailtrf/on-line/121005fingermatthias2.pdf a presentation talking more about the rpi and its limitations , since i was n't familiar with it . 
  limitations listed :  * passenger rail is over - weighted relative to freight , because punctuality is only measured in passenger transport   * big countries ( size ) are favoured relative to small countries , because of the share of high - speed travellers   * data stem from the international union of railways ( iuc ) : not enough data for dk , ee , gr i 'm a little suspicious of `` indexes '' , because while everyone loves being able to reduce a sum total of things to a single score so they can get a single bar graph and say `` good '' or `` bad '' , it 's very frequently not a great idea to do that . 
  first , the weightings may not make much sense . 
  modern-day rail travel is , as far as i know , quite safe ; i would n't place a third of the weight on safety . 
  i do n't worry much about driving my automobile around , and [ rail is much safer per mile , at least in the us , than automobile travel ] ( http://science.time.com/2013/12/02/despite-metro-north-crash-riding-the-rails-is-safer-than-riding-a-car/ ) . 
  i do , however , care a lot about travel time , which is only 1/12th of the score , and even more about coverage , which is n't scored at all , and number of interchanges required for an average trip , which also is n't scored at all . 
  second , i do n't know who computes the rpi . 
  one thing that occasionally pops up in the news in the us is the [ report card for america 's infrastructure ] ( http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/ ) , done by the american society of civil engineers , an industry association . 
  not surprisingly , the consistent conclusion is that clearly the united states ' infrastructure is in a dire state , and that governments need to spend more on civil engineering . 
  it 's a nice , simple , vaguely-authoritative-sounding set of numbers that are easy to cite in a news article , and it 's exactly what someone * should n't * be quoting . 
  if you wanted a particular country 's rail to look good or bad , you can set up weighting however you want . 
  i 'd be much happier with independent ranking of the various statistics , and avoiding trying to cram railways down into a single score . 
  honestly , who cares ? 
  some sports team talked trash and it did n't work out . 
  they could as easily have won , and it would n't have reflected well or poorly on the country as a whole . 
  it has nothing to do with russia 's actions regarding eastern europe , which is what i 'm pretty sure most people are actually irked about , and taking out upset about that on a sports team is just petty . 
  why is vancouver island light blue ?

  / u/kodiakanorak is describing a poll , and you 're talking about an anecdote ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_hollywood_shootout#aftermath_and_controversy  the ineffectiveness of the standard police patrol pistols and shotguns in penetrating the robbers ' body armor led to a trend in the united states ( including cities such as miami ) toward arming selected police patrol officers , not just swat teams , with heavier firepower such as semi-automatic 5.56 mm ar-15 type rifles . 
  swat teams , whose close quarters battle weaponry usually consisted of submachine guns that fired pistol cartridges such as the heckler & koch mp5 , began supplementing them with ar-15-based assault rifles and carbines . 
  [ 15 ] seven months after the incident , the department of defense gave 600 surplus m16s to the lapd , which were issued to each patrol sergeant ; [ 33 ] [ 34 ] lapd patrol vehicles now carry ar-15s as standard issue , with bullet-resistant kevlar plating in their doors as well . 
  [ 35 ] also as a result of this incident lapd authorized its officers to carry .45 acp caliber semiautomatic pistols as duty sidearms , specifically the smith & wesson models 4506 and 4566 . 
  prior to 1997 , only lapd swat officers were authorized to carry .45 acp caliber pistols , specifically the model 1911a1 .45 acp semiautomatic pistol . 
  [ 36 ] also , see the [ 1986 fbi miami shootout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_fbi_miami_shootout#aftermath ) :  the subsequent fbi investigation placed partial blame for the agents ' deaths on the lack of stopping power exhibited by their service handguns . 
  the fbi soon began the search for a more powerful caliber and cartridge . 
  noting the difficulties of reloading a revolver while under fire , the fbi specified that agents should be armed with semiautomatic handguns , and this incident contributed to the increasing trend of law enforcement agencies switching from revolvers to semi-automatic pistols across the nation . 
  [ 20 ]   in the aftermath , the fbi initially chose the smith & wesson 1076 chambered for the 10mm auto round , but its sharp recoil proved too much for most agents to control effectively , and a special reduced velocity loading was developed - commonly referred to as the `` 10mm lite '' or `` 10mm fbi '' . 
  broadly-speaking , i 'd say that police officers being outgunned in an event tends to result in increased firepower being issued . 
  according to their webpage , the [ department of state ] ( http://careers.state.gov/intern ) has both a paid and an unpaid ( other than housing ) program ; it looks like they 're billing it mostly as a way to spend time abroad . 
  < shrug  fair enough . 
   i just fell in love with them . 
  out of curiosity , what started your interest in the baltics ? 
  [ history and origin of latvian jokes ] ( http://www.chrisconnollyonline.com/2013/04/195-history-and-origins-of-latvian-jokes.html ) . 
  i mostly see them showing up on / r/polandball . 
  that 's a fair concern . 
  looking at my [ above explanation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/34t672/on_this_day_latvia_celebrates_25_years_freedom/cqygn48 ) :  * churchill , who was the most-bitterly opposed to letting stalin have poland , did n't really have the political clout at that point the power has shifted around a bit ; i 'm not sure who would be most-in-favor of intervention and who least today and whether that lines up with clout . 
  i do think that there would be a lot more willingness to oppose however ; look at what happened simply due to crimea , where there are no obligations present . 
   * i 've read , in many sources , that fdr 's view of stalin could be described as `` naive '' i do n't think that most of the world has a very rosy-eyed view of putin ( though , on the other hand , i do n't think that most would compare him to stalin , either ) . 
   * remember that for the us , the important bits of the war were still underway unlikely that the us would be in a major war already if russia tried to re-annex eastern europe . 
  though , certainly it 's the case that countries wait for potential competitors to be occupied to play their own bids ( and that 's why the world wars came as a burst of conflicts all at once ; as the world power ordering broke down , lots of countries saw an opportunity to get what they wanted . 
   * the soviet union had done the bulk of the bleeding against germany . 
  no such fraternal bond quite exists today . 
   * the us and the uk did not possess a land army quite as large as the the soviet union then had . 
  nato could wipe the floor with russia in a conventional war today . 
  it might not * want * to do so -- there might be cheaper ways of accomplishing goals , and nuclear war is certainly a risk -- but the military situation is quite different . 
   * unlike the uk , the united states had not made military commitments to poland 's security , all nato members have made a military commitment . 
   * churchill wanted to secure greece from communist influence , and part of the price for stalin not interfering in greece was churchill not interfering in poland . 
  russia has n't done much of anything for nato recently ( other than probably assisting officers in its structure in getting more funding ) . 
   * it 's not clear that the british public would have supported churchill , either . 
  two world wars had ravaged and impoverished the uk , and a third would have been a terribly-difficult pill to swallow .
