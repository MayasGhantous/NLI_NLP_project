  tough call as to whether people today are more-psychologically-ready for conflict , but certainly nobody is coming out of a massive war . 
   * fdr died before the war ended . 
  this was a disruptive time for american policy in terms of wrapping up the war . 
  well ... that could happen again , i guess . 
   * europe had been torn to pieces by the war . 
  the same urgency in getting things functioning again is n't present today . 
  i read a bit about that . 
  * churchill , who was the most-bitterly opposed to letting stalin have poland , did n't really have the political clout at that point ; as the uk had been playing a proportionally-smaller role militarily in world war ii , the ussr and us were setting more of what was going on . 
  * i 've read , in many sources , that fdr 's view of stalin could be described as `` naive '' ; he viewed the soviet union as something much closer to his progressive-reform approach to american democracy than it wound up being . 
  it 's easy to find criticism from historians of fdr 's foreign policy decisions , and particularly on yalta . 
  * remember that for the us , the important bits of the war were still underway : it had redirected resources into europe rather than focusing fully on japan , which had taken the phillipines from the us , was the country that had attacked the us , and it had been in europe with the expectation that it would go back and beat japan with the aid of the others . 
  attacking the soviet union would not only mean a soviet-japanese alliance which would greatly-exacerbate difficulties in finishing things up in east asia , but which would make it difficult for american resources to concentrate against east asia , which is what the us wanted to do . 
  at the least , the us would probably have headed over to finish off japan , then have to ship millions of conscripts ( who were pretty tired of war at this point ) to the other side of the world again and re-open a new war . 
  this would have been viewed by many americans as a war of aggression : remember that up until japan attacked the united states , us sentiment was against involving itself in wars in the first place . 
  * the soviet union had done the bulk of the bleeding against germany . 
  whatever their intentions , there was probably an expectation that something had to be given them . 
  while it 's certainly fair to say that poland was not for the other allied nations to choose to give up , the situation was probably politically-different than if the ussr had remained neutral after taking poland in world war ii . 
  sakhalin island was probably another way of `` paying off '' the ussr . 
  * the united states and the united kingdom possessed the most-powerful air force in the world by far , and the united states was ( slowly ) producing more nuclear weapons . 
  the two were also the naval powers of the world ( by the end of the war , the us overwhelmingly so ) . 
  however , [ they did not possess a land army quite as large as the the soviet union then had ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_unthinkable ) . 
  i would bet on us and the uk , but it would have made world war ii * much * longer and bloodier ; a nuclear war raging across europe would not have been pretty . 
  * unlike the uk , the united states had not made military commitments to poland 's security , and so politically , the us would be taking action without treaty obligation . 
  the uk could not single-handedly fight the ussr . 
  * churchill wanted to secure greece from communist influence , and part of the price for stalin not interfering in greece was churchill not interfering in poland . 
  * it 's not clear that the british public would have supported churchill , either . 
  two world wars had ravaged and impoverished the uk , and a third would have been a terribly-difficult pill to swallow . 
  * fdr died before the war ended . 
  this was a disruptive time for american policy in terms of wrapping up the war . 
  truman took his place , and took some time to come up to speed ; he had n't been prepared to suddenly be thrust into the role , and to some degree simply motored along with policies established under fdr for a while . 
  truman did become increasingly hostile to stalin and took a harder line over time , [ but at this point , the situation had become increasingly-frozen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potsdam_conference ) :  president roosevelt died on 12 april 1945 , and vice-president harry truman assumed the presidency ; his succession saw ve day ( victory in europe ) within a month and vj day ( victory in japan ) on the horizon . 
  during the war and in the name of allied unity , roosevelt had brushed off warnings of a potential domination by a stalin dictatorship in part of europe . 
  he explained that `` i just have a hunch that stalin is not that kind of a man '' and reasoned `` i think that if i give him everything i possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return , * noblesse oblige * , he wo n't try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace . 
  '' [ 8 ]   while inexperienced in foreign affairs , truman had closely followed the allied progress of the war . 
  george lenczowski notes `` despite the contrast between his relatively modest background and the international glamour of his aristocratic predecessor , [ truman ] had the courage and resolution to reverse the policy that appeared to him naive and dangerous '' , which was `` in contrast to the immediate , often ad hoc moves and solutions dictated by the demands of the war . '' . 
  [ 9 ] with the end of the war , the priority of allied unity was replaced with a new challenge , the nature of the relationship between the two emerging superpowers . 
  [ 9 ]   truman became much more suspicious of communist moves than roosevelt had been , and he became increasingly suspicious of soviet intentions under stalin . 
  [ 9 ] truman and his advisers saw soviet actions in eastern europe as aggressive expansionism which was incompatible with the agreements stalin had committed to at yalta the previous february . 
  in addition , it was at the potsdam conference that truman became aware of possible complications elsewhere , when stalin objected to churchill 's proposal for an early allied withdrawal from iran , ahead of the schedule agreed at the tehran conference . 
  however , the potsdam conference marks the first and only time truman would ever meet stalin in person . 
  [ 10 ] [ 11 ] * europe had been torn to pieces by the war . 
  many of europe 's inhabitants were starving and in serious need of food and other aid . 
  a new war would have postponed any repairs being done here ; a major concern was in getting the countries functioning again . 
  i realize that all of that probably is n't a lot of consolation to poland , but it 's at least an * explanation * in line with my understanding of what was significant at the time . 
  whatever it 's being used for , apparently the [ us is the primary importer ] ( https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/hs/2933/ ) . 
  here 's a [ breakdown of the individual chemicals ] ( https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff/headings/2933 ) : it sounds like applications include : * painkillers and anasthetics , like [ propyphenazone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propyphenazone ) , [ alfentanil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfentanil ) , and [ phenylbutazone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phenylbutazone ) . 
  * eyedrops , like [ naphazoline ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naphazoline ) * pesticides/fungicides like [ triflumizole ] ( http://www.pesticideinfo.org/detail_chemical.jsp?rec_id=pc34923 ) or [ fenamidone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fenamidone ) * antidepressants like [ iproniazid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iproniazid ), 
  not only that , but that snippit has n't changed since the first time archive.org [ took a snapshot of it ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20070613004825/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2049.html ) back in 2007 . 
  ... has varoufakis actually had a problem getting his views out ? 
  i 'd think that his statements have gotten an exceptional amount of coverage relative to anyone else in europe recently . 
   lithuanian officials claim that russian military ships have entered their country 's exclusive economic zone four times since march , incursions that have been interpreted as an attempt to disrupt the construction of the nordbalt , an underwater power cable that will link lithuania to sweden . 
  entering an eez alone is n't an issue , though -- an [ eez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone ) extends to 200nm off of a shore . 
  the territorial waters ( 12nm ) are significantly-closer . 
  i think that attempts to define common values that stretch to political lines tends to work very poorly , and that people often do n't have the same common view of their position . 
  what ideals there are seem to be likely to have derived from a political movement 's aspirational slogans . 
  for example , let 's say i do the united states . 
  i suppose that if i asked someone in the us , they 'd say something like `` liberty '' or `` freedom '' . 
  if i asked them * concretely * what that meant , they 'd probably say something along the lines of upholding the bill of rights . 
  but that 's not really an answer unless the bill of rights simply does a perfect job of accurately-reflecting what people 's internal values are . 
  sure , you can examine us positions on freedom of speech as related to that amendment and contrast them with , say , french ones , but it 's not at all clear that this does a better job of describing opinions than something like a poll would . 
  secondly , `` freedom '' as an ideal was taken down at a time when the us was a major slaveholding nation . 
  clearly , at least some people would n't have agreed with this . 
  a some of early american ideology was derived from ancient greece , and * there * the ideal was `` freedom for citizens , who are a particular elect group , but slavery for foreigners is fine '' . 
  to me , simply saying `` freedom '' and couching political slogans and movements in those terms seems terribly-artificial . 
  it 's on par with trying to establish characteristics of a generation ( generation x , etc ) . 
  most people around the world seem to want more-or-less the same things , and assigning one virtue to one group seems difficult to do . 
  maybe the weighting is different -- for example , maybe china , wracked by revolution for a long time , places a high value on avoiding civil war again , even to the point of accepting restrictions on civil liberties . 
  or maybe china is worried about recovering its economic power , since it 's in such a poor slot , and its people are willing to cut into civil liberties for a guaranteed rising standard of living . 
  maybe ukraine or poland are dreadfully-worried about a new russian takeover , and so they 're willing to special-case treatment of russian separatism ... but ordinarily , would prefer to have freedom for people to espouse political ideas . 
  most of the comments i 'm seeing people post here are , well , political slogans , nice sound bites . 
  but ... it 's far-from-clear to me that if you took someone and raised them without hearing that slogan , that that slogan would be what comes out of their mouth . 
  if i had to list what i think people living in the general area of europe * today * tend to weight more-highly than much of the rest of the world : * ** peace between european nation-states ** . 
  europe had two world wars , and they contributed greatly to devastation and europe falling from her exalted pre-war position of ~ 1900 . 
  i think that you could find almost universal agreement in europe that there should not be more general european wars , and that large sacrifices are acceptable to avoid such war . 
  * ** a willingness to blot out cultural differences within europe ** . 
  perhaps a result of the above , but it 's really not just the same thing . 
  europe has a lot of different cultures , but at least from my outside-europe view of europe ( which admittedly , is probably not a cross-section of all of european society ) , i do n't see a lot of people saying `` scotland is really awesome because scots are the * best * and we hate malta '' . 
  it could be that , for example , germans only complain about spanish customs and how awful it makes the spanish to other germans and not where an american could hear , or maybe just that i do n't interact with the germans who do this , but that 's certainly the impression i get . 
  one good example is language -- everyone on this forum is speaking english , for example . 
  while it 's the case that europe probably has more-to-gain from defragmenting language than many other places , and that looking at an english-speaking forum on reddit certainly has selection bias , i do n't have any trouble finding bitterness in the american southwest about spanish infringement ( which is * very * unlikely to become entrenched ) . 
  europe is , by-and-large , not terribly religious , and while many people had predicted the fall of religion , i think that this has been most-realized in europe . 
  here 's wikipedia 's [ importance of religion by country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country ) table . 
  * ** a higher degree of welfare than is the norm around the world ** . 
  to some extent , every country has an interest in providing for welfare ; it ensures stability . 
  you can not expect a starving man to obey any laws , since he will do anything to get bread . 
  however , i believe that europe does provide a relatively-extensive set of these services . 
  some of this is due to europe 's wealth relative to much of the world , true ; were europe suddenly reduced to ethiopia 's level of wealth , i 'm not sure what changes would happen , but i think that this ideal does pervade society , whatever the reasons . 
  furthermore , there * are * other routes to provide for the poor , like via churches or personal giving or ngos : europe tends to prefer to have the state provide welfare . 
  * ** an antagonistic view of the business world ** . 
  again , this may be me not getting a great cross-section of the environment , and i ca n't compare against what someone in , say , argentina thinks , but at least relative to the united states , i think that people i 've spoken to from europe are much-more-willing to take a sort of `` business is out to get me , and i do n't much like businesses '' position . 
  * ** gender equality ** . 
  europe is n't unique here and this has spread around the world , but many societies have significantly-different male and female roles , and this distinguishes europe from much of the rest of the world . 
  you can find people annoyed with feminists , but they are n't normally rejecting the idea that a woman should leave the house and go work in the same sort of job that men have worked in over the years and take the same political role that men do . 
  there are other things that i could list . 
  hope for growing wealth relative to one 's ancestors , security of property , education , the freedom to express one 's views openly , but i think that to greater-or-lesser degree , these show up around the world , and it 's not clear that european countries value these uniquely ( though perhaps they do a better job of actually providing them than many countries around the world ) . 
  could be worse , though .
