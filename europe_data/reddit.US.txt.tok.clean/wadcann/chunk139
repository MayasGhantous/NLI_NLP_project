  apparently , yes . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/feb/27/london-house-prices-slip-in-january-after-stream-of-rises-in-2014  prices are 12 % higher than in january 2014 , at an average of # 458,283 ... 
  i would n't spend more than a maximum of three times gross income on purchasing housing . 
  http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/04/british-house-prices it looks like the uk has about a 3.4 x multiplier ( up from 2x in 1980 ) , but it 's not * that * far off what i 'm talking about . 
  11.5 x is definitely out-of-whack ( though to be fair , a second income might bring that down somewhat ) . 
  oh , shoot , i 'm sorry ... i could n't figure out why people were talking about h1-b visas . 
  i meant to write `` companies '' . 
  the world war ii started with germany 's invasion of poland on september 17 , 1939 . 
  the united states declared war on germany on december 11 , 1941 . 
  this was 816 days after the war started . 
  world war ii ended with the surrender of japan on september 2 , 1945 . 
  this was 2177 days after the war started . 
   income inequality and poverty are quite shocking eu-wide . 
  8 years ( let that sink in ) after the crisis , a crisis - let 's not forget - that was spurred on by reckless deregulation . 
  first , i do n't see this clashing with what i said about intern pricing . 
  but , second , since you bring it up ... how much of that is due to expansion of the eu to include poorer countries and this not resulting in immediate wealth and education transfer to new members ? 
  let 's say that ukraine entered the eu tomorrow , in a surprise announcement . 
  ukraine has n't changed , nor has that of any other member state , but clearly the eu would be significantly more-unequal . 
  looking at member nations of the eu [ by gini coefficient ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) , it looks like most of the low-coefficient ( more equal ) countries are in the eu . 
  going from the bottom of the cia 's rankings , there 's sweden , slovenia , montenegro ( not in the eu ) , hungary , denmark , norway ( not in the eu ) , austria , luxembourg , slovakia , finland , germany , belarus ( not in the eu ) ... the highly-unequal countries are those like south africa , lesotho , botswana , sierra leone , central african republic , namibia , haiti , colombia , honduras , guatemala , hong kong , thailand , paraguay , boliva , chile , panama , mexico , papua new guinea , and so forth -- not a european union nation anywhere near there . 
  as for deregulation , if you 're talking about the triggering cause of the crisis ( the us housing bubble ) rather than europe-side issues that exacerbated the impact , while it gets [ a mention on the wikipedia : causes of the united states housing bubble ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_of_the_united_states_housing_bubble ) page , it 's also only one of eleven factors , and one of the more controversial ones . 
  naw , it was n't immediately-obvious to me either . 
  there 's a lot of really horrendous journalism online , and figuring out what 's a joke and what 's actually just as bad as a joke can take some doing ... 
  all right . 
  i 'm not sure why state subsidies for particular forms of employment would be considered `` unfettered capitalism '' , which is what / u/gooserampage was talking about . 
  i 'm not sure who `` we '' is in this context . 
  you 've posted other things about latvia , so i assume that you 're talking about latvia ? 
  latvia 's [ post-crash unemployment rate appears to have peaked at over 20 % at the beginning of 2010 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/latvia/unemployment-rate ) , and is now down to less than half that , and heading down . 
  that 's not low , but it 's certainly not wildly out-of-wack with what most countries have . 
  latvia 's on the euro , which [ appears to have had deflation for four months ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi ) . 
  according to the page i linked , it 's had inflation of 2.12 percent between 1991 and 2015 , which hardly seems terribly amok . 
   but enough about us how are things in us ? 
  we just broke 2008 's record for the fastest economic unraveling !, 
  that 's a blog that appears to be dedicated to advocating that the us is on the brink of economic collapse . 
  as of may 1 , 20015 , it 's predicting that we 're about to see a giant bubble bursting . 
  that blog appears to be a bit over a year old , and it was predicting the same thing a year ago . 
   it also implicate that people do n't have to be paid because `` they can go look elsewhere where they can get paid more if they really need . 
  they therefore must be lazy . 
  let me add you another 10h more hour this week to help you at a magnificent 10 more $ . 
  here have your coppers peasant . '', 
  first , you may define it in that way yourself , but that 's not the commonly-used definition of the term `` trickle-down theory '' ; i 'd repeat my statement that this is entirely-disconnected from that . 
  second , if you 're trying to present my views , no , i would n't say that 's an accurate take . 
  i think that it 's entirely-possible that * nobody * wants to pay more than a certain amount for a given internship ; if that 's the case , that 's because there is n't any demand for interns in that field . 
  wages are the primary mechanism by which the market pushes information back about what demand is ; you might well not * want * to be doing that internship . 
  i do n't think that it has much to do with anyone being lazy or not , and i do n't think that it has anything to do with a class-based system . 
   the problem is not me . 
  it 's that you stuck the entire gen y in that scheme at every corner . 
  `` take the 100 $ / mo or no income . '', 
  or do n't do an internship in that field . 
  if what you want is to make money on a summer job for a few months , go work whatever is offering you the best deal ( and you might look closely at whether that field is promising * after * the internship phase as well ) . 
   yup , exactly `` take the 100 $ or have nothing '' . 
  exactly what i said . 
  you understand what i 'm getting at , though , yes ? 
  if fifty people are saying `` i want to do an internship in field x '' and employers only want thirty people , then there are simply too many people trying to get into those slots . 
  simply saying `` i 'm available to do work in area x '' does n't make a company and industry pop up to hire you . 
   yeah they have n't mentionned years of experience . 
  but `` experience with real-time computer vision systems '' `` hands-on experience in implementing large-scale learning algorithms and systems '' `` experience with medical imaging analysis '' read the job description . 
  those are all `` preferred '' skills . 
  it 's common , when a job is posted , for `` required '' skills and `` desired '' or `` preferred '' skills to be listed . 
  even the `` required '' skills normally are n't an absolutely hard requirement ( it 's just what the hiring manager is trying to use to cut down on the amount of chaff that he has to go through ) , but `` preferred '' skills are typically a dump of what would be particularly interesting to the employer in the selection process . 
  it 's not likely that any one candidate will hit * everything * ; however , out of the applicant pool , they will help determine who is chosen . 
  the employer is n't wanting to cut people out ; they 're wanting to give an idea of what the job involves . 
  they do n't put * that * much thought into putting down the desired items . 
  for that opening , they are probably looking for a graduate student who knows either machine learning or computer vision , has done coding in c/c + + ( pretty likely for those two fields ) and ideally has a medical imaging background . 
   lol are you high ? 
  [ some internships are done remotely ] ( https://www.careerbuilder.com/article/cb-3369-internships-first-jobs-are-virtual-internships-the-way-to-go/ ) :  according to a 2012 survey by internships.com , 33 percent of the 300-plus companies surveyed offer virtual internships -- a 20 percent increase from 2011 to 2012 . 
  for some internships it does n't make sense , and i think that it misses some of the point of doing an internship ; learning what working directly with other people is like . 
   ah yes . 
  when you want to have people on demand even in the middle of the night blackmail them with a 20m \u00b2 eviction if they do n't answer immediately . 
  nope . 
  ever . 
  not for me . 
  do you have actual examples of housing used to `` blackmail '' people with `` eviction '' if they `` do n't answer immediately '' ? 
  where i 've seen employers provide intern housing ( and it 's not common , i agree ) , it 's because they 're pulling people in from a long ways away for three months , and it 's a hassle to do apartment setup for the students a short period like this . 
   lol no it is not . 
  that is the average rent in san francisco for the population as a whole . 
  just as most people drive a less-expensive automobile as their first car , most people also do n't rent a super-pricy place for their three-month student internship . 
   are you real man ? 
  they generally get fired on the spot for looking wrong at a manager . 
  well , i ca n't speak as to your experiences . 
  maybe you 've worked somewhere and personally seen interns be fired . 
  i have not seen this happen at any employer that i 've been at ; even if a manager is unimpressed with them ( which i have seen ) , they 're going to be gone in a couple of weeks anyway . 
   i 'm sure the precarious generation love being reminded that either way they 'll be gone in a couple month . 
  ... working before your education is completed is the point of an internship . 
   yes , that 's how you get 100 % turnover and people staying 3 months and deal with the state asking wtf you are doing . 
  late 5min due to a blocked highway ? 
  fired . 
  sneezing ? 
  fired for risking your coworkers health . 
  going to see the doc ? 
  fired for being absent without authorization ( do n't bother your manager forbade you because `` we 're late on the impossible schedule so you ca n't take time off '' . 
  not answering on sunday at 3am on service phone ? 
  fired . 
  we need to fire people ho there our secret network tape said you looked reddit 5min that day ; fired . 
  etc etc. 
  i ca n't speak as to whatever your experiences have been . 
  that 's certainly not in line with what i 've seen of internships , though . 
   they simply do n't give a shit . 
  `` oh one is broken pick the next in line . '', 
  no , for two reasons .
