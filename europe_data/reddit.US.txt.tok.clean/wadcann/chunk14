  i 'm kinda cynical . 
  first , it seems like the guy might be just saying what the interviewer wants and sounds like a sexy story : his main asset is his status as a kgb defector , and he 's peddling his story in the form of books and interviews . 
  in particular , he 's blaming it on the then-contemporary moral failing of americans , and claiming that the united states is at a heated war with communist ideology . 
  this would presumably fit nicely with his interviewer ( which is apparently the ultra-anticommunist [ john birch society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_birch_society ) ) . 
  it seems awfully large-scale , untargeted , and tells a really manchurian candidate-sounding kinda story . 
  the soviets have subverted your society and are ready to take over and all that . 
  it fits terribly-closely with the john birch narrative . 
  second , it sounds like this dates to 1984 , and i do n't think that propaganda a generation later need look similar at all -- the situation is pretty wildly different . 
  third , the guy is describing the program as having been successfully-completed , and whatever happened , it sure was n't all that impressive . 
  fourth , the guy is describing something fundamentally-based on selling a glorified view of marxism-leninism . 
  rt and sputnik do n't sell ideology in any way that i can see . 
  they advance negative impressions of some things and try and highlight particular things , sure . 
  but i do n't see how what he 's describing can really apply here . 
  in what i 'm describing , nobody would be forced into a country outside of the country providing asylum . 
  that would be a refugee convention violation . 
  refugee is registered in greece . 
  refugee now has the right to work in greece and receive greek welfare , which is not very much . 
  heck , germany or other eu states could even subsidize this , if it makes greece happy . 
  the refugee has no rights to travel or work in other eu countries , as he is not an eu citizen , and has given up his ability to leverage his syrian citizenship for asylum status -- he is now documented as being safe . 
  refugee is given the option of < richer eu country  letting refugee participate in a guest worker program where they work in < richer eu country  . 
  refugee can not be forced to do this , but because he knows that the < richer eu country  labor market is way better than the greek one , accepts . 
  at this point , it 's possible to tie continued membership in the guest worker program to continued employment in the country . 
  this essentially hands the employer in < richer eu country  influence over whether a worker is deported , which means that they can effectively pay the guest worker less than they otherwise would -- access to the labor market becomes part of their compensation . 
  this is a characteristic of guest worker programs -- for example , in the us , there 's [ probably a not-insignificant premium associated with guest worker visas ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/100610168 ) . 
  given that this is unskilled labor , it may be limited by minimum wage law . 
  at this point , the eu gains a lever over the worker that permits shifting value from their labor to eu employers : a net win for the eu . 
  in no case is anyone * forced * to do anything , other than return to the poorer country of refugee status if they do n't maintain employment or otherwise cause problems . 
  this happens quietly and on an individual basis : there 's no photogenic shots of oppression or anything . 
  this sort of structure would n't work in the us , because the us is a single country -- anyone with refugee status can travel and work anywhere in the us , and ca n't be booted out unless another country accepts them or their original country is now safe . 
  but it would be available to the eu . 
  not saying that this is the plan , just that registering in the poorest country possible in the eu would permit for such a program . 
  if this were the goal , though , it does seem that germany should have announced that such a program would be available to anyone who registered in germany , not advertised that germany was opening up many slots and then just made it hard to travel to germany . 
  just saying that this is a way in which the eu could potentially-benefit . 
  a guest worker program would n't need be in ukraine/romania/croatia / slovenia . 
  it could be in germany or similar : it 's just that now germany would have the useful ability to deport workers to greece on a whim , which is a powerful whip for germany to have available . 
  that is n't available for refugees with asylum in germany ( because the 1951 refugee convention guarantees freedom of movement and labor within the country granting asylum ) and is n't available for eu workers ( because the eu guarantees freedom of labor to citizens of member countries ) . 
  this mostly addresses misuse by the authorities . 
  that 's a very real concern , but it 's not the only issue . 
  the us could n't secure the data that snowden ran off with or that manning released or its database of federal background checks that china swiped . 
  all that is material that would probably be considered pretty sensitive . 
  whatever data gets retained should be considered to be something that could be stolen , even if you trust the authorities , now and in the future , to use that data in a way that you find acceptable . 
  that means the last year of your emails , texts , and so forth might be exposed if someone manages to get a copy of the database . 
  perhaps he only knows how to write arabic ? 
  there are two main concerns , and i think that both have some amount of legitimate basis . 
  first , the idea behind refugee status is that it 's supposed to be to secure one 's safety , not to obtain economic benefits . 
  if you 're doing that , you 'd expect people to value their children and wives and parents as much as their own lives , not leave them behind . 
  the fact that young men are coming over in disproportionate numbers is compatible with people wanting to use the refugee program for economic migration . 
  second , a number of media sources have been taking pictures of women and children at wildly-disproportionate-to-their-ratio-to-men levels , probably because these are the most-politically-acceptable refugees . 
  often , shots of many refugees , like this one ( where it 's hard to control the gender of the people in the shot ) are mostly of men , and shots of individuals show women and children . 
  i. . . hmm , i guess you 're right . 
  i was going to say that if a refugee registered in greece , then they 'd just go to greece , and there would n't be diffusion . 
  but you 're right ... they can not * force * them to leave unless another country grants asylum or force refugees to move within greece , but they * can * give the option of acting as a guest worker without granting asylum , and they 'd go if the labor market were better elsewhere . 
  if that 's what the eu is doing , it actually potentially gets a useful second-class citizen , since it 's at least theoretically setting up a [ guest worker program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guest_worker_program ) , and things guaranteed refugees in the 1951 refugee convention like freedom of movement and of labor would n't apply in the country-in-which-someone-is-working , though the refugee would be free to return to greece and move around it . 
  i 'm doubtful that this is the way to go . 
  germany 's tried two things now to limit its refugee count without violating the 1951 refugee convention : ** difficulty of application ** . 
  require someone to actually reach germany without getting picked up in an intermediate country , try to block human smugglers , etc. 
  this obviously is n't working now , or at least is n't sufficient , given the mass movement of people across europe . 
  ** redistribution ** . 
  this is politically-sensitive and i personally doubt that it will work . 
  it will mean having to try to force people to stay in the country that they are sent to , will piss off countries who were so-recently subject to [ russification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification ) , and is not something that anyone chose to agree to -- it is being bludgeoned through . 
  countries might be willing to accept refugees * temporarily * , but in the long-term ? 
  that seems like a tough call , and there 's no clarity that this will be the last demand for distribution . 
  it brings up the obvious concern of whether this sort of thing will be a regular feature of eu politics in the future . 
  and finally ... how well-received will refugees be in a country that is * forced * to take them ? 
  and how happy will refugees be if they were already undergoing all the things they underwent in order to get to germany ? 
  plus , the way the thing is presented looks like a * punishment * , which is really politically awful . 
  it 's presented as taking something away rather than giving it . 
  if germany said `` okay , this is an eu emergency '' ( which is kind of debatable ... this is really a germany/sweden/etc problem ) and pulled funds from a common eu fund and said `` okay , we 're going to auction off refugee slots '' , that avoids some of the problem , because nobody 's in a dominant and a submissive role . 
  even if it were good policy , it looks like really bad politics . 
  i understand the appeal for germany . 
  the risk of being sent to a peripheral state with less employment opportunities helps decrease germany 's appeal , diffuses refugees , and simultaneously helps relieve pressure on germany 's ability to cope immediately . 
  however , this looks like a short term band-aid and with bad politics attached . 
  i really think that withdrawal ( or violation , perhaps via an elaborate set of loopholes ) from the refugee convention would make more sense . 
  if germany had the ability to sharply-limit the numbers entering germany and the eu would just send increased aid to jordan , lebanon , and turkey , i doubt that there 'd be a problem . 
  the issue is that the refugee convention does n't let germany say `` we 're going to just take n refugees '' . 
  it should n't be germany 's role to act as whip to force other eu members to conform to the treaty ... and it 's particularly awkward to have ignored this while italy and greece were getting clobbered , and only forced this through once germany started to get hit . 
  i 've listed a few alternative ideas before . 
  here 's one more , maybe a bit out there : ** eu countries negotiate special tax status for factories , arrange for eu countries to set up factories in a [ special economic zone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_economic_zone ) in turkey by camps ** . 
  right now , you have a glut of labor driving a desire to emigrate from turkey . 
  the complaint is that there is no work . 
  doing this avoids requirements to provide extensive welfare that mass asylum in the eu would require . 
  turkey would presumably love it , as any money it gets out of this is a pure win and industrial ties helps attach turkey to the eu and closer to eu status . 
  eu companies would get cheaper labor ( nothing quite like a lot of labor in the middle of nowhere that 's geographically-close without any other prospects ) . 
  eu labor organizations would hate it , but probably would find it preferable ( as it could be made not-permanent ) to drawing that labor crowd into the eu proper . 
  the eu would maintain control over the spigot here . 
  it 's probably not as desirable for the refugees ( no benefits , and depending upon how this is structured , pay might be lower ) . 
  i do n't know how quickly these could be set up , or whether the area is actually fit for factories . 
  however , that seems like something that is not incompatible with other solutions and might be a win-win situation for many people . 
  there are people on here ( e.g. 
  / u/savannajeff ) who know a lot more about trade than i , and there might be reasons why this is unworkable , but it does n't seem fundamentally-broken to me . 
  i will list one caveat -- a partial draw of going to germany/sweden/etc is not * just * refugee/permanent residency status ( though at least for syrians , i strongly suspect that it is the dominant one ) -- but that even if one is rejected , one could just not leave the country and work illegally . 
  if that becomes enough of an appeal on its own , people may still illegally travel to germany . 
  < shrug  well , it 'd be a fun project . 
  lot of speculation here ; i 've not done that much with text analysis , and there may be more-clever things that are regularly-done . 
  most major news sources provide an rss feed ; rt 's is [ here ] ( https://www.rt.com/rss/news/ ) . 
  there 's existing software to dump that . 
  you do n't so much want a word cloud for rt so much as you 're interested in relative frequencies of terms in articles ( or maybe in titles ? ), 
  differing from news source to news source . 
  i do n't know how the current word cloud generators work , but they probably more-or-less just count how much each word occurs , how many total words show up , divide the former by the latter to get the word frequency , then sort words by their frequency of occurrence and whitelist `` interesting '' words ( nouns ) or blacklist conjunctions and prepositions . 
  the top few words are the ones that represent what the text is about .
