  first , internships are normally set up before the summer and take place over it . 
  it would be difficult for an employer to find someone partway through the summer . 
  secondly , an internship is already going to be heavy on bring-up time relative to the amount of work that is actually done . 
  starting over the bring-up-to-speed process because of a sick day would be absurd . 
   i said i would never work unpaid . 
  that 's fair ; not an unreasonable position . 
  http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/disclaimer/  wndr assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content . 
  all characters appearing in the articles in this website -- even those based on real people -- are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons , living , dead , or undead is purely a miracle . 
  it 's another fake news site , like * the onion * but less-well-written . 
   the thing is that trade school and community college all have mandatory intership periods as part of their curriculum . 
  that 's an interesting point ; that would certainly artificially-inflate the number of people looking for an internship . 
  do you think that it would be a good idea to reform trade school to eliminate the mandatory internship period ? 
   saic accused siemens and its dealers of having committed `` commercial bribery '' under article 8 of the anti-unfair competition law , the sources said , and the regulator took a tough line on a practice that , while technically illegal , is relatively common in china 's healthcare sector . 
  yeah , but the way to make it less-common is to increasingly crack down on it . 
   i would think the past decade has illustrated that unfettered capitalism can have dire consequences . 
  how so ? 
   that trickle down theory is how murica went from a 25 $ - equivalent minimal wage 50y ago to unpaid internship multiplying everywhere nowadays . 
  what i said does n't have anything to do with [ trickle-down theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trickle-down_economics ) , which states that giving benefits to the wealthy or to businesses results in those benefits being transferred to the poor . 
   implying there is any `` choice '' when there 's one internship paid 100 $ / mo for 3 persons looking for a job . 
  if there 's one slot and three people , the right answer is not to work at that internship ; that 's a pretty straightforward call . 
  increasing the cost of the internship to whoever is providing it is n't going to generate more supply of slots . 
  there is n't a guarantee that there * is * demand for labor in your field ; low salary is a pretty good sign ( along with outright lack of hiring ) that companies are n't looking for people in that area . 
    in san jose , ca , us , amazon.com averages $ 6,216 / mo for a software development intern . 
    ten years experience required , needs to know everything from cobol to pascal , fortran , c++ ; 20 years experience in php ; also being a java known star dev and 10y experience only on windows 10 prog environnement . 
  i do n't know if you 're intentionally using hyperbole or just disconnected from what intern requirements typically look like . 
  [ here 's an amazon software dev internship ] ( http://www.amazon.jobs/jobs/281576/software-development-engineersdet-intern ) ; the requirements here are pretty much par for the course :  qualifications   \u2022 currently enrolled in a computer science/computer engineering program ( or related technical discipline ) with at least one term to finish after the completion of the amazon internship   \u2022 experience with object-oriented design and coding skills ( c/c + + and/or java )   preferred qualifications   \u2022 experience on a unix or linux platform   \u2022 experience with distributed ( multi-tiered ) systems , algorithms , relational databases and optimization   \u2022 ability to effectively articulate technical challenges and solutions   \u2022 adept at handling ambiguous or undefined challenges through abstract thinking places that are picking up your college student interns are aware of the fact that they are n't going to have industry experience under their belt , and the expectations for the job reflect that . 
   oh also you need to live in the bay in that neighborhood or we wo n't hire you because you are too far , if you get an internship somewhere , i suspect that the odds are pretty good that you are n't going to be able to work remotely . 
  beyond working remotely , i doubt that your employer will care where you 're living once you 're off work . 
  there are obviously some practical matters -- you have to be able to get in to work -- and some employers may provide free housing for their interns , and if the interns make use of that , that 's obviously going to constrain location , but outside of that , i do n't think it likely that an employer would care much . 
   and the rent is 4000 $ / mo that is unrealistically high even for san francisco proper ( well , okay , i 'm sure that you * could * find somewhere with a $ 4k/mo rent , but it 's probably not what you 're getting for a three-month summer internship ) . 
  you 're right that rent can be a significant cost , though . 
   3 weeks later you are fired because you had to take a sick day . 
  i do n't think i 've seen an intern be fired . 
  obviously , there 's a point where it could happen ( let 's say they ran around hitting people over the head with things , or something , and you do n't want them in the office ) , but the intern is going to be gone in a couple of months anyway ; them being incompetent is probably just not worth hassling with . 
  you just are n't going to ask them back in that case . 
  second , while i suppose that there 's some point where people not showing up for work due to constantly-vanishing could get out-of-hand , an employer has no reason to fire someone for taking a sick day ; that 's not in the employer 's interests . 
   `` we 're sorry the position was already taken [ by the ceo 's son ] '' i suppose that nepotism could happen . 
  i do n't see any reason to think that it 's specific to internships versus employment in general , though . 
   peopel do n't take a less than minimal wage job because they are `` serious '' or `` willing '' but because it 's `` do or die from starvation '' in the us . 
  if you are working an unpaid internship , it * definitely * is n't because you need money ; it 's because you feel that it will open up job opportunities . 
  and , no , even people who are n't working are n't out starving in the us , though they 're going to live a pretty miserable life . 
  i do n't see it happening . 
  that 's heading into another country that you 're not at war with and destroying property that may very well have nothing to do with the immigration . 
  if europe wants stronger disincentives , it could : * imprison smugglers * confiscate boats * guarantee that no migrant fleeing the country via boat instead of showing up at the embassy will be granted asylum * extend [ ais ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automatic_identification_system ) with cryptographic authentication and provide a unit to all small boats , and require that boats within a certain range of european shores be identifying , stopping and searching those that do not . 
  that makes smuggling boats stand out like a sore thumb . 
   people underestimate how dumb he was , and cocky if hitler did , however , do several risky things that a lot of people would have advised against , and successfully judged that there would n't be a response to them : * [ german re-armament in violation of the treaty of versailles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_re-armament ) ( not initiated by hitler , but expanded ) * [ the remilitarization of the rhineland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/remilitarization_of_the_rhineland ) * [ the * anschluss * of austria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anschluss ) * [ the german occupation of czechoslovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_occupation_of_czechoslovakia ) to just cherry-pick the times when he made risky decisions that did n't succeed does n't , i think , give the most-accurate picture available . 
  finally , there 's also a matter of the fact that we 're looking at all this with hindsight . 
  every national leader involved made some serious miscalculations over the war , and those decisions are easy for us to pick apart now , with lots of time and resources to go over them . 
  we have far more complete information , and information available from all sides . 
  we 've read sources that probably de-emphasize the other factors being considered by leadership at the time , and so forth . 
   i suspect without legislation in place protecting interns , most ceos will simply think : why should i pay my interns if other companies do n't ? 
  because you wo n't get any interns if someone else is willing to pay them ; they 'd go over to that other place that is paying . 
  same as the non-intern job market , the market for wheat , or any other market . 
  if you 're still getting unpaid interns , either : * the market wo n't support that many interns , simply because it does n't want them . 
  not * all * businesses benefit from having interns , though it 's a nice way to do safe recruiting . 
  if you hire an intern , you 're responsible for training someone ( and tying up time of other employees ) . 
  the intern will likely leave in short order and may or may not join up with you ; an intern is n't inherently a net benefit to a company , and some companies really are n't geared up for doing them . 
  my experience has been that businesses like assigning interns to people who they 're thinking about having take on leadership positions to evaluate * them * , so there 's some benefit to the business . 
  * workers do a poor job of choosing internships , because they lack sufficient information about what businesses are offering for an efficient labor market to function , and wind up taking an unpaid internship when there are companies offering paid internships . 
  in the united states , [glassdoor.com ] ( http://www.glassdoor.com/ ) exposes a lot of anonymized statistical information about pay ; more than has been the case in the past . 
  for example < glances over glassdoor for a random selection of salaries  : in san jose , ca , us , amazon.com averages $ 6,216 / mo for a software development intern . 
  in merriam , ks , us , brr architecture averages $ 47,436 / yr ( $ 3953/mo ) for an architecture intern . 
  general electric averages $ 2,933 / mo for their interns . 
  i do n't know whether europe has equivalent services , but if it does n't , i 'd imagine that there 's a strong incentive for someone to create such an equivalent . 
  presumably if someone is working an unpaid internship , it 's because they 're seriously-concerned about managing to get a job subsequent to that internship , and want a way to build their resume . 
  where that 's the case , it may be that there simply is n't demand in that industry and country for more labor , and the employee would want to avoid the field . 
  as [ forbes points out ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/01/16/why-your-unpaid-internship-makes-you-less-employable/ ) , people who have done unpaid internships tend to ultimately be hired for significantly less money than those who do paid internships ; i 'd guess that this reflects the fact that in industries with a lot of people relative to job slots ( examples forbes gave were the magazine and fashion industry ) , the industry that the person is trying to get into is n't very promising anyway . 
  edit : oops , sorry -- fixed the above typo of * companies * , not * countries * . 
  the british paid for an awful lot too ... 
  [ more assassination attempts on hitler than anyone else ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_attempts_on_adolf_hitler ) , mind . 
  yeah , well , we wound up using technology to spy more than anyone else , so ... 
   even going so far as to enact a `` europe first '' policy , rather than than focusing on the country that actually attacked them . 
  keep in mind , though , that the predominant us concern was that the ussr would do what russia had in world war i and make a separate peace , and if stalin felt that he 'd been abandoned , he might want to do exactly that ; there was good reason for a very-public europe first policy . 
  secondly , while the pacific theater did n't get all the resources that it wanted or could have without that policy , the us was ramping up and winning major engagements like the [ battle of midway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_midway ) and the [ guadalcanal campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guadalcanal_campaign ) with japan six months ( june 1942 ) after the initial japanese attacks ( december 1941 ) ; it was able to simultaneously conduct wars across both oceans , so it was n't simply sacrificing the pacific theater , either . 
  while the us started providing weapons and supplies to the uk and ussr , it was n't involved in a ground front in the european area until [ operation torch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_torch ) in november 1942 . 
  well , the uk had a military obligation to some of the occupied countries : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal  along with italy and nazi germany , the munich treaty was signed by britain and france - czechoslovakia 's allies . 
  czechoslovakia was allied by treaty with france , and great britain was in turn allied with france , so both countries would be obliged to help czechoslovakia if it was attacked . 
  [ citation needed ] the munich treaty and the subsequent occupation exposed czechoslovak citizens to the nazi regime and its atrocities . 
    czech politicians joined the newspapers in regularly using the term western betrayal and it , along with the associated feelings , became a stereotype among czechs . 
  the czech terms mnichov ( munich ) , mnichovsk\u00e1 zrada ( munich betrayal ) , mnichovsk\u00fd dikt\u00e1t ( munich dictate ) and zrada spojenc\u016f ( betrayal of the allies ) were coined at the same time and have the same meaning . 
  poet franti\u0161ek halas published a poem with verse about `` ringing bell of betrayal '' . 
  [ 18 ]   then member of parliament for epping , winston churchill said : `` britain and france had to choose between war and dishonour . 
  they chose dishonour . 
  they will have war '' . 
  [ 19 ] [ snip ]  with the rise of nazism in germany , this system of alliances was strengthened by the signing of a series of `` mutual assistance '' alliances between france , britain , and poland ( franco-polish alliance and anglo-polish alliance ) . 
  this agreement stated that in the event of war the other allies were to fully mobilize and carry out a `` ground intervention within two weeks '' in support of the ally being attacked . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] i 'm not very familiar with the very early war ( military history that i 've read tends to focus on the later portions of world war ii ) , but i 've read more than one source commenting that if france had followed up on her promises to poland and immediately-invaded germany instead of letting the [ phoney war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war ) go on , world war ii arguably would have been over very quickly ; germany had no ability at the time of the german invasion of poland to hold off a french invasion . 
  so , while it 's certainly the case that france and the uk did n't consider themselves prepared for a war with germany , that does n't mean that it would have been agreement-bound-suicide to have followed the treaties , either . 
  would the us have even entered the european war without the uk holding on , though ? 
  there are a lot of interdependencies ... 
  well , this is an off-the-cuff answer and not backed up by hard data , but i 'd attribute it to to a handful of factors , with inertia helping keep a lot of the original positions . 
  ** land ** the nearing-revolution united states had gobs of land -- if you could take and hold and work land , it was available ; this in a time when land determined a lot of the productive capacity . 
  the concern was n't so much with a lack of ability to provide for oneself , but with someone coming in and * taking * it via taxation . 
  the monopolies granted by the government to england and the taxes were what was objectionable . 
  as a result , the united states wound up with a lot of restrictions on what the state could do , and constitutional guarantees on property rights . 
  it wanted to make sure that the government could n't come in and take property . 
  contrast this with the french revolution -- same time , similar ideas floating around the world , and same as the us , most people working in agriculture . 
  however , in france , availability of land was the bottleneck on production , not access to labor . 
  in france , land , an important form of capital property , [ was owned to the tune of 10 % by the clergy , and 25-30 % by the aristocracy ] ( http://www.sjsu.edu/people/stephen.morewitz/courses/c2/s1/soc118humanrightshis.102_11._french_revolution.pdf ) . 
  there is n't any more land being * produced * , which means that you either need to manage to somehow worm your way into the aristocracy , or be cut out of the major route to earning a living : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_of_the_french_revolution#social_inequality  the population of france in the 1780s was about 26 million , of whom 21 million lived in agriculture .
