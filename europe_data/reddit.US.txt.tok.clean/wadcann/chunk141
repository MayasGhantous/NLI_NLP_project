  few of these owned enough land to support a family and most were forced to take on extra work as poorly paid labourers on larger farms . 
  there were regional differences but , by and large , french peasants were generally better off than those in countries like russia or poland . 
  even so , hunger was a daily problem which became critical in years of poor harvest and the condition of most french peasants was poor . 
  [ 4 ] in that kind of environment , if you 're a peasant , you want to * redistribute * wealth . 
  you want to not just ensure that * you * get some land , but make sure that there 's a structure in place to make sure that your descendants are n't cut out of access to land . 
  i think that this factor has become less-significant , as land is n't as important in what the typical person does in a typical day , but inertia still lives on ... ** timing relative to automation ** i 'd guess that * some * of this was also when the [ industrial revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution ) happened relative to stable governments being established . 
  the industrial revolution really got underway after the american revolution in the united states , whereas it had been happening for a decade or so in the more-industrialized europe . 
  automation tended to shift skilled ( limited , expensive ) labor to unskilled labor . 
  one had to design a machine ( which could only perform simple operations ) and then instruct workers how to use it ; if doing so , it made little sense to have a skilled worker . 
  when explicitly defined in a manufacturing context , this process would be called the [ american system of manufacturing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_system_of_manufacturing ) . 
  marx was [ concerned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marx%27s_theory_of_alienation ) about the replacement of the artisan with semi-skilled workers :  the alienation of the worker from the act of producing renders the worker unable to specialize in a type of productive labour , which is a psychologically satisfying condition nor was [ he the first to be expressing these concerns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luddite ) . 
  i 'd say that there was proportionally more concern in europe about industry where labor was n't really the primary bottleneck being automated and commoditizing labor even further . 
  there were waves of revolutions during a time when concern over labor being commoditized was very real : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1848 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1917%e2%80%9323 the us already had a sufficiently-stable government in place by the time these became broader concerns , so these were less a factor in determining united states institutions . 
  ** economic reforms occurred in the united states ** later , when leftist movements became a larger factor in the us : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_party_of_america https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_usa the [ new deal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_deal ) addressed a chunk of the major concerns that left-wing groups had ; arguably , had it not happened , labor unrest might have progressed further . 
  however , the new deal did * not * involve an overall shift to socialist ideology ; this effectively addressed some of the socialist movement 's concerns , and so neutered some of the political movement . 
  ** unions in place opposed to communism ** in the united states , [ major unions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afl%e2%80%93cio ) were anti-communist and had anti-socialist elements : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_gompers  gompers complained that the socialist movement had been captured by lassallean advocates of `` political party action '' rather than the `` militant economic program of marx '' . 
  [ 18 ] he warned delegates to the 1900 annual convention that when men became enthusiastic about socialism , `` they usually lost interest in their union '' . 
  [ 19 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_meany  despite meany 's support for reform policies that were sometimes called `` socialist '' , he also said that `` i very much agree with the free market system , '' [ 3 ] pointing out that `` when you do n't have anything , you have nothing to lose by these radical actions . 
  but when you become a person who has a home and has property , to some extent you become conservative . 
  '' [ 3 ] ** the cold war ** after this , the us was in the cold war , and communism and socialism , which had n't yet gotten a strong foothold , became associated with an enemy ( and one that demonstrated that real-world socialism could lead to a rather less utopic outcome than its proponents had advocated for ) . 
  the existing socialist and communist political movements rapidly-withered . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism  socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism  communism ( from latin communis -- common , universal ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and characterized by the absence of social classes , money , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and the state , as well as a social , political , and economic ideology and movement that aims to establish this social order . 
  while the more-left parties in europe still often have `` social '' in their name , they 're typically advocating for a mixed , market-oriented economy with more wealth redistribution than is presently the case , not a fundamental reworking of the economy to be based around public ownership of industry . 
  i 'm not sure if you could find a major political group that advocates doing so in the western world today . 
  i know a lot of people were complaining about syriza in greece , but from what little i see of their policies , if they 're the extreme left , the left is n't all that radically-different from the status quo . 
  sure , hitler and churchill could agree on a separate peace , but my point is that that places the united kingdom in an untenable long-term position . 
  the uk 's strength relied on that they were acting in union with other powers opposed to nazi germany ; if the uk made a separate peace , hitler can concentrate on the ussr , now having supplies coming in from overseas . 
  let 's say that the ussr issue gets resolved , one way or another . 
  either stalin wins and takes europe or hitler wins and takes the useful bits of the ussr . 
  in either case , there 's now an empire right across the water that 's a lot more powerful and which has been very enthusiastic about gobbling up countries , and which has more aircraft and ship building capacity . 
  your sloth facts are wrong :  the sloth can tolerate the largest change in body temperature of any mammal , from -92 to 74 fahrenheit !, 
  http://www.aviary.org/animals/two-toed-sloth  the two-toed sloth has the lower and most variable body temperature of any mammal , due in part to the fact that sloths ca n't shiver to keep warm . 
  depending on the weather , a sloth 's temperature can range from 74 - 92 degrees f. that 's 74 degrees fahrenheit to * positive * 92 degrees fahrenheit . 
   malthusian ideas are still completely idiotic . 
  [ malthus pointed out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_robert_malthus ) that food production is bounded by land , and that an unrestricted population grows until bounded by food . 
  i strongly disagree that this is an idiotic point . 
  if you think that it 's idiotic , it must be the case that it is * so * patently clear that one of the two following points are clear that anyone who does n't agree must be an outright idiot : * we can infinitely increase food yields via technology , no matter how much population grows . 
  [ there are some physical bounds here , and i think that even in the best case , we become much-more-vulnerable to any disruption ; i certainly do n't feel that one must be an idiot to disagree with the above statement . ], 
  * population , independently of food supply , must become bounded before the limits placed by food are reached . 
  [ we 've seen many times where population * does * increase to be bounded by food supply ; this is a norm in nature for most species . 
  even if , say , condoms are a factor in short-term discouraging population growth , if * choosing * not to have children due to the presence of condoms is the dominant selection factor in determining whether offspring show up , it seems like there is immense evolutionary pressure do have a predisposition to dislike use of condoms , for example . 
  this does n't just have to be * human * evolution , either : memes that discourage use of contraception , like the catholic church 's prohibition , become symbiotic with humans . ], 
  i have a hard time believing that either of the two above points are true , much less that they are so unquestionably true that only an idiot would disbelieve them . 
  i assume that it also means that if there 's overall sentiment against settling african immigrants in europe , that member nations will now oppose permitting immigrants in in the european parliament rather than ( `` fine , as long as you go do it elsewhere '' ) . 
  so really , it comes down to whether europe wants to accept them and has a not-in-my-backyard dispute or whether europe does n't want to accept them . 
   an invasion of britain was essentially impossible so for britain the war would probably end in some kind of peace treaty . 
  the uk spent hundreds of years trying to avoid letting an empire take over europe so that it would n't be in the position of having a unified mainland clobbering it . 
  it could not have held out indefinitely militarily if isolated ; the channel is a valuable barrier , but not * that * valuable , particularly in a world with aircraft . 
  the uk did have the ability to blockade europe ( which it did both [ during world war i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blockade_of_germany ) and again [ during world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blockade_of_germany_%281939%e2%80%9345%29 ) ) . 
  this is a powerful weapon , but whoever runs the continent itself gets to determine the allocation of what food exists , which means not merely that europe was slowly being starved to death , but that the german military was n't likely to be the worst-off :  a joint british -- french staff paper on strategic policy issued in april 1939 recognised that , in the first phase of any war with germany , economic warfare was likely to be the allies only effective offensive weapon . [ 6 ] ... 
  even in peace , europe was unable to feed itself . 
  [ snip ]  life was particularly harsh in poland . 
  cholera broke out in concentration camps , and mass public executions added to the estimated 3 million poles already killed during the invasion . 
  thousands had already died of cold and from starvation during the first winter of the war and with its sugar beet , rye and wheat systematically stripped away , and with few farmers left on the land , conditions quickly grew worse . 
  norway , with extensive mountainous areas relied on imports for half its food and all its coal ; shortages and hunger quickly effected belgium which , despite being densely populated and producing only half its needs , was still subjected to the widespread confiscation of food . 
    france , normally able to feed itself , now had an extra 5 million refugees from other countries to care for . 
  [ 58 ] when the germans stripped the farms of half a million horses and mules for their army , causing a large drop in agricultural productivity , they also took 11 % of remaining food stocks , a million tons . 
  the germans held 1,500,000 french prisoners of war as hostages , feeding them on bread and soup so thin that grass was added to bulk it up , and most items were now heavily rationed , with a worker entitled to a daily diet of only 1,200 calories ; many people rode bicycles into the countryside during the weekend to scavenge for food . 
  german soldiers got double rations , but this was still only a modest daily diet , similar to that served to inmates in american prisons . 
    the british blockade of the mediterranean immediately cut italy off from 80 % of its imports . 
  essential items such as pasta , flour and rice were severely rationed , leading to riots , and any farmer withholding his crops from compulsory storage could be imprisoned for a year . 
  [ snip ]  even in the normally plentiful balkan region there were now food shortages caused by an extremely hard winter in the east and flooding of the lower danube which devastated the agricultural plains and prevented the planting of crops . 
  [ snip ]  as 1940 drew to a close , the situation for many of europe 's 525 million people was dire . 
  with the food supply reduced by 15 % by the blockade and another 15 % by poor harvests , starvation and diseases such as influenza , pneumonia , tuberculosis , typhus and cholera were a threat . 
  [ snip ]  hoover said that his information indicated that the belgian ration was already down to 960 calories -- less than half the amount necessary to sustain life -- and that many children were already so weak they could no longer attend school ... 
  i assume that blockade would have continued . 
  in any event , for a while , germany could defer starvation herself by starving the people in the countries that she occupied and confiscating their food ( though obviously , this would result in a rather grim depopulation of europe ) , but i 'm not sure how long this could have been sustained . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunger_plan  a meeting on 2 may 1941 between the permanent secretaries responsible for logistical planning for the invasion of the soviet union , as well as other high-ranking nsdap functionaries , state officials and military officers , included in its conclusions :   1 ) the war can only be continued if the entire wehrmacht is fed from russia in the third year of the war . 
      2 ) if we take what we need out of the country , there can be no doubt that tens of millions of people will die of starvation . 
  [ 5 ]   the minutes of the meeting exemplify german planning for the occupation of the soviet union . 
  they present a deliberate decision on the life or death of vast parts of the local population as a logical , inevitable development . 
  [ 6 ] three weeks later , on 23 may 1941 , economic policy guidelines for the coming invasion appeared that had been produced by hans-joachim rieckes agricultural section of the economic staff east , which had direct responsibility for the economic and agricultural exploitation of the soon-to-be occupied soviet territories :    many tens of millions of people in this country will become superfluous and will die or must emigrate to siberia . 
  attempts to rescue the population there from death through starvation by obtaining surpluses from the black earth zone [ ... ] prevent the possibility of germany holding out till the end of the war . 
  [ 7 ]   the perceived grain surpluses of ukraine figured particularly prominently in the vision of a `` self-sufficient '' germany . 
  yet ukraine did not produce enough grain for export to solve germany 's problems . 
  [ 8 ] scooping off the agricultural surplus in ukraine for the purpose of feeding the reich called for :    the annihilation of what the german r\u00e9gime perceived as a superfluous population ( jews , the population of ukrainian large cities such as kiev which did not receive any supplies at all ) [ 9 ]     the extreme reduction of the rations allocated to ukrainians in the remaining cities     a reduction in the foodstuffs consumed by the farming population [ 10 ]   in the discussion of the plan , backe noted a `` surplus population '' in russia of about 20 to 30 million . 
  if that population was cut off from food , that food could be used to feed both the invading german army and the german population itself . 
  industrialization had created a large urban society in the soviet union . 
  the backe plan envisioned that this population , numbering many millions , would be cut off from their food supply , thus freeing up the food produced in the soviet union , now at germany 's disposal , to sustain germans . 
  as a result , great suffering among the native soviet population was envisaged , with tens of millions of deaths expected within the first year of the german occupation . 
  starvation was to be an integral part of the german army 's campaign . 
  planning for starvation preceded the invasion and became in fact an essential condition of it ; the german planners believed that the assault on the soviet union could not succeed without it . 
  [ 11 ]   the hunger plan caused the deaths of millions of citizens in the german-occupied territories of the soviet union . 
  the historian timothy snyder estimates : `` 4.2 million soviet citizens ( largely russians , belarusians , and ukrainians ) [ were ] starved by the german occupiers in 1941-1944 . '' [ 12 ] among the victims were many jews , whom the nazis had forced into ghettos , and soviet prisoners of war , whose movement was most easily controlled by the germans and thus easily cut off from food supplies . 
  [ 13 ] jews , for example , were prohibited from purchasing eggs , butter , milk , meat or fruit . 
  [ 14 ] the so-called `` rations '' for jews in minsk and other cities within the control of army group center were no more than 420 calories ( 1,800 kj ) per day . 
  tens of thousands of jews died of hunger and hunger-related causes over the winter of 1941-1942 . 
  [ 15 ] [ snip ]  by mid-1941 , the german minority in poland was receiving 2,613 calories ( 10,930 kj ) per day , while poles received 699 calories ( 2,920 kj ) and jews in the ghetto 184 calories ( 770 kj ) . 
  [ 22 ] the jewish ration fulfilled a mere 7.5 per cent of their daily needs ; polish rations only 26 per cent . 
  only the rations allocated to germans fulfilled the full needs of their daily caloric intake . 
  [ 23 ] without the us shipping food to the ussr , the ussr would have had 1.75 million tons of food less than it did ; i think that a larger risk would have been not the uk not being able to invade , but rather the ussr folding and then britain getting the undivided attention of the axis . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/night_wolves#relationship_with_the_kremlin  they are funded by the kremlin , receiving `` several hundred million rubles a year '' according to a report in 2013 .

  * historical political ties ( probably partly due to the above ) * the german language is still spoken to some degree .
