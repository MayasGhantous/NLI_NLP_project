  assuming that there 's correlation between people trashing one place and them trashing another , though , it 's nobody wanting to jail them that i 'd expect would result in the ongoing problem . 
  instead of banning them from entering the country , why not have them jailed ? 
  banning them does n't seem like much of a deterrent . 
  not all riots in the united states are done by black people , if that 's what you mean . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_incidents_of_civil_unrest_in_the_united_states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:white_american_riots_in_the_united_states dunno if we 've ever had east asians rioting in the us , though ... 
   they actually got more than they asked for prior to the invasion . 
  meaningless , because the ussr demanded control of finland 's important forts and fortifications , which would have let the ussr roll in easily without finland having any defense ; other areas that had to submit to similar constraints like estonia were absorbed into the ussr . 
  i was going to say that you were exaggerating , but seriously , i looked up the first guy ...  according to ** peter iiskola ** , a former finnish district court judge and journalist , it is the first time such a letter has been sent out . 
  `` it is extraordinary and is clearly intended to make people feel there is a russian threat and that ` pre-mobilization ' steps must be taken , '' he says . 
  [ googles iiskola ] http://www.geopolitika.rs/index.php/en/english-home/248-eng/english-content/sample-english-subcategory/774-peter-iiskola  the wall street and other bankers that use obama as a puppet . 
  obama has managed to lure the inexperienced eu-commission to its war plans . 
  they use the ikrainan junta and poroshenko oligarks , because they are bought with money . 
  war and repression is also a business !, 
  [ snip ]  because eu just follows the orders of usa and nato , which are both controlled by wall street and other bankers . 
  [ snip ]  german politicians seem never to learn !, 
  the last clever one was bismarck soon almost 150 years ago , [ snip ]  eu is nowadays an organization with complete disoriented goals : to become bigger and larger just against all logic and the wish of people to have a supranational power in europe . 
  the lack of democracy -- the so called democracy deficit -- is so obvious in the eu institutions that it is now better to tear down s mch as possible of eu , instead of trying just to repair it . 
  eh , i do n't know . 
  it 's not clear that manning 's releases actually did all that much public damage , and realistically ... any intelligence agency that wanted that information was going to get it , given how minimally-compartmentalized it was . 
  i 'm definitely less-sympathetic to manning than to the other two there ( snowden , in particular , strikes me as the sort of person that i wish we had a great many more of in the united states , rather than fewer ) , but i do n't know if manning 's actions really warranted a life sentence ( nor * was * manning given a life sentence , for what that 's worth ) . 
  `` the government will never abuse this information , now or in the future . '', 
  snowden would probably have gotten along just fine with the founding fathers . 
  it 's more-than-a-little disappointing that we do n't have statues in the us for him . 
  i do n't think that snowden was at any real risk of assassination , despite [ some rather alarmingly-casual wistfulness about the idea from high-ranking cia and nsa officials ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/edward-snowden-kill-list-joke-us-intelligence-chiefs ) . 
  winding up a cell for the rest of his life ( or , though i do n't think that the politics would have supported it , theoretically being executed after a trial , yes ) . 
   us military propaganda ( a ) while the united states has certainly engaged in propaganda ( particularly in the world war ii era ) , one would really expect the state department , not the military , to be engaged in any sort of propaganda . 
  ( b ) this is an internal , unfinished army publication . 
  there would be far better and more-visible routes if the goal were to sway political opinions . 
  the people at that gathering appear to have a surprisingly-high average age . 
  not the young crowd that i 'd kind of expect to see at political rallies . 
   imagine if a us president was revealed to be doing what the bnd did under merkel . 
  handing off information to foreign intelligence agencies ? 
  you 're probably going to be rather disappointed , then , if you go read cia memoirs ; information-swapping does happen . 
  i still want to know about * industrial * espionage . 
  i 'd be irked if there were concrete , specific examples of state-sponsored industrial espionage happening on any side . 
  not thrilled about mass monitoring , either ( or if we 're going to do that , at the very least , we 'd need to live in a world where there are a whole lot of restraints on how that information is used and how long it is retained , with more-trustworthy oversight and with serious penalties for misuse -- think of the way soldiers face court-martials if they abuse the powerful tools and authority that they 're granted ) . 
  small-scope , national security spying is one thing . 
  `` i 'm going to peek at you * because i can * '' is another . 
  of course , technical fixes are better than legal , and maybe not being able to trust countries will trigger the roll-out of better technical solutions , like ubiquitous encryption and double-checking ssl keys for changes . 
  however , at the end of the day , if you 're a state actor , you have resources sufficient that it 's really hard to shut down abuses via even technical approaches . 
   yeah but american ~ ~ trains ~ ~ passenger trains are expected to be shitty !, 
  that 's ... a really weird piece of lawn sculpture . 
  all the other branding i see of nato seems to make it look modern , very simple , and unblemished . 
  flat colors , and colors associated with cleanliness -- white and blue . 
  but that thing on the lawn at nato hq in brussels is ... what , grungy oxidized metal , with a ton of visible pieces ? 
  it 's almost the dead opposite of what i 'd expect from nato . 
  it does n't even look like the nato logo , with the rings not matching the size rings in the nato logo , the rings not being centered on the cross , visible i-beams , loss of the vertical symmetry in the nato logo , the ring projecting forward from the logo , and the huge gap in the cross to fit the i-beams in . 
  that is probably the most-incoherent bbc story i 've ever read . 
  darned if i can figure out this `` blonde '' business . 
  the low-quality , artifact-filled photographs really do n't help . 
   ( most strikes here are by the public sector because they can never be fired ) you 'd think that that would tend to encourage privatization . 
  a does n't understand b should be compatible with b not understanding a. 
  though in this case , i have a hard time believing that it was anything other than the russian ambassador wanting to stir up a bit of friction . 
  or the [ russian navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_navy#/media/file:naval_ensign_of_russia.svg ) . 
  baltimore had ... what , two businesses looted , and one also burned , no deaths , no robberies ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_england_riots the london riots were significantly-more serious than that . 
   i just feel really weirded out when you use a word like angst in english when you already have a word like fear which is literally the same word in english uh ... english is full of that . 
  it 's very common to have multiple words from different source languages that have slightly-different connotations ( or even are pretty much identical ) . 
  we had thirteen states in the us that were founding members , and we did n't distribute washington , dc across all of them . 
   a subset of gay guys is accused of appropriating black female culture ... o_o i do n't even ... < thinks  well , i think that they make a compelling argument . 
  it 's clearly invasive of culture to `` appropriate '' culture associated with a gender or race . 
  one gender and race developed that culture , and it is clearly theirs and theirs alone , and we must respect that . 
  clearly , we must put an end to women `` appropriating '' male culture . 
  off with the pants and on with the skirts !, 
  back to the kitchen !, 
  we 'll have no more of this culture appropriation nonsense !, 
  we must not falter in the struggle for diversity and tolerance !, 
  now , if you 'll excuse me , i 'm off to speak to mississippi and alabama and south africa about blacks `` appropriating '' white culture !, 
  we know who the big house was built for !, 
  vive progress !, 
  onwards respect for culture and individuality !, 
  there was the [ 2006 thai coup d'\u00e9tat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_thai_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) : the leader leaves the country , and political opponents use the opportunity to stage a coup . 
  does denmark normally make domestic policy decisions via direct democracy , or via representatives ? 
  well , i suppose that it would be possible to mount a vast state-driven social campaign against drinking , of the sort that the us has been doing against smoking for some decades now . 
  i 'm not saying that that would be something that people want to do , but it 's not as if the state has * no * options for influencing alcoholism . 
   it 's been ` year of the linux desktop ' for something like a decade now . 
  i 've been using linux on my desktop for over a decade and a half now . 
  the problem is that these are n't explicit about what was being taken ( and some of these are just * suspected * ; it 's not that someone was actually caught with their hand in the cookie jar ) . 
  going down the list :  between 1987 and 1989 , ibm and texas instruments were thought to have been targeted by french spies with the intention of helping france 's groupe bull . 
  [ 40 ] in 1993 , us aerospace companies were also thought to have been targeted by french interests . 
  [ 41 ] during the early 1990s , france was described as one of the most aggressive pursuers of espionage to garner foreign industrial and technological secrets . 
  [ 40 ] france accused the u.s. of attempting to sabotage its high tech industrial base . 
  [ 40 ] the government of france has been alleged to have conducted ongoing industrial espionage against american aerodynamics and satellite companies . 
  [ 42 ] first , these are allegations , and second , they 're very high-level . 
   in 1993 , car manufacturer opel , the german division of general motors , accused volkswagen of industrial espionage after opel 's chief of production , jose ignacio lopez , and seven other executives moved to volkswagen . 
  [ 14 ] volkswagen subsequently threatened to sue for defamation , resulting in a four-year legal battle . 
  [ 14 ] the case , which was finally settled in 1997 , resulted in one of the largest settlements in the history of industrial espionage , with volkswagen agreeing to pay general motors $ 100 million and to buy at least $ 1 billion of car parts from the company over 7 years , although it did not explicitly apologize for lopez 's behavior . 
  again , customer lists ? 
  supplier information ? 
  knowledge of bids on ongoing material ? 
  what ? 
  and this was n't done by a state , but rather companies ; what 's unexpected to me would be the involvement of at least us * state * organizations in * industrial * espionage . 
   in april 2009 the us based hospitality company starwood accused its rival hilton of a `` massive '' case of industrial espionage . 
  after being purchased by private equity group blackstone , hilton employed 10 managers and executives from starwood . 
  under intense pressure to improve profits , [ clarification needed ] starwood accused hilton of stealing corporate information relating to its luxury brand concepts , used in setting up its own denizen hotels . 
  specifically , former head of its luxury brands group , ron klein , was accused of downloading `` truckloads of documents '' from a laptop to his personal email account . 
  `` corporate information relating to its luxury brand concepts . '', 
  okay , that 's a little better ( though not state-driven ) , and at least one * guesses * that this is related to upcoming brands or procedures for determining brand popularity . 
   ghostnet was a `` vast surveillance system '' reported by canadian researchers based at the university of toronto in march 2009 . 
  using targeted emails it compromised thousands of computers in governmental organisations , enabling attackers to scan for information and transfer this back to a `` digital storage facility in china '' .
