   the americans are incredibly productive though . 
  let 's say that we have two countries . 
  labor costs in one country are $ 1/hour . 
  labor costs in the other country are $ 10/hour . 
  which country is n't going to have any low-productivity jobs ? 
   indeed , as shown above , russia minus all of its income from oil , gas , timber , and minerals is basically a much larger version of romania . 
  romania , of course , is n't exactly an economic miracle , but it is a democratic member in good standing of the european union and nato . 
  well , that seems ... kind of inapplicable . 
  that 's actually really-impressive . 
  i 've been kind of annoyed that it 's so much easier to pass a law than to remove an old one that they tend to accumulate , but someone 's actually willing to go out and do so . 
   but the law also states that a closed area is any place with 4 hard walls . 
  so now they just build `` aquariums '' for smokers with transparent pvc walls that are rolled up in sunny weather and rolled down when it 's cold . 
  does n't that wind up looking really gross after a while ? 
  i mean , if it 's constantly got smoke passing by it , it 'll get stained ... 
  in the 1800s , europe hooked china on opium , and sold gobs of it in china .

  [ it 's a lot , but i do n't believe that it 's most ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/who-russians-smoke-the-most/422117.html ) . 
   with 44 million adults , or almost 40 percent of the population , russia has the biggest percentage of adult smokers ... 
  most men do , according to the statistics given :  more than 60 percent of russian men and almost 22 percent of russian women smoke , according to the who 's global adult tobacco survey . 
  it 's just not the same .

   make it a catalogue whose individual parts can be agreed upon or postponed/scrapped . 
  that does n't work in the case where you have an element that favors one side that was accepted in exchange for an element that favors the other side . 
  i 'm pretty sure that i have to scroll past more comments on / r/europe talking about / r/european than i would if i were reading / r/european . 
  i may have to switch to reading the latter sub just to stop hearing about that sub so much . 
   the us may be unwilling to support the uk with more than words on an annexation of part of the uk ? 
  i do n't know about that . 
  honestly , i 'm not sure that it would have made a difference , if you 're treating that as the only relevant factor . 
  there were [ on the order of 100 british defenders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_invasion_of_the_falkland_islands ) in 1982 against 600 argentinian invaders . 
  there are [ about 13 times that many british soldiers now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_falkland_islands ) , but it also took a month for britain to put together a military response . 
  it seems unreasonable to expect that argentina could n't put together at least 13 times as many soldiers as need be for a second go or for those soldiers to hold out for a month . 
  that 's not to say that argentina could necessarily hold the thing or that it would be a good idea , but i 'm not convinced that the base is the magic factor . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guano_islands_act  whenever any citizen of the united states discovers a deposit of guano on any island , rock , or key , ** not within the lawful jurisdiction of any other government , and not occupied by the citizens of any other government ** , and takes peaceable possession thereof , and occupies the same , such island , rock , or key may , at the discretion of the president , be considered as appertaining to the united states .

   you 're not worried about the impact of the bat , the finns disabled russian tanks in the winter war by jamming logs into their tracks . 
  http://www.neatorama.com/2010/07/05/landlocked-navies-of-the-world/  in the 13th century , the mongolian navy was the largest in the world . 
  it lost that fleet during two failed invasions of japan . 
  since that time , it shrank down to nothing . 
  in the 1930s , the mongolian navy was reborn under the auspices of the soviet union . 
  it received one boat , the sukhbaatar , to patrol lake hovsgal . 
  the soviet-made vessel was dragged overland to that lake . 
  the ship was named after [ damdiny sukhbaatar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/damdin_s%c3%bckhbaatar ) , the mongolian leader who drove china out in the 1920s . 
  it , and its successor , the sukhbaatar ii , eventually sank . 
    but as of 2001 , one vessel remains -- the tugboat sukhbaatar iii . 
  it 's manned by seven men , only one of whom knows how to swim . 
  the ship is homeported at khatgal , and it continues its regular patrols of lake hovsgal . 
  but due to financial constraints , the mongolian government privatized its navy in 1997 . 
  so now the sukhbaatar iii supplements its income by hauling freight across the lake . 
  think hard about this . 
  did you * really * want italy to fight bitterly to the last man ? 
  even * aside * from whether it would have been a suicidal idea for italy ? 
  gives them a base halfway around the world ; the distance itself makes it valuable . 
  also , the british probably could do without setting a precedent of letting every country that feels like it annex part of their country . 
  thatcher had the guarantee of the us lending the uk an assault ship if a uk carrier were sunk . 
  she 'd already provided for at least one alternate plan b. . . 
  in other news , zombie michael jackson , margaret thatcher , and ronald reagan have been rolled out of cold storage and are being defrosted . 
  the term used to have more of a connotation of simply being intended to influence , not being false .

   plenty of pretty girls there . 
  give a man a camera , and you are unlikely to wind up with a sample set representative of the whole population ; seems like selection bias is likely . 
  i got the impression that / u/maerun thought that the finns were attacking the submarine ; my point was that when this is done , it 's not intended to be an attack . 
  the cuban missile crisis references were because i could n't find other pages online referring to dropping them on a hostile submarine . 
   the u.s. gets lucrative military contracts the us is n't the primary source of arms for europe , though ; this is n't 1943 any more . 
  it does n't look like * any * of the ships that [ finland 's navy uses are made by the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_finnish_navy_ships ) : they 're either finnish or italian in origin . 
  the [ equipment of the finnish army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equipment_of_the_finnish_army ) page has a * few * bits of us-originating equipment -- a small atv , the browning heavy machine gun , and apparently consideration ( and rejection ) of some black hawks . 
  it looks like sweden , germany , the czech republic , the netherlands , poland , canada , japan , south africa , and finland all play a role . 
  there [ are a significant number of military aircraft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_military_aircraft_of_finland#2000-today ) , though my guess is that the general shift in europe to european-built military aircraft will tend to cancel this out for , say , fighter craft . 
  i 'd think that russia poking europe is generally-disadvantageous to us interests , since it makes it more politically-awkward to refocus the us military on east asia , which is what the us * is * more concerned about . 
  it 's probably good if you 're part of the europe-based us military ( since your relevance in a theater where not a lot has happened recently goes up ) , but i do n't think that the us does terribly well off of the whole affair . 
  maybe in terms of social influence ? 
  i mean , it makes the awkward iraq fiasco look better when russia is off doing things that are more-objectionable . 
   ... the older i get the less i believe in people or groups of people masterminding and/or conducting intricate plans . 
  [ hanlon 's razor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanlon%27s_razor ) :  never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . 
  when the people of a country feel under attack , the approval rating of national leaders tends to * soar * -- the idea is that everyone has to pull together to address the current national emergency . 
  george w. bush 's approval rating * skyrocketed * to the highest-ever recorded level for a us president after we were attacked on 9/11 . 
  there was no brilliant strategy on his part ... hell , he did n't do anything at the point that his approval rating had increased , but the effect overwhelmed essentially all other inputs into public approval . 
  or [ goering ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/hermann_g%c3%b6ring ) 's famous quote :  g\u00f6ring : oh , that is all well and good , but , voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders . 
  that is easy . 
  all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger . 
  it works the same way in any country . 
  north korea 's leadership has kept the country in a perpetual state of emergency , which is probably the only way that leadership has managed to hang onto power . 
  i also expect that the cold war worked rather well for the leadership on both sides once it was well under way : the communists did n't have to worry about workers getting twitchy about a lack of nylons , and the capitalists did n't have to worry about leftist revolution . 
  if putin * is * worried about retaining russia 's cohesion , a high-profile conflict and sense of the nation being under threat might be just what the doctor ordered . 
   ... we do n't even have our own reconnaissance aircraft to detect submarines . 
  you have a very new anti-submarine warfare helicopter , replacing the [ westland lynx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westland_lynx ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agustawestland_aw159_wildcat  on 29 august 2014 , the wildcat ah1 formally entered operational service with the army air corps . 
  [ 2 ] on 23 march 2015 , the royal navy 's first wildcat hma2 began its initial operational deployment at sea onboard hms lancaster . 
  [ 25 ] as well as the [ aw101 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agustawestland_aw101 ) , which at least can be configured for asw . 
  maybe you mean fixed-wing aircraft ? 
   finns do n't mess around !, 
  this was n't an attack . 
   the finnish military fired on tuesday ** handheld ** underwater depth charges as a warning these are probably practice depth charges -- they do n't have enough explosive force to damage a submarine . 
  i do n't see a good reference online on them ( kind of an obscure bit of military hardware ) , but : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasili_arkhipov  on 27 october 1962 , during the cuban missile crisis , a group of eleven united states navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier uss randolph located the diesel-powered nuclear-armed soviet foxtrot-class submarine b-59 near cuba .
