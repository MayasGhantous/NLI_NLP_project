  despite being in international waters , the americans started dropping practice depth charges , explosives intended to force the submarine to come to the surface for identification ... http://www.military-quotes.com/forum/questions-cuban-missile-crisis-t75992.html  the americans hit us with something stronger than a grenade , apparently some kind of practice depth charge ... 
  also , if you do n't use anything at all and if it does n't greatly-impact your understanding of the world around you , it vanishes pretty quickly . 
  i know that our science curriculum covered some microbiology , but most of that has been lost to my memory by now , because i simply do n't use it . 
  components of a cell ? 
  could n't name many . 
  and really and honestly , how often do the relative sizes of an electron and a proton come * up * in most people 's lives ? 
  unless you 're reading some related science articles , it amounts to some trivia to have memorized . 
  i do n't think that their primary focus is anthropology . 
  i do agree with the `` look , guys , you got ta treat knowledge of north america on par with europe if you 're going to compare geographical/political knowledge '' , but my point was that central america * is * on our continent and i 'll bet that most people in the us do n't know the leaders there . 
  we had to learn the types of greek columns too !, 
  this may be an international thing ... 
  also , relativity was definitely taught more than ten years ago . 
   in a new bmw i can easily drive 170 km/h , and be just as safe as in a twingo at 110 km/h . 
  http://www.bta.lt/eng/company/news/?18753  the highest accident rate is observed among drivers of bmw , immediately followed by alfa romeo , subaru and saab model cars ... statistics of bta car accidents shows that in 2010 as many as 7 out of 100 drivers of bmw car models were liable for car accidents . 
  nobody ever wakes up in the morning and leaves their house thinking `` today is going to be the day that i get into a fatal accident '' -- if they did , they would n't leave . 
  people do n't do a good job of understanding how safe their own driving is . 
  it 's not just risk ( and certainly things like constraints on reaction time are more-limited ) , but also what happens when there is a collision -- it 's a lot more kinetic energy that has to go somewhere . 
  `` fuck you , america !, 
  the allies won world war ii !, 
  so there ! '', 
  `` those geocentric people had it right . 
  they just understand the concept of relativistic frames of reference ! '', 
  i do n't think that most people from the us could name central american or south american leadership either . 
  i do n't think i could name a single ( current , i could do some past ones ) central or south american leader outside of castro , though i 'd probably recognize a few names if you handed them to me . 
  i certainly do know putin , though ... 
  not only could i not name the current eu leadership , i could n't describe the eu government structures . 
  and * i * spend time on / r/europe . 
  i learned history in the us . 
  our k-12 history education basically followed the following path : * humans arose in africa . 
  * then civilization in the fertile crescent . 
  * then there was the ancient greeks . 
  * and the roman empire . 
  * which turned into medieval europe , which was bad because women did n't have equal rights like today 's enlightened society and many rights that we take for granted did n't exist . 
  * then there was the protestant reformation , and the renaissance . 
  * then columbus discovered america . 
  * puritans traveled to the americas for freedom of religion . 
  * the brits tried to impose objectionable taxes , but america was n't having any of that and revolted . 
  * then the war of 1812 , which did n't really change anything . 
  * japan is forced to open to american trade . 
  * the american civil war , which was bloody and left a lot of people angry at a lot of other people for a long time . 
  * the spanish-american war and teddy roosevelt and world war i was somewhere in there . 
  * world war ii . 
  that was a big deal , but we set things aright eventually . 
  * then there was the the red scare and mccarthyism , which was bad . 
  * and the cold war , which we eventually won . 
  * and the environmental movement and various civil rights efforts . 
  history of the world , right there . 
  africa and even more so central and eastern asia do n't really get covered . 
  there were a couple spots of south america and australia somewhere , but they 're pretty much a black hole too . 
  europe mainly showed up before ~ 1700 . 
  sure , i went back and learned about them , but if you assume that my education is more-or-less representative of what other people get , it 's definitely a kinda continent-centric education . 
  you 'd think that they could find at least * one * estonian intelligence officer willing to spy on them . 
   i doubt that the four universities that teach islamic religion are among the most respected in germany , if there even was such a thing - it 's not the us . 
  i 'm not sure that i catch your meaning . 
  chernobyl ( and the far-less-severe , but domestic [ three mile island accident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_mile_island_accident ) ) helped halt new nuclear power plant construction in the us for a long time . 
  it is n't until relatively-recently that new construction started up again in the us civilian nuclear power world :  as of 2015 , there are five new reactors under construction with a gross electrical capacity of 6,218 mw , while 33 reactors have been permanently shut down . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] the united states is the world 's largest supplier of commercial nuclear power , and in 2013 generated 33 % of the world 's nuclear electricity . 
   having said that , i do n't agree with trident there was once a country called ukraine that decided that it would never need its nuclear deterrent ... 
  [ the hellenic army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_equipment_of_the_hellenic_army#main_battle_tanks ) appears to have more leopard 2 tanks ( and that 's discounting all their other types of tanks ) than the [ german army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_equipment_of_the_german_army#vehicles ) . 
  i 've seen the odd article theorizing that corruption in greek culture is a long-term reaction to being occupied by the ottomans and not wanting to hand over money to them . 
  if that 's true , i do n't think that occupying greece would actually do much good . 
    usa has a history of supporting dissenters in hostile countries . 
    yeah but russia has a history seeing ludicrously paranoid plots against it . 
  the unstoppable force meets the immovable object !, 
  * i do n't like the possibility of intelligence services , including the nsa , pulling my electronic communications off the wire . 
  * germany has historical reasons for a certain level of concern here ; the [ stasi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stasi ) is who i 'd reference if i wanted an example of an intelligence agency acting against the interests of a country 's citizens . 
  the nsa ? 
  oh , the german service . 
  the promises made to ukraine after ukraine got rid of its nukes would probably tend to instill in the casual listener more expectation of military action than that , though . 
   as a romanian , i hate putin , but , because of him the us has an interest in seeing romania and poland build up to developed countries , so , thanks putin . 
  hmm . 
  the us provides defense guarantees , but how large of a role does the us take relative to the eu in economic development in these two countries ? 
  i would have thought that germany , france , and the uk were larger factors . 
  you could use a tablet to consume content , but for getting much useful work done , i 'd really rather have a computer ... 
  people really do tend to rank highly-saturated , gamma-increased photographs more-highly . 
  it 's easy for photographers to do that , so the natural result is that the photos do n't look much like reality , at some point . 
  :-( i guess there 's always * national geographic * as a fallback for good photography ... 
  it was n't the primary cause of the shrinking population , but it did a very bad job of dealing with that , which is certainly one of its responsibilities . 
  the municipal government turned something that should have been a not-fun-but-manageable problem of keeping the city services and financial commitments in line with detroit 's shrinking revenues into insurmountable debt and an outright collapse at the end of that period . 
  yes , it 's undoubtedly more fun to govern over growth , but cities can shrink and still remain viable cities . 
  edit : also , at the end of the day , there were things that it could have done . 
  even as labor demands for the auto industry declined , detroit did n't * have * to tie itself to that . 
  the fall of detroit was n't an overnight affair , and detroit probably would have been better off doing whatever it took ( even in terms of harming the auto industry ) to diversify its economy and bring in a wider range of businesses . 
  well , put it this way : i do n't really see much of an analogy between the two places and the two sets of policies . 
   i would be pissed off if i got a canadian one . 
  all the others had tobacco . 
  i think i could have lived skipping the epic-scale expansion of an addiction ; both world war i and ii had cigarettes included in rations , terrifically-expanded smoking , led to even today the us military having a much-higher smoking rate than the general populace and [ does in quite a few people ] ( http://www.lung.org/associations/states/colorado/tobacco/ ) :  yet every year tobacco kills more americans than did world war ii -- more than aids , cocaine , heroin , alcohol , vehicular accidents , homicide and suicide combined . 
  i do n't see any real connection between the policies here and in detroit . 
  detroit suffered from : * growing during a time of little competition ( the east not being industrialized , europe trashed from war ) and then having its companies needing to adjust as the market became more competitive and as demand decreased . 
  * having heavy reliance on the fortunes of a single industry . 
  * making long-term commitments that assumed that its income would not decrease ( not specific to government ; auto companies did the same thing ) , contributing to it failing to scale down gracefully as taxes decreased . 
  * having poor leadership for decades that was both corrupt ( [ culiminating in what was some of the worst mayoral leadership the us has seen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kwame_kilpatrick ) ) and failed to take action to bring detroits budget into line with its tax revenue , instead trying to push the downsizing down the road until it became a catastrophic event . 
  * race riots ( driven in part by competition for the decreasing labor slots in the city ) , and subsequent white flight ( in turn decreasing real estate demand further , draining wealth of the remaining residents , as americans tend to tie up a lot of their wealth in their house ) . 
  what 's being talked about here is : * brits limiting subsidized healthcare to brits * denmark limiting the scope of emergency room care * finland not covering certain conditions . 
  i do n't really see any connection between the two . 
  thanks !, 
  apparently that was specific to the organization of american states . 
  a [ substantial chunk of the unemployment in the us is hidden because non-disabled people claim long-term disability , which lets them permanently remain on a benefit system without working ] ( http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/ ) . 
  they then do not contribute to unemployment statistics . 
  the us and spanish unemployment rate may not be directly-comparable ( though comparing the sum of the unemployment and long-term disability rates might be more interesting , assuming that the spanish do not dramatically-differ in their chance off becoming actually seriously disabled from people in the us ) .
