  does the eu ( that is brussels , as opposed to member governments ) even have the requisite authority granted by its members to do this ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_government  the general government , sometimes also general governorate ( german : generalgouvernement , polish : generalne gubernatorstwo , ukrainian : \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u044f ) was an occupied area of the second republic of poland that was under the colonial administration of nazi germany during world war ii , from 1939 to early 1945 . 
  the nazi government designated the territory as a separate administrative region of the third reich . 
  [ 1 ] in 1941 it comprised much of central and southern poland and of modern-day western ukraine , including the major cities of warsaw , krak\u00f3w and lviv . 
  following the german invasion of the soviet union in operation barbarossa in june 1941 , the region of eastern galicia , formerly polish territory which was invaded and annexed by the soviet union subsequent to the nazi -- soviet pact , was incorporated into the general government . 
  nazi flag , nazi insignia . 
  i do n't understand why this ca n't be referred to as `` nazi poland '' . 
  i do n't understand why germany would need to explicitly force french reforms , as the author is claiming is germany 's goal . 
  if germany 's policies work well ( and they do seem to be doing all right ) , would n't a lack of french economic competitiveness do that itself ? 
  `` a chicken in every pot ! '', 
  `` europe has high-speed rail . 
  the heck ? 
  we do n't have high-speed rail . 
  why should europe have something that we do n't ? '', 
  `` europe has high population density . 
  you have a population desert with three separated and not-terribly-compact metro areas in it . 
  rail only makes sense where ... '' `` whatever . 
  we 're building high speed rail . '', 
  california [ has both ] ( http://ballotpedia.org/history_of_initiative_and_referendum_in_california ) the initiative ( you can go out and get something you want on the ballot with enough signatures on a petition ) and the referendum ( that thing is voted on directly by the population , without representatives being involved ) . 
  using that system , we determined the following : * the typical citizen does not like higher taxes . 
  * the typical citizen likes more services . 
  we have kkk marches and neo-nazi marches . 
  < shrug  not generated much popularity for them . 
  fair enough . 
  it does seem , though , like tweaking the money allocation/voting scheme there could permit addressing the unhappy periphery as well . 
  nato put out photographs of russia 's actions in the past . 
  let 's see some photographs of your claims , russia . 
   moscow denies any involvement . 
  / r/russiadenies, 
   nimb applies to pretty much anything . 
  < shrug  auction off the location to accept refugees based on a certain amount of aid from the federal government . 
  you can find some incentive capable of equaling out disincentives . 
  not in my backyard shows up when people agree that something is a good idea overall but do n't want to be the sole ones bearing the cost for it . 
  you can typically modify such a policy so that others can bear the cost as well . 
  of course , that also means that half of all germans are opposed to taking in more refugees . 
  i 'd be interested in a map with gradations rather than ranges ( e.g. 
  choosing a color between 3.3 and 32.9 ) so that it 'd be possible to see how big that jump to estonia is . 
  even though the uk 's population might be south-loaded , though , it 's still more-northerly than most of europe . 
  the caption is :  in many nations , deaths from suicide increased after the economic crisis triggered by the banking crash in 2008 . 
  but this does n't show a delta across the crash years -- it shows an absolute rate . 
  furthermore , the less-suicidal countries on here were often countries that were hit badly -- greece , italy , spain . 
  my takeaway here is that it 's better to either be an easygoing , mediterranean nation ... or the uk , which is n't quite the country i 'd have expected to have cultural commonality with the former . 
  the north-south thing i get -- people get depressed in a dark environment . 
  but the uk so strongly bucks the trend that i wonder if it does a good job of recovering potential suicides or has a culture that is more-resistant to suicide . 
  just as a comment on reform , i have to say that the regard that turks hold attaturk in is in many ways , i think , well-deserved . 
  it is * hard * to be a reformer . 
  in , say , the united kingdom , being `` western liberal '' more-or-means continuing with the traditions that existed in place . 
  same with the united states -- it happened to grow up with more-or-less the set of economic positions and views that happened to have become widely-used in the world . 
  that 's easy to do , socially . 
  it 's * really hard * to upend a society , to say `` we have not been doing the best things , and we are going to change that now '' . 
  i support broad gun rights in the united states , yet i can tell you that there would be horror in the us at changing what the us does , and a good deal of this is from cultural tradition , that we 've deeply-accepted what is * right * . 
  the same is true of much of europe on gun rights . 
  attaturk threw out a writing system ; concerns over language change are big in europe . 
  attaturk completely changed the role of the state ; whether-or-not the government should subsidize health insurance , a comparatively-minor change , is a * bitter * fight in the us with cultural concerns . 
  even the use of metric units in the us is a clash with cultural overtones . 
  that does n't mean that reforms are always a good idea or well-chosen , but that selling a society on adopting them is a very hard task . 
   indeed , but then you have erdogan campaigning to remove the t.c. 
  from our country 's name ( t.c. 
  = turkish republic ) . 
  he would prefer to call it the islamic state of turkey . 
  i do not claim that that does n't have important symbolic value , but would turkey no longer be a republic ? 
   mandatory religion classes are being enforced more under akp than before . 
  according to the article , mandatory religion classes existed during attaturk 's time too -- however , the educational system * as a whole * had been secularized ; this was the important change . 
   akp is entirely and unashamadley anti-secular . 
  they merge politics and religion in every single speech they make and law that they pass . 
  listen to anything erdogan says and it will involve some sort of islamic undertone or a justification taken straight from the koran . 
  i am not saying that akp is not a religious party , but does not turkey have a secular law system ? 
  that was the change that attaturk made , and i do not think that the akp has reversed that . 
   trust me , if it were up to him , he would change it back . 
  look at the ottoman palace he built for himself with public funds , he thinks of himself as a sultan of the ottoman empire 2.0 : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30061107 perhaps . 
  but even if erdogan * deeply * really wants to do this personally , and taking culturally/religiously-conservative stances is not merely to appeal to the public -- something with a rich history in my own country -- the question is whether he * has * . 
   that 's a law set in stone , but akp is very patriarchical towards womens ' role in society and still supports them wearing headscarves everywhere ( which is a terrible kind of oppression imo ) . 
  from reading the wikipedia article , it seems that attaturk 's wife typically wore a ( western-style ) head covering in public ( though there are a picture or two otherwise ) . 
   more domestic ownership by a wealthy elite with less nationalisation and less regulation to protect the working-class . 
  not good stuff . 
  look up his corruption scandal , he stole millions in public funds for himself and his son . 
  the recorded and authenticated tapes are on youtube . 
  courts approved them as real . 
  he would be in prison for life if he were n't immune via his spot as prime minister followed by presidency . 
  again , i 'm not saying that erdogan is not personally-corrupt or claiming that he is a good leader . 
  i 'm just saying that i do not think that he has torn down what attaturk built . 
  i am not very familiar with turkey today , or her current political parties , but while i know that attaturk is held in great regard as a profound lawgiver and a lot of people on / r/europe do n't much like the direction the akp has taken , i do n't think that he would describe it as a second ottoman empire . 
  i 'm looking at [ wikipedia 's list of the reforms he made ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mustafa_kemal_atat%c3%bcrk#domestic_policies ) to transition from the ottoman empire to turkey-under-attaturk . 
  none of these have really been reversed : * brought turkey to representative democracy , which is still the structure that turkey uses . 
  * brought a modern educational system aimed at having a literate , skilled populace . 
  * moved ( i * never * understood the cultural importance of this , but as far as i can tell , it invariably happens when various societies around the world brought in western social structures , educational systems , and so forth ) to the same sort of clothing worn in western europe . 
  * ended purely-religious schools . 
  * islamic law and secular law separated , and islamic law 's jurisdiction restricted to secular affairs . 
  * introduced gender equality in many areas , including educating women beyond homemaking . 
  * replacement of arabic script with latin script . 
  * granting of women 's suffrage . 
  * a shift towards diplomatic methods in international affairs rather than military . 
  * decentralize and industrialize the economy and ensure more domestic ownership of capital goods . 
  i am not really enthusiastic about what little i read of the akp 's changes , but they really do not seem to make any significant dent in the above changes . 
   what no one knew at the time was that nature only produces cis-molycules you 're comparing two different substances . 
  i 'm saying that genetically-engineering corn can produce the same genetic code that mutations and artificial selection can . 
  if you want to , say , only eat food grown from clones so that you have a fixed genetic code ( which is not as impossible as it sounds ; for example , [ hass avocados ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hass_avocado ) all come from a single tree ) ) , then at least that would be consistent . 
  but complaining about genetic engineering is n't complaining about any single output : it 's complaining about the * process * by which one arrives at a wide set set of different outputs , where nobody is arguing ( and i assume that you are not either ) that selection can not produce the same genetic sequences . 
   the tactics here are laughable how so ? 
  it means that tanks can be moved easily .
