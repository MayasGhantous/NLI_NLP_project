  but tanks have to deal with aircraft and anti-tank missiles . 
  what i just said is not what anyone said about trans-fats . 
  genetically-engineered plants are n't different in some precise way . 
  genetic engineering is just a way to more-rapidly induce the same changes that artificial and natural selection can also induce . 
  saying that plants produced via genetic engineering are dangerous is like saying that plants produced by artificial selection are dangerous . 
   it was developed by the same people who developed the honeycrisp apple , on its royalties . 
  i realize that this is n't your point , but i really dislike honeycrisp -- it 's too sweet . 
  [ jazz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jazz_%28apple%29 ) is a lot better , imho . 
  i 'm not sure how new zealand enforces licensing , though , if it 's over 20 years old ( out of patent protection ... ) . 
  maybe it 's just the trademark on the name . 
  it will increase the overhead of food production , and thus tend to economically-weaken the continent , since it makes it a bit more expensive for everyone to operate . 
  i think that the idea of blocking gmos ( but permitting identical genetic changes to be less-efficiently produced via natural or artificial selection ) is pretty silly -- but ultimately , that 's up to europe . 
  there are also a number of ongoing conflicts , and that growth has to happen despite them . 
  if we [ go check wikipedia 's list of ongoing armed conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts ) , we 've got : * [ boko haram insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boko_haram_insurgency ) * [ war in somalia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_somalia_%282009%e2%80%93present%29 ) * [ war in darfur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_darfur ) * [ libyan crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libyan_crisis_%282011%e2%80%93present%29 ) * [ central african republic conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_african_republic_conflict_%282012%e2%80%93present%29 ) * [ south sudanese civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_sudanese_civil_war ) * [ katanga insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katanga_insurgency ) * [ insurgency in ogaden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insurgency_in_ogaden ) * [ allied democratic forces insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_democratic_forces_insurgency ) * [ kivu conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kivu_conflict ) * [ sudanese nomadic conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudanese_nomadic_conflicts ) * [ sinai insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinai_insurgency ) * [ sudanese conflict in south kordofan and blue nile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudanese_conflict_in_south_kordofan_and_blue_nile ) * [ northern mali conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_mali_conflict ) * [ cabinda war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabinda_war ) * [ lord 's resistance army insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%27s_resistance_army_insurgency ) * [ insurgency in the maghreb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insurgency_in_the_maghreb_%282002%e2%80%93present%29 ) * [ conflict in the niger delta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conflict_in_the_niger_delta ) * [ renamo insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renamo_insurgency_%282013%e2%80%9314%29 ), 
  i 'd be enthusiastic about ending us agricultural subsidies . 
  if the cheap price depends on subsidies , then why would cotton become expensive for the rest of the world ? 
  define what `` culturally european '' means first . 
  i do n't dispute that ukraine would be better-off without corruption . 
  but the reason that corruption is a big deal for , membership in the eu is because economies are being joined ; financial guarantees are being made on , for example , bank deposits predicated upon the financial stability of the member states . 
  nato is n't really harmed in the same way by corruption in member states . 
   now , if nato expands to russia 's border , i see no way at all russia could have that happen and in any way remain a military power . 
  they would be strategically defeated before any potential future war ever even began . 
  * it would be irrelevant in a nuclear war . 
  * russia has n't had a chance in a conventional war against nato for a long time . 
   arguably , europe might want a buffer state as well . 
  this really has nothing to do with your point ( that any arguments about `` russia wants '' should also be able to pass the `` eu wants '' test , and that russia in no way is unique to having interest in ukraine ) , but a country that you 're in a military alliance with does n't really qualify as a [ buffer state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buffer_state ) :  a buffer state is a country lying between two rival or potentially hostile greater powers . 
  its existence can sometimes be thought to prevent conflict between them . 
  a buffer state is sometimes a mutually agreed upon area lying between two greater powers , which is demilitarized in the sense of not hosting the military of either power ( though it will usually have its own military forces ) . 
  the invasion of a buffer state by one of the powers surrounding it will often result in war between the powers . 
    buffer states , when authentically independent , typically pursue a neutralist foreign policy , which distinguishes them from satellite states . 
  but ... anyway ...  as a neutral state , ukraine 's sovereignty exists only for so long as ukraine can defend themselves and their territory . 
  if they 're unable to do this , their sovereignty is null and void . 
  < shrug  i do n't quite think that that was the basis behind the eu and the whole post-world-war-ii order in europe . 
  they had their alliance with cuba . 
   ukraine need to implement many reforms and work really hard to be ready for nato and to be something that nato can accept into the alliance . 
  why ? 
  nato is n't an economic union , and does n't permit freedom of population movement . 
  it 's not the eu . 
  it 's a military alliance , predominantly of countries who do n't want to be stomped by russia . 
  the eu would n't take in turkey , but nato has no problem with doing so . 
   if the ukrainian people so wished , they could destroy the rebels . 
  they have a vast advantage in numbers and materials . 
  does ukraine get a guarantee that russia wo n't intervene like it did last time ? 
  ukraine would n't have had any trouble earlier , either , sans russia . 
  we 're talking nato , not the eu . 
  corruption in nato is n't nearly such a big deal . 
   but the constant feeling of the american and sometimes british lens is annoying . 
  the american ? 
  their [ sporadic anti-gun tirades ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21647627-prevent-gun-deaths-politicians-offermore-guns-why-gun-lobby-winning ) annoy me . 
  what caused me to stop reading it , though , was that it 's like a firehose . 
  okay , i 'm interested in * particular crisis in some african country * . 
  maybe i 'll read an article or two on it . 
  but over a couple of months , you 'll get seven or eight articles on the same topic . 
  it burns too much time to keep up with them , and i do n't need to be kept * that * in touch with the specifics . 
  i would n't mind a monthly digest format , though . 
  the us has a similar split , and i assume that most countries have a similar structure ( unless they do n't have a real rural/urban split , like singapore , or there 's some absolutely overriding political concern for everyone , like imminent invasion ) . 
  honestly , one area where it 's pretty hard to talk smack about russia is in space stations . 
  there have been [ thirteen non-prototype human space stations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_space_stations ) . 
  one was american ( * skylab * ) . 
  one is chinese ( * tiangong 1 * ) . 
  one is international ( the * international space station * : russia , us , europe , canada , and japan ) . 
  russia built a lot of that station . 
  the other ten were soviet/russian . 
   the biggest roadblock is probably shithead republican senators from shit states like oklahoma and alabama who dont want two more democratic ( probably ) senators to mess with the balance . 
  could pull a missouri compromise-type deal and split texas into two . 
   sincerely i feel more close to an argentinian , a colombian or a cuban than some members of the eu . 
  yeah , but let freedom-of-movement-and-labor operate for a while , have some kids across national lines ... couple of generations later , you 've got yourself a nice stew in the national melting pot , same process as the us . 
  [ we addressed this in 1883 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._civil_service_reform ) . 
   the less developed countries always have an inferiority complex about these things . 
  they always assume that the more developed countries have `` figured things out '' . 
  sadly , this is not very often true . 
  my reading comments on this forum from several countries ( romanians in particular seem to be pretty hard on romania ) has supported this . 
  the argument that / u/donvito is making is that it is scale that is the dividing factor between apple and software vendor x , not that it is free for apple . 
  i 'm pointing out that a company that specializes in that service and then provides it to many , many companies can provide at a greater scale than apple can . 
  okay , there are some differences -- for example , maybe there are [ transaction costs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transaction_cost ) in dealing with the service . 
  if it had to , say , send out salesmen to provide its service , then those salesmen have to be paid . 
  but providing electronic services is generally pretty inexpensive . 
  [ viaweb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viaweb ) ( later yahoo stores ) was a pretty good example of this in the us . 
  lots of brick-and-mortar retailers wanted to dip into the online marketplace . 
  those companies did not want to go hire their own software engineers that were expert in security , payment processing , different browsers and so forth . 
  they had product , and they wanted to sell it , and their scale was small enough that it was costly for them to replicate the infrastructure that , say , walmart was going to put up . 
  so viaweb provides a package that contains essentially all of these services in an easy-to-use package . 
  credit card companies do this every day ; it 'd be insanely expensive for every retailer to set up their own credit card ( [ though at one point , that * was * how things worked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/credit_card#charge_cards_from_western_union.2c_oil_companies.2c_and_other_companies ) ) . 
  instead , the credit card company provides payment processing and some fraud detection and probably currency conversion and other services . 
  the same can apply to online retail dealing with vat processing . 
   they will likely go down like the local super market chains and be replace with german giants that syphon the profit out of the country . 
  so , you 're in bulgaria , yes ? 
  your concern is that a germany-based supermarket chain will move in . 
  assuming that they provide a better service , that is true -- money will go to that chain . 
  however : * if that supermarket is doing so by providing better prices , it 's making bulgarian retail chains worse off ... but it is making the bulgarian * consumers * who shop at those stores better-off . 
  additionally , the result is a more-efficient economy , so bulgaria as a whole is slightly better-off . 
  * this wo n't produce a permanent trade imbalance , which seems to be a major concern . 
  my favorite commentary on this is an old recording of [ milton friedman describing why persistent trade imbalances do n't occur ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em&amp;t=2m ) :  let us suppose , for a moment , that the japanese flood us with steel . 
  that * will * reduce unemployment in the american steel industry , no doubt . 
  however , it will increase employment elsewhere in america . 
  we will pay for that steel with dollars . 
  what will the japanese do with the dollars they get for the steel ? 
  they are n't going to burn them . 
  they are n't going to tear them up . 
  if they would , that would be best of all , because there 's nothing we can produce more-cheaply than green pieces of paper .
