  and if they were willing to send us steel and just take back green pieces of paper , i ca n't imagine a better deal !, 
  but they 're not going to do that -- they 're not stupid , they 're smart people . 
  they 're going to use those dollars to buy goods and services . 
  they 're going to spend them . 
  in the process of spending them , they may spend them in the united states , and that directly provides employment in the united states . 
  they may spend them in brazil or in germany or in china or anywhere else . 
  but whoever gets them in turn is going to spend them . 
  so the dollars that we spend for steel will find their way back to the us as demand for us goods and services . 
  you will have less employment in the steel industry ; you will have more employment in the industries producing the goods we export . 
  overall , total employment will not be affected . 
  same idea here . 
  you do n't need to try to force out german retailers from the bulgarian market because you 're worried about bulgarian wealth being drained to germany . 
  if german retailers are more-efficient than bulgarian retailers , they might wind up driving bulgarian retailers out of business ... but at the end of the day , those german retailers are * still * going to want some sort of real goods in return for their services . 
  `` ah , * but * the example you gave has the us with its own currency . 
  that 's not the case for bulgaria -- bulgaria ca n't ` print all the euros it wants ' . '', 
  and maybe letting independent currencies adjust relative to each other makes the process smoother , as you do n't have to lay people off and re-hire them at lower rates , but just let their wages fall in real terms by having inflation show up ... but that does n't really affect the underlying mechanism . 
  at the end of the day , it still is n't an issue for bulgaria . 
  you are concerned about bulgaria 's wealth , right ? 
  there are two things you can buy with any wealth in bulgaria : domestic goods/services and foreign goods/services . 
  if you want to buy foreign goods/services , then you 're in * exactly * the same boat as if you were getting the german retail services : you 're transferring a claim on production to the outside world . 
  if you want to buy domestic goods/services , then a temporary trade imbalance might make the price of labor in bulgaria drop off ... but since everyone 's euro-denominated price of labor falls off , both mine and my barber 's , i 'm still able to have the barber cut my hair . 
  you do n't want to block trade with the outside world : that trade will tend to increase economic efficiency , and there wo n't be a permanent trade imbalance . 
   european officials believe the continent now has a chance , ** perhaps its last ** , to shepherd its main industries into the digital age and drive europe 's economic recovery . 
  melodrama rating : high  furthermore , commission data show that only 15 % of european consumers bought goods and services online from another eu country in 2014 , while 44 % did so domestically . 
  only 7 % of smes in the eu sell cross-border . 
  how do you even manage that ? 
  i live in the us , and * i * purchase goods from the polish gog.com . 
   simultaneously , rules surrounding so-called over-the-top communications services like facebook 's whatsapp instant messaging app will be scrutinized . 
  this last element has long been championed by the likes of deutsche telekom and other european operators , who see billions of people use whatsapp , facebook messenger and skype , while revenues from sms and voice calls decline . 
  wrong answer on that one , eu . 
  sms pricing is utterly-artificial and mindbogglingly-overpriced . 
  the reason it 's fragile as hell is because data is much cheaper to send than sms . 
  deutche telecom ca n't just acquire a monopoly on frequencies and expect europe 's population to keep dumping money into their pocket . 
  those messaging companies are n't doing well because they 're american ( skype is n't even american , for crying out loud ) . 
  they 're doing well because they 're bringing the price being charged consumers into line with what actual telco costs are . 
  and that 's a * good * thing , from the standpoint of an efficient market . 
  when you artificially-inflate how much money deutche telecom is making from germans , sure , you make deutche telecom wealthier ... but you do it by making poorer other industries and people in germany . 
  deutche telecom is going to be enthusiastic about this , of course , but it hurts germany as a whole ( since first there 's the zero-sum nature of shifting money from herr schwartz 's pocketbook to deutche telecom , and on top of that the economic inefficiency ) . 
   the commission says that the setting of standards for digital industries such as the internet of things , cybersecurity , mobile payments , connected cars , and cloud computing , are increasingly being set outside of europe , undermining europe 's long-term competitiveness . 
    `` europe established gsm . 
  at that time , of 2g , we set european standards as global standards , '' mr. ansip said . 
  i do n't think that standards-setting determines success so much as the other way around . 
  if you 're making a compelling system , people are probably going to use the conventions that you set . 
  have a lousy system , and your standards will be ignored and people will use something else . 
  your extensive xml-based forum markup language standards are going to be completely-ignored if people would rather use markdown . 
   the commission suggests that the european standards system identify gaps in the technology market ripe for essential standards and mandate standards bodies to deliver them quickly . 
  awful idea . 
  do n't try to use standards bodies as a weapon to bludgeon competition ( regardless of whether that competition is foreign or not ) . 
  do that and you get a less-competitive market , which is bad for your consumers . 
  use them to reduce unnecessary costs for companies trying to provide services to multiple members . 
   because apple can afford to hire 50 new accountants just to handle that bullshit . 
  for us hiring just one new person is a major investment - and risk . 
  eh , someone just sets up a service that does this automatically and charges a relatively-low fee . 
   when the world hates you [ see my below comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33d6f4/russia_receives_lowest_approval_in_world_russia/cqklyd5 ) . 
  this poll may have some serious flaws if you 're using it to judge world opinion . 
  actually , more like this : submission 1 :  love military transgenders . 
  i am searching a military transgender in army uniform as a female soldier . 
  submission 2 :  is there lgbt soldier in the usa army ? 
  submission 3 :  would you mind if the republic georgia join the usa ? 
  submission 4 :  does anybody have transgenders soldiers pictures like in a video . 
  actually soldiers on nato ) submission 5 :  would you mind if the republic georgia join eu . 
  op is a man on a * mission * : one way or another , damn the international changes that must be done , he 's getting some transgender nato troops into georgia !, 
   every great dream begins with a dreamer . 
  always remember , you have within you the strength , the patience , and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world . 
  -- harriet tubman make the dream a reality , op !, 
   those people do n't have the american dream of moving to usa to get a better life , they have the european dream of making their own country a better place and join the european union . 
  if mohammed will not go to the mountain , then the mountain shall come to mohammed ... 
  that * does * appear to be in line with the author 's past articles on vox.com ; very populist , kill-the-rich-sounding . 
  however ... i think i 'd actually say that they tend to advocate policies that are advantageous to the well-to-do . 
  from the article :  the rich world spends billions of dollars every year on armed guards and planes and drones to make sure the global poor stay poor in this case , while totally-unrestricted immigration might be a tough sell to the very wealthy -- might be too-disruptive -- here i think that `` the rich world '' is rather-importantly different from `` the rich in the rich world '' . 
  the people who make money from immigrants being kept out are people who are being paid to fill job slots that are much less-competitive due to those restrictions on immigration . 
  the guy on a factory line following some premade set of instructions wants to have an artificially-low supply of labor so that the market rate for his work is higher . 
  he 's been able to leverage his privileged access to that job slot thus far . 
  a [ second article ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/4/15/8406605/payroll-tax-income-tax ) :  the greatest trick the rich ever pulled was making us believe they pay all the taxes but this does n't talk about adjusting capital-gains taxes , which primarily impacts the well-to-do , as it 's effectively a property tax ( due to inflation ) and a tax on the primary source of income for the well-to-do ( money coming from capital ) . 
  it 's talking about the relationship between social security and friends versus the income tax ... and while the income tax tends to clobber professionals ( high-value labor ) , it 's capital gains taxes that clobber the really wealthy ( income comes from return on stored capital ) . 
  also , while i 'm not familiar with the policy specifics , it advocates for mike lee and marco rubio , who from a quick skim appear to generally be in favor of tax policy that is advantageous to the well-to-do . 
   there are more german-americans [ irish-americans are also way up there , though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_american ) :  about 33.3 million americans -- 10.5 % of the total population -- reported irish ancestry in the 2013 american community survey conducted by the u.s. census bureau . 
  [ 1 ] three million people separately identified as scotch-irish , whose ancestors were ulster scots who emigrated from ireland to the united states . 
  my point is that those complaints seem like the sort of complaints that almost * any * country would have people making . 
  i am * very * sure that i can find people in the us complaining about people polluting , driving too fast , and playing loud music . 
  that 's just the sort of thing that people get irked about . 
  you could probably also find people unhappy that there 's too much bureaucracy getting in the way of business , that people driving too slow and blocking the road are annoying , and that irritating neighbors complaining about your music is a problem . 
  that seems less evidence that georgia suffers from some sort of fatal social flaws , and more just that georgia is full of people who complain about substantially the same things that other people do . 
  if i understand the statistics here , the sampling is pretty whack . 
  i * think * that what they did , from reading the article ( they do n't provide the raw study without some sort of email correspondence ) was to take every region , take 1000 people from it , and poll them about the set of regions . 
  this does not appear to be a random sampling , and that seriously-impacts the overall conclusion . 
  let 's take a quick skim over these , hyperlink to the wikipedia relations summary and their relative relationships with us and russia ( i do n't know russia as well , but if we assume that it 's somewhat opposite the us ... ) : * [ ** ukraine ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : was just attacked by russia , with entire chunks of the country torn away . 
  crimea was quite-possibly excluded from sampling ( crimea was not participating in ukraine 's elections ) ; not sure whether the occupied areas in the east were . 
  highly-unlikely to be very favorable to russia ; while i do n't know whether ukraine is enthusiastic about the us , to the extent that the us can block russia and provide meaningful disincentives to beat up ukraine , it probably has some good image . 
  * [ ** romania ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : russia took over and inflicted a lot of pain , and the us represents a way to block that , i guess . 
  * [ ** bangladesh ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bangladesh%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : i 'm not familiar with this . 
  according to wikipedia , has a vaguely-positive relationship with the us subsequent to the country 's independence war ( where the us was opposed to independence ) . 
  * [ ** tanzania ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanzania%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : i 'm not familiar with this either . 
  wikipedia says that there was tension with the us in the 1970s and 1980s , but that that pretty-much died down . 
  i assume no strong relationship either way with russia . 
  * [ ** latvia ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvia%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : same as romania ; probably stronger , since russia arguably would like to have the baltics back . 
  * [ ** lithuania ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) . 
  same as latvia . 
  wikipedia says `` lithuania is one of the most pro-american nations in europe and the world , with 73 % of lithuanians viewing the u.s. positively in 2011 . '', 
  * [ ** ireland ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ireland%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) .
