  instead of just making a cloud , once you 've got a sorted list of word frequencies for a given news source , it 's possible to compare sorted lists of word frequences . 
  generate an aggregate list for news sources that you want to consider `` normal '' . 
  generate one for rt. 
  find the difference between the two frequences for each word to come up with a new list of word frequencies . 
  sort that , and generate your word cloud to find what it is that russia wants the world to know about relative to other news sources . 
  i 've also been vaguely wondering how possible it would be to identify new propaganda news sources -- i vaguely imagine that russia funds things other than sputnik and rt that i do n't know about , given that it runs efforts to comment on articles on mainstream news sources . 
  so , theoretically , if instead of using * all * words seen , you just generate a wordlist for the last , say , week ... unless a country religiously segregates its propaganda sources ( source a only talks about fracking and how much of an asshole germany is , source b only talks about how the us government is trying to oppress its people ) , they may exhibit shifts in word frequency at the same time , if orders to start promoting new topics go out to multiple sources ; it 'd help flag propaganda that would run under the radar . 
  the downside is that web stuff tends to be kinda incestuous -- things like reddit repeat news that show up on other sources -- but if news sources * consistently * exhibit correlation in when they start covering particular news , that seems kinda suspicious . 
   its highest-trafficked videos on youtube , for instance , apparently pertain to `` metrosexuals , bums , etc. '' rather than anything political that 's not necessarily indicative of it failing . 
  * first , it may be that * nobody 's * political news gets a lot of attention , and that people just really like reading about `` metrosexuals '' . 
  the real interesting question is the ratio of coverage that political news gets . 
  * second , getting eyeballs is a springboard to work with . 
  if you 've got someone watching a metrosexual video , you 're not * currently * doing anything other than building brand awareness with your `` rt '' logo and , by diluting the percentage of your content that is political , reducing the `` propaganda '' profile . 
  however , it 's possible that you could insert subtle material in even not-apparently-political news to have an effect . 
  for example , if russia is interested in keeping people thinking of germany as being `` tyrannical '' in the eu but people want to actually watch metrosexuals , they could film some italian metrosexual guy being harassed by german authorities . 
  * third , the lack of cable coverage does n't seem all that interesting . 
  i do n't know the numbers , but cable 's viewership is waning , and internet viewership waxing . 
  thoughts i have on rt : [ ** russia has rt/ruptly/russiatoday as well as sputnik news as propaganda outlets ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3immq6/a_glance_at_state_international_media_sources/ ) . 
  why ? 
  the sources seem to have vaguely-comparable levels of sketchiness . 
  the us also seems to have two major sources ( rfe/rl and voa ) , but with the us , there seems to me to be a separation -- any voa bias is pretty subtle and maybe just limited to topic selection . 
  rfe/rl has a pretty visible agenda . 
  my ( layman 's ) guess is that this is intended to serve two different markets -- voa to provide a neutral , reputable alternative to domestic propaganda in targeted countries , something that can build reputation and win viewers from those domestic sources , and rfe/rl 's goal is to promote issues that the us wants promoted without tainting voa 's brand . 
  but sputnik and rt are n't all that different . 
  rt obviously has higher production values , but i do n't understand the segregation between the two . 
  ** some of the conspiracy theory ** . 
  i really do n't understand some of the mix of issues that russia promotes . 
  i 'm starting to wonder if it 's just anything that people in the target countries might be unhappy about . 
  i can understand promoting ron paul or corbyn , as both would take a less-aggressive international stance in their countries : it would clearly be in russia 's interests to have a less-aggressive us or uk . 
  targeting [ fracking ] ( https://www.rt.com/tags/fracking/ ) promotes a more-restricted oil supply , which produces higher oil prices , which greatly benefits russia . 
  promoting occupy wall street or the us hassling blacks ( which goes at least back to [ infektion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_infektion ) ) does n't clearly generate benefit other than creating headaches or generating opposition to the government in the target country . 
  the stuff [ promoting gold ] ( http://www.rt.com/business/245629-no-gold-twenty-years/ ) does n't make any sense to me . 
  edit : [ actually , maybe it 's pretty simple ] ( http://www.escapehere.com/inspiration/10-countries-with-the-largest-gold-reserves/4/ ) . 
  ** leaking interests ** . 
  one difficult thing about propagandizing is that if someone 's aware that something is a propaganda source , and if you spend a lot of your effort promoting a particular thing , you expose what you want people to believe . 
  i vaguely-imagine that the cia and friends run relative word clouds on rt and sputnik compared to other news sources to see what topics it is that russia disproportionately-promotes . 
  it 'd be kinda interesting if they 'd release that data to the public , put it on a website somewhere . 
  i think that that 's the aggregate result of many different policies over time : hard to hold a referendum on everything that affects a decision to have a kid positively or negatively . 
  i 'm also doubtful that the traditional make-use-of-a-representative approach does n't work . 
  if people really * did * want to do things like fund daycares eu-wide , they could certainly have representatives running on these policies -- france provides such a service , for example . 
  i think that rather than the legislative system prohibiting the desires of the public from being expressed , that the public simply has n't had a lot of interest in raising the birthrate to sustainable levels or shifting social norms to favor larger families . 
  that 's a legitimate decision on the part of the public . 
  all right , as long as you 're simply being critical of european governments -- though i 'd point out that the european public voted in those governments . 
   also he resigned voluntarily for personal reasons that 's typically a nice way of firing someone . 
  you tell them in advance that if they do n't quit , they 're fired , and they `` decide to voluntarily leave for personal reasons '' . 
  less-awkward for both sides . 
  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention this * is * certainly sufficiently-vaguely-defined that one could argue for something like that , but there 's a restriction on it :  article 31 . 
    refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge [ snip ]  2 : the contracting states ** shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularized or they obtain admission into another country . 
  ** the contracting states shall allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country . 
  you 'd have to argue that confining people was necessary . 
  ah , that makes a lot more sense . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  [ that 'd probably get pretty grim pretty quickly , as the bodies do n't just promptly vanish ] ( http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/how-long-do-dead-bodies-remain-inta-2009-06-10/ ) :  the australian museum has an informative web site , deathonline.net , on how human remains change after death ... on the open ocean , however , flies and other insects are largely absent . 
  and if the body is floating in water less than 70 degrees fahrenheit ( 21 degrees celsius ) for about three weeks , the tissues turn into a soapy fatty acid known as `` grave wax '' that halts bacterial growth . 
  the skin , however , will still blister and turn greenish black . 
  finally , crabs and small fish may feed on the soft parts of the face like the eyes and lips , according to the book forensic taphonomy : the postmortem fate of human remains , by william d. haglund and marcella h. sorg   a 2002 study in the journal legal medicine examined nine bodies that had drifted hundreds of kilometers in cold waters off the coast of portugal and spain . 
  bodies recovered in the first week were in good condition , but the beginning signs of decomposition were present on a body recovered after eight days . 
  the two bodies recovered after 20 days were highly decomposed and could only be identified through dna analysis or dental records . 
  as for warmer water , a 2008 study on two human bodies recovered following aircraft accidents found one body off of sicily to be partially skeletonized after 34 days and a second body off of namibia to be completely skeletonized after three months . 
  apparently the confederate states of america did n't pass the smell test from the us standpoint . 
   right now , it 's working to our advantage , honestly . 
  that only works if they 're where you want to dump them back into turkey and border turkey , though . 
  if other countries steal their belongings , now they 're just left in a strange country with no money . 
  now you 've got someone desperate and without money , which is the last thing you want in terms of crime . 
  i 'll also bet that there are an unbelievable number of con games , theft , pickpocketing and so forth being run . 
  you 've got a ton of people who do * not * want to make themselves known to the police ( and thus fingerprinted ) probably carrying cash with them and no knowledge of the local language , law , or customs . 
  if someone happens to be wearing a uniform of some sort , they probably believe that they 're an law officer . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_c._parker  george parker ( 1870 -- 1936 ) was one of the most audacious con men in american history . 
  he made his living selling new york 's public landmarks to unwary immigrants . 
  his favorite object for sale was the brooklyn bridge , which he sold several times . 
  he convinced his marks that they could make a fortune by controlling access to the roadway . 
  more than once police had to roust naive buyers from the bridge as they tried to erect toll barriers . 
  [ 1 ] now imagine the market for every huckster , snake oil salesman , and con man between turkey and sweden . 
  we were already hearing on here about how someone ... bulgarians ? ... had a number of con artists agreeing to take people across the border for money in advance . 
  instead , they work with the police to leave them at a safe house , contact the police , and get them picked up , keeping the money and having the person and their complaints deported . 
  that 's probably one of the most-benign of schemes out there . 
  yeah , but what i mean is that the idea of a `` barbarian '' is n't unique to greece -- it 's not as if there 's some universal agreement in which some people would say `` oh , yes , our culture is less good than your culture '' . 
  it 's possible for different peoples to weight different technological or social advantages , even where they agree that something is an advantage , more-heavily . 
  that 's * why * different cultures exist concurrently -- after all , i think that few people intentionally want to take up a culture that they view as being worse . 
  the [ idea of `` progress '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idea_of_progress ) is , i think , a bit seductive -- that we always and inexorably move towards something better , which can be clearly identified , and that thus the older thing is worse . 
  and yet ... people care deeply today about whether homosexuality is taboo in society . 
  ancient greece had non-taboo homosexuality , then christianity squashed it , and millennia later , we 're still fighting over it . 
  i 've got europeans on here who frequently condemn the death penalty as being barbaric ; after all , it was more common in the past . 
  my us-centric view is that there 's no particular benefit in banning the death penalty . 
  things like democracy also became uncommon in the world for a very long time ... yet if aristocratic societies were to say today that democracy was for a barbaric , more-primitive time because it fell off in frequency for a long time , i think that we 'd laugh quite a bit . 
  i think that often , `` barbarism '' is used when someone simply attaches more negative emotion to something than positive -- it `` feels '' wrong , and it 's not part of the social norms of one 's society , but it 's not really possible to articulate a universally-convincing pragmatic argument for your own norms . 
  so ... someone just throws in `` barbarism '' as a shorthand for getting the idea that something `` feels '' wrong and is n't in line with their social norms across ... but it also means that they 're giving up on a hard , universally-accepted metric , because people wo n't agree with them about what is barbaric and what is n't . 
  this is n't an argument for all cultures to be treated as being `` equally good '' -- as i said in my earlier post , i think that that might be a politically-correct cop-out that 's occasionally used , but that there * are * ways in which one can realistically come up with measurements that people would agree on . 
  it 's just that i think that it 's regrettably-easy to let one 's own social norms creep in and simply start coming up with [ just-so stories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-so_story ) that explain why one 's own culture is superior , that there 's a bias towards one 's own culture . 
  and then it 's easy to fall into the `` well , they 're just barbarians '' explanation . 
  the current bulk of the logistics problem is caused by people swarming over borders illegally , and doing so because it is advantageous to them to reach germany/sweden/etc . 
  a public and explicit statement that germany/sweden will provide no preference to people applying for asylum within germany/sweden versus those applying from greece would avoid the movement . 
  this may violate the 1951 refugee convention : there are certainly legal issues to be worked out . 
  there is no practical reason for germany to provide legal preference for people applying within germany when the majority of applicants are crossing multiple countries to get to germany other than due to legal inertia . 
  germany/sweden may have * wanted * to make use of the difficulty of reaching germany as a sort of flow-rate limiter , but that clearly is not working , and is causing major problems for countries on the way . 
  furthermore , the transit countries are going to * continue * to suffer from being used as a valve until this situation changes . 
  i think that germany is probably going to have to have some kind of cap or make refugee status less-desirable in some way unless it wants to take in a pretty large chunk of the population of the countries in question or can cut a deal with someone else to take them in ( which seems increasingly-unlikely , given that other eu countries see the costs as outweighing any benefit and the us extremely uninterested in taking in any kind of significant numbers ; russia benefits greatly from the crisis intensifying and has no reason to do so ) . 
  that takes the burden off the balkans and can be done almost immediately , simply by opening up refugee processing facilities in turkey . 
  simply increasing aid to turkey/lebanon/jordan for camps might not hurt , but i think that it 's unrealistic to believe that it will resolve the problem . 
  the us has dealt with the 1951 refugee convention not by formally withdrawing from it , but simply by burying seekers in red tape ( it will be years until any newly-filed refugee application will actually make it through the current backlog to be processed ) and imposing small limits on the number of refugees to take in ( which are n't actually permitted by the convention ) .
