  there are a ton of irish-americans out there ; lotta shared heritage . 
  * [ ** afghanistan ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afghanistan%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) . 
  well , russia fought a bloody war here against reformers , and ultimately did n't come out on top . 
  i do n't know what the average afghan 's position on the us is , but the us is dumping a ton of money into development and whatever the flaws of the administration that it helped put in place , it 's democratic and the people of afghanistan select it . 
  * [ ** bosnia and herzegovina ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnia_and_herzegovina%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : i still do n't understand how the us is viewed in the balkans or even the politics of that place , but if i understand correctly , the current country was backed in its creation by nato and is a nato member , whereas serbia was backed by russia ; i 'd expect bosnia and herzegovina to be more-enthusiastic about the us than russia . 
  * [ ** canada ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) . 
  the us and canada get on pretty darn well ( at least subsequent to 1812 ) . 
  * [ ** slovakia ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovakia%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : i 'm guessing that the situation is somewhat similar to that of romania . 
  * [ ** finland ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : russia invaded and annexed part of their country ( and tried to take the whole thing ) and claimed most of the country for a long time . 
  the us did n't actually do all that much during the invasion , and certainly the relationship with russia is important , but then ... the us has also caused a lot less pain to finland than russia has . 
  * ** united states ** : well ... while i 'm sure that you 'll find people critical of the us here , i 'm pretty sure that it 's more popular than russia . 
  * [ ** guinea ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guinea%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : the strongest approval of the us in africa , according to wikipedia . 
  * [ ** malawi ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malawi%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : sounds like a vaguely-positive relationship with the us ; probably not much interaction with russia . 
  * [ ** netherlands ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : nato member . 
  wikipedia says that the dutch have some of the highest approval of the us in europe . 
  * [ ** portugal ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugal%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : not particularly at-odds with the us , certainly not compared to russia . 
  * [ ** estonia ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : same as latvia and lithuania . 
  russia caused a lot of problems ; the us is a guarantee that russia does n't do it again . 
  * [ ** gabon ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabon%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : same as some of the other western african countries : vaguely-positive take on the us , probably not particularly associated with russia . 
  * [ ** sierra leone ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sierra_leone ) : another west african country with vaguely-positive ties to the west and the us . 
  * [ ** south africa ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_africa%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) : does n't look like there was a lot of friction subsequent to reagan . 
  so , here 's my point : while i will happily believe that the us is more popular than russia around the world , the selection of countries determines greatly the overall opinion that this thing registers , and the selection hardly seems random . 
  all of the baltic states are represented , some of the most pro-us countries in europe and africa , and the us itself . 
  russia is not represented , and countries that might have had closer relationships with russia -- cuba , venezuela , serbia , russia herself -- do n't show up in that sample . 
  if you want to determine world opinion of the us versus russia , it seems to me that it would make much more sense to choose a random sample of people from the whole world and then poll them . 
  if you 're trying to measure favorability weighted by power or something , maybe weight the selection by gdp . 
  but polling a bunch of people in countries that are broadly in favor of the us ( or really have it in for russia ) and saying `` yup , countries that tend to be pro-us also have people who tend to also be pro-us '' is kind of silly . 
  using that as a proxy to make conclusions about * world * opinion is just incorrect . 
   its to strategically located . 
  < scratches head  if you 're talking about re : a military conflict between the rest of europe and russia , and if that would be a zero-sum situation , then would n't it have the same strategic value to europe ? 
  [ also the atlantic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_islands_in_the_atlantic_ocean ) . 
  the us 's strength is really the pacific -- eu members claim most of the islands in the atlantic . 
  all right , all right . 
  * ireland * ? 
  i 'll be darned , i did n't know that !, 
  hmmm ... you guys had better hurry up and federalize the eu !, 
  that 's pretty impressive , but the mountainside link appears to be the flag of northern cyprus rather than turkey proper . 
  [ here 's a fabric texas flag ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afw-e0_vj8c ) . 
  [ i believe ] ( http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/turkish-flag.jpg ) that [ it 's on ] ( http://www.warrenharris.net/_thm/row%20of%20texas%20flags.jpg ) !, 
  same reason that the world series is the world series !, 
  yeah , you might need more power , but that 's not a fundamental limitation . 
  sure , it costs something more , but it does n't block israel from using it for commercially-viable * agriculture * ( why i included it as the example ) , which is a much bigger consumer of water than just city use . 
  certainly it 's not something that would alone have forced the uk to have given up hong kong island . 
  ah , but it was n't * called * georgia , and besides , i * really * , * really * want to call a european country a `` young whippersnapper '' in comparison to a us organization for once . 
  sounds great !, 
  that ( a ) as you said , probably has a good return in that it provides a rapid return independently of positive benefits in a political sense , ( b ) can be done incrementally -- nobody needs a massive wad of cash suddenly , and ( c ) makes the worried-about-carbon-dixoide-emissions crowd happy . 
  fun tidbit : i was reading about the insulation issue not long ago , because traditionally japanese residences are not insulated , and a very large chunk of even currently-used housing has no insulation . 
  in the winter , it 's the norm to use a sort of [ heated table ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kotatsu ) and have the household just keep their legs under the thing , and for houses to become very cold in cold environments ; people also just run small heaters like mad to heat up chunks of their houses . 
  south korea , on the other hand , does n't have this tradition and has pretty solid insulation ... 
  if the gas is primarily used for heating , i wonder how viable improving insulation would be . 
  the world has gotten a lot better at insulating buildings ... 
  caps russia 's influence and ability to set gas prices in poland . 
  honestly , as long as there are alternative sources that can cut in * if need be * , unless the eu is trying to embargo russian fossil fuels , i do n't see the point in eliminating use of them if they 're cheaper . 
  i mean , while i agree with you that in a technical sense , that 's true , one would n't normally think of most of these countries as having ill-defined territories . 
  in fact , today , i 'd say that countries have pretty defined borders . 
  there are n't really substantial `` undefined '' chunks on maps , and i have a hard time thinking of countries that really lack control of substantial portions of the land that 's normally-considered their country outside of some places in africa , like morocco or somalia , and with some countries with border issues with russia . 
  russians and lisp programmers would get on wonderfully . 
   what 's lacking in my country in terms of what i have said above is people 's attitude and understanding that their actions matter when they pollute environment , drive excessively fast , play music loud in the middle of the night like there 's nobody around , etc.

  plus a lot more ... i mean , that 's a lot of countries in that basket . 
  however : ( a ) i suspect that georgia would have an easier time getting into nato than the eu . 
  ( b ) my guess is that greece has soured people in the eu on economies with a lot of problems jumping in without those problems being resolved first . 
  ( c ) russia has a history of attacking countries that look like they might want to affiliate with the eu . 
  russia also has a history of attacking georgia . 
  i 'd think that georgia would want to plan that pretty carefully . 
  ( d ) i assume that ukraine would be ahead in line , assuming that it wants to do so , and that 's an immense chunk of people for the eu to assimilate . 
   desalination for a town of 30,000 is somewhat different than for a city of 1 million . 
  why ? 
  the ocean is n't going to run dry any time soon . 
  heck , israel manages to run its agricultural industry off desalinated water . 
  it 's not as if countries have n't negotiated water access before , though , and worst case , i imagine that the british could have set up desalinization , if they really wanted to do so ; that 's what they did in gibraltar .

   hong kong did n't get a say , since it was loaned to the british . 
  we never owned it ( except for a tiny little bit ) . 
  ehhhh ... i got ta be blunt there . 
  i think that a bigger factor was the uk 's assessment of what china was going to do if the uk kept it and whether the uk could retain it . 
  legally , it looks like the uk could have kept at * least * [ hong kong island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hong_kong_island ) . 
   in 1842 the island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the uk under the treaty of nanking also , if you throw enough lawyers at an international problem , you can * generally * find some sort of rationale for it .
