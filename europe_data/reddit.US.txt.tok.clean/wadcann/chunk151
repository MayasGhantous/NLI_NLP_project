   what i 'm most impressed with about the border between spain and gibraltar is how they manage to get international roaming as soon as you cross that line . 
  i 'd never even thought of this . 
  if one lives in europe , are there typically higher cell phone usage charges if one is in other european countries ? 
  that is refreshingly honest . 
   because once a country solidifies as a democracy , it almost never reverts back to anything else . 
  i suppose that `` solidifies '' leaves for a lot of wiggle room , but there 's the [ first spanish republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_spanish_republic ) and the [ second spanish republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_spanish_republic ) , the [ french first republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_first_republic ) , the [ french second republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_second_republic ) , the [ french third republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_third_republic ) , the [ weimar republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weimar_republic ) in germany , [ athenian democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/athenian_democracy ) , iceland 's althing until norwegian monarchy in 1262 , and later until danish monarchy in 1800 . 
  i suspect that there are many military coups that would also count , like the [ 1953 iranian coup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) . 
   the us is among the oldest continuing governments in the world , surpassed perhaps only by britain . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_marino  san marino claims to be the oldest surviving sovereign state and constitutional republic in the world , [ 10 ] as the continuation of the monastic community founded on 3 september 301 , by stonecutter marinus of arba . 
   for all those who do n't know , the us is going to be the youngest developed country by 2040 thanks to the hispanos . 
  [ fertility levels among later-generation latinos ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2782440/ ) falls off ( though it 's still comparatively-high , and stays well above replacement levels ) . 
  let 's say that it 's 3cm per year ( that 's apparently about as fast as north america and europe are moving away from each other ) . 
  africa currently has a population of 1.1 b. 
  that 's approximately equivalent , in terms of closing the gap , to one african constantly moving at 3.7 kph , a slow walk , to europe . 
  well , you 've got a crowd of people who purchased bitcoin and want it to go up in value . 
  then you 've got a crowd of people who actually want to use the thing as a currency . 
  so if someone says `` bitcoin 's value stayed flat '' , that 's probably disappointing to group a , but it 's good for group b , for whom volatility in value is just an irritation . 
  high media profile , minimal impact on society . 
  look at car accidents if you want a meaningful killer . 
  that 's certainly one take on the matter . 
  looks like [ a country of origin label is a per-country thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/country_of_origin ) . 
   for imports to the united kingdom , there is a voluntary code for food . 
  other products are not subject to labelling requirements , [ 10 ] but misleading labelling can result in prosecution under the trade descriptions act 1968 . 
  [ snip ]  united states : section 304 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended ( 19 u.s.c. 
  \u00a7 1304 ) requires most imports , [ which ? ], 
  including many food items , to bear labels informing the ultimate purchaser of their country of origin . 
  meats , produce , and several other raw agricultural products generally were exempt . 
   the jewish population of europe was relatively prosperous . 
  there were some substantial efforts being made to ensure that wealth did n't leave with them . 
   [ fahrenheit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fahrenheit ) ( symbol \u00b0 f ) is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the german physicist daniel gabriel fahrenheit ( 1686 -- 1736 ) , after whom the scale is named . 
  [ 1 ] in fact , looking at the temperature scales out there , i do n't think we did any of them . 
   we 're amongst the most productive worldwide i suspect that scarcity of labor plus outsourcing has more to do with productivity levels than personal work ethic , though . 
  if you need to pay $ n/hour to attract labor , all jobs that ca n't pay that much vanish from the equation and the average productivity rises . 
   more stability will allow these people to build lives in their own countries rather than immigrate the per-capita nominal gdp [ in libya is $ 11,300 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_libya ) and [ in the eu $ 34,300 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union ) . 
  you 're going to have to have some pretty hefty disincentives if you expect people to want to stay in libya . 
  ( someone else commented that the actual origins of the migrants was ethiopia , which has a per-capita gdp of $ 570 . ), 
  mexico and central america are stable ( at least by comparison with libya ) and the us sees plenty of illegal immigration . 
  also , re : stability , while i have n't been paying attention to the situation , wikipedia says that the gdp in libya has returned most of the way to where it was pre-war . 
  probably a good idea . 
  i get way , way less excited about it one way or the other than some people on here who seem to think that it represents apocalypse , though . 
   history was n't made yesterday . 
  well , some of it was ... 
  i should note ( looking at your flair ) that i have repeatedly seen indians identify chinese authoritarianism as a strength . 
  i believe that india compares itself to china a lot , and that since one of the differences is that china is more authoritarian , value has been placed on this . 
   you are breaking openly a peace agreement http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11408266/minsk-agreement-on-ukraine-crisis-text-in-full.html  pullout of all foreign armed formations , military equipment , and also mercenaries from the territory of ukraine under osce supervision . 
  disarmament of all illegal groups . 
  are trainers armed ? 
  i am not very sympathetic to russia on this , but a lot of that also happened before minsk existed . 
  so if you limit complaints about actions to * just * minsk and * just * whether the question of soldiers ... 
   you could really see the consequences of the furious pumping of siberian gas that actually surprises me . 
  this is presumably mostly a question of the cost of housing , right ? 
  and that 's presumably mostly the cost of construction , which is mostly domestic labor , and i 'd think that russian labor prices would fluctuate * with * russia 's wealth . 
  even if the country were poor , i 'd think that housing would be available . 
   yes , but why do you assume a war with poland would have brought the soviet union into it ? 
  just because it would have been a golden opportunity for the ussr to jump germany . 
  nazi germany had no interest in ussr expansion : it was willing to accept it so that it could buy off stalin to stay out of the fight . .  keep in mind hitler and the nazis did n't believe the german army was defeated in the previous world war german planning in both wars reflected concern over the risk of a simultaneous french and russian attack : world war i was the [ schliffen plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schlieffen_plan ) and world war ii was the [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  whether `` we were never truly beaten '' was something beyond a slogan or even the same as `` we would have won '' or even `` we 'd be willing to fight russia and france simultaneously '' , as a government , germany acted as if it took the risk of the ussr very seriously . 
   the last time they had a two-front war they managed to defeat russia yes , but doing so meant that they got clobbered on the western front . 
   really , we 've strayed into counterfactual history here , and that 's always a difficult subject by its very nature . 
  that 's certainly fair ; no matter how many arguments we throw up , we 'll never really know ... 
  [ and guns !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcf4nsba-cq&amp;t=37m10s ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_romania shows a pretty strong growth rate . 
     i 'd argue that ukraine has not decided with a majority . 
  i mean , poroshenko is an oligarch , ex soviet army , and is governing based off of 22 % of the vote on a 52 % turnout . 
  so that means , the vast majority of people did n't vote for him , and nearly half of the people did n't vote at all . 
  that is a really bad metric that i see people rather-disappointingly using when talking about voting in various countries , because it makes for low numbers . 
  factoring in low turnout and using it to imply that those people were opposed to a candidate is very unconvincing to me ; low turnout would , if anything , indicate ambivalence . 
   the greatest military powers were , throughout history , also cultural and scientific leaders . 
  greece , rome , the ottoman empire , the british empire or even the us today . 
  it 's hard to define `` culture '' ( i mean , everyone has culture ) , but to the extent that being `` cultured '' tends to refer to some sort of peaceful , civilized focus on highbrow stuff , the [ golden horde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_horde ) still ran the [ largest empire in the history of the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_empire ) , albeit for only a short time , and i 'm not sure how well they 'd fit the mold . 
  edit : oops , the british empire [ * just * edged them out in size ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_empires#largest_empires_by_land_area_and_population ) , though i think the point still stands ... 
  to be fair , while it 'd be interesting to see what would have happened in europe if france had permitted gentler economic constraints in versailles , [ they also had pressures that the us and the uk did n't have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_versailles#french_aims ) :  ** french aims **   as the only major allied power sharing a land border with germany , france was chiefly concerned with weakening germany as much as possible . 
  the french prime minister georges clemenceau described france 's position best by telling wilson : `` america is far away , protected by the ocean . 
  not even napoleon himself could touch england . 
  you are both sheltered ; we are not . '', 
  [ 33 ] clemenceau wished to bring the french border to the rhine or to create a buffer state in the rhineland , but this demand was not met by the treaty . 
  instead , france obtained the demilitarization of the rhineland , a mandate over the saar and promises of anglo-american support in case of a new german aggression ( a commitment that could not be relied on after the united states failed to ratify the treaty ) . 
  [ 34 ]   british economist john maynard keynes argued ,    so far as possible , therefore , it was the policy of france to set the clock back and undo what , since 1870 , the progress of germany had accomplished . 
  by loss of territory and other measures her population was to be curtailed ; but chiefly the economic system , upon which she depended for her new strength , the vast fabric built upon iron , coal , and transport must be destroyed . 
  if france could seize , even in part , what germany was compelled to drop , the inequality of strength between the two rivals for european hegemony might be remedied for generations . 
  [ 35 ]   france , which suffered significant destruction in its northern territories ( the worst damage sustained in areas that formed a so-called red zone ) and the heaviest human losses among allies ( see main article world war i casualties ) , was adamant on the payment of reparations . 
  the failure of the government of the weimar republic to pay these reparations led to the occupation of the ruhr by french and belgian forces . 
  also , even after world war ii , there [ were * still * factions who wanted to inflict as much pain on germany 's economy as possible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morgenthau_plan ) . 
   there is every reason to believe hitler would have gone ahead with an attack on poland even without molotov-ribbentrop . 
  do you have sources on this ? 
  germany had just lost world war i , and i 'd think that it 'd be pretty unenthusiastic about facing france and russia simultaneously again .

  the united states also does n't have very many police officers per capita , interestingly-enough . 
  excluding the mini countries like vatican city , the countries in europe with the highest per-capita count are serbia and russia .
