  also , on a related note , i knew that mcdonalds was trying to shift its locations in the us to [ have a higher-end appearance ] ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-05-06-mcdonalds-revamp_n.htm ) , but i was n't sure if that was just regional or country-wide ; apparently that 's country-wide . 
  well , the original article was n't linked . 
  it was from john conner at the american antitrust institute , though , and a [ quick google turns up an abstract with download link ] ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2400780 ) . 
  i think that some people who would like the eu see it as basically a pairing-of-equals : that is , there will be an organization that has more clout for all the elements working together . 
  it 's not ( primarily ) intended to transfer wealth from them other than maybe shifting wealth within the society via producing more-competitive markets . 
  i noticed a while back on a graph showing polls with support for more-centralization of authority that broadly-speaking , the wealthier an eu member , the less-enthusiastic it is about that centralization . 
  i have heard , on this forum , at least one older greek poster say `` yes , we know we fucked up , and badly '' , as part of a pretty long and involved post explaining how painful the policies were . 
  i 'm assuming that generally , though , criticism of the government happens internally , and when talking with people from other countries ... well , it 's still * your * government , after all , whatever its warts . 
  and i do n't think that that 's specific to greece , either ... would you treat someone saying `` dutch food sucks '' differently depending upon whether they 're from the netherlands or from , say , france ? 
  and honestly , let 's say that you had a really crummy leader who adopted policies that led to disaster . 
  how enthusiastic would you be , and how well would you identify with that leader ? 
  i do n't mean that there would be intentional hypocrisy , but mentally , you 're frustrated and fed up with that leader . 
  you 're already thinking of him as `` the other '' , and you 're furious about the whole affair . 
  my guess is that there has been quite a lot of self-recriminations in greece , and i 'm pretty sure that greeks are n't really enthusiastic about letting the same thing happen again , but ... i do n't think that a generations of repeated public acceptance of guilt and self-flagellation a la germany is actually really all that healthy . 
  would it make life all that much better if every greek person you talked to said `` yes , we were totally awful with money management for years '' ? 
  well , think of how it would appear the other way : `` country x leaders appear at wwii commemorations * despite * all the things that country y has done . '', 
  you 'd probably have people objecting ; rather unappealing politics . 
  i mean , what else would you want ? 
  all back-room , invisible-to-the public politics short of sanctions and war ? 
   they knew they 'd come to blows eventually , it 's just that stalin seemed to think that germany would want to deal with uk first . 
  i 've read conflicting claims about the ussr 's expectations as regards germany invading , ranging from `` there was no expectation of attack in the near future '' to `` there was certainty , but the timing was wrong '' . 
  i 'm kind of surprised by the flak he gets from russians who miss the ussr and wish that it had hung around . 
  i mean , even if you wanted the ussr , it seems like he gets an undue amount of blame for the ussr 's breakup , and prior administrations far too little . 
  from [ one of the other threads on reddit that linked to the image ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/humanporn/comments/31ir6r/italian_soldier_after_72_hours_of_combat_he/ ) , here 's [ a more up-to-date photograph of his eyes that has normal exposure/saturation/etc ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vhv3vsy.jpg ) . 
  this has probably shown up on reddit at least a dozen times , and in at least two threads people had taken stabs at correcting the original image . 
  as has been pointed out every time that image gets posted , the image has been photo-manipulated to make the eyes stand out like that . 
  well , it 's not as if there 's some consensus as to what the world 's population * should * be . 
  i mean , if you target a world population of 100m humans ( which may seem ludicrously-small , but would still put humans above the [ next-most-common large mammal on earth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crabeater_seal ) ) , the current world obviously has too many humans . 
  on the other hand , we could feed a lot more humans than we currently do . 
   maybe the reasons people are n't having children and marrying as often as they did before are n't economical but rather social . 
  when did the birth rate start declining and what event marked its decline ? 
  well , here 's a collection of relevant statistic tidbits : https://www.census.gov/population/international/files/wp02/wp-02005.pdf more contraception availability tends to produce less fertility in developing countries . 
   fig . 
  46 : total fertility rate by modern method of contraceptive prevalence , developing countries : 1990 or later fertility levels and contraceptive prevalence rates are strongly correlated across countries . 
    ... a 1-percentage point increase in use of any method of contraception is associated with a 0.06 birth decrease in total fertility rate ( tfr ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fertility_and_intelligence educational attainment and fertility level are inversely-correlated :  another way of checking the negative relationship between iq and fertility is to consider the relationship which educational attainment has to fertility , since education is known to be a reasonable proxy for iq , correlating with iq at .55 ; [ 16 ] in a 1999 study examining the relationship between iq and education in a large national sample , david rowe and others found not only that achieved education had a high heritability ( .68 ) and that half of the variance in education was explained by an underlying genetic component shared by iq , education , and ses . 
  [ 17 ] one study investigating fertility and education carried out in 1991 found that high school dropouts in america had the most children ( 2.5 on average ) , with high school graduates having fewer children , and college graduates having the fewest children ( 1.56 on average ) . 
  [ 18 ] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2723861/ religiosity is positively-correlated with fertility . 
   ... women who report that religion is `` very important '' in their everyday life have both higher fertility and higher intended fertility than those saying religion is `` somewhat important '' or `` not important . '' http://www.deliafurtado.uconn.edu/pdfs/hock-furtado_current.pdf low skilled-immigrant labor to the us has tended to decrease labor force participation of native-born women and increased their fertility levels and decreased the strength of the negative correlation between fertility and labor force participation by native-born women . 
  https://www.princeton.edu/~adsera/jpe04.pdf in the oecd * as a whole * , fertility was once also negatively-correlated with female labor force participation , but has in the last few decades become positively-correlated with female labor force participation :  in the paper i find that whenever unemployment is low and institutions easily accommodate the entry-exit of the labor market , fertility rates are around replacement rate . 
  this matches the case of either highly flexible labor markets , such as the us , where women leave the market , to rear children , with a high certainty of employment when they reenter or , alternatively , countries with a large government sector , such as those in northern europe , whose liberal leave programs and job security partially reduce the opportunity costs of childbearing . 
    by contrast , whenever the costs of childbearing in terms of loss of present or future income are intensified by high unemployment and rigid labor markets , fertility rates are very low . 
  southern europe fits this pattern . 
    since the mid 1980s unemployment has run high , especially among the young . 
  mature workers hold permanent and highly protected jobs while the young cohorts experience high turnover rates across precarious jobs in the lower end of a dual market . 
  as a result , young women either become unemployed , and eventually may drop out of the labor force , or stick to their unstable job trading off childbearing for the hope of employment security . 
  the lack of employment stability among young men reinforces the depressing effect on fertility of this institutional framework . 
  as argued in the last part of the paper , the sharp reduction of fertility in southern europe since the mid 1980s , when unemployment went up sharply , accounts for the sudden reversal in the participation-fertility relation within the oecd . 
   it 's not exactly egalitarian , such a system could be perceived as a ploy to further the divide between the rich and the poor . 
  at least in the us , [ household income is inversely-correlated with birth rate ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/241530/birth-rate-by-family-income-in-the-us/ ) ; the poor have more children anyway ( especially the very-poor ) . 
  [ the us 's only race that manages above 2.0 today are latins ] ( http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-us-population.aspx ) ; about 2.1 is required to maintain population . 
   missiles in cuba/turkey were a big deal in 1962 because the range of missiles was short , and you had to be that close to reach a target at all . 
  there 's one other major factor , though : it reduces the warning time to counter-launch , which makes a preemptive strike more viable . 
  there 's currently a 30 minute icbm separation between the us and russia ( though submarine-based nuclear weapons can launch from much shorter distances and get there faster ) . 
  that 's not a lot of time to react and counter-launch in the event of a preemptive strike , even with the immense and sophisticated detection and warning systems in place it 's one major concern with the pakistan/india : even if they have reliable detection in place , it takes very little time to reach state capitals from a launcher at the border . 
  that means that both are somewhat blind and on top of that have almost no time to decide or confirm anything ; if they believe that a preemptive attack is underway , if they are to have any chance of counter-launching successfully , they must counter-launch * instantly * . 
  that means that realistically , they ca n't have much by way of fancy detection or safeguards or civilian control over the weapons if they want second-strike capability . 
  honestly , i do n't think that putting nukes in estonia actually buys that much . 
  russia putting nukes in crimea is , i would assume , intended to be a statement , in that they feel that it adds credibility to a claim that they would attack back with nuclear weapons if crimea is attacked ( since they 'd be unwilling to lose control of nuclear weapons ) . 
  i 'm a little dubious that russia would actually do so , though , or that it would substantially-shift the us 's position to an attack on estonia . 
  the uk apparently currently ( 2014 ) [ spends $ 68.1 b/year on its military ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) , for reference . 
   you do n't see other countries that do not have a nuke being nuked or threatened . 
  ukraine got rid of their nukes and have been more-than-threatened . 
  i 'm not familiar with unsc procedures , but i normally hear about vetos . 
  are there any unsc majority-vote issues , or is it just that having one country on the unsc is sufficient to veto any policy ? 
  if so , it actually would n't shift that much ( from a us/unsc standpoint ) . 
   a jet armed with a nuke left the airport and landed elsewhere . 
  noone knew that it was carrying a nuke . 
  the nuke was left exposed on the aircraft for several days before anyone took notice . 
  that 's the [ 2007 united states air force nuclear weapons incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_united_states_air_force_nuclear_weapons_incident ) : they were supposed to have been moving the missiles with the warheads removed and replaced with dummy warheads , but screwed up on the inspection procedure on the sending side , and six of the twelve cruise missiles still had the nuclear warheads in them ; it took 36 hours until the receiving side checked the warheads , and it resulted in a huge shake-up ( as it was , among other things , a treaty violation ) with investigation , people being fired and procedures being revised . 
  this was a long way from unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon : the weapons were not armed , the crew did n't have the security codes to do so  bunker doors in nuclear silo not working properly . 
  pizza delivery guy was making a drop and simply wandered off in there . 
  the [ only reference i can find on google to a similar real-life case was a satirical story from an anti-nuclear-weapons source ] ( http://theloosenukes.blogspot.com/2013/10/pizza-delivery-blamed-for-nuclear.html ) . 
   high ranking person in charge of - i do n't remember exactly what , codes , some silos , a part of the nuke program , something like that - was a gambler . 
  sounds like [ adm. timothy m. giardina ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/11/22/admiral-fired-as-second-in-command-of-u-s-nuclear-forces-allegedly-made-his-own-counterfeit-500-poker-chips/ ) . 
  the rationale is presumably to avoid someone running into debt and getting desperate -- you do n't want anyone to have potential leverage over people in sensitive positions -- but gambling does n't appear to be prohibited ( though not reporting large gambling debt is ) . 
   well it would certainly build up to that . 
  [ a gradual build-up over , say , 12 hours ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzrjfac-hu&amp;t=2m50s ) !, 
  but the point is , if they * had * achieved them , would the government have been attacked ? 
  i agree that at least to me , that seems pretty ridiculous , but : * the statement was from a college student who later went into politics ; this does n't appear to be his current view . 
  * the reason this came up was that the person in question was retracting for and apologizing for the statement . 
  * the context appears to be flying the english flag in wales , rather than in england ( as opposed to the british flag ) . 
  russia can talk to beijing or berlin any time russia wants too , and yet that still happens . 
  i dunno ... there was a widespread-in-the-populace concept in the [ enlightenment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_enlightenment ) of an inevitable * progress * , a movement in one direction that countries must inexorably travel down with time and greater understanding . 
  liberal democracy , though , did n't turn out to be all that inevitable ; modern china appears to be pretty-successfully rejecting multiparty democracy . 
  i think that it 's very easy for people to consider the path that their ancestors traveled to be the one necessary path that culminates in them ... 
   an argument can be made that globalization is so complete at this point that a world war is in almost no ones interest . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_illusion  * the great illusion * is a book by norman angell , first published in the united kingdom in 1909 under the title europe 's optical illusion and republished in 1910 and subsequently in various enlarged and revised editions under the title the great illusion . 
    angell argued that war between industrial countries was futile because conquest did not pay . 
  miller writes : `` the ` great illusion ' was that nations gained by armed confrontation , militarism , war , or conquest . 
  '' [ 1 ] the economic interdependence between industrial countries meant that war would be economically harmful to all the countries involved . 
  moreover , if a conquering power confiscated property in the territory it seized , `` the incentive to produce [ of the local population ] would be sapped and the conquered area be rendered worthless . 
  thus , the conquering power had to leave property in the hands of the local population while incurring the costs of conquest and occupation . 
  '' [ 1 ] of course , the major powers * still * fought the world wars and * still * got economically burned . 
  putin is n't making russia better-off on ukraine , but that still happened . 
  that looks like a us western , aside from knives instead of pistols , and with lush , green grass instead of great plains dust and dry grass . 
   if you are an illiterate or a complete idiot who knows nothing about politics , you should n't vote . 
  i 'm surpriesed that everyone opposes this idea because of '' freedom blah blah '' when it 's completely irrational . 
  * ** literate how ? 
  ** for example , there 's be currently a spat in quebec ( and , i 'm sure places in europe ) over language .
