  a lovely way to eliminate opponents would be to , once in control of the government * once * , establish that only citizens literate in * your * favorite language may have the vote . 
  * ** is there a real problem , and is it related to political familiarity/literacy ? 
  ** i 've never met someone who i could honestly call a `` complete idiot '' . 
  i * have * met people who have accepted information that i 'd call false ( and it 's not clear to me that literacy was particularly-relevant to this ) . 
  i 've met people who have rationalized why someone 's political views differed from their own was that they were `` just idiots '' , which does n't fill me with a lot of enthusiasm about filtering out `` idiots '' . 
  * ** historically , do you like what efforts in this direction looked like ? 
  ** aristocracy is `` rule of the best '' . 
  democracy where the vote limited to particular groups in the past -- whites , or men , or property-owners typically-justified this with the idea that the excluded groups were n't really capable of voting in a sensible way . 
  broadly-speaking , most people are n't incredibly-enthusiastic about this today , i think . 
  * ** how sure are you of the usefulness of your `` can vote '' criteria ? 
  ** there are a lot of systems that provide , at least potentially , for inarguable benefits . 
  filtering voters * might * improve the quality of governance . 
  eugenics * could * address genetic issues more-rapidly than does evolution . 
  but i suspect that generally-speaking , people feel that they , themselves , are a part of the group that * does n't * need to be filtered out or removed from the gene pool or whatnot . 
  that makes me suspicious that , despite how clearly obviously correct that criteria seems to be , that it might be unfortunately subjective . 
  * ** democracy is n't just a system of governance . 
  it 's also a safety valve . 
  ** democracy addresses , in part , the system of incredibly-destructive revolutions and civil wars . 
  think of , say , the succession of the roman emperor . 
  civil war was a major problem , and eventually shattered the empire . 
  part of democracy 's role is n't just to identify the best policies for being ruled : it 's to avoid those revolutions . 
  it replaces them with `` little revolutions '' , where we play-act on a very regular basis what * would * have happened had we fought a traditional revolution ( the greater number probably would have come out on top ) . 
  in doing so , it creates the opportunity for a peaceful transition of power and avoids civil war , all through the frequent use of these `` little revolutions '' . 
  any aspirant to leadership who can gather enough supporters to make a realistic military bid likely also can gather enough supporters to make a democratic bid , so it neuters them . 
  any citizen who is angry-enough about the leadership has a less-destructive route to address his concerns . 
  and democracy does work well in this role : countries where people do feel that democracy is working ( in the sense of access to the ballot , non-rigged vote-counting , etc ) do not commonly revolt . 
  it 's not necessary that the * best * voters be voting for this role to be filled , but it is that as-many-as-possible voters are voting , else the vote begins to diverge from what would actually happen , were there a revolution . 
  * ** representative democracy already addresses some of the issues . 
  ** voters do n't really need to know the ins-and-outs of every policy that 's addressed ; that would be unfathomably-wasteful of their time . 
  a policy-maker might spend all his time keeping up with this . 
  in a country of 300 million , are we to multiply the costs by 300 million ? 
  it would be like requiring everyone to learn medicine to select a doctor ; in opposition to specialization of skills , which we treat as a valuable thing . 
  instead , voters select someone who they want to stay on top of the issues . 
  if there is a real argument against a candidate , it is the responsibility of `` advocates '' -- in this case , typically through use of a free press -- who are familiar-enough with the issues to raise it and explain their concerns . 
  this is the same process that we use in situations even with learned people : a judge will quite possibly not know all of the facts of a particular bit of law as it relates to a case , but the advocates of each side have the incentive to thoroughly-study and present their arguments in a way that a judge who is only generally-familiar with law can understand their case . 
  i do n't think that loading it onto a truck and putting it on ebay would make quite the same political statement , though . 
  i 'm not sure that lenin wanting someone more loyal to the committee was quite the same thing as condemning the actions in ukraine ... 
  it looks like the relevant bit of intellectual properly law here is [ personality rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personality_rights ) : what powers the subject of a photograph has to restrict the use of that photograph . 
  it looks like germany is fairly-unusual in permitting people to generally block publication of pictures of them . 
  while the us as a whole has no such law , there are some states that have varying degrees of such property rights . 
  generally-speaking , though , i have a very hard time seeing any form of remotely-political speech not being overridden by the first amendment guarantees . 
  surely , unlike previous attempts to censor content on the internet , this will meet with great success !, 
  < looks at wikipedia  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_bohemia  assuming the bohemian throne in 935 , duke boleslaus conquered the adjacent lands of moravia and silesia , and expanded farther to krak\u00f3w in the east . 
  he offered opposition to henry 's successor king otto i , stopped paying the tribute , attacked an ally of the saxons in northwest bohemia and in 936 moved into thuringia . 
  [ snip ]  duke bretislaus i of bohemia re-acquired the moravian lands in 1029 , which from that time on then usually was ruled by a younger son of the bohemian king . 
  about 1031 bretislaus invaded hungary in order to prevent its future expansion and in 1035 he helped emperor against the lusatians . 
  in 1039 he invaded poland , captured pozna\u0144 and ravaged gniezno , after that he conquered part of silesia including wroc\u0142aw . 
  the destruction of gniezno pushed the polish rulers to move their capital to krak\u00f3w . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_bohemia  p\u0159emysl ottokar ii ( 1253 -- 78 ) married a german princess , margaret of babenberg , and became duke of austria , thereby acquiring upper and lower austria and part of styria ; he conquered the rest of styria , most of carinthia , and parts of carniola . 
  he was called `` the king of iron and gold '' ( gold because of his wealth , iron because of his conquests ) , and he defeated hungary in the battle of kressenbrunn , where more than 200,000 men clashed . 
  he also fought and defeated the prussian pagans . 
  in 1256 , p\u0159emysl ottokar ii founded a city he named kr\u00e1lovec in czech , later known as k\u00f6nigsberg , now kaliningrad . 
  he ruled an area from austria to the adriatic sea . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hussite_wars#beautiful_rides_.28chevauch.c3.a9e.29  during the hussite wars , the hussites launched raids against many bordering countries . 
  the hussites called them spanil\u00e9 j\u00edzdy ( `` beautiful rides '' ) . 
  especially under the leadership of prokop the great , hussites invaded silesia , saxony , hungary , lusatia , and meissen . 
  these raids were against countries that had supplied the germans with men during the anti-hussite crusades , to deter further participation . 
  however , the raids did not have the desired effect ; these countries kept supplying soldiers for the crusades against the hussites . 
    during a war between poland and the teutonic order , some hussite troops helped the poles . 
  in 1433 , a hussite army of 7,000 men marched through neumark into prussia and captured dirschau on the vistula river . 
  they eventually reached the mouth of the vistula where it enters the baltic sea near danzig . 
  there , they performed a great victory celebration to show that nothing but the ocean could stop the hussites . 
  the prussian historian heinrich von treitschke later wrote that they had `` greeted the sea with a wild czech song about god 's warriors , and filled their water bottles with brine in token that the baltic once more obeyed the slavs . 
  '' [ 2 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_bohemia  zizka led armies to storm castles , monasteries , churches , and villages , expelling the catholic clergy , expropriating ecclesiastical lands , or accepting conversions . 
    during the struggle against sigismund , taborite armies penetrated into areas of modern-day slovakia as well . 
  czech refugees from the religious wars in bohemia settled there , and from 1438 to 1453 a czech noble , john jiskra of brand\u00fds , controlled most of southern slovakia from the centers of z\u00f3lyom ( today zvolen ) and kassa ( today ko\u0161ice ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war#the_bohemian_revolt  soon afterward , the bohemian conflict spread through all of the bohemian crown , including bohemia , silesia , upper and lower lusatia , and moravia . 
  moravia was already embroiled in a conflict between catholics and protestants . 
  the religious conflict eventually spread across the whole continent of europe , involving france , sweden , and a number of other countries . 
  [ snip ]  the thirty years ' war saw the devastation of entire regions , with famine and disease significantly decreasing the population of the german and italian states , the kingdom of bohemia , and the low countries . 
  the war also bankrupted most of the combatant powers . 
  both mercenaries and soldiers in armies were expected to fund themselves by looting or extorting tribute , which imposed severe hardships on the inhabitants of occupied territories . 
  i 'm not saying that ukranians will or will not join the eu , but europe 's fields have been drenched a thousand times over with the blood of one people or another . 
  i do n't think that there are any people in europe who can be said to have either not offended against another or have not been offended against ; if none of these were ever to slide into the past , it would be an awfully-grim present . 
  hmm ... thanks , i did n't know that . 
  it looks like the us was n't a * terribly * - bad offender here -- more collaborating with other countries , aside from delaying return of pows until after harvest to benefit from labor -- but still , not something that i knew of . 
  ( i am not an economist ) . 
  i do n't know about rice in particular , but certainly i 'm not going to hold up the us as the ideal ; it has its own share of special interests who manage to lock in legislative protection for their industries . 
  the [ sugar industry is one such example ] ( http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa768.pdf ) ; corn ethanol legislation provides another to corn farmers ; federally-subsidized crop insurance provides another . 
  i 'm not saying `` the us does what is right ; copy everything the us does '' , but rather that `` trying to maintain a permanent trade surplus is n't a benefit to the country imposing those policies , or to anyone else '' . 
   i swear , no other country has ever taken so much shit for just trying to help out another country than germany does right now for helping greece . 
  it 's not that germany ( and the other creditors ) are imposing austerity policies on greece . 
  it 's that nobody else was willing to provide more funds to greece even * with * those reforms happening . 
  mongolia , the united states , peru , switzerland -- all these countries were less-willing to take a hit in greece . 
  does n't need that greeks need to be * happy * about the situation , but blaming germany for attaching conditions that they do n't like to funds is silly ; everyone else out there offered less-appealing-to-greece terms . 
   unpaid forced labor ... by ... the western allies ? 
  yeah ... you can blame greeks for letting the financial problems show up , but i think that it 's really , really hard to blame them for syriza 's presence , and i think that a lot of the flak greece gets here is just people taking it out frustrating about other things on greek voters . 
  greece 's biggest catastrophe was the financial situation . 
  the two mainstream parties were associated with the problem , and greek voters did what i 'd call the absolutely-appropriate thing : regardless of who else comes into office , boot out the corrupt parties . 
  everything else comes second . 
  the next three-largest parties simply are n't in line with the european mainstream : the communists , syriza , and golden dawn . 
  i think that we can safely say that the communists would n't have been popular with / r/europe . 
  greece took huge flak for giving an increasing share of the vote to golden dawn earlier , and i think that they would have been more-objectionable than syriza . 
  other parties were small and often young or unknown . 
  i have a really hard time blaming greece for voting in syriza ; if i were a greek voter , i suspect i probably would have seriously-considered doing the same ( and i 'm probably best-described as right-libertarian ; i would not like syriza 's politics ) . 
  furthermore , while syriza may or may not be ept , what they 're doing with russia seems far from obviously a bad idea . 
  right now , greece is in a very poor bargaining position . 
  they have little leverage other than `` we default on debts '' , which the eu has a whole has not shown signs of changing position on . 
  ( this is not to say that i am in any way unsympathetic to germany and france and finland and other creditors ; just that it is the responsibility of greece 's government to do whatever it resaonably can for greece 's long-term interests . ), 
  the only way that they can strengthen that position is to establish that they have some option other than simply inducing a grexit , since that would hurt greece a lot * and * has n't been able to sway the eu .
