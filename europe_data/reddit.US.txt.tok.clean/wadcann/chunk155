  that means trying to play two major powers against each other . 
  that 's not at all new in the european experience . 
  they know that russia has interest in fracturing the eu , and in muting combined eu efforts ; this shows not only that they have something to offer russia , but that greece can impose some pain back short of leaving the eu . 
  blaming greece for the ability to split the eu is dumb . 
  first , applying social pressure ( `` you 're being jerks ! '' ), 
  only works for minor issues , where the pain of being ostracised is greater than the pain of whatever else is at issue , and greece is more-unhappy about the financial situation than some name-calling . 
  second , if any one country can bone over the eu 's foreign policy as a whole , that 's an organizational problem with the eu , where the eu is n't sufficiently-robust to achieve its foreign policy goals ; if it was n't greece , it 'd just be the next country to get into a tight spot , have corrupt leadership , or similar . 
  this is n't a `` germany and france and finland and friends should just eat greece 's losses and they 're morally-reprehensible ! '', 
  statement , but a `` realistically , greece is in enough of a corner that it 's going to do whatever it can to try to un-fuck itself , and that could potentially be extreme , and it 's probably unrealistic to expect greece not to do that '' . 
  at one point in time , [ mercantilism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) was the lens through which countries viewed trade : maintain an trade surplus and stockpile gold and silver , and success will be yours . 
  today : policies that produce artificial stockpiling are n't beneficial to you . 
  from the article :  germany 's export-driven economy has powered much of the increase in the region 's current account surplus . 
  the treasury said stronger demand in germany , which includes spending consumer goods and investments , was `` absolutely essential . '' buy some goods and services , germany . 
  you worked hard , you earned it , enjoy . 
   rumored to be ... agrarians i had never even heard of this use of `` agrarian '' until today : from the collaborative international dictionary of english v. 0.48 [ gcide ] : agrarian \\ a * gra `` ri * an \\ , n. 1 . 
  one in favor of an equal division of landed property . 
  [ 1913 webster ], 
  this is very interesting to me , since it 's something that i 'd been trying to understand for a while . 
  my understanding is that , at least in the original sense , `` communism '' really meant `` an environment where property is communally-owned '' . 
  it 's not `` my spoon '' , it 's `` the community spoon which i may use '' . 
  then , as i understand it , part of the industrial revolution had [ marx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_marx ) ( and others , like the [ luddites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luddite ) ) observing that the old relationship between artisanal labor and production was going away . 
  it used to be that many goods were produced by a skilled worker ; if you wanted a better knife or a nicer engraving , you needed someone who was better at the trade or for them to spend more time on it . 
  however , the shift towards the [ american system of manufacturing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_system_of_manufacturing ) was to try to apportion work to make any individual task very simple and repetitive , so that labor was commoditized ( and thus easier to obtain and interchange ) , and perhaps could even be automated . 
  machines replacing men made for a feedback loop in which capital goods -- property that itself created value , like mechanical looms -- could produce more capital . 
  laborers were relegated to commodity roles , and as long as there was alway sufficient labor , wages would not rise . 
  if i understand marx 's take on communism , it was communal ownership of capital goods that was an important element , not communal ownership of all property . 
  the way to break that positive feedback loop from producing ever-wealthier elites was to force the people as a whole to be an element in this loop , for them to own those capital goods themselves . 
  now , as i understand it , both the ussr and china self-described as socialist : neither claimed to have ever actually achieved the ideal end goal of communism , but to have been in transition . 
  in practice , in each of these , agricultural land ownership was communalized , and ownership of many capital goods ( like factory machines ) were made collectively-owned . 
  on at least some chinese communal farms , early on , some basic items , like cups and plates , were communally-owned . 
  however , i do n't believe that the concept of one person having exclusive rights to an object ever completely vanished -- that is , if someone carved a piece of wood into a figurine , and someone else took it without their permission , regardless of what use was made of that figurine , this would still have been seen as having taken the property of the carver . 
  that is , at least in effect ( though the terminology may be different ) , individual ownership of goods that were not capital goods persisted through both the ussr and china . 
  is that more-or-less an accurate summary ? 
  i do n't think we have any of those . 
  the [ british ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_agincourt ) have been [ waiting for this day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jack_churchill ) for a long time now ... 
  from the article : * minor increase in frequency . 
  * not violating alaskan airspace . 
  * generally not entering us adiz . 
  * `` sophistication increase '' . 
  eh , they 're entitled to be as sophisticated as they want . 
  here 's my understanding , from a skim of the sources : nuclear winter is n't driven by the nuclear explosion , but by normal fires started by the nuclear explosion . 
  those fires will generate soot . 
  any soot will block sunlight and cause cooling . 
  the question is one of how much soot will make it up to the stratosphere , since particles that make it into the stratosphere will tend to remain there for much longer ; it is this long-term presence that creates the `` nuclear winter '' . 
  some soot is going to make it up no matter what ; the question is how much . 
  very large volcanos have been able to blast significant amounts of material material this high and had a global cooling effect , though conventional fires ( even very large brushfires/wildfires ) have generally not had such an effect . 
  you will see a cooling effect from smoke , certainly ; the question is one of how much and how long it lasts , and that depends on the mass that makes it into the stratosphere . 
  i 'd think that this would be a really good time to form a new political party in greece . 
  i doubt that opportunities like this -- with all the incumbents being thrown out -- come along terribly-often . 
   or to waste effort defending a questionable regime against another questionable regime . 
  is it the regime that 's interesting , or the country and people ? 
  i guess that vichy france was n't a terribly-admirable regime , but the uk still went to bat for france in and after world war ii . 
   while russian president vladimir putin denied using athens to sow discord within the eu . 
  no submission yet to / r/russiadenies yet . 
  ah , thanks !, 
  well , i imagine that different countries have different laws . 
  i was n't trying to make a legal claim , though : i was saying that while the fact that russian missiles were used to shoot down a civilian airliner might be tragic , it 's not something that i 'd get nearly as worked-up over as if russia intentionally shot down the plane . 
  switching back to the unrelated issue of legality : in the united states , killing someone is n't always going to send someone to jail ( i.e. 
  self defense is a defense ) but it 's certainly possible to kill someone accidentally and wind up in jail ( e.g. 
  [ involuntary manslaughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manslaughter#involuntary_manslaughter ) ) . 
  intent does matter , as that would separate manslaughter from murder . 
   the uk alone has enough nuclear missiles to cause a nuclear winter , if all of them were launched at once , which would wipe out life on this planet as we know it . 
  my understanding is that there is not a consensus that the entire world 's nuclear arsenals going off would be sufficient to cause nuclear winter ; it depends upon the height to which smoke from fires set off by the weapons actually rises . 
   we are n't using gold here , we can pay pensions out of fiat . 
  expanding the money supply does n't generate new real wealth . 
  it just says `` increase the number of counters for the existing finite store of real wealth denominated in my currency out there , and add the new counters to me '' . 
  you can use it to shift real wealth from whoever is holding euros to whoever has been given those euros , but you can not use it to generate more real wealth . 
  and the issue here is a lack of real wealth : there actually are n't enough younger people producing * stuff * to both keep their standard of living acceptable and also provide older people with welfare to keep their standard of living elevated . 
  well , i can automate anything in theory , but i can also cure any disease in theory , and we sure still need doctors . 
  `` in theory '' is n't necessary very well-connected to what actually happens . 
  * immigration . 
  this is ... dubiously sustainable , but maybe . 
  * drop post-1950s roles for women ; we were doing okay back then population-wise . 
  i 'm sure social conservatives would love this . 
  alternatively , switch up gender roles . 
  this effectively cuts the standard of living in order to free up resources for parenting . 
  * provide more subsidies to reduce financial pressure on parents . 
  * reduce the role of the family , and make the state take over child-rearing to reduce time pressure on parents . 
  * do what the nobility once did with nannies and similar : hire professionals to rear children , scaling up . 
  like the above , but private enterprise fills the role of state . 
  * change the expectations of parenthood ( maybe we expect parents to devote too many of their resources just to children today ? ), 
  there are a lot of options available ; it 's not just `` immigration or nothing '' . 
  however , immigration clearly does work ( though certainly it has its own set of side effects , which might be objectionable ) . 
   you 're supposed to have kids because you want someone who you can love and care for . 
  that 's just sort of asserting that a particular set of values exists . 
  for those of us who * are n't * familiar with romanian-transnistrian-moldovan-russian politics , what is the few week window about ? 
  are there any eu organizations that assign power based on a per-state basis ? 
  it would be in the political interests of romanians and moldovans for moldovans to be in a separate country in the eu , were that the case . 
   is there an ethnic and/or cultural difference between a ~ ~ moldovan ~ ~ x and a ~ ~ romania ~ ~ y ? 
  almost certainly depends upon who you ask and context . 
   pretty rich coming from a country that has the exact same real gdp now as you did in 2009 . 
  maybe i 'm not understanding you . 
  you 're saying that greece 's gdp today was the same as germany 's in 2009 ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_greece  the economy of greece is the 43rd or 50th largest in the world at $ 242 billion or $ 283 billion by nominal gross domestic product or purchasing power parity respectively , according to world bank statistics for the year 2013 . 
  the chart you lists places germany at over an order-of-magnitude of that in 2009 , right ? 
  i 'm happy to criticize russia where it 's stepped wrong , but that seems like a thin chain of blame . 
  that was a horrible accident , and the really lame cover-up did n't help , but it was pretty-clearly an accident . 
  russia has no reason to want dutch airliners to be shot down . 
   both the us and the su were thrust into imperialistic roles following wwii , whereas both were born out of a rejection of imperialistic values ehhhh ... the us has its fingers in a lot of politics around the world , but i 'd call the us much less-imperialist post-wwii . 
  * after world war ii , the us gave the phillipines their independence , which it had acquired during its one real push into overseas annexation of territory .
