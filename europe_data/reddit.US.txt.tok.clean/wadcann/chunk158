  < shrug  i 'm no economist , but i 'd say that one of the following will happen : * ** germany does n't spend the money it 's making on imports . 
  ** germans delight in german products and have no interest in anything else , but out of sheer joy of craftsmanship , keep exporting mercedes automobiles to the rest of europe and getting nothing in return . 
  germans become wealthy in euro terms but poor in living standards . 
  mercedes automobiles eventually become so expensive that nobody else can afford them , shutting off the export tap . 
  germany 's real wealth is slowly redistributed to everyone who holds real assets , since germans insist on holding their wealth in the form of the euro , which is a depreciating asset . 
  the balance is maintained . 
  * ** like the above , but germany lends out its money . 
  ** then you 've got exports ; it just happens to be in the form of really cheap credit in euros that 's always available , as germans are trying to avoid having their real wealth evaporate . 
  the balance is maintained . 
  * ** germans start buying more foreign stuff . 
  ** germans can lounge around and drink lots of beer that someone in belgium spends their time working to brew , the same as belgians were enjoying automobiles that germans had to spend their time working to build . 
  the balance is maintained . 
  these outcomes just do n't seem all that exciting or dangerous to me . 
  note that bernanke does not currently represent the united states in any capacity , though under bush he spent a while as chairman of the federal reserve . 
  fair-enough ; north korea also seems to use rather large peaked hats . 
  i was referring to the fact that `` ireland '' the country does n't map to ireland the island due to the chunk that 's still part of the uk , and the island is commonly-used to define `` the irish '' .

   the problem with defending the purity of the english language is that english is about as pure as a cribhouse whore . 
  we do n't just borrow words ; on occasion , english has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and riffle their pockets for new vocabulary .

  i do n't know if foreign exchange reserves need to hit zero for problems to come up ( i.e. 
  some impacts are presumably from businesses anticipating that it will hit zero , or anticipating that other businesses will anticipate that it will hit zero , etc ) , and , [ * the economist * ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/12/russias-foreign-exchange-reserves ) says that some of that is is in illiquid form that russia could n't immediately use if need be , but it 's still hundreds of billions . 
  they 've got a couple years under current trends before foreign exchange reserves run out . 
  well , define what you mean by `` western world '' and it can be answered . 
  [ western world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_world ) :  specifically , western culture may imply :  * a biblical christian cultural influence in spiritual thinking , customs and either ethic or moral traditions , around the post-classical era and after . 
    * european cultural influences concerning artistic , musical , folkloric , ethic and oral traditions , whose themes have been further developed by romanticism . 
    * a graeco-roman classical and renaissance cultural influence , concerning artistic , philosophic , literary , and legal themes and traditions , the cultural social effects of migration period and the heritages of celtic , germanic , slavic and other ethnic groups , as well as a tradition of rationalism in various spheres of life , developed by hellenistic philosophy , scholasticism , humanisms , the scientific revolution and enlightenment . 
  is that what you 're referring to ? 
  you mean the automobiles were driven by gypsies as well ? 
  i think that / u/crocodile92 was referring to the automobiles on the wrong side of the road , not just the horses . 
  lots of non-soviet countries have [ peaked caps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peaked_cap ) as well :  the peaked cap originated in early 19th century northern europe , usually worn by working class men . 
  in the later years of the napoleonic wars , it began to appear in the senior ranks of the russian and prussian armies , being popular because of its comfort and light weight , as opposed to the cumbersome bicorns and shakos that were standard duty issue . 
  during the biedermeier period ( 1815 -- 48 ) , they became universal dress for german and austrian civilian males of all classes , and for the entire 19th century , they were popular with the working classes all over northern europe , although in britain the flat-top cap was preferred towards the end of the century . 
  [ citation needed ]   in 1846 , the united states army adopted the peaked cap during the mexican-american war due to the unsuitability of the shako in the hot mexican climate . 
  in 1856 , a form of peaked cap was adopted by petty officers of the royal navy , in imitation of an undress headdress worn by officers from as early as 1827 . 
  the british army adopted peaked caps in 1902 for both the new khaki field dress and ( in coloured form ) as part of the `` walking out '' or off duty wear for other ranks . 
  a dark blue version was worn with dress blues by all ranks of the u.s. army between 1902 and 1917 . 
  [ citation needed ]   during the 20th century , the combination or peaked cap became a common headdress in the armies , navies , air forces , and law enforcement agencies of the world , especially for officers . 
  as a relatively practical and smart item , it also became popular for police forces , largely supplanting helmets and kepis .

  the only issues with corruption i see listed are by his competitors :  in 1927 , koch developed a more efficient thermal cracking process for turning crude oil into gasoline which allowed smaller players in the industry to better compete with the oil majors . 
  the larger oil companies quickly sued in response , filing 44 different lawsuits against koch , and embroiling him in litigation for years . 
  koch was to prevail in all but one of the suits ( which was later over-turned due to the fact that the judge had been bribed ) .

  just to keep this in context : * this is a summary without direct quotes ... * ... which came from a * reference * to the use of nuclear force . 
  * not seen directly by the newspaper in question , but obtained by * the times * . 
  * which in turn came from notes taken an unspecified private meeting between russian and us officials by an unnamed american ... * ... of words spoken by some unknown russian who may-or-may not have policy-setting power , may-or-may-not actually have knowledge of russian plans , and who may-or-may-not have been intending to bluff . 
  i 'm all for criticizing russia when it deserves it , but this is a thin thread to be getting upset over . 
  i 've no doubt that there 's some kernel of truth here , but i suspect that the actual event may not quite warrant the reaction here . 
  authors want to make their articles as exciting as possible . 
  travel through one note-taker and two newspapers without references to original sources , and you 're on thin ice . 
  if russia really wanted to use the threat of nuclear weapons as a deterrent ( and it would n't be * telling * people about it if it were planning on a surprise attack ) , then it has every reason to broadly-announcing that threat itself and make any nuclear lines in the sand very clear to the entire world itself . 
   furthermore , the appearance of putin and kim together , heads of two states targeted by economic sanctions , creates a provocative image of anti-western solidarity . 
  in blunter terms , it is another jab to the battered body of the west .
