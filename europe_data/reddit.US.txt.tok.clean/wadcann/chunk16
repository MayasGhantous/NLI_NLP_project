  in practice , the us is n't conforming to the convention , and i suspect that most countries ignore it to greater or lesser degree in their policies . 
  i do n't think that it 's truly realistic for countries to conform to it without modification in a world where entire countries may be depopulated , cheap transport exists , and such massive income disparities exist . 
  either the bar for granting refugee status must be raised higher than is presently the case , the convention must permit limits that do not currently exist , some of the financial incentives must be removed ( e.g. 
  the same movement/work status granted refugees as is granted any foreigner working in a country ) , or something else must happen that increases the difficulty/cost of traveling from country to country ( if countries are simply to rely on the difficulty of application ) . 
  the risk from current countries is not currently an existential one ( though asylum granted now may be quite expensive over time in various ways ) . 
  however , in the long run , simply granting the ability to live , work , and move around europe to anyone from a country with a war is simply not viable today . 
  what happens if india or china see a war in which people with some political affiliation are executed ? 
  under the refugee convention , a country to which anyone applies for asylum must take them in , even if they all choose to apply to one ... and yet , it is clear that the country can not bear this burden . 
  i assume -- without expertise in eu politics -- that eu farm subsidies exist to buy off numerous small-scale farmers , who used to have barriers to trade subsidizing them . 
  they should go away once enough farms go out of business and merge to cut the number of people voting based on farm subsidies to drop far enough and reduce political clout of the farm lobby . 
  [ that * is * happening ] ( http://www.momagri.org/uk/agriculture-s-key-figures/the-average-size-of-french-farms-is-135-acres_1070.html ) :  between 1970 and 2010 , the average size of french farms rose to 135 acres from 52 acres resulting in a decline in the number of farms from 1.6 million to 490,0002 . 
  that would make the farm subsidies a political necessity for the moment . 
  also , i 'd argue that the extent to which the hungarian-serbian fence works is because there 's another way around . 
  it 's not going to just stop a flood of people cold -- it might be able to divert them a bit out of the way . 
  even just before joining the danube , the drava looks like it 's something like ( eyeballing it ) 150m . 
  if you can swim or have something that floats , that 's certainly quite doable . 
  http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/china-eyes-land-giveaway-program-in-russias-far-east/  russian president vladimir putin has offered his support to a `` homestead act '' that will offer free land to anyone willing to move to russia 's far east , russian media reported last week . 
  putin wants to avoid china starting to establish a population in the area . 
  syrians probably are n't actually a terrible choice . 
  i have a hard time seeing anyone wanting to go from finland to russia , though . 
  augh , a png of photographs reduced to 256 colors ? 
  i thought that we were past those days ... 
  i do n't see anything there that addresses blasphemy , though . 
  when / u/johnr83 posted his initial post , i hit pew to see if they had anything up and related , and turned up these as well . 
  none of the listed ones seem to address support for blasphemy law . 
  the closest i see would be the percentage that support sharia law ( which i assume would necessarily incorporate blasphemy restrictions ) , and that 's not supported by a majority :  59 % of muslims would prefer to live under british law , compared with 28 % who would prefer to live under sharia law, 
  the bible spends a lot more time hammering on [ heretics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heresy ) ( believers who advocate for different interpretations ) or [ apostates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apostate ) ( believers who renounce their religion ) than non-believers . 
  then wait for criticism from the eu and say `` see , the eu hates serbia ? '', 
  actually , there have been very real use of population movement to create very real changes : [ russification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification ) on the part of the soviet union to lock in pieces of europe , or the less-forced us [ homestead acts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homestead_acts ) to ensure rapid expansion , annexation , and solid control of land . 
  well , they 're ships with the same role and similar specifications . 
  i 'd kinda expect that if the pohjanmaa could do the job , so could either of the other two . 
  now , as i said , i 'll certainly admit that they might already have other obligations in the baltic . 
  hmm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalism  nationalism involves national identity , by contrast with the related concept of patriotism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_identity  national identity is the sense of a nation as a cohesive whole , as represented by distinctive traditions , culture , language and politics . 
  a person 's national identity is his/her identity and sense of belonging to one state or to one nation , a feeling one shares with a group of people , regardless of one 's legal citizenship status . 
  scientists see national identity in psychological terms as `` an awareness of difference '' , a `` feeling and recognition of ` we ' and ` they ' '' . 
  [ 1 ]   national identity is not an inborn trait , various studies [ which ? ], 
  have shown that a person 's national identity results directly from the presence of elements from the `` common points '' in people 's daily lives : national symbols , language , national colours , the nation 's history , national consciousness , blood ties , culture , music , cuisine , radio , television , and so on . 
  [ citation needed ] i dunno , i think that people in the us have a national identity , and i do n't think that it is particularly harmful . 
  i admit that i 'm not as familiar with turkey . 
  the problem is that , as flawed and imprecise as `` left '' and `` right '' are , it 's useful to have some sort of basis for international comparison . 
  you want to have * some * kind of starting point so that you do n't have to describe a political party in a country from the ground up each time . 
  maybe a couple more dimensions are required to capture most things . 
  often being `` right-wing socially '' is n't connected to being `` right-wing fiscally '' , and being a hawk is often disconnected from both . 
  i do n't think that nationalism implies any particular political details . 
  the us is pretty nationalist . 
  turkey is pretty nationalist . 
  probably a bunch of other countries that are pretty nationalist . 
  i have a hard time blaming muslims in africa and the arab countries for europeans not having children . 
  what are they supposed to do , somehow force europeans to have more children ? 
  got ta start throwing the euro bull up on things the way the us does the bald eagle . 
   all cultures are equally valid/good ... it 's not true while i agree with you -- it 'd be very strange for that to be the case -- i 'd also point out that i think that people have historically exhibited a bias towards over-valuing their own culture relative to that of others -- the idea of a `` barbarian '' is pretty common . 
  it 's easy to overlook plusses and focus on negatives . 
  for example , i think that mormonism is pretty silly , but in many ways , the followers enjoy practical benefits ( avoid alcoholism , for example ) . 
  what 's your beef with [ shinto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shinto ) ? 
  source ? 
  it 's not totally clear to all , i think , what `` meta '' means in the sidebar . 
  not sure that there 's a good fix , but i still think that you 're going to be manually-removing a lot of posts and putting them in / r/europemeta . 
  [ exactly ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/the_great_gatsby_curve.png ) . 
  the us would be a terrible place to immigrate to . 
  much better options out there , like denmark , finland , spain , and the rest of them . 
  that 's '' [ tim hortons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tim_hortons ) '' . 
  well , let 's take a step back ... whose fault is it that we exist as an independent country ? 
  checkmate , france !, 
  i 'm not sure how representative of the whole a single interview is . 
  really need some polling to get a representative picture . 
  well , if you 're a little kid with short legs and it 's in boots and mud , and going uphill or downhill ( they 're clearly climbing a hill in the picture ) it 's not quite like an adult on dry pavement on flat ground , though . 
  croatia has a large border with serbia . 
  i ca n't imagine that they 'd fence the whole thing . 
  though , granted , i was surprised by hungary fencing their serbian border too . 
   the problem with this however is that the refugees want to choose the country they go to , this makes it impossible for the governments to spread them as the refugees will force their will by violence , as you can see at the hungarian border . 
  second , the refugees refuse to abide by the rules and laws in place . 
  the dublin rules clearly state that they must be registered in the first eu-country they enter , which they have refused . 
  to be fair , the `` i want to diffuse '' and the `` i want to put refugees in the first country they come to '' requirements kind of conflict . 
  i propose that all of you increase erasmus funding , have a lot of sex and kids across national lines for two generations or so and then stop arguing about it afterwards because the problem 's no longer visible . 
  i heard of one instance in the news , where people wound up in a small village instead of a city . 
  there are more ? 
  eh , you 're only going to hear recordings of the worst . 
  the other ones wo n't make the news . 
  `` land of freedom ? 
  oh , easy error to make . 
  you wanted the united states . 
  there 's a ship heading over there right now , just hop aboard . '', 
  other than being right-wing libertarian , what in the above describes paul ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that he 's protestant rather than catholic , he is n't anti-semitic , he 's definitely not monarchist , and ... actually , i was n't even aware that anti-freemasonry was a thing , but when i hit google , all i see is a couple pages accusing him and his dad of being freemasons . 
  i 'm not arguing that they can not be permitted to lose money because that would be somehow wrong . 
  i 'm pointing out that they 've sunk a lot into this , and are unlikely to be willing to just abandon the journey ; using the same policies elsewhere as well may not work . 
   the problem is , if you leave it up to the market it just does n't happen . 
  what are the grounds to say that ? 
  why ca n't higher pay and less guaranteed holidays * be * that mutually-preferred form of compensation ? 
  honestly , what weirds me out is more the fact that [ ireland has blasphemy law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law_in_the_republic_of_ireland ) . 
  laws against purchasing sex are much more common . 
   `` unhcr reiterates its call on the the hungarian authorities to ensure unimpeded access for people in need of protection in line with its legal and moral obligations , `` the un high commissioner for refugees , ant\u00f3nio guterres , said today . 
  `` states should manage their borders in a way that is consistent with international and eu law , including guaranteeing the right to seek asylum , '' guterres added . 
  i do n't see in any way that having open borders is required to fulfill hungarian legal obligations ( moral obligations are less-well-defined and certainly an open argument ) . 
  hungary is n't refusing asylum applications -- it 's simply blocking illegal traffic through the country . 
  it 's under no legal requirement to provide the latter , and it is providing the former . 
  if employees and employers are both free to set and accept their terms in a market , i 'd expect them to find an optimal balance of return and reward with respect to each other . 
  i 'm not enthusiastic about * forcing * one or the other to particular terms . 
  i 'm not as interested about the nursing example , because this could reasonably be called just a pay raise for state-funded workers : it 's not showing that the outcome is preferable .
