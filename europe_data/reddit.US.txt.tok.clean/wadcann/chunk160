  when nicolas sarkozy and i were both still interior ministers , i proposed him abandon the interpreters at meetings of the council in brussels . 
  but he was concerned that the english take advantage . 
  i retorted that it would be more inconvenient for them because we will be destroying their language ... * ''   without returning to the poverty of the concepts conveyed by this globish ( see my other papers on the subject ) , one of the major problems of this forced march anglicized is that it does not correspond to reality outside the european bubble . 
  who speaks perfect english in europe , outside the british ( who totally do not care about europe ) and ireland ? 
  few people , apart from the elites who were educated in britain or the united states . 
  it suffices to note that the inhabitants of a country mainly looking for internet content in their native language . 
  outside the european bubble , english remains a largely foreign language . 
    or english only language of europe is not only an internal reality to the institutions , but also externally . 
  fewer texts ( outside the guidelines and regulations published in all languages in the oj ) are available in a language other than english . 
  '' * if the french still ( carefully ) respected in daily briefings of the european commission it is not the same in the publication of various papers ( official or the press ) as the various european websites that are predominantly or exclusively in english , `` notes the aje . '', 
  some sites are entirely in english such as dg `` internal market '' or `` migration home affairs '' , such as frontex . 
  some releases are only available in english - even when they are intended for francophone areas - . 
  it is the same number of institutions reporting . 
  point all the more worrying when these questions concern matters of primary concern for our fellow citizens .

   on 13 may 2013 , german media reported that the eurohawk would not be certifiable under icao rules without an anti-collision system ; thus preventing any operations within european airspace or the airspace of any icao member . 
  [ 38 ] [ 39 ] the additional cost of certification was reported to be more than $ 600 million ( us$ 780 million ) . 
  [ 40 ] on 15 may 2013 , the german government announced the immediate termination of the program , attributing the cancellation to the certification issue . 
  [ 41 ] reportedly , the additional cost to develop the eurohawk to the standards needed for certification may not have guaranteed final approval for certification . 
  [ 42 ] if you 're gon na mandate an anti-collision system , you got ta approve an off-the-shelf cheap system to do everything up to issuing the avoidance commands , or you 're going to have a hard time doing inexpensive drone development . 
  he 's just kinda cynical about the status of pan-european military affairs ( not without reason , mind ... ) i am enthusiastic about drones in general . 
  they 're far-cheaper to develop and test and operate than manned aircraft , and their losses can be much-more-acceptable . 
  there 's immense room for improvement : the drone is a platform that you can tack whatever onto . 
  i 'd advocate pushing for a standard hardpoint interface ( the sort of thing that nato did with firearm ammunition across nato members ) . 
  conform to given drag , weight , and electronic interface standards , and you can be mounted on any drone . 
  hell , get the us onboard too . 
  that way , munitions and other add-on providers can sell their products independently of the system as a whole . 
  just getting a drone up and going is n't terribly-complicated ; college students regularly do projects with them . 
  well , eurovision was a success . 
  do a `` brief history of country '' video contest and get all sorts of people jumping in . 
  the witcher game series is also based on a book series by [ andrzej sapkowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrzej_sapkowski ) , a polish author . 
  the video game series the witcher was developed by the polish game development house [ cd projekt red ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cd_projekt_red ) . 
  finally , the video game series was published for electronic sale via gog.com on [ gog ltd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gog.com ) , a polish e-retailer owned by the above development house . 
  much polish attached to that series . 
  aw , thanks poland !, 
   all this suits mrs merkel 's style . 
  she exercises patience , waiting for greece to see sense on economic reform and britain to resolve its domestic problems . 
  she took a risk in pursuing the minsk peace deal with russia because the situation in eastern ukraine had become desperate . 
  yet she has eschewed calls from american senators to send arms , instead comparing the situation to the long wait for the berlin wall to come down . 
  this appears to mean she is prepared to see the conflict `` frozen '' . 
  if mr obama was once accused of leading from behind , mrs merkel sometimes leads from a direction no one else can understand . 
  it 's worth pointing out that while the wall did fall , it also required 40 years to do so . 
   without our support it would desintegrate in two weeks , zero doubt . 
  how much real aid have nato members given ukraine ? 
  blankets , clothing , a few used jeeps , a couple of counter-artillery radars ? 
  probably some intelligence information . 
  some ( relatively small ) loans and grants . 
  i 'm sure that they 're appreciated , but that really are n't all that much . 
  on the flip side , the separatists would n't have any meaningful ability to fight kiev without russian involvement . 
  i 'd guess that any modern-day airborne operation is going to happen at night . 
  a skim shows the last major airborne operation that the us did ( not that they 're very common ) was [ operation northern delay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_northern_delay ) in 2003 , which [ happened at night ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sinkaxfcmi8 ) . 
  i 'm guessing that most military campaigns in the region have been in summer , though . 
   i do n't understand why americans itt are getting butthurt when people answer `` would you move to another continent ? '', 
  with `` no . '', 
  i 'm fine with `` no '' , but a lot of the responses are `` no , because x '' , where x is n't actually what the us is like . 
  the best response i 've seen so far ( and it was voted highly ) was `` no , because i do n't like driving '' . 
  that 's indeed an * excellent * reason : the us really * is * a car-centric culture , and if you do n't like driving , where you can live is extremely-limited . 
  / u/donvito specifically wanted to go build a cabin and have his dog and a gun , which is certainly a staple of the backcountry . 
  but things like `` my kids will get mowed down by a spree killer at school '' or some of the ideas about medical expenses feels like people derived their view of what the us is like from reading a political advocacy blog . 
  if i was going to provide feedback , i 'd say : * guns * really * are not that big a deal as an element of day-to-day life for most people . 
  they 're one of the bigger ideological differences , but everyone is n't typically whipping out their weapons every five minutes . 
  people do n't just go around shooting people : homicide deaths tend to be tied up with a few specific areas , like dealing drugs . 
  * the major thing i remember from a friend , a german guy who worked in the us for a while , was that the houses all feel big , new , and chintzy ; he was used to older , stone houses that had been around for a long time and would last a long time . 
  * in most places , bicycles are not really terribly practical as a general-purpose mode of transport . 
  you will drive or you will live in one of a very few areas ( san francisco , new york city ) . 
  * automatic transmissions are in the overwhelming majority of cars , the cars are larger , and you can start driving at a younger age . 
  * you ca n't drink alcohol as soon , though . 
  * air conditioning is the norm . 
  * corner groceries are comparatively-rare ( an artifact of a car culture , probably ) . 
  you are more-likely to make less-common , longest-distance grocery trips to large superstores . 
  * [ job , particularly in technology , tend to pay rather more in the us ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/dbm/m3/2011/downloads/rht_2015_salary-guide.pdf ) . 
  * nationalism is n't viewed in anything like the negative way it is in europe . 
  * i guess that this does n't have that much impact on day-to-day life , but a lot of boys in the us get circumcised for non-religious reasons . 
  this is changing ... 
  they 're [ still occupying part of maine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/machias_seal_island ) . 
  wearing shoes in the house * broadly * speaking is n't usually a huge deal in the us , but it is in east asia , and if you visit someone whose family is from east asia , they may be unhappy about you wearing shoes in the house . 
  i think i remember an / r/europe thread where people described whether-or-not wearing shoes in the house was okay , and it was sort of a patchwork by region as well . 
   where people do n't constantly shout at doctors in hospitals that they 're going to sue them that ... has n't happened in any hospitals that i 've been in where i was there . 
   governments do n't want to look into your pants ? 
   nationalism is n't celebrated in all of the media and on the streets well , there you 've got us . 
   every issue is n't viewed through the prism of politics ehhh ... i admit that / r/usa bans politics , and / r/europe does n't . 
  that being said , my day-to-day conversations really are n't all that political . 
   people are n't career and celebrity-obsessed well , career is hard-to-measure , but i guess i 'd believe that . 
  celebrity-obsessed ... i dunno . 
  when i look at tabloid news sites , ( * the sun * seems about as celebrity-loving as * huffington post * ) . 
   every issue does n't have to become polarized by a twin-party system well , that 's true -- you probably wo n't typically-see a two-party view . 
   random idiots do n't have weapons , so you do n't have to be worried some idiot is going to run in a killing spree through your kids ' school < checks 2014 statistics  you have about twice as much chance of dying from bee attacks as you do school shootings . 
  how panicked do you get about bee attacks ? 
  remember the `` banksters '' back during the financial crisis in the us ? 
  where people were defaulting on mortgages and saying that bankers should be killed ? 
  i remember that . 
  in historical europe , christians were banned from lending money for interest ( usury was a sin ) so jews filled the void and became major players in finance . 
  hence you 've got some sort of jews = = bankers thing going on . 
  now imagine how much less-friendly the us people yelling ( sincerely or not ) that bankers should be killed would be if those bankers all belonged to a different ethnic group , race , spoke a different language , lived apart , etc. 
  my best explanation for the history of the populist anti-jewish stuff . 
  and then there 's just the plain old religious and cultural clashes : even today , in a relatively-secular world , muslims hit friction . 
   so even those germans that fought against hitler , they are also to blame for the rise of hitler ? 
  ones who backed , say , the spd ? 
  sure , the same as members of opposition political parties still bear responsibility for what leaders wind up doing , and they did : they wound up paying huge reparations for what happened . 
  germans who emmigrated ?
