   you seem to be under the impression sovereign means democratic ... so the citizens of an authoritarian dictatorship are also to blame for their dictator . 
  no , i 'm saying that if the leader of a country uses that country 's resources , manpower , and influence to do something unpleasant , that in * any * government system , the citizens are responsible , even if it 's for the lack of successfully performing the much-harder-and-less-pleasant task of rising up and booting that leader out of power . 
  democracies have the nice property that it 's ideally a lot easier to remove bad leaders , so a citizen can hopefully ensure that someone running up bills on their behalf can be more-easily removed before damage becomes too great , but living in a non-democracy does n't mean that the citizenry can ignore the consequences . 
  war reparations and the costs of embargos were suffered by ordinary citizens in the era of monarchies as well . 
  yes , because that 's part of being a citizen of a country : if you elect ( or choose to accept ) leadership , you also have responsibility for their actions . 
  the germans were responsible ( and paid in the most severe terms ) for hitler 's actions , even though not each german was hitler . 
  the greeks were responsible for the actions of the greek government in the financial crisis . 
  changing governments afterwards might be a good idea in each case , but it does not absolve the citizens of a country from responsibility from the actions that their country took . 
  sovereign powers can operate without direct outside interference ; the flip side is that they bear responsibility for what happens if that freedom is used badly . 
  well , both show citizens ( well , one , in that picture ) cheering soldiers . 
  the hohenzollern pictures are of a germany that felt cut out of colonization trying to acquire more land for germany . 
  the ones today show foreign citizens cheering a defense alliance being honored by sending soldiers into an area that has been attacked twice now in the past few years . 
  in the first case , it 's pretty hard to argue that germany was n't trying to expand her lands . 
  in the second case , the troop movement is a response to russia trying to expand her lands . 
  i 've no doubt that soldiers of every nation were cheered in that war at some point ; the british soldiers were probably cheered when they showed up in france . 
  if the extent of the similarity is `` soldiers being cheered by citizens '' , then certainly than similarity does exist ; both know that soldiers might die , and that those soldiers were doing something that they saw as being in their interests . 
  but aside from that , i do n't think that german citizens cheering german troops at the dawn of world war i is terribly comparable , in terms of the world affairs involved , to polish citizens cheering nato troops moving into eastern europe after ukraine was attacked . 
  the risk might also be less background radiation and more ingesting radioactive particles ( the `` fallout '' ) . 
  you do n't want radioactive material in your body : a lot of radiation that your skin will stop will go do damage once it 's right up close and personal with your dna . 
  i did n't know that ... but also , when germany was falling , where would * you * want to go to surrender , if you have freedom of mobility ? 
  reclassify them as `` independent contractors '' and avoid minimum wage law entirely .

  there was the whole urbanization thing that affected most countries . 
  the swedes must really be hitting the pill hard to be managing both low condom use and low fertility rates . 
  that list is inaccurate , assuming you 're going by count of aircraft . 
  going from wikipedia , the list and associated count should be : | organization | aircraft count | | - | - | | united states air force | 5,638 | | [ united states army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_united_states_military_aircraft#army ) | 5,012 | | united states navy | 3,700 + | | [ russian air force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_air_force#aircraft_inventory ) | 3,493 | i 'm getting the russian air force numbers and the us army numbers by summing active aircraft wikipedia lists in their inventory , and the other two from the total aircraft count listed in the wikipedia article sidebar . 
  you may have seen an statement entitled `` the most * powerful * air forces in the world '' ; that 's more-debatable and depends on how you measure power , since a lot of the us army stuff is helicopters for ground attack , not air-to-air combat . 
  when it comes to larger aircraft count , though ... 
  note that the russian air force does have more aircraft than the remaining two united states military wings , the marines ( 1103 aircraft ) and the coast guard ( 205 aircraft ) . 
  if you 're objecting to ttip , nato actions are not predicated upon it . 
   and shows that eu does not hold them collectively responsible for the ukraine crisis i certainly hold russians collectively-responsible for the ukraine crisis . 
  a people * is * responsible for what its country does . 
  maybe not to such a great degree as particular individuals , but i do n't get to just say `` oh , that was bush , not me ... ca n't blame me for that '' when someone complains about iraq being attacked . 
  ehhh ... i mean , obviously it 's absurd in the context of someone brute-forcing a password somewhere ; the world would just devolve into permanent war . 
  on the other hand , what if , for example , someone redirected a gps-guided ship into an ammunition ship and destroyed the two ? 
  certainly the technology to do this exists now , and it would be on par with an armed attack . 
  on the other hand , stuxnet disabled an enemy nuclear program , which is about as high profile as you can get without actually killing someone . 
  if we treat computer security violations as an act of war , the us and israel have really committed an act of war against iran . 
   mr wainwright said that in most current investigations the use of encrypted communications was found to be central to the way terrorists operated .

  now let 's see if we can get the general public onboard too .

  i 'm not sure that i agree with all the points . 
  one claim that he made was that politicians did n't understand military realities , and so they set up situations that made the ukranian army vulnerable . 
  an example was withdrawing artillery by a certain distance that * could * be raced over . 
  i do n't think that the goal was to fully-prevent all possible surprise attacks , but to create a situation where intentional force movement would be required , where an individual at an artillery piece could n't be starting a conflict . 
  it may be a bad idea or counterproductive , but i 'm sure that that was vetted with military leaders before being proposed . 
  i also did n't see -- maybe because the presentation ran long and was cut off -- what the implications in the long term were . 
  how should this be appropriately-countered ? 
  what is the risk ? 
  are these tactics actually new ? 
  surely non-uniformed organization in the advent of an invasion is n't really new : d-day had [ the french resistance cutting communication and transport systems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normandy_landings#coordination_with_the_french_resistance ) . 
  the one really concrete takeaway i got was the recommendation that tandem warhead anti-tank guided missiles should be provided to ukraine .

  well , the ussr did a lot more bleeding than the us did . 
  that being said , crediting the ussr for beating germany is also different from being very enthusiastic about what happened when the ussr took over .

  well , we did [ authorize some privateers in the war of 1812 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_1812#privateering ) , and that 's a form of plundering . 
  i 'd guess that it showed up because the urals blocked population movement , and hence a rough split in human movement . 
  i 'd guess that this is the same reason that the term continent was probably used around water : because it tended to block free movement . 
  i really think that you 're getting overly-excited about the definition , though . 
  who cares whether north or south america are connected by a narrow strip or a thick strip ? 
  is it something to get excited and upset about ? 
  someone developed the terms at some point . 
  they happened to draw a line that made india ( somewhat smaller ) a subcontinent and europe ( somewhat larger ) a continent . 
  it does n't mean that somehow , your life needs to be lived drastically-differently because someone happened to draw the dividing line at that particular point . 
  it 's like the `` is pluto a planet ? '', 
  debate . 
  it 's just a definition : you draw a line and be done with it , and if you need a line somewhere else for some other application , you draw a new line and make up a new term . 
  language keeps whatever 's useful . 
  it 's useful for me -- heck , for this subreddit -- to have a convenient term for the area of land that exists in what we call europe . 
  hence , europe . 
  if it were n't useful , the term would dry up . 
  i wonder if putin 's primary concern is really acquiring land , or in doing a north korea : provoking a conflict that will ensure that the russian people see an appealing political and economic alternative as `` the enemy '' . 
   if the russian population gets richer , they will stop voting in lunatics , like in every other country i can think of . 
  seems plausible . 
  of course , a lot of us also thought that a market economy and a multi-party state went hand-in-hand , but china 's doing a pretty good job of demonstrating that that need not be the case . 
   we have to accept that the russian people are a product of decades of soviet propaganda and then decades of nationalist/putinist propaganda . 
  would n't that condemn estonia , latvia , and lithuania as well ?

   firstly , europe is not a continent . 
  in the us , for common-language use of the term , it is . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent  * the seven-continent model is usually taught in china , india , the philippines , parts of western europe and most english-speaking countries , including australia [ 25 ] and england [ 26 ]   * the six-continent combined-eurasia model is mostly used in russia , eastern europe , and japan . 
  they are the two european countries that really need the ability to defend islands around the world . 
  neither is at risk of an immediate land invasion , and both are relatively large economies .
