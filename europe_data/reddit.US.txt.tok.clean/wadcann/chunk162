   poland has ... . sorry , i do n't really know , but i am sure you are good at something based on this [ i-have-no-idea-how-particularly-applicable world conventional military power of countries at globalfirepower.com ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) , poland is # 19 of 126 listed countries . 
  the ranking index obviously is n't linear , mind , so but if it 's just intended to show the relative relationship of two countries ... < shrug , 
  awwww ... 
   pride in tradition europe has come to the ( arguably-correct ) conclusion that its biggest existential threat is war between its own countries . 
  that led to international cooperation and trade , but has also led to this strange-to-someone-from-the-us deemphasis of nationalism at the country level , where nationalism is viewed as a really bad thing . 
  unlike with states in the us , though , there has n't been much of something to replace it . 
  the eu might one day have that , but there 's no eu team at the olympics , no eu military . 
  i ca n't think of any widespread symbols other than the eu 's flag . 
  there is no animal of the eu , nothing like the us bald eagle , the russian bear , or the chinese panda . 
  merkel or hollande or tusk or whatever eu bureaucrat is currently acting on behalf of the eu does n't really fill the same disconnected-from-policy-and-transient-politicians role as a symbol . 
  the people of europe have closer family ties than those in the united states , yet , i 'd argue , not the same degree of tribalism . 
  i do n't think that pride-in-organization need just lead to conflicts with other organizations ; i think that it tends to lead to people wanting to keep the organization together . 
  i 'm kinda surprised that european federalists are n't off trying to create that sort of mental association . 
  some of the efforts in the us to establish nationalism were post-american-civil-war , when people were really concerned about splits , and were trying to re-create a sense of unity . 
  [ flag day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_day_%28united_states%29 ) and the [ pledge of allegiance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pledge_of_allegiance ) ( leaving whether the pledge is a good idea aside , for a moment ) arose from that post-civil war era where people were trying to re-establish a sense of unity . 
  in the time immediately-after the world wars , though , europe was n't in the kind of position to adopt federalist positions , and i suspect that this is why the closest equivalent era did n't see the same sort of action being taken . 
   one source of americans ' expectation that europe 's jews are packing their bags ... 
  i think that the author thinks that americans have a lot more-familiarity and concern with what jews in europe are doing than is actually the case . 
  i have the vague feeling that in estonia , this might be a little different than in the us , especially right now with putin using ethnic russians as an legitimization to become militarily-involved and separatism and all that . 
  broadly-speaking , it 's really not viewed negatively to describe someone in the us as being < blank  - american . 
  i do n't think that you 'd find a lot of modern-day agreement with the [ world war i statement from wilson on `` hyphenated americans '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyphenated_american ) . 
  i suspect that some of this is just because there are n't any threats to the us where someone might be viewed as somehow having divided loyalty that would somehow threaten the country . 
  regardless of the validity of the statement , i 'm not sure that pimco 's management is the most-objective source for such a judgment call . 
   europe is well about to leave the yanks behind and that 's what they are more afraid of than anything . 
  left behind militarily ? 
  well , i certainly ca n't speak for everyone in the us , but i suspect that the us leadership would be happy if european military efficacy went up , not unhappy . 
  < shrug  same reason to be in any alliance : it makes the individual members stronger relative to their individual contributions . 
  the downside is if it drags members into conflicts on the wrong side of things or that they disagree with , but broadly-speaking , nato operations and european interests seem reasonably well-aligned . 
  here 's wikipedia 's list of [ nato operations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_operations ) : * yugoslavia : while i 'm sure that serbia is unhappy here , europe did n't want to have a civil war raging on the continent . 
  even without nato , i suspect that european countries were n't going to just watch . 
  * afghanistan : the 9/11 attacks on the us taken in isolation were n't a core european concern , i guess , but countries operating as bases for asymmetric warfare against the developed world is : same reason that you will find nations generally banding together against terrorism , as it represents an issue for all of them . 
  i doubt that non-us countries would have become militarily-involved in afghanistan without nato , but on the other hand , it does n't seem like that is in significant conflict with the interests of any of those countries . 
  * pakistan disaster relief . 
  militaries are basically collections of relatively-fit men and women with the logistics capability to operate independently without infrastructure or resources for long periods of time . 
  that makes them pretty-well suited for disaster relief . 
  if you want to do disaster relief ( [ and many countries in the world did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_response_to_the_2005_kashmir_earthquake ) ) , they make sense for this . 
  * counter-piracy operations off somalia . 
  this is a core european concern , as threats to asia/europe shipping through the gulf of aden is no joke . 
  piracy is also one of the things that essentially all modern-day nations are in opposition to . 
  * libya . 
  as i recall , this was initiallly france 's concern . 
  i 'm too ignorant about the implications of gaddafi 's regime falling to understand who benefits . 
  an egyptian friend of mine * really * hated gaddafi ( apparently , gaddafi had a habit of funding rebellions around africa to destabilize various countries , and was seen as a problem-causer ) . 
  * turkey : providing missile defense against syria . 
  i do n't know who benefits , but does n't seem terribly-objectionable to any member ( maybe if countries were concerned about antagonizing russia ? ), 
  or both : the us has a unified military * and * is part of nato . 
  edit : unifying the military would presumably be an efficiency gain in exchange for giving up separate foreign policies . 
  that seems like a much-broader question than one of simply military procedure : it 's whether the people of the european union want federalization . 
  if so , then there will probably be a european union army . 
  if not , then there probably will not be ( though i 'd guess that cooperation and integration to some limited extent will probably happen incrementally anyway ) . 
  according to [ wikipedia : b\u00f6rek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%b6rek ) , it 's all over that region :  * ** turkey ** enjoys a wide variety of regional variations of b\u00f6rek [ not listing them all , but there 's apparently a large range , including both sweet and savory -- wadcann ]   * in ** albania ** , this dish is called byrek , burek , or lakror ; the most common fillings include : cheese ( especially gjiz\u00eb , a soft cheese similar to ricotta but salted ) , ground meat and onions ( rag\u00f9 style filling ) which is sometimes called mesnik in the south , spinach and eggs , milk and eggs with pre-baked dough layers , but it can also be made with tomato and onions , peppers and beans , potato or a sweet filling of pumpkin , nettles ( known as byrek me hithra ) , [ 12 ] etc   * ** arab ** burek is often stuffed with minced or diced lamb or beef , or a mixture of the two . 
  various herbs and spices are used to flavour the meat , including turmeric , fresh parsley and nutmeg , and concentrated pomegranate juice , which gives the mixture a unique sweet and tangy taste . 
    * in ** armenia ** , byorek ( \u0562\u0575\u0578\u0580\u0565\u056f ) or borek ( \u0562\u0578\u0580\u0565\u056f ) , consists of dough , or phyllo dough , folded into triangles and stuffed with cheese , spinach or ground beef , and the filling is typically spiced . 
    * ** assyrian ** * burek * is usually stuffed with spiced ground beef , though potatoes are also sometimes used instead . 
    * the ** bulgarian ** version of the pastry , locally called byurek ( cyrillic : \u0431\u044e\u0440\u0435\u043a ) , is typically regarded as a variation of banitsa ( \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 ) , a similar bulgarian dish . 
  bulgarian byurek is a type of banitsa with sirene cheese , the difference being that byurek also has eggs added . 
  [ 13 ]   * in ** greece ** and ** cyprus ** , boureki ( \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ad\u03ba\u03b9 [ bu\u02c8reki ] ) or bourekaki ( \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 [ bure\u02c8kaki ] , the diminutive form of the word ) , are small pastries made with phyllo dough or with pastry crust . 
  pastries in the b\u00f6rek family are also called pita : tiropita , spanakopita , and so on . 
    * in ** israel ** , bourekas ( hebrew : \u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05e7\u05e1 ) became popular as immigrants who settled there cooked the cuisine of their native countries . 
  bourekas can be found made from either phyllo dough or puff pastry filled with various fillings . 
  among the most popular fillings are salty cheese , mashed potato , mushrooms , spinach , eggplant and pizza-flavor . 
    * ** italy ** : in certain italian towns of emilia-romagna [ 17 ] that were formerly city-states such as ferrara and modena , there can still be encountered a half-moon shaped sweet pastry called burriche or burricche [ 18 ] which has been described as a mediaeval relic of the ottoman inspired cuisine of the jewish communities that lived in certain towns of the area . 
    * across the territories of former ** yugoslavia ** , burek is regularly available at most bakeries , and usually eaten as `` fast food '' . 
    * ** crimea ** : the tatar version , one of the national dishes of the crimean tatars , is called \u00c7ib\u00f6rek and is made from unleavened dough filled with ground lamb , onions and spices , fried in oil . 
    * ** moldova ** : the regional cuisine of the moldavian west bank of the pruth still yields a type of dumpling-like food called burechiu\u015fe ( sometimes called burechi\u0163e ) which is described as dough in the shape of a ravioli-like square which is filled with mushrooms such as boletus edulis , and sealed around its edges and then tossed and subsequently boiled in borscht like soups [ 33 ] or chorbas . 
    * brik ( pronounced breek ) is a ** tunisian ** and ** algerian ** derivative of the b\u00f6rek consisting of thin malsouka pastry around a filling commonly deep fried . 
  the best-known version is the egg brik , a whole egg in a triangular pastry pocket with chopped onion , tuna , harissa and parsley . 
    low powered pea shooter   while i ca n't speak for flimsy , the g36 shoots 5.56 \u00d7 45mm nato . 
  it 's called nato because it is the nato standard . 
  it 's used in the american m16 & m4 , british sa80 , french famas , belgian fn f2000 , etc. 
  it 's not completely the powder in the round that determines the round 's energy , to be fair . 
  a longer barrel will waste less of the energy , and the mechanism will consume some as well . 
  the m16 does have a slightly higher muzzle velocity , according to wikipedia 's numbers : * [ m16 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m16_rifle ) : 948 m/s * [ g36 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_g36 ) : 920 m/s, 
   the mg42 is indeed the heavy machine gun ... 
  note that `` heavy '' here is only in the sense of being heavier than the g3 . 
  it 's not a [ heavy machine gun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heavy_machine_gun ) . 
  [ and pulse lasers ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/10/us-navy-laser-weapon-video ) , though really , i think that it 's more-interesting as a potential missile defense system than anything else . 
   this incident proves that it is not all bad having a dysfunctional military . 
  the russian navy is still way ahead . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogger_bank_incident  the dogger bank incident ( also known as the north sea incident , the russian outrage or the incident of hull ) occurred on the night of 21/22 october 1904 , when the russian baltic fleet mistook some british trawlers in the dogger bank area of the north sea for an imperial japanese navy force and fired on them . 
  russian warships also fired on each other in the chaos of the mel\u00e9e . 
  [ 1 ] three british fishermen died and a number were wounded . 
  one sailor and a priest aboard a russian cruiser caught in the crossfire were also killed . 
  the incident almost led to war between britain and russia . 
  i suspect that most current military propeller-driven aircraft are [ turboprop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turboprop ) rather than [ piston engine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reciprocating_engine ) - driven , as the a-1 was . 
   as long as it 's not out of ( excessive ) patriotism . 
  you guys had better hurry up and federalize the eu so that we can get past this awkward stage and back to a proper , sensible state of affairs . 
  this `` no flags and patriotism is a dirty word because world wars '' situation has simply got-to-go .

   the hunger in usa that this would cause ignoring all existing us food surplus production and exports , and without increasing grain production , [ the us could feed the entire population of europe and have plenty of food left over by the simple expedient of not eating meat and instead using the grain directly for human food ] ( http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat ) . 
  might also solve the us 's obesity problem . 
  i would kind of like to see the original question asked and what the actual levels are . 
  that is , does this range from 49 % -52 % or from 10 % -90 % ? 
  for others who also did n't know , [ voivodeship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voivodeship ) . 
   poroshenko is a fucking boss . 
  he just turned it on and took it around for a spin . 
  the [ humvee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humvee ) , like the overwhelming majority of american vehicles ( [ currently somewhere north of 96 % ] ( http://www.fix.com/blog/manual-vs-automatic-transmissions/ ) ) , has an automatic transmission . 
  europe as a whole has about [ 20 % automatic transmissions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automatic_transmission#comparison_with_manual_transmission ) , and i 'm guessing that ukraine is on the low side of that scale .
