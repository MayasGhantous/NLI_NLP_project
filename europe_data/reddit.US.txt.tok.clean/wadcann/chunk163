  that humvee is probably significantly-easier to drive than the typical ukranian automobile on the street . 
  that being said , [ liberty maritime corporation ] ( http://libertymar.com/about.html ) apparently has military shipping as a big chunk of its business , and most of its other ship names would have slotted in pretty well too , like * liberty eagle * , * liberty glory * , * liberty dawn * , or * liberty destiny * . 
  they also apparently do us humanitarian aid food transfers , so i imagine that the ships do regularly get photographed when unloading on various us goodwill operations . 
  i am pretty sure that europe could win a conventional war against russia without outside aid , barring europe making major mistakes . 
  it would probably be a lot less-pleasant without the us and canada and turkey , and attempts to extort off slices of countries bordering russia in exchange for time might be more successful , but if all of europe pulled together , it 's simply more-powerful than russia : [ eu nations alone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_european_union ) have 507m people , russia 146m . 
  [ eu nations alone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union ) had $ 192.5 b in military spending in 2012 , russia $ 90.7 b in 2013 . 
  eu nations alone have 1.55 m active-duty military personnel . 
  russia has 771k . 
  `` desperate attempt to stay afloat '' with someone else 's money that should n't have been sent in the first place . 
  come on , * telegraph * . 
  that [ particular author 's headlines ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/mehreen-khan/ ) seem incapable of not having emotional loading packed into them , regardless of the target . 
  it might be [ `` greece pushes creditors to the edge as it demands eu summit talks '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11479304/greece-pushes-creditors-to-the-edge-as-it-demands-eu-summit-talks.html ) or [ `` ecb edges closer to pulling trigger on embattled greek banks '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11493101/european-central-bank-edges-closer-to-pulling-the-trigger-on-greece.html ) , but there always seems to be someone trying to * unjustly screw over someone else * being implied . 
   i still do n't agree with posting pics of military equipment in this sub and think it constitutes warmongering . 
  that 's a pretty low bar . 
  here 's a picture of some modern-day jeeps , and you 're war-mongering ? 
  but , hey , i 'll let the votes on the post decide . 
  [ milton friedman and the steel industry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em ) . 
  the us had a big debate over whether japan was dumping steel in the us decades back . 
  milton friedman gave a talk ( opposed to import tariffs ) then , which i think is a nice , simple summary . 
  for a low-marginal-cost-of-production item like ip being sold into a third-world country ? 
  in europe , maybe regulatory or other costs will drive things up , but ... 
  seems like it would have limited demand . 
  shipping is cheaper for bulk . 
  air is faster for long-range transport . 
  there 's not that much in alaska ( particularly far western alaska ) and even less for a long , long distance in russia . 
  maybe if you had something like a [ hyperloop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperloop ) in place , but the distances involved just do n't make much sense for a train . 
  so maybe those unbreakable cockpit doors were a bad idea after all . 
  a legacy of 9/11 , at least on some aircraft , but ... 
  i maintain that the 9/11 hijacking mechanism was solved about 45 minutes after the world trade center was hit : people stopped passively-sitting around , because they became aware of the consequences of doing so . 
  most people are good guys , and only sat there because that 's what someone was * supposed * to do in a hijacking . 
  if they did n't just sit around , hijackings would n't be possible . 
  [ flight 93 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_airlines_flight_93 ) was n't able to complete its run , and the hijackers would n't have even been able to crash it if the passengers and captain had had the information that only reached them after the cockpit was occupied . 
  air marshals , unbreakable doors , all the extra screening and monitoring ... honestly , those do n't really hold a candle to large numbers of decent people people simply not willing to be passively sitting around . 
  they 're regulatory solutions that show that someone is doing something , but they just are n't all that great as fixes . 
  i do n't think that / u/freefrench is assuming that , but certainly it 's now possible that that is what happened . 
  that could be a mess . 
  the [ religiously-motivated murder-suicide on egyptair flight 990 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egyptair_flight_990#reaction_of_the_egyptian_public ) had far-more-certain information than this , and the egyptian authorities * still * were adamant that it was a mechanical failure . 
  my guess is that that 's a common approach to provide for price discrimination , and price discrimination can make for more-efficient markets ( i.e. 
  if every nigerian has to pay us rates for a movie , no nigerian will be able to watch that movie ) . 
  i assume that it would never be raised as an explicit point , but most of the objection that i see on / r/europe to turkey being included in the eu seems to center around the idea of a large number of muslims being added to the eu . 
  i assume that this is at least somewhat representative of offline views in europe . 
  they are . 
  from the article :  warsaw meanwhile has begun a 10-year , usd 42 billion overhaul of its military . 
  poland alone would be pretty uncomfortable in a one-on-one with russia , though . 
  regardless of the motives , leaders making statements do have political consequences and legitimize positions . 
  that being said , if the eu is n't going to let turkey in for being islamic , seems like it 's hard to complain about turkey saying that the conflict is n't over ... 
  africa , asia , north america , south america , and australia are all out of commission ? 
  if you 're worried about that , [ your nation can stockpile non-perishable goods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bill_emerson_humanitarian_trust ) to use to address immediate needs , if you do n't think that the market can cover stockpiling in the event of a likely supply drop . 
  i probably have enough flour , beans , grain , and canned food just sitting around my residence to go for some months if i had to do so . 
  you may need to obtain less-desirable substitutes , but * no * available food on the world market is a pretty hard state to reach . 
  and who is to say that if you got to a state where all of the other continents in the world could not provide food , that europe * could * do so ? 
  war destroys fuel sources , electrical power , and other things that it 's hard for modern farms and food distribution systems to work without ; all your refrigerated trucks and warehouses with fans to blow off ethylene wo n't be working very well . 
  finally , even in that extreme case , humans also do n't * immediately * keel over ; i 've fasted for half a week before for the hell of it , and people * can * run for up to something like a month on average if they have to without food , though it wo n't be much fun . 
  north korea has seen famine not because north korea does n't have an agricultural industry , but because it 's too poor to import food . 
  you can always spend money preparing for one sort of disaster or another . 
  but `` worldwide unavailability of food to countries as well-to-do as those in europe and mass starvation '' seems like it would n't be very high on my list of concerns . 
  if fn 's support is over immigration , why do n't other parties adopt immigration caps ? 
   civilisation is perpetually three meals away from collapse . 
  europe is wealthy enough to buy itself food from other countries , though , and would probably be wealthier without distorting the agricultural market . 
  it means that chunks of europe are effectively being less-industrialized than they should be and land that could be used for more-useful pursuits is locked up in agriculture . 
  think about the cost in human time of educating every member of the public on the details and implications of even one policy . 
  * the article does not define `` lower '' and `` higher '' income groups . 
  the report defines them as deciles 1-5 and deciles 6-10 ; so this is the below-median and above-median groups . 
  * i 'd want to know how much the preceding unsustainable bubble benefited the below-median groups versus the above-median groups ; if you assume that those policies are likely to be rolled back , the impact is probably going to reflect that . 
  * give me your tired , your poor , * * your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , * * your legions of finnish girls in search of social interaction ... *, 
   it could n't stop or even slow down any serious effort by russia . 
  that 's not the purpose of having them there . 
  http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/tripwire  a comparatively weak military force employed as a first line of defense , engagement with which will trigger the intervention of strong forces . 
  it 's very politically-difficult for a country ( well , certainly for the us ) to back down from war after its soldiers have been attacked . 
  having them present is a way of increasing the credibility of a response ( to russia as well as the countries in question ) . 
  us forces reporting that they 'd been attacked in the [ gulf of tonkin incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_of_tonkin_incident ) touched off the vietnam war . 
  even relatively-minor incidents tend to result in substantial escalation , like the north korean axe murder incident , where two us soldiers were murdered and the north korean government refused to criticize the action , kicked off [ operation paul bunyan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axe_murder_incident#operation_paul_bunyan ) . 
  meaningless as legislation . 
  the previous things that actually allocated money to do so were meaningful . 
  this is just legislators in both major parties who know that the american people are enthusiastic about sending weapons to ukraine and want to soak up some of the popularity . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_air_force * two [ an-2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonov_an-2 ) biplane utility aircraft . 
  * two [ c-23 sherpa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_c-23_sherpa ) transports were apparently just given to estonia by the us , being built by the uk . 
  * two [ l-39 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aero_l-39_albatros ) jet trainers . 
  it looks like in theory ( not sure if these are so-equipped ; wikipedia says that no estonian air force aircraft are yet armed ) , these could carry light , short-range anti-air armament . 
  * four [ r44 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robinson_r44 ) light utility helicopters for training or reconaissance . 
   if something serious happens , we wo n't have time to set up radar facilities and maintenance facilities and all that shit . 
  i can understand maintenance , but i 'd assume that any rapid-response us air force units would be able to make use of [ awacs radar cover ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_e-3_sentry ) . 
  training to avoid incidents between anti-air latvian units and air us units might also be important , as / u/creepyoctopus points out . 
   if you leave russia alone it will spare you . 
  ukraine joining a trade agreement apparently was n't leaving russia alone . 
   as i went through the comments here , i kept thinking there 's an important point nobody seems to have said : most communist countries had a policy of faking their production reports as a matter of propaganda . 
  that compares before and after , not during communism . 
  granted , there might have been inertia in faking statistics in some places , but ... 
  that being said , if [ falklands war i tradition holds in the event of future conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falklands_war#position_of_third_party_countries ) , the uk wants to visibly demonstrate again that it can beat off invaders itself in any conflict , but accepts some non-public third party assistance to smooth the path :  the us provided the united kingdom with military equipment ranging from submarine detectors to the latest missiles . 
  [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] president ronald reagan approved the royal navy 's request to borrow the sea harrier-capable amphibious assault ship uss iwo jima ( lph-2 ) if the british lost an aircraft carrier . 
  the united states navy developed a plan to help the british man the ship with american military contractors , likely retired sailors with knowledge of the iwo jima ' s systems . 
  [ 35 ] france provided dissimilar aircraft training so harrier pilots could train against the french aircraft used by argentina . 
  [ 36 ] french and british intelligence also worked to prevent argentina from obtaining more exocet missiles on the international market , [ 37 ] while at the same time peru attempted to purchase 12 missiles for argentina , in a failed secret operation . 
  [ 38 ] [ 39 ] chile gave support to britain in the form of intelligence about argentine military and early warning radar . 
  [ 40 ] [ 41 ] throughout the war , argentina was afraid of a chilean military intervention in patagonia and kept some of her best mountain regiments away from the falklands near the chilean border as a precaution . 
  [ 42 ]   in recent years it has become known that a listening post located in fauske , norway was vital in giving the british intelligence information regarding argentinian fleet locations . 
  the listening post was designated fauske ii by norway . 
  the information was `` stolen '' from soviet spy satellites which were the only space assets having the south atlantic under coverage . 
  [ 43 ] western powers such as the united states and the uk did not have their own satellite presence in this area at the time . 
  a high ranking british military source claimed that the intelligence the british got from the fauske ii post as `` incredibly vital '' :    when the war broke out , we had almost no intelligence information from this area .
