  it was here we got help from the norwegians , who gave us a stream of information about the argentinian warships positions . 
  the information came to us all the time and straight to our war headquarters at northwood . 
  the information was continuously updated and told us exactly where the argentinian ships were . 
   this is a big deal because it runs contrary to the official policy , since russia has been fighting perceived fascism everywhere , on stage , on tv , in literature , not to mention ukraine and crimea , but when actual fascists show up it 's `` welcome , komrades '' . 
  russia is n't the first to support ideologically-opposed political factions to try to affect its rivals : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_revolution  eventually , german officials arranged for lenin to pass through their territory , hoping that his activities would weaken russia or even -- if the bolsheviks came to power -- lead to russia 's withdrawal from the war . 
  lenin and his associates , however , had to agree to travel to russia in a sealed train : germany would not take the chance that he would foment revolution in germany . 
  after passing through the front , he arrived in petrograd in april 1917 .

  you can judge the quality of a country by whether their borders have to deal with trying to keep people in or trying to keep them out . 
  was it previously subsidized via taxation ? 
  i guess that if nato has alliances with russia 's land neighbors , russia ca n't invade or threaten those neighbors , so it kinda cuts off influence via hard power . 
  [ russian land neighbors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borders_of_russia ) : * norway .

  not a good idea to provoke . 
  not a nato member ( and , as i understand it , pretty firmly under russia 's thumb ) . 
  * north korea . 
  not a nato member and i 'm not sure that china would bail them out , but a nuclear power and probably vastly easier to buy off than threaten anyway . 
   fourth , smallest player . 
  [ the claims of countries in europe ( and in this context , i 'm talking about continental europe , not the `` europe means eu '' that some on here use ) ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/international/21636756-denmark-claims-north-pole-frozen-conflict ) to the arctic are larger than those of the us and it looks like possibly canada . 
  smaller than russia , though : russia claims about half the arctic circle . 
   exept murmansk and all the old bases along the northern shore of kola peninsula . 
  those will be more valuable with a bit more global warming to make them warm-water ports . 
  finland and sweden maybe because they are n't nato , so a threat might be more credible . 
  beats me about denmark , though . 
  i guess there 's also the broader question of why russia is threatening random countries in general . 
  and china passes russia . 
  hmm . 
  detroit 's water system has been state-run . 
  it is true that at the point that the city became bankrupt and was unable to raise funds for continued operation of water or other services , the city water department did finally start cutting water to people who had n't been paying their bill . 
  part of detroit 's bankruptcy proceedings have been to move towards privatizing its water system , but that has not yet happened . 
  other countries have water meters and do n't have `` water bosses '' threatening to `` make you die of dehydration '' . 
  why pay via taxes ? 
  pay * a la carte * with meters -- after all , if someone 's using gobs of water , they 're the one who should be paying more for it . 
  if you just want rainwater and do n't care about maintaining and building water infrastructure , afaik there 's no restriction on trapping as much of it as you want . 
   if ~ ~ serbia ~ ~ some people in serbia would prefer to stay out of eu http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/poll-serbias-complex-attitude-towards-eu-311141  serbian citizens have a more positive attitude toward russia than toward the eu , but they would prefer to see their children live in the eu ... 
   the collapse of detroit 's happened due to extreme poverty induced by corporate poverty wage and concentration of wealth ( everything in the hand of a few industrialists to the point their employees could n't buy cars anymore or even fuckin potable water ) which means soon everything collapsed in cascade . 
  the debt problems of detroit happened because for decades , detroit had borrowed more money than it had a hope of paying back . 
  this was exacerbated by detroit 's economy shrinking : a debt taken out by a city that not only does n't grow but rapidly shrinks becomes more-difficult to pay off . 
  detroit 's need to service debt resulted in ever-more-pressure on taxes and surcharges . 
  the shrinkage of detroit 's economy happened because automation increased and places other than detroit became more-competitive , which reduced demand for detroit 's labor . 
  postive feedback loops happened from there ( race riots , white flight , a long string of corrupt and/or ineffectual political leaders culminating in [ kwame kilpatrick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kwame_kilpatrick ) ... ), 
   its economy is a similar size to greece 's ( 84 % the size ) ... detroit was taken over by federal and state bankruptcy mechanisms the day it announced its insolvency and they began restructuring it would greeks accept germany and france and finland taking over greece and to then start restructuring it ? 
  there were some pretty bitter people in detroit who lost pension money and other things , and it was only due to federal authority that they were permitted to come in and do so . 
   but greece 's crisis caused turmoil from tokyo to new york . 
  my understanding is that part of the risk of greece was that it was more-likely to cause a ripple effect that might lead to other nations defaulting ; it was n't so much greece itself . 
   it was a minor article in the financial newspapers and everyone went on with their day . 
  ehh ... it was a pretty big deal and in the papers for quite a while . 
  fun fact : jeans were invented by a [ first-generation latvian-american ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacob_w._davis ) .

  if hitler had pulled off the third reich , yeah , the way we talk about [ oda nobunaga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oda_nobunaga ) as a `` great unifier '' would probably eventually have applied to hitler . 
   ( per-country breakdown ) roughly-speaking , that looks like the wealthier a country in europe is , the less it wants federalization . 
  to clarify / u/petardik 's point : http://www.geek.com/games/why-gandhi-is-always-a-warmongering-jerk-in-civilization-1608515/, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease  joseph stalin , during the tehran conference in 1943 , acknowledged publicly the importance of american efforts during a dinner at the conference : `` without american production the united nations [ the allies ] could never have won the war . 
  '' [ 21 ] [ 22 ] that 's just american * production * being subtracted . 
  that 's not counting [ every other allied nation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allies_of_world_war_ii ) in the european theater , all of which would also go away in that scenario . 
  nothing wrong with using russian gas ( other than sanctions and stuff like that ) , as long as a country has the ability to rapidly-switch from it if need be . 
  strategic nuclear weapons are n't nearly as valuable if used as something other than a threat . 
  that 's right ... i 'd forgotten about that . 
  argentina invaded and tried to annex some of the land of a nuclear power . 
  i wonder if a better way of putting it would be `` authorizing arms sales is a tool of foreign policy for some countries , but for china , it 's more of a traditional business '' . 
  russia 's economy is damaged , but it [ has been much worse not all that long ago ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp ) . 
   meanwhile , the russia of missiles and are guaranteed to penetrate the future global missile defense system . 
  strange that russia would express such concern about the threat missile defense poses if it is so certainly bypassed . 
  he 's probably pretty accurate . 
  moscow is very very probably on the list of british targets , and always was . 
  that seems reasonable and probably accurate . 
  the flip side , of course , is that nato is targeting russian nuclear sites .
