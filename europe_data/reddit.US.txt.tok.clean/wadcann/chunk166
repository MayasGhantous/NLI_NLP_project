  facebook , published in the video allegedly distributed the money involved in the celebrations . 
    putin arrived directly from the kremlin for the ministerial appointment . 
  according to media reports , he said during a meeting that russia 's goal is to `` self-sufficient in the crimea and sevastopol . '', 
    nezavisimaya gazeta newspaper on thursday published a review that putin is far below the target . 
  crimea is completely dependent on russian support , and received by the federal budget is the same as in chechnya and ingushetia . 
    caption : the man introduced in the moscow celebrations `` i krimil\u00e4inen '' - kyltti\u00e4 . 
  that 's more-or-less what i expected you to say : but then my question is surely the `` ca n't join nato '' would apply to establishing a frozen conflict in finland ? 
  i wonder how much it would cost to have a dual magellan/galileo receiver . 
  more satellites means more data , hence more reliability and accuracy . 
   but without a credible centralized eu-wide defense force , it would be a symbolic move more than anything . 
  i do n't see why it would n't be possible to manufacture galileo-based bombs even if the gps ones are also in use . 
  i 'd think that a bomb guidance device would be one of the smaller defense projects . 
  < shrug  i read a few books on churchill , and he was personally pretty distressed about poland towards the end of the war . 
  he also pushed hard diplomatically to try to get a different outcome ( and tried to get the us to push hard ) . 
  churchill 's position may not have been consensus view of the british bureaucracy , but churchill at least held it to be important . 
  what is your take on what russia 's benefit is from occupying eastern ukraine ? 
  the question is , once you have a reliable and functioning system in place , how long it will take to add a lot more anti-ballistic missile missiles . 
  just a matter of manufacturing and siting more . 
  i think that russia 's concern is legitimate from their standpoint ( though that does n't necessarily mean that putting the missile shield is a bad idea from our standpoint ) . 
   these are not pieces of paper , the ability to honor treaties is what makes the difference between a real country and a banana republic . 
  france [ has n't always followed through on her defense treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal#1939 ) , but i 'd have a pretty hard time calling france a banana republic . 
   you 're in a fantasy world . 
  that being said , that 's also pretty much exactly what everyone ( including us ) thought in 1939 . 
   great , but you 're still comparing an air force of 150 planes with one of over 3,400 . 
  those are actually better odds for finland than in 1939 : [ wikipedia has 114 finnish aircraft against 3,880 aircraft back then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) . 
  http://www.koreapost.com/news/view.html?section=165&amp;category=192&amp;no=656  for the last decade , bulgaria has been one of the fastest growing eastern european economies . 
  it is characterized by a stable macroeconomic environment , the most favorable tax treatment in the eu , high skilled labor force and one of europe 's lowest operational costs . 
  the strong fiscal performance of bulgaria for 2012 is confirmed by one of the lowest budget deficits in europe , only 0.8 % and the second lowest debt to gdp ratio in the eu27 . 
  [ snip ]  bulgaria ranks fourth in the world in low taxes for foreigners [ snip ]  bulgaria is placed at fourth place in the ranking for lowest tax burden in europe with 10 % tax on personal income . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/9220752/bulgaria-found-to-be-cheapest-european-destination.html  bulgaria is the cheapest european holiday destination for britons , according to a new survey . 
    ten typical holiday items and costs , including a three-course meal out , will cost tourists just # 42.79 in bulgaria -- almost twice as cheap as brighton -- according to post office travel money 's latest cost index .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_bulgaria  bulgaria has the fastest average broadband internet speed in the world after romania and south korea . 
  that sure does look like an inverse correlation between price and smoking frequency to me . 
   that was offshored to africa . 
  and asia . 
  the colonial era is pretty dead , though , post world war ii . 
  algeria was handed back in 1962 ... i guess there 's israel . 
  the rationale for churchill 's position was that the uk had guaranteed poland that it would receive its independence , and not be handed over to russia , which the article did n't explain ... that blog appears to be rather pro-russia , skimming the collection of articles there ... edit : ah , this domain is run by [ * rossiyskaya gazeta * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rossiyskaya_gazeta ) , russian state-run media . 
   no factory is interested in buying spanish apples even for almost free . 
  i do n't understand why , though : are you saying that there is simply no factory capacity for this , or is it that factories do n't believe that there 's a market for their processed , non-perishable goods ? 
  there 's a surplus today , but there wo n't be down the road , and i 'd think that those goods could be sold then ... 
  could be done automatically via a firefox plugin for reddit and google translate , if someone could live with machine translation . 
  that wikipedia article says that the gay bomb was based on swedish research . 
  france and britain have long used the term `` civilization '' . 
  next time , maybe ask them where they learned how good life in the ussr was ? 
  would be interesting to see where the source is . 
  that seems * insane * . 
  apples can be dried or processed into applesauce or apple juice concentrate and will keep for years . 
  surely they still have value . 
  most of the world , including europe , was comfortable with land grabs to expand themselves a hundred years ago . 
  the only unusual thing about russia is that they 're doing it * today * , when most countries expect neither to do this themselves nor to have risk of a country doing it to them . 
   eu wo n't survive an attack on a member-state why is that ? 
  i could see that being said about nato , because the entire point is to be part of a defense alliance ; there 's no * point * to being in nato if it does n't respond to attacks on members . 
  if it does n't actually live up to its defense promises , no point in being a member . 
  but the eu provides substantial non-defense benefits as well ; even if it * did n't * provide defense , surely it could be viewed as having worthwhile membership ? 
  uber/lyft price wars have driven down fares in existing markets , reducing profits . 
  they wo n't if lyft and other competition come in and outcompete them ( or , rather , the competition itself will drive down prices ) . 
   however , germany 's economic position was made possible by ... you guessed it ... debt forgiveness , favorable lending terms and massive amounts of growth stimulus from the us . 
  greece * has * been provided with debt forgiveness and favorable lending terms , though . 
  had the books not been cooked and the debt not run up in past years , i doubt that greeks would be unhappy with germany 's actions . 
   sharing refugees more fairly i think that part of the issue is that a lot of people ( probably accurately ) view a very large chunk of the people in question as being economic migrants , not war refugees , and while they might be willing to accept some number of war refugees , they would not accept economic migrants . 
   if we accepted all refugees on and impermanent basis we could send them back to syria once things have calmed down . 
  that might have a tendency to become permanent once the reality on the ground has become established . 
   if this is due to a mechanical failure caused by a lack of funds seems like it would be hard to define whether something is caused by a lack of funds in that it could also be considered a bad prioritization of existing funds or a bad decision to fly the helicopter given known limitations . 
  i 'm not sure that killing off russian naval vessels is the best first response , but : * it 's pretty hard to argue that a submarine is a civilian craft . 
  * airspace and national waters are no joke when it comes to military vehicles . 
  part of the ( very serious ) responsibilities of such vehicles is not posing a threat that crosses certain agreed-upon lines . 
  the entire point of having those lines is to ensure an acceptable-to-all set of standards . 
  if there are constant violations , the standards go away : better to have an aircraft destroyed than to have large numbers violating national air or water after discovering that nothing is done in response to violations . 
  * russia has had no compunctions about shooting down [ actual civilian craft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) that strayed into russian airspace . 
  that being said , the title appears to be inaccurate : the title says that the ship and subs were `` in its waters '' , but the body said that they were `` near '' those waters , which is no violation . 
  that 's not what / u/porttack is saying , but rather that they 'd like this to be an impetus for changing the laws . 
  nyc taxi medallions ( licenses ) ran for $ 1m . 
  that 's a pretty good sign that the nyc taxi market is n't competitive : the licensing mechanism had been seriously impacting the market . 
  uber and lyft simply ignore licensing , and have been [ causing the price on these to collapse ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/upshot/new-york-city-taxi-medallion-prices-keep-falling-now-down-about-25-percent.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1 ) . 
  i think that it would be better to eliminate licensing or dramatically-increase the license count , but people had been aware of the problem for many years , and it had never been addressed : there 's now some actual movement on the problem . 
  even ignoring the obvious immediate political and logistical difficulties and the lack of significant benefit , are you going to realign administrative boundaries as population moves in the future ? 
  if you 're not , you 're just choosing another arbitrary breakdown . 
   corruption really is one of the biggest challenges facing europe right now . 
  is this unique to europe , or a global concern , and is it a problem specific to today ? 
  i think that corruption has been an issue for a long time and in most of the world . 
   and though you may not yet be americanized enough to say , `` thanks sweetie ! '' to your waitress or bus driver ... 
  apparently i 'm not americanized enough either . 
  i would really advise against relying on this material . 
  my take :  ... there are long-lasting friendships in the united states , but if someone says , ` i 'm your friend , ' it often means nothing more than ` i am sympathetic and want you to feel here is your home , too ' . 
  it is not the beginning of a long friendship . 
  true . 
   `` americans like to start with a little humor and a lot of small talk . 
  facts and figures do not play as an important a role as in germany . '' i do n't have the extensive experience to compare with germany . 
  i 've worked with a number of germans , and in retrospect , i guess i did see a lack of small talk at the opening of meetings , but i did n't see it as an issue or offensive in any way . 
  i 'm a little more dubious about the `` facts and figures '' bit ; my guess is that they 're probably about as important in any culture . 
   according to frank schmiechen , `` [ americans ] will start simple , without always needing to know everything before-hand . 
  if something does not work , there is just a new start . '' i did see a planning-heavy-up-front , but that may have had far more to do with the particular company or approach . 
   the american work dress code is different in every business , building , state , and county . 
  so germans encourage other germans to play it safe and just wear a suit . 
  even german women should wear suits ; no short skirts . 
  and whatever length your hem is , always wear pantyhose . 
  americans love pantyhose .
