  ehhh ... it does vary dramatically by business , that 's certainly true . 
  i 'm not so sure about `` state and county '' . 
  broadly-speaking , there 's been a strong shift towards casual clothing for decades ( which , as far as i know , also shows up in much of the rest of the world ) . 
  it 's relatively-rare that i would see somone wearing a necktie at work , though in the 1960s , a tie would have been the norm . 
  i suppose that it does n't ever hurt to wear a suit , but it 's definitely not the norm for most businesses ... a few conservative areas like finance , maybe . 
   in a discussion with americans , when they say , `` i wonder if this is really the best solution ? '' they mean `` no . '' if they say `` i 'm wondering if we might need more time , '' they mean `` no . '' and `` we might want to review some parts of the project , '' is `` no . '' americans get confused ( or just plain mad ) if a german boss answers statements with `` no . '' `` that 's good . '' `` just go ahead . '' ehh ... i think that a simple unqualified `` no '' might be a titch offensive in that it simply asserts that someone 's authoritative and makes any discussion awkward , but nothing else here would be . 
  and i do n't think that the degree of elaborate dancing described here is necessary either : saying `` no , i do n't think that that would be the best way to do it '' would be fine . 
   when a group comes together , act casual and introduce everyone present : yes . 
  i was n't aware that this was n't normal in germany . 
   just like in our country , topics such as religion , sex and politics are not appropriate in small talk . 
  sport , however , is always an excellent entry . 
  pauses are considered unpleasant and can easily be bypassed with a casual question . 
  effusive compliments are also very popular . 
  but beware of superficial compliments to the opposite sex , they can be regarded as harassment . 
  i 'd agree . 
  * effusive * compliments might be a bit over-the-top . 
   if you stroll through america 's shopping malls or are in a restaurant for dinner , you 'll often hear the words , `` darling , sweetheart , sweetie , and luv '' or other terms of endearment , which belong in the personal realm . 
  americans are much more frivolous and relaxed with these nicknames , and they do not carry the same meaning as they do with us . 
  it 's not at all considered objectionable to use terms of endearment in public . 
  using them on people who one does n't have a high degree of intimacy with , though , would often be considered offensive . 
  i really do not agree with this example :  and though you may not yet be americanized enough to say , `` thanks sweetie ! '' to your waitress or bus driver ... 
  i 'm not saying that that does n't happen ever , but that is very far from the norm , and in the context of travel or business , i would avoid that like the plague . 
   always stay calm and polite . 
  never respond with an annoyed or even defensive attitude , because this behavior is strange . 
  keep in mind that the waiter in a restaurant , the clerk in a store , or employees of any kind might be dismissed from their jobs for even the smallest rudeness . 
  ehh ... being calm and polite is probably a good idea in general , but irate customers are very far from uncommon . 
   seriously . 
  your instinct while passing a grinning stranger on the street will be to `` look stubbornly and rigidly at the ground in front of you , '' but that is rude . 
  you must keep smiling :    over time , american friendliness will probably get on your nerves and it will seem very superficial -- which it is , presumably . 
  but this form of interaction is how american people function and is one of their basic manifestos . 
  you should probably smile when first greeting someone or meeting them , but keeping a grin plastered on your face the entire time you 're talking to someone or looking in their direction is just bizarre . 
   take user rheinflip , who said , `` the germans just think that a people who chose bush , creationism over darwin and sells machine guns at everyone , and blows more co2 into the atmosphere than any other country , reveals a certain lack of understanding . 
  pardon , but not only the germans think so . 
  just ask the canadians or mexicans ... '' bush is a poor speaker and definitely rode into the white house via political connections , but he 's really not as dumb as his poor speaking might imply . 
  [ creationism ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx ) views are high , though that 's probably because there 's still a far-larger presence of religion in the united states , and a question like that may be viewed as tantamount to `` do you believe in a creator '' ? 
  re : carbon emissions . . 
  the us has a significantly-lower population density , which drives the use of automobiles , as well as a broader temperature range than germany . 
   user derrolf added , `` every other country has an older culture . 
  most americans are not familiar with the rest of the world at all , and the president even said that the americans had invented the car . '' travel from the us to countries other than canada or mexico is more-expensive and takes longer than international travel among countries in europe , which would be closer to interstate travel within the us , and so the sort of frequent , casual cross-border travel that exists in europe does n't exist in most of the us . 
  compare , say , to typical european familiarity with south america or east asia . 
  americans do n't really want to hear about your ferret , even if they ask . 
  to the extent that this deals with `` how are you '' being a greeting and `` fine '' being the normal response , okay . 
  i am not at all sure that this extends much further than that phrase , though . 
  a lot of these start with a grain of truth , but they seem to exaggerate differences . 
  is this public expenditure , private expenditure , or total ? 
   abrams tank is the most badass , prove me wrong . 
  based on the unit prices listed and ignoring the costs of the crewmen , you could have four chinese type 99 tanks or one m1 abrams . 
  a 4:1 opening advantage is pretty significant .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom%e2%80%93united_states_relations  ... most british people perceive the u.s fairly positively , with 58 % of british people viewing the u.s. favorably and 68 % viewing american people favorably in 2013 , decreasing to 66 % in 2014 . 
  [ 7 ] according to a 2014 bbc world service poll , 52 % of british people view u.s. influence positively , with 42 % expressing a negative view . 
  according to the same poll , 81 % of americans view british influence positively , with only 10 % expressing a negative view . 
  [ 8 ] 81 % is pretty high . 
  a bit old , but still good : * [ american culture ] ( http://www.zompist.com/amercult.html ) * [ canadian culture ] ( http://www.zompist.com/canada.html ) , highlighting in black differences from us culture . 
  * and , of course , [ quebecois culture ] ( http://www.zompist.com/quebec.html ), 
   ( no human rights [ only rights for citizens ] ) that 's not correct . 
  the rights extended to non-citizens is not the complete set of rights extended to citizens , but it is much closer to being the same than being zero : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_the_united_states  lack of social security social security does apply to [ some non-citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_the_united_states ) . 
   gun laws gone mad well , i 'd use the same term to describe the uk , but granted , that 's a real difference . 
  i do n't think that it would be an issue for free movement , but if the uk and the us were involved in a single organization again , the us constitutional [ title of nobility clause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/title_of_nobility_clause ) might smash into the uk 's aristocracy . 
  i agree that the us is the `` least british '' of the old predominantly-european british colonies , though , and it split far earlier than the others , and violently . 
  i 'd guess that from the standpoint of people trying to retain british culture in the uk but expand free movement , free movement within the commonwealth might be desirable , but from an economic standpoint , it seems like easy and free trade with mainland europe would be a lot more interesting . 
   i think us brits ( and tell me if you think i 'm wrong here ) share more in common with commonwealth countries like us/aus/ca / nz/ire than we do mainland europe . 
  the british empire shall rise again , eh ? 
   the eu would n't allow a member state to have freedom of movement with a non-eu and non-efta country , just like the eu does n't allow member states to negotiate their own trade deals . 
  would the eu be willing to reject the uk over free movement within the commonwealth states , though ? 
  if the anglosphere turned into commonwealth plus us , i wonder if it 'd theoretically give french or german a new shot at being the language of the eu . 
   russia will have entrenched itself so much i wonder ... 
  the value of being on the defense has varied an awful lot over the years . 
  certainly it does n't have the benefit that it once did . 
  i 've not read anything from military science folks examining this for really recent years , but my gut feeling is that the value of defense has become much lower than it once was . 
  even back in world war ii , germany was very successful on the attack , and i think that the pendulum has only swung towards the attacker . 
  * at one point , traditional fortifications gave an advantage against attacking infantry . 
  however , that benefit was destroyed by artillery . 
  * trenches helped against shrapnel from unguided bombs and artillery , but looking at modern attack aircraft , guns and guided bombs today are accurate-enough to hit trenches . 
  * surface-to-air weaponry can be deployed in an area , but i doubt that there 's a huge benefit in having time to set it up versus driving it in on vehicles with an attack : there are mobile sam weapons that are as effective as anything that weapons at a fixed location could do . 
  the accuracy of sam missiles and of anti-sam weapons means that the benefit of setting up in a bunker is n't likely to extend the life of either side long today ( i.e. 
  targeting a sam launcher on a truck is going to be about as effective as a sam launcher in a fortification ) . 
  * aircraft range is great enough that control of ground is n't as interesting as it once was in terms of limiting aircraft targets . 
  * ground military radars probably help and might be cheaper to operate , but [ the e-3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_e-3_sentry ) and the [ a-50 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beriev_a-50 ) mean that long-range radar can accompany an attack . 
  i 'm not sure that it would be drastically-harder for nato to be in an offensive conflict , re-entering finland than a defensive conflict , defending it . 
   general motors co. said wednesday it plans to stop selling opel and most chevrolet vehicles in the russian market by the end of the year , a week after the company said russia was under `` serious review . '' [ snip ]  gm said it will focus on the premium market in russia and will still sell cadillac and u.s.-built chevy models such as the camaro , corvette and tahoe . 
  the well-to-do in russia are still buying cars , but ... 
   because i 'd send in the military with armour penetrating rounds to destroy these far left hippies . 
  i realize that this is really not the thrust of your argument , but armor-penetrating rounds are less-effective against unarmored targets than non-armor-piercing rounds : you want a round to expend its kinetic energy inside the target , not just punch through . 
   socialist movements tend to find their greatest support among the industrial working class , well , that 's the russian/german model . 
  did n't happen in china , where the left did best in rural areas . 
  i also suspect that some of the people angry about inequality are angry about their relative standard of living dropping as labor competition increases * because * of the entry of eastern european workers ( which will decrease * overall * inequality across europe ... ), 
  an opportunity for local molotov cocktail and hoodie vendors , i imagine . 
  repeating the link to the poll itself ( provided by / u/bowgentle ) : http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/, 
  i know that it 's popular to beat up on germany these days because of very real german army cuts , but the [ * bundeswehr * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundeswehr ) * does * have 180k people : the [ lithuanian armed forces ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_armed_forces ) have only 8000 . 
  finland is not in nato either . 
  additionally , western europe and the united states did n't jump into the winter war the last time russia invaded finland ( despite finland hoping that they would ) . 
  that 's despite the fact that the us and western european public and media were solidly behind finland then . 
  if finland has better hopes for outside aid today , i 'd say that it comes from one of the two following factors : * at the time , the overwhelming interest of the uk , france , and the us was in not establishing a stable ussr/germany axis against the uk and france . 
  that is not the case today . 
  * finland is a member of the eu . 
  the eu may be willing to go to war with russia over the invasion of an eu member via its own guarantees to its members . 
   the attempts by kiev to provoke russia into a wider war ... yeah , nothing ukraine would like more than a broader war with a more-militarily-powerful country ...  mh-17 was intended to draw nato into a war with russia * then why not engage in a false-flag attack on the actual netherlands , instead of against a vehicle .
