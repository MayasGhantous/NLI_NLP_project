  * then why not declare article 5 at the time ? 
  * then why take the soft-power route of economic sanctions even later , when russia is taking the hard power route ? 
   why do americans need this war ? 
  for improving their economic position ... freezing assets to pay down the national debt . 
  war does n't improve an economy ; certainly not to non-war alternatives . 
  * in world war ii , it drove deficit spending in the us , which can lead to a temporary increase in employment and activity , but costs down the line . 
  if that were in us interests , there would be no reason to have a costly war : the us could just go engage in deficit spending on something useful without a war . 
  * sanctions against russia are not going to come close to what the national debt is . 
  i do n't know what the total us benefit from frozen assets is . 
  the numbers i see online are on the order of hundreds of millions , maybe in the low billions ; the annual deficit is hundreds of billions of dollars i also suspect that more assets are in europe than the us . 
   to weaken russia as an economic competitor russia is way , way , way down on the list of us economic competition * and * is predominantly a raw resource exporter , whereas the us is primarily an exporter of consumer and industrial products . 
  russia going to pot is n't going to eliminate a competitor to sell iphones . 
   the us will supply gas to the eu , exxon will displace royal dutch shell if the us and lithuania stretch themselves , they could * mitigate * the effects on lithuania of a russian natural gas shutoff . 
  my guess is that north africa is a more economical energy source . 
  royal dutch shell has resources around the world , not just in russia ( though i admit that i do n't know the breakdown ) , and exxon has operations in russia : energy multinationals do n't tie themselves to the sources of one continent . 
   thanks to the war , the us military-industrial complex will get many orders i suspect that most european spending will wind up in europe ; that 's a pretty indirect way of generating purchases . 
   ukraine 's provocations against russia will become even more profound ( shows mushroom cloud ) ukraine does n't have nukes . 
  in fact , it was the deal that the uk , us , and russia cut to remove ukraine 's nukes that probably exposed ukraine to this situation in the first place . 
   russia seeks to prevent the outbreak of world war iii probably , to the same extent that everyone does . 
  on a list of `` countries who push the world towards world war iii '' , though , i 'm having a really hard time putting putin anywhere near the bottom . 
   the survivors of world war iii are going to witness the new american economic miracle [ background of flames ] even aside from the global nuclear risks , a conventional war , the us would be economically better-off by having russia * not * invade ukraine , no conflict , and by simply engaging in trade that did n't wind up destroying assets . 
   what i do n't get is how they can think that there 's an audience that is fluent in english that would fall for it . 
  would n't you say that you are more familiar in international relations and history than the typical target of this video ? 
  i knew some pretty intelligent people who were ... maybe being * convinced * by the 9/11 truther movement is going too far , but saying `` it raises some interesting questions -- you should look into this '' , at least . 
  rabbits have no issues maintaining their population , though ... 
   what the fuck ? 
  the us gets an eagle , the chinese a panda ... why ca n't we get an animal ? 
  because even the eu federalists have n't chosen a national animal for the eu yet ? 
  it 's more than just treading water and more than decreasing the budget further . 
   any land war in europe would end in full nuclear winter for everyone . 
  it did n't in georgia or ukraine . 
  [ canadian army starts winter combat training with french and polish soldiers ] ( http://www.army-technology.com/news/newscanadian-army-starts-winter-combat-training-with-french-and-polish-soldiers-4494534 ) canada * does * conduct winter combat training for soldiers from countries with more-reasonable climates . 
   russia wo n't attack finland . 
  it 's a very highly developed and respected country , which also has no serious conflicts with russia . 
  well , ukraine did n't either , other than signing a trade deal with the eu instead of with russia . 
   most of the world would turn against russia , it would become globally isolated , disrespected and untrusted , which in turn would bring catastrophic consequences to its economy and society . 
  how does this differ from what 's already happening ? 
   that being said , i really do n't think the eu could take back finland without american help . 
  if the eu was willing to pull together , i 'm pretty comfortable saying that they could win a conventional war against russia even without us involvement . 
  it might take a while , but ... 
   the eu cares more about finland than it does about ukraine ( sorry ukraine ) . 
  europe would n't tolerate this . 
  and neither would america . 
  it 's worth pointing out that finland thought that the united states and europe would also jump in last time russia invaded them . 
   russia can place troops within its own borders anywhere it pleases , it is not an act of war . 
  that being said , saying that something is legitimate does n't mean that it is n't a sign of something potentially less-legitimate in the future . 
  it 's legal for me to carry a prybar , a book on how to break into houses , a pair of black gloves and a handgun , but those might also be viewed as a sign that i might want to engage in burglary in the near future . 
  it 's not the legality of what 's been done thus far that you care about in that case ... 
   it fascinates me how putin makes his worst fears real to be fair , we 've seen some argument that his real concern is the eu 's peaceful expansion , not nato military action , and that nato is just a more-acceptable boogeyman to attack . 
  i 'm not sure if i agree , but if that is true , it would make the eu , not nato , the biggest concern . 
  i do not believe that this is the generally-accepted interpretation of nato 's article 5 . 
  nato members have been in various conflicts before where overseas soldiers were attacked , and nato members did * not * consider the attack to be against the country itself and thus nato as a whole . 
  examples : * korean war * vietnam war * falklands war the only time that nato article 5 has ever been invoked was when the us did after september 11th in support of the actions in afghanistan . 
  in that case , an actual nato country 's homeland was attacked ( not just that country 's soldiers somewhere in the world ) , that country was clearly not the aggressor ( it 's not a `` i attacked some country 's military and someone fought back against my soldiers so article 5 '' ) . 
  arguably afghanistan was n't the true actor , but it was the host to the organization that was conducting the attacks and refused to either stop them or to permit outside action to stop them . 
  true , that is n't an absolute argument that article 5 * could n't * have been invoked on other occasions , but the point remains that it was n't , and i would be really careful about assuming otherwise with what is at stake . 
  does n't it seem more-plausible that the issue is with the system of organization in russia than that people start to differ at a political boundary ? 
   well it 's funny but they do n't want to give a cent to greece on their debts [ greece already had a lot of money given to it in the form of debt write-offs ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11381719/greece-crisis-could-derail-pms-plans-for-eu-reform-warns-norman-lamont.html ) . 
   `` there has already been voluntary debt forgiveness by private creditors , banks have already slashed billions from greece 's debt , '' she said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper . 
    `` i do not envisage fresh debt cancellation , '' she said . 
  [ snip ]  at the start of 2012 , greece restructured its debt in a deal involving private creditors who took `` haircuts '' or wrote down parts of their holdings . 
  this cut greece 's total debt burden by around 100 billion euros . 
  [ 15 % of belarus is catholic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_catholicism_in_belarus ) . 
  low-cost , no-real-action-required , and no concrete commitments or guarantees . 
  not very interesting . 
  all three of those are right-wing journals ; if your objection is to right-wing journals , fair enough , but i have a hard time grouping them with rt or sputnik : they are n't organizations run by a state to send propaganda to other countries . 
  i do n't follow breitbart or theblaze , but i have seen * the daily mail * , and i have n't seen anything on it that looks terribly-false : just lots of uninteresting-to-me-glop . 
  i 'd tend to be more-willing to list things like * voice of america/radio liberty . 
  i think that these guys hew to a reasonably-high standard , but they 're a for-foreign-consumption-only news media run by the us government ; certainly if you 're skeptical of the us , they 'd be something to be aware of . 
  while the language is fairly-neutral , topic selection is also a way to influence a reader . 
  * sputnik ( ex-voice of russia ) / rt ( ex-russia today ) : russian-state-funded propaganda , and these guys are just ridiculous . 
  * al jazeera : not bad on most issues , but run by qatar . 
  is the daily mail actually making false claims , or is it just celebrity-news heavy ? 
  looking at its front page , it looks like the latter . 
   ukraine is not important enough to start a war over . 
  korea and vietnam were . 
   as an american , if russia had started building army bases in like canada or mexico , and started building rocket silos as there are built by americans in countries like romania right now , started deploying several troops right on your doorstep and impose sanctions to your country , would n't you be the one that feels trapped and be ready to go in an all out war ? 
  if that 's grounds to invade and annex part of ukraine , then the same standard permits invading and annexing the baltics or poland . 
   and now the great america is driving a thousand tanks and trucks through europe , heading east . 
  nato does exercises all the time . 
  the only different thing this time is that because of the russian activities in ukraine , congress authorized another $ 1b to send more hardware and soldiers in and expand the scope . 
  it 's just being heavily-highlighted to emphasize that the us is n't going to just stand back if the baltics or poland are attacked . 
  us forces in europe are still nothing like what they 'd look like if the us were expecting a conventional world war iii . 
  no national armies have been mobilized : the only change is lithuania reintroducing conscription . 
  `` no nato * basis * in slovakia ? '', 
  fair enough . 
   and russia has excellent anti-air capabilities the us has good anti-anti-air capabilities . 
   the west wants to help ukraine , but the more we do the more russia does in response . 
  oh , stuff-and-nonsense . 
  if the political desire existed , russia could be booted out of ukraine in short order . 
  it might have undesirable political effects , but the `` russia might/will escalate '' was true of every proxy war that we 've been in with russia , and we 've been in more-than-a-couple .
