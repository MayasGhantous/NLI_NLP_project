  if russia and poland were involved in a conflict , doctors will probably be even more in-demand than riflemen . 
  here 's a country ranking based on [ self-assessment ] ( http://www3.weforum.org/docs/ttcr/2013/ttcr_datatables7_2013.pdf ) of roads . 
  that may or may not reflect actual road condition well , but it 's an interesting starting point . 
   also heavy vehicles like tanks can actually damage roads . 
  if those are all strykers , [ wikipedia says that they weigh less than a third ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stryker ) what a [ main battle tank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1_abrams ) does and have rubber wheels instead of metal tracks . 
  it looks like [ road convoys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhqwvgao-e ) with them are n't a big deal . 
  yup , as i said :  getting to the more-interesting bits would be a lot harder . 
   this whole tense situation in europe is to america 's advantage how so ? 
  the us is wanting to shift military to the east asia theater ; i 'd think that this would be a distraction . 
  the us presumably also wants russia to counterbalance china , which the ukraine situation makes rather more-difficult . 
  we do n't have a collapsing population : we already have mass immigration from central america . 
  that 's a freight train , not a passenger train . 
  the us has [ a very good freight rail system ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/16636101 ) . 
  what it does n't have is a lot of passenger rail : it does n't have europe 's population density , and so passenger rail is typically a money-losing exercise ( the northeastern us is one of the few exceptions , with the rail commuter system between new jersey and new york city in the nyc metro area doing all right ) . 
  us passenger rail competes poorly with air travel for long-haul travel or cars in their ability to deal well with lower-population-density areas . 
   america 's railways are the mirror image of europe 's . 
  europe has an impressive and growing network of high-speed passenger links , many of them international , like the thalys service between paris and brussels or the eurostar connecting london to the french and belgian capitals . 
  these are successful -- although once the ( off-balance-sheet ) costs of building the tracks are counted , they need subsidies of billions of dollars a year . 
  but , outside germany and switzerland , europe 's freight rail services are a fragmented , lossmaking mess . 
  repeated attempts to remove the technical and bureaucratic hurdles at national frontiers have come to nothing . 
  [ snip ]  amtrak 's passenger services are sparse compared with europe 's . 
  but america 's freight railways are one of the unsung transport successes of the past 30 years . 
  they are universally recognised in the industry as the best in the world . 
  i posted this a while back : this is what the [ us-russia border looks like ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/diomede_islands_bering_sea_jul_2006.jpg ) : us on the left , russia on the right . 
  you can take a rowboat over and just land anywhere . 
  getting russian soldiers onto us soil would certainly be doable . 
  holding onto the land or getting to the more-interesting bits would be a lot harder . 
   according to the results of fr\u00e9ttabla\u00f0i\u00f0 's survey there 's no link to the original survey , but the obvious question is : is the sample used representative of the population of a whole ? 
  for example , if it 's an online poll or a poll to readers of a particular publication , they may not return representative results . 
   the current republican party simply is n't fit to govern . 
  / r/politics is that way . 
  [ that 's not catching all neighboring countries !, 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/a-17th-century-russian-community-living-in-21st-century-alaska/275440/ ), 
  http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub1038.pdf  civil-military relations in medvedev 's russia   eqully , if not more importantly , the quality , reliability , and extent of professionalism of the armed forces , as well as their responsiveness to civilian authority are crucial issues in russia 's defense and foreign policy . 
  since the russian government is a highly autocratic one with little or no accountability of the executive to anyone at home and is conducting an aggressive global foreign policy , these facts make the nature of the defense forces and defense policy a matter of urgent international and national interest . 
  as mcauley concludes ,    the war in the caucasus proves that russian international behavior for the most part is decided by circles , which wittingly provokes russia 's defiant and aggressive international behavior with a view to restore a mobilized economy and its privileged status in the political system . 
    however , even though the current military reform is both timely and essential if russia is to have a modern army capable of defending against contemporary threats , it will not be sufficient if there is no reform of the pathetic state of civil-military relations that could threaten the state 's integrity and stability if left unchecked . 
  here we should be blunt . 
  after the fall of communism 19 years ago , russia has yet to create a system of civil-military relationships that provides effective control of both the government and the multiple armed forces . 
  one result of this failure , as i have previously argued elsewhere , is that ** there exists within russian politics and not exclusively within the armed forces , a constant temptation to use military force for the solution of problems that require a political resolution ** . 
  the second result of this enduring failure is no less and perhaps even more serious , namely the permanent tension , if not crisis , in civil-military relations is part of a larger and enduring crisis of the state . 
  this tension , if not crisis , colors many if not all of russia 's security policies . 
   to be honest , people would be thinking the same thing if this happened to obama ( god forbid ) . 
  if obama died , nobody would be keeping it secret . 
  heck , when bush choked on a pretzel , we had a press conference . 
  the problem with images is that so many people have jacked saturation on photographs that they just are n't all that representative of reality any more . 
   if western media can repeatedly screw up world maps it 's astonishing the errors that have made it into maps : see [ wikipedia : phantom island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phantom_island ) . 
  in particular : [ sandy island , new caledonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sandy_island,_new_caledonia ) , which survived into 2012 national geographic and google maps data and had bogus entries across a range of map data sources .

  [ snip ]  while britain may be the us 's strongest ally , it 's also not immune to poking fun . 
  the british embassy last month tweeted a picture of a white house cake surrounded by sparklers commemorating the 200th anniversary of the brits burning down the building . 
  true enough . 
  :-) ... though i admit , i had n't realized until recently how important cross-currency debt ( like holding a mortgage in one currency and having a salary in another ) are to people in europe , so i guess even that could be a * huge * loss or a * huge * win . 
   they would be cut off of any resupplies and would simply starve to death . 
  running out of supplies is a concern : that 's why in switzerland 's case , long-term supplies were pre-cached in the mountains . 
   germany would have to only use a very small army without having to fight to actually defeat switzerland . 
  < shrug  there are a lot of countries and militaries that walked into such conflicts thinking that they could win easily . 
  normally ( since it 's the weaker side that is forced to use guerrilla tactics ) , they could have won a stand-up fight against a guerrilla organization ... but because they were never given that stand-up fight , they wound up retreating . 
   additionally retaining control over the population centres is all that really matters anyway . 
  not in this form of conflict . 
  oh , sure , ultimately the goal is to get control of cities as well , but all of these forces were willing to trade control for being able to continue a resistance . 
  the cuban revolution had revolutionaries without control of population centers for all but the last year of the war .
