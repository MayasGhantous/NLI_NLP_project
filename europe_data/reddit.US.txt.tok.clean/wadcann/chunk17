  on the other hand , where a private company is offering this in a competitive market :  for maria br\u00e5th , boss of internet startup brath , the six-hour working day the company introduced when it was formed three years ago gives it a competitive advantage because it attracts better staff and keeps them . 
  `` they are the most valuable thing we have , '' she says -- an offer of more pay elsewhere would not make up for the shorter hours they have at brath . 
  that sounds interesting , and it 's a very different question from one of the nursing situation . 
  it 's possible that workers would prefer compensation in the form of less hours than more pay , and offering that as an option would certainly be an interesting option to explore . 
   deposing/assassinating him um ... 
   the finnish defence forces do not have a suitable ship for a mission on the mediterranean now that the minelayer pohjanmaa , which participated in action against somali pirates in the operation atalanta , is being decommisioned . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_minelayer_pohjanmaa  displacement : 1,450 tonnes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_finnish_navy_ships finland has two [ * h\u00e4meenmaa * - class minelayers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a4meenmaa-class_minelayer ) with the same displacement and similar speed that i 'd assume could function in the med ( though perhaps they have other obligations in the baltic ) . 
  it does look like normally one of these has 60-70 onboard , so it may be that committing a full ship plus the crew is simply more in total than finland wants to put in , though . 
  the base closures may not be a good measurement of demilitarization . 
  the bases were established to serve cold war era needs along the iron curtain . 
  it 's unlikely that that is a line that will need to be defended in the near future . 
   leftists do n't care about reason , they only follow their agenda and ideology . 
  even if they see it clearly that they are wrong , that probably encourage them to try even harder , just like all the stubborn fanatics out there . 
  to reiterate my [ comment from the other day ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kg7tq/prime_minister_of_sweden_stefan_l%c3%b6fven_thinks/cuxo0hv ) :   that is the thing with < people-of-a-political-persuasion  , they have < negative-mental-characteristic  . 
    i think that people tend to use phrases of that format more-frequently than is actually warranted . 
  well , that 's an individual in the country . 
  i mean , there are a lot of people doing inadvisable things in poland , the us , russia , sweden , italy , and any other country you want to name . 
  heck , if i held a country responsible for everything that its citizens do on facebook , that country would never make it out of purgatory ... 
  sure , by `` give '' i 'm referring to having russian-favored leadership controlling syria , not russia annexing the thing . 
   russia is an emerging market and like almost every other emerging market , its crashing due to global economy and commodities ( metals , oils , gas ) being on the downside , so unless u can magically fix global economy , u ca n't do anything -_- there are * some * factors that are controllable or influenceable , but i agree that china 's economy and demand is not . 
   while many people have argued that fences `` will never work '' , the early signs are that mr orban 's policy of sealing the hungarian-serbian border is already having the effect he wanted . 
  it channels people to registration areas ( from where they can continue to germany or elsewhere ) and dissuades others from trying to cross . 
  this does not mean that this approach is universalizable . 
  if slovenia and ( somehow ) romania were all to do this and cut off the land route from greece into the rest of europe , it 's not clear that refugees would accept registration . 
  when hungary closed the borders , there was still a viable path of least resistance to germany and sweden open . 
  if a substantial financial commitment was made to get to get to the european mainland , turning back before germany or the uk means giving up on the dream of having a positive return on this : that is , many poor people are now financially-committed to making it through . 
  i ca n't do much with the scan , as i ca n't read german , but google translate on the article does n't list any sources of statistical data , other than a claim that `` it must be said clearly that it is not this is anecdotal . '', 
  / u/savannajeff , this is a bit unrelated , but since you 're talking about trade issues ... out of curiosity , what 's your take on the [ infant industry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infant_industry ) and [ anti-dumping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dumping_%28pricing_policy%29 ) arguments for trade protectionism ? 
  to my not-specializing-in-trade eyes , it seems like both are claimed much-more-frequently than is actually the case , but certainly i can understand at least the theoretical argument for them . 
  are there cases where developed countries took a no-protectionist route and were particularly successful ? 
  would you advocate eliminating trade policy that attempts to address these two concerns ? 
   tip is still directly undermining the laws and sovereignty of the whole of europe . 
  so if i get this straight , your trade negotiators are n't able to clearly see this , not able to fully understand the implications of what they 're negotiating over , but you are ? 
  i agree . 
  i just want a date to feed into the remindme bot . 
  so the way to resolve all refugee problems is to give syria to russia and to end the sanctions , eh ? 
  http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2015/09/09/10-private-colleges-and-universities-with-highest-lowest-sticker-prices  the 10 priciest schools in 2015-2016 charge an average of $ 50,632 in tuition and fees to undergraduate students . 
  and that 's before room and board , textbooks and other expenses . 
    at the opposite extreme of college costs , the least pricey schools charge an average of $ 9,571 in 2015-2016 . 
  note that that is only private universities -- the ones that do n't receive a ( direct ) government subsidy . 
  note that it 's common for people to pay different prices -- there 's effectively some degree of price discrimination going on due to need or merit-based aid , where someone with a weaker academic history or who is wealthier tending to pay more , so those can be treated as maximum prices in a system that engages in price discrimination .

   would it hurt the united states if florida split into a souther and northern state ?

  well , [ this site is apparently attempting to find positive stories about muslims ] ( http://muslimgoodnews.com/ ) . 
   the camps housing them are rife with rape and prostitution . 
  for whatever reason , references to rape show up very frequently in critical-of-immigration posts . 
  i 've seen only two real sources that relate at all to rape as regards immigrants here . 
  one was to an particular incident of sexual assault ( not rape ) in a camp ; not a statistic , but a single incident . 
  the other was to a study that showed that somalian refugees to finland were committing rape at a much-higher-than-average rate relative to the population as a whole . 
  do you have sources showing that refugee camps have a particularly-severe rape problem relative to the rest of the population ? 
  like , statistical data ? 
  i 'm having a hard time buying that there 's real evidence here just because there has n't been much time to have gathered data . 
  the somalian data is from people who immigrated a while back . 
   polish people ( both far right and far left wing ) keep attacking polish police all the time for no reason do you have a source/explanation ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that merkel does think about other countries .

   if i drove through a border post at full speed crashing through fences and shit . 
  okay , that 's fair enough , and it [ looks like that does happen ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/us/24border.html?_r=0 ) :  two mexican men were arrested on federal human-trafficking charges wednesday , a day after officials said three vans in which they were riding with scores of other mexicans tried to run through the border station at san diego . 
  [ snip ]  one van driver and one passenger were taken to a san diego hospital with gunshot wounds , one of them with serious injuries , the police said . 
  [ snip ]  three border agents opened fire when the vans were `` bearing directly down on them , '' lieutenant rooney said . 
  no shots were fired from the vans , he said . 
  would probably need to involve the border guards feeling that they were at risk , though . 
   yeah , desperate for handouts ... 
  i suspect that most people want access to a highly-paid labor market that they believe would be lucrative for them more than they want just welfare .

  i am a pretty ardent fan of a strong interpretation of free speech , and i agree that there is both a rich history of past attempts to encroach on free speech given an opportunity * and * misuse any exceptions . 
  i also particularly dislike vague , ill-defined exceptions and think that those are particularly prone to abuse . 
  but i think `` you either have free speech or you have n't . 
  there 's nothing in between . '', 
  goes too far . 
  there is a very real difference between germany and china in terms of potential consequences for political speech . 
  remember that even free speech guarantees like the us first amendment are , at the end of the day , just legal instruments , nothing magical . 
  they get a practical effect . 
  it 's a strong one , but the fact that it exists on the books does n't mean that free speech is , in reality , always protected . 
  look , i 'm not defending the stasi . 
  i agree that there are all sorts of extremely-disturbing things that the government could do regarding monitoring the populace , the stasi is near or at the top of my list , and frankly , i would n't want to have government-run people monitoring social media for political views either on this side of the atlantic . 
  my point is just that what they 're talking about here really is not , at least from the information provided , on-par with what the stasi became , and the reference to the stasi seems more to create emotional attachment to a very unpleasant thing than because there 's some factual relevance . 
   though no american would deny that tanks work in the desert , some americans do deny that deserts are growing larger . 
  [ climate change is making deserts greener ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/26/climate-change-is-making-deserts-greener.html ) global warming is causing desertification in some areas ; shrinking deserts in others . 
  more heat tends to increase evaporation , but warmer air increases the moisture-carrying capacity of air , permitting for more precipitation .

  ... without referencing the [ milgram experiment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milgram_experiment ) . 
  this was trying to explain why many people in nazi germany would participate in the execution of other germans . 
  a pleasantly-comfortable way to explain it was some sort of character flaw in people in germany . 
  the experiment demonstrated that ordinary american citizens ( later reproductions dealt with other nationalities ) would be willing to kill or seriously-risk the life of a stranger if told to do so by someone in a position of authority .
