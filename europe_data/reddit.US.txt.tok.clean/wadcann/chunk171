  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/its-happy-meal-time-as-mcdonalds-flagship-restaurant-reopens-in-moscow-9872333.html  it 's happy meal time as mcdonald 's flagship restaurant reopens in moscow http://www.kiev.info/food/mcdonalds.htm  mcdonald 's , the world 's largest chain of fast-food restaurants , has been treating the ukrainians with its famous burgers and sandwiches since 1997 . 
  the first mcdonald 's restaurants were a real sensation , customers traveled kilometers to visit them . 
  nowadays there are about 50 mcdonald 's restaurants in 16 ukrainian towns , and more than a dozen of mcdonald 's restaurants are in kiev . 
  they seem to be making a pretty good effort at it . 
  thanks !, 
  guess i 'm in the wrong !, 
   merkel is in the position to get putin to relent simply by cancelling one of the regular government-level consultations i doubt that even withdrawing the german embassy would cause russia to voluntarily turn back over eastern ukraine and crimea . 
  i guess it depends on what you mean by `` relent '' . 
  you mean be satisfied with taking and keeping land that has already been invaded and just not taking , say , mariupol in a couple of months ? 
  how do you define failure ? 
  eastern ukraine and crimea are occupied . 
  would success be formalizing the handover of that land to russia ? 
   it 's that we are putting our own good before that of ukraine , among other things .

  once you start to blur country lines and permit them to be malleable to use of force , you eliminate a substantial stabilizing influence .

  no , i do n't mean from an organizational standpoint ... i mean from a technical standpoint . 
  there 's no real way to know , remotely , what types of mining google is doing with my search data , for example . 
  i do n't believe that germany spends a huge proportion of its military spending on us-sourced equipment ; certainly there 's no constraint to do so . 
  fair enough !, 
  mind , i 'm sure that it 's not pure coincidence that the baltics just happened to be the focus this year ; just saying that there were going to be nato forces simulating a war against russia this year * somewhere * in europe anyway . 
  yeah , just saying that it 's not as if we were perfectly pure and innocent either . 
  russia was screaming about nato involvement when nato was doing * nothing * and russia was sending un-uniformed soldiers in . 
  russia 's going to complain no matter what happens anyway . 
  operation atlantic resolve is apparently routine . 
  the us congress apparently decided to drop another $ 1b on it to send over more forces and expand its scope , but a nato exercise of some degree was going to happen anyway . 
  that 's ... kind of mangling churchill there . 
  base count seems like a really poor metric for combat readiness . 
  it 's not as if a base somewhere in east asia has the least to do with the ability of the us to fight a war against russia in eastern europe . 
   ... but i guarantee none of those people are in poland , the baltic states , or ukraine right now . 
  if you 're referring * specifically * to people with those political views , maybe so ; it 's not as if i can get any hard data on that . 
  however , i believe that this is part of operation atlantic resolve . 
  that is a [ multi-nation operation ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/atlantic-resolve.htm ) that covers a substantial chunk of nato : aermenia , azerbaijan , belgium , bulgaria , the uk , georgia , moldova , poland , romania , turkey and ukraine at least were involved in the first exercise of it , and i 'm sure that other nations were involved as well in later exercises . 
  romanian and bulgarian naval forces were operating in the black sea . 
  the us is the largest single nation involved ( and congress just dumped another $ 1b to permit sending over more military ) , but a fair chunk of europe is involved as well . 
  really and honestly , while this sounds absolutely absurd today , with gps and perfect , high-detail maps , there was a point in time when it was a huge problem for advancing militaries . 
  even the american civil war hit this : * maps were not fantastic to begin with * many places had similar times ( e.g. 
  there were multiple `` cold harbors '' ) * it was par-for-the course to remove and hide road signs in the advent of advancing armies * civilians in hostile territories tended to give bad directions it also was n't that many years ago now that the royal marines , a part of a modern , well-equipped army , [ infamously invaded the wrong country ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/19/gibraltar.world ) : if that can happen in 2002 to the uk , it can probably happen to just about anyone .

  i know that journalist pay is n't what it once was , but we * do * have computerized spell-checkers these days . 
  this was referenced way back , and it 's plausible that it was a non-rigged vote . 
  the problem is that this is n't considered grounds for invasion and annexation of part of a country . 
  if it were , then russia also can also treat estonia and some other countries as fair game .

  < interested , checks various sources  [ wikipedia : propaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda )  propaganda is a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of a population toward some cause or position . 
    propaganda is information that is not impartial and used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda , often by presenting facts selectively ( perhaps lying by omission ) to encourage a particular synthesis , or using loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented . 
    while the term propaganda has acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and jingoistic examples , propaganda in its original sense was neutral and could refer to uses that were generally positive , such as public health recommendations , signs encouraging citizens to participate in a census or election , or messages encouraging persons to report crimes to law enforcement .
