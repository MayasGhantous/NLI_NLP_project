  sweden is probably the major remaining russian rival who had n't been blamed yet . 
  i 'm trying to think of any remaining historic russian enemies who have n't yet been blamed ... i guess japan has n't been blamed yet . 
  is bill gates a thief ? 
   im to lazy to google what and in which context the greek minister of defence really said , and why he said it and not the minister of economy or foreign policy . 
  well , he 's apparently a member of the [ independent greeks ] ( http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/politics/article/who-is-panos-kammenos ) who got his position because of the syriza coalition , and apparently anti-immigration is a large chunk of their platform . 
  his statement might well have more to do with domestic politics than anything else . 
   ... the bashing of foreign countrys which struggle because the us dominion and liege of germany decided that neoliberal bankocracy was the best for europe . 
  i really think that the us has been a small figure in the handling of the eu debt crisis compared to germany and france and the like . 
  i guess the us could have lent or gifted money to greece on more-favorable terms than european lenders did . 
  i 'm not saying that the us would have done anything differently , but i really do n't see how or why the us would be key in eu members not giving money to greece . 
  http://europa.eu/about-eu/index_en.htm  human dignity , freedom , * democracy * , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights : these are the core values of the eu . 
  i 'm a little sad that both sides view it as a threat . 
  : - /   ... we may end up having to do a referendum . 
    in that case other eurzone members should also hold referendums ... `` we might have to * democracy * you . '', 
  maybe we 'll have to * democracy * you back . '', 
  women mostly do n't have children after 40 , anyway . 
  if we get strong ai , the world will be a * very * different place . 
  it 's hard even to imagine how it will differ , and i tend to be a lot more pessimistic than the utopian crowd . 
  even ignoring the effects of all the secondary technological changes : * historically , the reason that we 're social animals is because we 're stronger together than apart . 
  in theory , if an ai can do everything that a human can do , now we 're resource competitors rather than creatures that are mutually-advantageous . 
  having a large population in your country , or keeping people alive , plummets to zero . 
  * control of raw materials becomes important , though ... * ... the balance of power is radically up for grabs . 
  whoever winds up with strong ai first , assuming they are able to retain a monopoly on it , will probably an have overwhelming military , economic , and other advantage . 
  existing countries may have difficulty enforcing claims over raw resources . 
  * the stabilizing influence of people not-wanting-to-go-to-war-because-of-the-risk-of-casualties , already somewhat blunted in the event of technological disparity , will in significant part vanish . 
  * probably a significant amount of effort on the part of whoever has strong ai will go into ensuring that nobody else gets it . 
  if this is not the case at first , then somebody will seek to establish a monopoly . 
  a lot of our society is built upon assumptions that the presence of strong ai changes . 
  yes , men are a minority in my country . 
   europe 's acute security concerns , he said , made a proposed trade agreement with the united states a strategic priority . 
  he said it was essential that american and european negotiators reach an agreement on the trans-atlantic trade and investment partnership a deal strongly opposed by a host of european groups wary of globalization and american-style capitalism . 
  from what little i know of ttip , sounds like a vaguely-good idea ( i realize that it does have opponents on here ; it 's not really a news item in the us at all ) . 
  i do n't see how it can be seen as essential to maintaining a united front against russia , though . 
  that 's not what happened in the korean or vietnam wars . 
  eyeballing that , it looks like a negative correlation with per-capita economic strength . 
   germany , as well as the germanic peoples around it , have a strong sense and perception of a society working together , much less individualistic than many countries like france or greece . 
  according to this [ map of social expenditure as percentage of gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:social_expenditure_as_percentage_of_gdp_oecd_2013.svg ) , germany has less social spending than france , though . 
  i just mean that , for example , the uk may have their own unofficial goals in the eu project : they may not want a federation . 
   wars between eu/nato members is obviously a non-issue . 
  however the need for collective european security action is probably at its highest point ( was n't too important during the cold war with the us doing the heavy lifting ) . 
  based on articles talking about shifting military budgets us was actually bearing about half of the military costs in nato during the cold war , versus about 85 % today : the us * was n't * doing the bulk of the heavy lifting then . 
   and cyprus : the eu force would have to fight the turks , who are in nato . 
  that would be most odd . 
  eh , nato and eu both manage to deal with spain wanting gibraltar . 
   step 1 : get rid of the unequal representation in the european parliament , a german vote in eu election should weigh as much as a maltese vote ( currently a maltese vote weighs about 11 times more than that of german ) and introduce directly elected councilers in the european council , that would act as a second chamber similar to the senate of the usa . 
  i give this a low chance of happening . 
  organizations do n't just give up political power because of a desire to neaten things up . 
  as long as ( a ) the ability to block this change is available to less-populous states and ( b ) less-populous states would be disadvantaged by it , it 's not going to happen . 
   step 4 : introduce continent wide referendums where a absolute majority of the population and of the countries need to approve any major change in the union . 
  note that `` major '' is a really hard thing to define . 
  for example , in the united states , the following things are theoretically under the exclusive authority of the state-level government : * road construction * drinking age and these require congressional action : * war however , all of these have been bypassed by loopholes . 
  the us [ interstate highway system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interstate_highway_system ) ( dwight d. eisenhower national system of interstate and defense highways ) is technically a `` military '' project to move tanks , which comes under federal authority . 
  the drinking age was never mandated by the federal government , but the federal government then used the above system to refuse to send tax dollars to states that did n't set the drinking age where the federal government wanted it . 
  war is supposed to be declared by congress , but because it 's politically-dicey for a legislator to vote for war , loopholes have effectively permitted the president to wage war without any congressional approval since world war ii . 
  even the apparently-clearest lines of authority are subject to attack ; i think that you 're going to have a very hard time establishing a difference between major and minor changes . 
   a ) have defence spending targets ( make them the same as nato 's 2 % of gdp ) . 
  nato does n't have the ability to enforce defense spending targets . 
  will the eu ? 
  can brussels hand down budgetary requirements ? 
  seems like it would cede a lot of authority if that 's not currently the case . 
  and if a country 's politics are currently such that it 's spending less than 2 % , and the eu will not be granted that authority , why would having an eu label rather than a nato label create more pressure for a different military spending policy ? 
   ... the eu is an organisation meant to end as something similar to the usa . 
  afaik , that 's not a official goal . 
  might be a good idea , but that 's a different matter ... 
  [ marshall ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/marshall )  1 . 
  ( us ) alternative spelling of [ marshal ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/marshal#english ) [ martial ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/martial )  1 . 
  of , relating to , or suggestive of war ; warlike . 
   your average european can hardly pinpoint a fair number of african nations on the map , let alone judge if it is wise to intervene in any given situation that compels us . 
  that 's a very un-democratic position ( it even moves away from an accountable representative democracy ) . 
  ( it may * be * that democracy is a bad thing in some cases ; just pointing out the nature of what 's being said . ), 
  i do n't understand the use of secret ballots for representatives in the eu at all . 
  the idea behind a [ secret ballot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secret_ballot ) is that it blocks any accountability from the voter to anyone else . 
  this is a nice property in terms of letting an individual who ( should ) represent only themselves not be beholden to outside interests . 
  but a representative * is * expected to be beholden to the people who he represents . 
   establish in stone the eu 's commitment for the overseas territories of its member states . 
  people seem to forget the extent of overseas territories still present around the world . 
  in the 21st century these are n't merely national assets : they are european assets . 
  most of those are french or british assets , though . 
  how enthusiastic is , say , slovenia going to be about spending blood and treasure to defend those ? 
  russia is , to lesser-or-greater degree , a common concern for all european countries : it 's easier to find consensus on something like russia . 
  i get [ the impression that inflated eu bureaucrat pay has been something of a british sticking point ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10847979/10000-european-union-officials-better-paid-than-david-cameron.html ) . 
  i suppose that the idea of paying a few countries to control europe 's military is okay , as long as people generally-feel loyal to europe as a whole . 
  it does bring to mind the [ decline of the roman empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decline_of_the_roman_empire ) , though :  they gradually entrusted the role of defending the empire to barbarian mercenaries who eventually turned on them . 
  [ snip ]  the historian arther ferrill has suggested that the roman empire -- particularly the military -- declined largely as a result of an influx of germanic mercenaries into the ranks of the legions . 
  this `` germanization '' and the resultant cultural dilution or `` barbarization '' led not only to a decline in the standard of drill and overall military preparedness within the empire , but also to a decline of loyalty to the roman government in favor of loyalty to commanders . 
  [ snip ]  in the end , due to economic failure , even the armor and weaponry of soldiers became so obsolete that the enemies of the empire had better armor and weapons as well as larger forces . 
  the decrepit social order offered so little to its subjects that many saw the barbarian invasion as liberation from onerous obligations to the ruling class . 
  [ snip ]  ... dependency on germanic * foederati * for the military ... 
   economic differences are probably smaller within the states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_income in 2011 , the span ran from maryland , with a $ 70k median household income , to mississippi , with a $ 36k median household income . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_military_pay it 's fixed in dollar terms across all states . 
  there are [ significant differences in percentages of a state population that have gone into the military ] ( http://www.statemaster.com/graph/peo_per_of_civ_pop_who_are_vet-percent-civilian-population-who-veterans ) . 
  there is an offset based on cost-of-living based on where the person is * stationed * , since the soldier will have to pay more or less based on where they 're actually living . 
  in what way do greek , italian , and french societies and companies not respond in the same way as germany societies and companies to reforms ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_culture  nowadays , russian cultural heritage is ranked seventh in the nation brands index , based on interviews of some 20,000 people mainly from western countries and the far east . 
  [ global maps with this data ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/health/140904/map-youth-elderly-world-political-unrest-economy-unemployment ) . 
  africa will tend to become much more demographically-important in the world , and europe much less . 
   second , greeks , italians and french are not germans . 
  their economies certainly need structural reforms , which have , for example , boosted exports from spain , but their societies and companies simply do not respond in the same way . 
  while i agree with the sentiment , this is going to result in people tearing pages out of textbooks . 
  hmm .
