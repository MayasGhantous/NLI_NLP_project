  maybe the sample size is too-small , but there 's at least a rough correlation between low military spending and wanting an eu army : luxembourg spends 0.4 % of its gdp on its military . 
  china has no reason to sanction russia . 
  they 're not going to pick a fight with russia any more than with the west , and it 's profitable for them to sit on the side . 
  i do n't realistically-think that anyone could expect otherwise . 
   russia is , in many respects , dying ... churches are largely empty . 
  not sure how useful a metric of a nation 's life this is , but [ church attendance in russia quadrupled between 1991 and 2008 ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2014/02/10/russians-return-to-religion-but-not-to-church/ ) . 
  even * if * a woman got there on her own merits , now you 've got everyone thinking `` yeah ... her . '', 
   a survey published thursday by the levada center found that despite their support for their president , russians are not in a hurry to purchase putin paraphernalia . 
  seventy-two percent of the population had not purchased and had no interest in acquiring a t-shirt featuring an image of the stunt-happy putin ... 
  wait , so twenty-eight percent owned a t-shirt with putin on it or wanted to buy one and this is viewed as not wanting to purchase putin gear ? 
   these can mislead others to think that one country might invest on roads a lot less than the other - or even worst , create the idea that one country is less developed than another in the same magnitude as one road is better than the other - while in reality it will only tell you about the investment in this particular area of each of the countries .

  it 's not at all clear that finland * only * would have lost what the ussr asked for .

  * i was looking up numbers the other day , and most electrical production in poland , at least , is not from natural gas . 
  i assume that a good chunk of it is for heating ( like houses ) or industrial use ( like assisting electric arc furnaces ) , so you 'd have to rip out infrastructure up to wherever it 's actually being used . 
  even * if * it were used for electrical production , you 'd still have to throw away your gas electrical power plant generation equipment . 
  * if you want to use electrical power , you need to have an electrical grid capable of pushing more power : you can only run so much power over a line . 
  the us has talked about this recently because there is n't enough electrical infrastructure to put everyone in an electrical car , even if we wanted to do so and had enough electrical cars . 
  we would n't be able to deliver the electricity to the charging stations . 
  * if russia is actually selling gas near their cost , it 's probably very economical . 
  it 's just that there 's the possibility of cutoffs and russia increasing prices and so forth . 
   americans may be soulless bastards , but at least they had the guts to admit an outrageous ammount of spying , extradordinary rendition and a completely void of result torture program . 
  we admitted to the rendition and the bullshit torture thing , but if what you 're referring to by `` spying '' is talking about the snowden affair , while snowden may very well be american , patriotic , and driven by conscience , his actions clearly are at odds with our government . 
  even if rand paul ( who proposed a short sentence for him ) gets into office , he 's still running a very likely risk of some form of jail time if he makes it back into the us .

  note that the bombers were * not * in ireland 's airspace , though the author goes out of his way to obfuscate that fact . 
   russian bombers disrupt commercial flights in ireland 's airspace the commercial flights were in ireland 's airspace , but the bombers were not . 
   the irish aviation authority told the irish examiner that british authorities had notified them that the bombers were moving ** toward ** irish air space ... [ snip ]  the incident come just weeks after irish airspace was ** buzzed ** by russian bombers ... [ snip ]  after that scare the irish department of foreign affairs and trade sought assurances from the russian ambassador in dublin that military aircraft ** would not fly unannounced into irish-controlled airspace ** ... 
  well ... realistically , if putin or an ally were involved , it would n't matter what the investigation found either . 
  `` science '' is too broad of something to fund , though , and there are a lot of things that fall under the category of `` science '' that are n't worthwhile . 
  it 's science to theorize how long a mouse will take to eat a sugar cube -- you can produce a sophisticated model involving humidity , how long since the mouse slept , how long since the mouse last had sex , blood sugar levels , age of the mouse , and all that , and probably get increasingly-good predictions going ... but we 'd be predicting something that would n't be of interest , and be pulling people off something else . 
  say , rather , that there are things that fall under `` science '' which are important and valuable . 
  the actual source locations do look nice , but i 'd also point out that the photography looks like it 's getting an awful lot of hdr and/or gamma/saturation fiddling . 
  while i think that russia probably was a negative ( that is , we can do things like compare finland and estonia ) , i think that [ the idea of bringing good to the occupied seems to be a pretty common theme in empires ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilizing_mission ) , and russia 's far from the only country to make claims along those lines . 
  yes , in some cases there probably was a benefit , but it seems like the occupier is typically awfully-willing to buy into the idea that they 're gracing the occupied with their presence . 
  well ... i do n't know what `` combat-ready '' means as the bundeswehr defines it . 
  an aircraft or a tracked vehicle is n't going to be ready 100 % of the time : you need to replace parts on it , which are only rated for operating for so long . 
  i do n't know what percentage of a typical army is combat-ready ; that may not be abnormal . 
  it 's actually not such a crazy idea , because a very large cannon also [ permits for rather cheap space launches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_gun#practical_attempts ) . 
  the downside is that it also puts ridiculous forces on whatever it 's launching , so you 're going to have trouble launching people and most things that we might want to build , but if you want to get bulk material into orbit ( e.g. 
  to build a sizeable space station , once you have sufficient equipment to retrieve and process the material in space ) , it could be an important component of the world 's space launching capacity . 
  because the reason that germany is surrounded by those buffer states is because nato has an umbrella over them . 
  if the border states are expected to fend for themselves and effectively defend germany , they are n't going to be able to do so . 
  france does n't necessarily need to have a strong air logistics arm if it can rely on other nations to fill in the gap . 
  it might be less-efficient to have every country duplicate effort on those grounds . 
  if it turns out that a nation has a strong interest in maintaining watercraft ( e.g. 
  it 's a safe bet that the uk cares more about having a navy than slovakia does ) , then no problem ; slovakia can certainly specialize in whatever is useful to it . 
  the nato spending constraint is n't `` every nation must be able to conduct completely-independent overseas operations '' , but `` put a certain amount of spending into the military capabilities of the country '' . 
  the us * has * to have a major air logistics arm , and will have one for the forseeable future , given that it 's on the other side of the world , so unless there 's concern about the us pulling out of nato , there 's going to be an awful lot of air logistics capacity available anyway . 
  it 's just that if france is n't going to do air logistics , it should focus on tanks or have a stockpile of air-to-surface missiles or develop anti-air defenses or something else that fills in a gap . 
   it 's always annoyed me when people say , `` it 's 2015 , we should n't be doing x ; it 's 2015 , x is of the past ; we do n't do x in the 21st century '' and i hear that a lot about defense spending . 
  well , some things * do * change and can be eliminated , and saying `` that 's old '' can be a reasonable shorthand for `` everyone else has stopped doing that thing for very good reasons '' . 
  there are reasons for not wearing hoop skirts , but i can summarize it as `` nobody does that any more '' . 
  it 's totally fair to say that just having a sort of emotional association to `` that 's old '' is n't a good reason to get rid of something , and if someone wants to contest the statement , then you maybe need to provide some reasons ( `` women get out of the house more and a hoop skirt is unwieldy , intertia attached to dresses is n't present any more and pants have been found to work pretty well , etc '' ) . 
  i think that it 's reasonable to use statements like `` that 's just old '' , though , unless there * is * an argument against the thing . 
  no , i agree : it 's not something that i 'm trying to say should be acceptable . 
  eh , that 's probably also what people said about camouflage on uniforms when they started out . 
   i mean biddings like these barely cost a thing if your own industries builds them . 
  ehh ... if an engineer is building a weapons system , he ca n't be building a civilian system . 
  the cost is real , and it should n't be marginalized : having a functioning military means not having other things that you could have had . 
  there may be enormous inefficiencies in militaries as they are today that could be improved , but it still is going to cost something : 2 % of gdp is money that could buy other good things that people might want . 
   so long as they do n't give anyone west of poland a single bullet , boot or dime . 
  the uk and other nations went along on a lot of our sometimes-rather-silly excursions , even when * they * probably felt that they had rather-more-useful things to do . 
  and it 's not in the us 's interest to have europe being clobbered , anyway . 
  i wish that europe would stick to the nato targets too ( or at * least * honestly re-negotiate them , if they really feel that they want a lower level of military defense in europe ) , but just as there is a time and place for that , i 'm not comfortable holding out on countries that really are in trouble either to which we 've made commitments . 
  if the us wants to complain about it , the time and place to do it is n't now . 
  we committed to provide a level of defense . 
  you 're upset about that commitment , we can withdraw from nato ( with a year of warning ) if it ca n't be otherwise-negotiated , but the way to deal with that is not to just not fulfill commitments after having agreed to make them . 
  we 've made security commitments to countries around the world , and it is important to them that we hold up commitments to others ; it 's hard to regain trust once lost . 
  we 're talking about 368 hectares . 
  that 's 3.68 square kilometers , or 1.42 square miles . 
  it 's not an enormous chunk of land . 
  well , anyone can establish a claim . 
  a country does n't need to `` think '' that it has a claim : it just says that it has a claim . 
  the question is whether it has the ability and will to enforce that claim ( which , in the case of at least some ukranian land , the answer is `` yes '' ) . 
  if your goal is to quietly make him disappear , it makes no sense . 
  if your goal is to frighten similarly-vocal opposition into being quiet , it makes a lot of sense . 
  hammering on a minor technical point , i think that the [ mxy-7 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yokosuka_mxy7_ohka ) and similar kamikaze aircraft would count as combat aircraft , though they ca n't really fire at anything : just crash into them . 
  well , he was echoing me , and i meant rocket re : the irish planes : old ground-attack stuff . 
  because they 're using a farm tractor for towing ? 
  that does n't seem like an unreasonable cost-saving measure : it does n't prevent the aircraft from being used , and a tractor has a lot of torque and good visibility . 
  i 'm all for coalitions and all that , but honestly , ireland does n't currently appear to have have any meaningful air-to-air capability against fixed-wing aircraft . 
  they could give authorization to fly into irish airspace or contribute money or add prestige by being part of the coalition , i guess .
