  thank you -- that 's the right question to ask . 
  requires too much technical knowledge . 
  noscript breaks sites and requires people to go fiddle it back on . 
  better to force all cookies to session and nuke fsos via betterprivacy . 
  ip address is harder ( though nat does complicate that a bit ) -- you 'd probably need to have people using a vpn for that . 
  that way , you just have to deal with `` browsing is slower and i always have to log in manually/use my browser keychain '' rather than `` website x randomly does n't work '' . 
  i use noscript and noscript is great -- if you 're able to diagnose broken websites . 
  but i would n't suggest that most users install it , unfortunately . 
  that being said , at some point , the arms race becomes too much for joe smith and you just start to want a `` privacy providing '' service that deals with anonymization . 
  the fbi got panicky about pgp when it was released ... but it turns out that few people actually * use * pgp , because it required effort to become familiar with it . 
  it did not usher in an era of secure email . 
  oh yes it is !, 
  the document that that document cites on fas.org as its source does n't actually say anything about us sales to syria . 
  farben , what 's your source for the refugeesandweapons.png screenshot that shows $ 7.7 b from the us ? 
  i just went through all of the wikipedia sources on syrian military hardware , and i do n't see anything at all us-produced , and little from europe -- it 's almost completely russian or soviet , including the larger items like ships . 
  that seems strange . 
  syria appears to use [ primarily russian or soviet equipment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equipment_of_the_syrian_army ) . 
  i do n't see any us entries there . 
   saudi arabia has every reason to keep prices down . 
  why ? 
  if it 's a `` squish competition '' argument , that production will start back up again once saudi arabia stops . 
  saudi arabia would prefer to sell oil at whatever some optimal price is for it . 
   they need to put an end to fracking asap . 
  why ? 
  if they do n't lower their prices below the cost of production for hydrofracking , fracking still happens . 
  if they do , then it 's simply worse for them than letting production happen at fracking prices . 
  it 's not like the resources will vanish if production is shut down for a time . 
  someone , the next investor , will step up once prices rise . 
  and fracking is primarily a us thing thus far , and the us has n't been complaining in the least . 
   sanctions on russia helps saudi arabia too . 
  russia needs western tech for drilling in the arctic and sanctions make that a lot harder . 
  sure , there could be other ways in which saudi arabia is aligned with us-eu interests . 
   commodities are down all across the board and this has nothing to do with russia . 
  saudi arabia 's [ certainly ramped up production , in a time when prices were very unfavorable to them doing so ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2014/12/16/how-opec-destroyed-the-russian-ruble/ ) . 
  supposing [ germany , and in particular , chancellor merkel is trustworthy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pyine/sweden_now_demands_other_eu_countries_take_up_to/cwb0y44 ) . 
  how would it be possible to tell ? 
   some stupidly altruistic country like germany or sweden takes them and then demands its neighbors help it out by admonishing them for not doing their part . 
  just as a reminder -- we ca n't see everything that sweden and germany 's leadership see . 
  what if , say , ensuring that syrian refugees were handled was part of a deal struck with saudi arabia ? 
  the us-aligned saudi arabia is burning immense amounts of wealth to flatten the world oil markets , something which hurts russia badly and which started a while after ukraine was attacked and after the european powers and the us announced an economic rather than military strategy against russia . 
  i would guess that saudi arabia is not doing this for free . 
  they have taken in no refugees , even though they 've been one of the backers of anti-assad forces . 
  seems odd to not have at least taken in some * token * people , unless there was already a guarantee that they would n't be on the hook for it . 
  nor has anything shown up in the news from chancellor merkel or president obama asking that saudi arabia take in refugees . 
  chancellor merkel has taken a very strong stance in favor of taking in syrian refugees . 
  i understand that she is considered to be pragmatic , not someone who has traditionally taken risky political positions , and doing this is in opposition to quite a bit of friction . 
  if she viewed germany doing this as a trade that was ultimately intended to whack russia in defense of eastern europe , that might even explain the [ frustration ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-eu-needs-to-consider-treaty-change/ ) over eastern european positions . 
  simply reducing this to `` germany is being stupidly altruistic '' might not be terribly-accurate . 
  i 'm not enthusiastic about explanations that require world political leaders and the people working for them to be kinda simple-minded . 
  why would rape have anything to do with this ? 
  i mean that if someone does n't have food or access to food , they 're going to do whatever it takes to survive , including stealing money . 
  if i were a controversial leader , i do n't think i 'd be adopting random cell phones from people . 
  it 's an anonymously-sourced second-hand report of what putin supposedly said . 
  hmm . 
  well , existing law definitely does n't map terribly-cleanly to the internet . 
  i 'm not sure if this is the right way to go ... but on the other hand , it 's also pretty difficult to do anything right now . 
  it 'd be preferable to lock down systems technically rather than trying to use law , but i do n't think that we 've done a very good job of that ( and it might even be impossible to do that ) . 
  i wonder what happens in international telephone fraud cases . 
  no country in europe uses capital punishment except belarus , and [ belarus just shoots them in the back of the head ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_in_belarus#method ) . 
  the us executes people , but [ only the state of washington ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_in_washington_state ) ( and , under unlikely circumstances , new hampshire ) presently permit hanging . 
  huh ? 
   national socialism has very little to do with other kinds of socialism . 
  their economic policy was heavily state-controlled capitalism , which is more or less authoritarian centrist . 
  [ the nazi platform ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_program#the_25-point_program_of_the_nsdap ) included the following :  * abolition of unearned ( work and labour ) incomes . 
  breaking of debt ( interest ) - slavery . 
    * in consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people , personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people . 
  therefore we demand the total confiscation of all war profits . 
    * we demand the nationalisation of all ( previous ) associated industries ( trusts ) . 
    * we demand a division of profits of all heavy industries . 
    * we demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare . 
    * we demand a land reform suitable to our needs , provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility , abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land . 
  these are not positions that i 'd normally think of as centrist , but from the left . 
  it 's legitimate to point out that the political position probably does not fit nicely into a one-dimensional classification system , but i do n't think that it 's legitimate to call it centrist . 
  huh . 
  when did you adopt the new flair ? 
   anybody i have spoken to in real life is absolutely terrified of this `` migrant '' crisis to be totally honest , i think that i 'd prefer to see more poll results . 
  the problem is that it 's really hard for one person to get a good random sampling of a national population , and i see people in these threads often claiming completely different positions for their country . 
   islam does not integrate into any society . 
  there are forms of islam that do not . 
  but not all forms of islam are identical , either . 
  there are very moderate forms of christianity that are quite different from the spanish inquisition-era christianity . 
  ditto for judaism -- there are moderate , revised , fairly-compatible-with-mainstream-secular-society forms , and there are some fairly extreme forms . 
  people are n't supposed to vote based on whether-or-not they agree with a comment 's position . 
  i 'd guess stuff like vandalism -- spraypainting things on buildings . 
   in the meantime usa is using isis source ? 
  probably because : * they believe that they may be penalized for doing so . 
  * they believe that it 's possible that austria and germany will keep the doors open draining them at until at least after closing doors causing intake through the balkans or until pull factors are shut down . 
  * if the eu is to shut doors , probably doing so between slovenia and croatia is not the best place to do it . 
  * actually closing their doors outside of the authorized border checkpoints would require a substantial investment of resources , and limiting traffic at the borders has n't worked thus far , as people simply cross elsewhere . 
  i think that / u/sarloh was speaking about the eu in general closing doors rather than specifically slovenia . 
   `` it 's a pity that we had to come together because of a crisis , but we know how the eu works , that it functions and evolves through crises and maybe we needed a crisis to come together , '' the ambassador said . 
  that 's ... not the most diplomatic thing that could be said . 
  it 's just a guess . 
  scotland 's currently 5.3 m. 
  how many do you think that scotland could take ? 
   you really have no clue i do n't think that it would be a good * idea * . 
  i do n't want the us taking more than the 10k syrians that it said that it would take . 
  i 'm just saying that it would not wipe out europe . 
   where do you put 50m ? 
  you probably start out with camps of the same sort that have been used in places like turkey or requisition existing space to the extent that 's there 's a requirement for life , perhaps assigning people to existing residents .
