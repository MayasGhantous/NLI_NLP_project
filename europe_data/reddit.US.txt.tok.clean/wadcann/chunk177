  but the point is that if you get no preference for asylum when showing up over applying from turkey -- germany just says `` sorry , we 're full up '' and deports you -- then you are n't getting anything via illegal immigration . 
  i believe that what you 're proposing is actually quite-similar in impact to what i 'm proposing . 
   idiotic bans of trivial items ( like traditional medical thermometers ) pushed by 12 year old minds from brussels . 
  not trying to argue that everything that the eu does is ideal or that that particular ban is justified , but i 'd point out that [ the us does this too ] ( http://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2011/02/25/mercury-thermometers-face-final-phase-out ) -- my understanding is that it 's a substantial source of the mercury in landfills . 
  the alcohol-based replacements seem to me to work well-enough -- i 've both a mercury thermometer and alcohol thermometers , and if anything , the red alcohol one is easier to read . 
  this kind of stuff seems really counter-productive . 
  i 've seen people complain that the uk wants `` the good stuff without the bad stuff '' . 
  but from what i 've seen here , the uk has n't asked for authority over an area without responsibility : it does n't seem to be abusing opt-outs to try to dodge handling something . 
  it just wanted a trade union , maybe with a defense agreement and something more . 
  it has n't proposed stopping the eu doing that , but rather just that it would rather be more-loosely-bound . 
  and i 've seen a lot of people here threatening it with `` we 'll make you hurt if you do n't commit to federalization '' . 
  that seems really unproductive -- it should be the responsibility of a federalization effort to make membership desirable to a state , not to try to beat it about the head if it does n't accept . 
  it seems to me that the eu should be structured such that if the eu wants the uk in a federal union , that the uk will , n years down the road , even if it does n't join the federalization union now , say `` whoah , that looks pretty good ... i should sign up after all '' . 
   i feel like if there was only the 6 creators + spain + portugal + irland it would have been much better . 
  last i saw , france is only accepting 44k migrants and has the political clout to block new numbers if it feels that the other members are demanding that it accept too many . 
  i think that there 's concern from some members in the eu that if they accept mandatory quotas , at that point countries with a lot of influence in the eu might transfer very great numbers of migrants to them , and that they would lack such brakes . 
  i do n't think that the mechanics here would be different with a smaller eu . 
   which is the issue people have with the quota ... that number just keeps getting higher and higher . 
  i think that it might be possible for chancellor merkel to sell countries on a defined amount of intake , but i think that signing a blank check here is risky , since it would be possible for very large numbers to then show up . 
  i also think that if the total number will be small , that this is a bad move for the chancellor in that it is quite unpopular in those countries . 
  this would burn a lot of political capital , and it seems that there are probably other things that are more-valuable that it could be spent on than relocating a small number . 
   there is automatically a preference , because if you `` just come '' then you are here . 
  if you wait there , you may or may not be allowed to come . 
  by preference , i mean in choosing whether-or-not to grant asylum , not in choosing whether to ship someone to the eu . 
   what we need is n't simply `` no preference to applications already in the eu '' , but the absolute impossibility to get asylum if they come illegally on their own , instead of going to the official application point in the turkish camp . 
  that aims at the same goal , but my belief is that it goes further than is necessary -- as long as the migrant gains nothing via illegal immigration from an asylum application standpoint , the fact that it costs more and is dangerous to immigrate illegally seems like it would likely be a sufficient deterrent . 
  any limits would need to apply to those who physically show up as well , this is why the :  * assuming * , and this is critical , that the eu gives no preference to applications already in the eu over those applying from in the camps . 
  otherwise people will have a reason to keep illegally-immigrating . 
  ... bit in my comment . 
   not our problem '' club of eastern europeans and the uk . 
  hmm . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're talking about being `` not our problem '' . 
  if it 's the middle east , the club 's larger than that : we 're only taking 10k syrians in the us , and i do n't support increasing that number . 
  if you mean the eu border countries ... i agree that italy/greece deserve some support , in one form or another , from the rest of the eu , as the eu does have a responsibility to not clobber them , particularly since most people are n't really trying to get the greece/italy , and might not have even come in if that were the case . 
  maybe it amounts to no more than financial funds to seal the border and deport people , but they * were * getting clobbered , and through nothing they did . 
  if you mean germany/sweden/etc , since these are destination countries ... that 's a tough one . 
  there are some ways in which i think that the destination countries do deserve assistance , and some not . 
  ** in favor of eu support for destination countries via quotas ** : * it 's not the fault of the destination countries that people want to come to them , and to at least * some * degree , eu membership makes it harder for them to limit immigration . 
  if , in the future , people will ultimately move more-or-less freely around the eu , then * any * country that permits immigration will simply be treated as a weak link to get into the destination countries . 
  if national borders stay down , it 's harder for the destination countries to secure their borders ... since those borders are now essentially the size of schengen . 
  * to some degree , countries pitch in where they can serve well -- that makes sense . 
  one thing that poorer countries in the eu are particularly * good * at is , without requiring the destination countries to repudiate the 1951 refugee convention , making the prospect of illegally-immigrating a lot less appealing , since it 's a good bet that a lot of these people would not have illegally immigrated if it would have dumped them in , say , romania . 
  romania can thus serve as something of a threat . 
  additionally , it 's cheaper for destination countries to place refugees in romania * even if they still pay for them * because it massively reduces how much they have to pay for welfare and other benefits , since the levels in those countries are lower . 
  * it does help build a sense of solidarity . 
  germany * has * eaten some pain for other countries , and knowing that other countries will eat some pain for it is probably nice . 
  * if the eu federalizes and immigration has been to another eu member , guess what -- you 're going to wind up with those immigrants anyway to some extent . 
  ** against eu support for destination countries via quotas ** : * at the end of the day , the eu had the ability to negotiate eu-level control of immigration . 
  at the time that happened , the various states would determine whether it was a good deal for them . 
  the eu chose to postpone that , and now it 's being demanded that various countries accept immigration without any negotiation . 
  * i think that whether-or-not this is a good idea , it 's extremely undiplomatic to have chancellor merkel appear to be forcing-through requirements on countries . 
  maybe that 's what she does behind the scenes in negotiations between countries , but she should not ever make a public statement like that . 
  nobody in , say , hungary wants to think `` oh , great ... so five years down the road , what might germany demand and threaten over ? 
  what policy might change next ? '', 
  germany is a particularly-interested party in trying to address germany 's concern of too many immigrants in germany , so it 's hard for it to also act as a sort of objective judge . 
  she might be involved in the negotiations , but i do n't think that the political image she cuts in being the one to make these announcements is the best . 
  * the quotas are open-ended . 
  the request is for countries to sign a blank check . 
  i 'm not convinced that there is sufficient trust in germany/the eu to restrict immigration sufficiently for countries to be willing to sign a blank check -- the numbers that have been permitted into germany and sweden may be quite alarming to other members . 
  maybe chancellor merkel is thinking of a small number , but without guarantees ... well . 
  there 's no way to know where this will go , and it 's better to raise a concern now than to agree than then renege on the agreement . 
  * those destination states did , perhaps by nothing more than refusal to violate the refugee convention , choose to accept a lot of people . 
  other eu member states were * not * given a chance to cap that immigration or even block it . 
  that 's the flip side of federalizing immigration -- normally , states have to deal with the consequences , but they have some say in what will happen . 
  here , if all the eu states knew that they 'd be on the hook themselves , they might have blocked refugee immigration into the eu entirely . 
  might not from the balkans , particularly if that 's been going on for a long time , but the relatively-recent large-scale illegal immigration from palestine/pakistan/eritrea / syria/etc was n't happening at one point , so just the prospect of working illegally presumably is n't enough . 
  plus , if someone * is * working illegally , the requirements on germany to grant freedom of movement , benefits on par with that of citizens , all that stuff goes away . 
  that 's a win from germany 's standpoint . 
  i 'm not mandating any number . 
  the number you adopt might be zero or it might be 300 million or even , as might be what 's done here , not even publicly committing to a number . 
  the difference is just that it come from turkey rather than from the pool of illegal immigrants in germany so that people stop illegally coming through most of europe . 
  some of the previous issues that europe was faced with was because the destination countries were trying to limit applicants not by refusing to accept them , but by making them clamber over other european countries . 
  that policy was n't working well at limiting the numbers and it was creating tons of headaches . 
  now , the destination countries * still * have the issue that they may not want to accept gobs of refugees . 
  but this does n't harm them on that point -- if they want to accept 1m people or 1 person , they can still do that . 
  they are n't needing to accept * more * refugees . 
  this way , they get to screen people who are showing up , they do n't run into deportation problems if someone is n't accepted ... 
  because the benefit to a migrant of illegally-immigrating vanishes . 
  there 's no reason , at least in terms of getting asylum , to immigrating illegally with all the expense and danger if all you 'd get at the end of the trip would be access to some clerk who is already available in turkey . 
  oh , there might be some non-asylum-related benefits , like the possibility of working illegally , and i 'm sure that there 's always been * some * illegal immigration to europe ... but it was n't until the possibility of asylum-based legal residency due to conflicts was there that the large flows that are present today really kicked off . 
  will this approach be less-likely to do so ? 
  that 's not very diplomatic . 
  the dublin convention was generated because it conformed to the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , which does cover the countries involved :  1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  if the travel is * not * directly from such a country , then the country can penalize an applicant for it . 
  one such penalty might be deporting them . 
   know she want to take people from turkey but i am not sure how it will help . 
  i means that you wo n't have people illegally traveling through europe , because it wo n't buy them anything . 
  before , if they stay in the camps , they get stuck in turkey . 
  if they illegally-immigrate through the balkans or other places , they have a chance at getting asylum . 
  now , whether they get accepted or not , it buys them nothing to illegally-immigrate in terms of getting acceptance . 
  since that 's expensive and dangerous , it wo n't happen . 
  * assuming * , and this is critical , that the eu gives * no * preference to applications already in the eu over those applying from in the camps . 
  otherwise people will have a reason to keep illegally-immigrating . 
  that means the eu can do medical and criminal screening , the tensions between eu member states over internal borders go away , countries panicky about getting caught with lots of migrants when national borders go up can relax , etc. 
  that cleans up the italy/greece/balkans mass illegal immigration issues . 
  it gives european countries control -- whether you agree with the numbers they choose or not -- over intake . 
  there are still other problems associated with the crisis , but yeah , i think that this is a good move . 
  syrians are a minority of the people involved : that alone would n't be a full solution . 
   eu would strike pacts with third countries , such as turkey , agreeing to take large but unspecified numbers of refugees from them ** directly into europe ** .
