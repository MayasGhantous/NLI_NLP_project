   the problem is the manner , why do it in the middle of the night and close to rivers when we accept everyone during the day any way ? 
  my understanding is that you do n't : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34567247  slovenia will only allow 2,500 migrants to cross its borders daily - half the number neighbour croatia has asked for . 
    interior ministry secretary of state bostjan sefic said slovenia could not accept croatia 's request to take 5,000 , because austria 's daily limit is 1,500 . 
  so either croatia has an increasing glut of illegal immigrants forced on it until the destination countries ( germany , sweden , etc ) announce that they are going to shut down acceptance or until they announce that they are going to accept asylum applications directly from turkey/lebanon * or * croatia needs to slip them into slovenia to avoid the limits . 
  i imagine that either slovenia is doing the same to austria , it * will * be doing the same soon , or it 's going to be clobbered by huge masses coming in . 
  if you 're talking about the us : http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/06/womens-college-enrollment-gains-leave-men-behind/ women * are * enrolling in college at a higher rate than men , but nothing like a 2:1 ratio . 
   the government has tried to highlight the benefits of gaining new labor to deal with the demographic challenges of an aging population . 
    `` it 's important to note that we know that an increasing population and more young people in working age coming to sweden also is an economic possibility and has big potential of leading to higher growth in the future , '' said per bolund , financial markets minister , in an interview . 
  `` we should see this as an investment in the future . '' the obvious counterpoint : it 's possible to run skilled-worker immigration programs , and these are likely to do a better job of producing future economic generation on a per-immigrant basis . 
  a planeload of eritrean refugees is pictured in the article , and eritrea has a very limited degree of education -- second-worst in the un 's education index in the world . 
  eritrea has adult literacy of only two-thirds of the population ( and * that 's * not even in english , german , french , spanish , swedish , or in another language that would be likely to be immediately-applicable ) . 
  while almost any immigrant will produce economic activity to * some * degree , even if the only thing done is digging ditches , unskilled labor will tend to lower per-capita income in the country . 
  sweden has a gdp of $ 552b and a population of 10m . 
  eritrea has a gdp of $ 3.88 b and a population of 6.4 m. 
  were eritrea 's population to be imported wholesale to sweden and slapped down alongside it , everyone performing their previous occupation without change , it 's true that sweden 's economy would see an expansion . 
  however , this would be a bit under 1 % , from about $ 552b to $ 556b . 
  at the same time , sweden 's population would also increase by 64 % . 
  that will decrease the funds available on a per-person basis , and thus the services and wealth available for each person , which i believe that is what most people are interested in when it comes to the possibility of future investments with the hope of a return . 
  it 's possible , perhaps likely , that sweden will see some decrease anyway if it is trying to replace its existing , dying-out population with a new population . 
  it might not be able to convince other people who are producing as much to immigrate . 
  but it is my belief that sweden does have options in the world that would be more-favorable to future production than large-scale , non-skill-based immigration from eritrea . 
  surely there are places in the world that have at least a higher degree of literacy from which skilled worker immigration could be driven ? 
  perhaps non-eu european countries , or even india or south america ? 
  and if the goal is future economic activity , would n't it make sense to phase in such a program with the idea of addressing a shrinking population , seeing what works well and what does not , rather than to crash into the deep end ? 
  it seems likely to be difficult to back out from having granted permanent residency to very large numbers of people from very poor and very uneducated people in the world if this program does n't work out well . 
  establish an organization with a prestigious-sounding name , choose a weighting , and publish the results to popularize the city . 
   the planning and the bureaucracy are the lengthy part and will stay so even if you start cutting the more pointless regulations . 
  i dunno , if you use state-of-emergency to bypass a lot of that , standardize on soviet-style cheap-to-construct identical buildings , do n't worry about aesthetics , plan to address things like traffic congestion down the line and so forth , you could probably get things up a lot faster than is the norm, 
   you better pick up some hobbies that seems different from the original `` being unemployed is torture '' . 
  the `` and '' separation indicates that he 's talking about two different things , yes ? 
  < shrug  if there 's an across-the-board abuse of a policy where people who have ability to pay are supposed to pay for housing and simply say that they ca n't , establishing that that approach wo n't work might . 
  it 's the precedent to permit the policy to work that 's of interest . 
  it 's not uncommon to have littering laws in the us where someone will be fined many hundreds of dollars for littering . 
  it 's not because that particular act of littering is causing hundreds of dollars in damage , and certainly it is often much cheaper to remedy a littering situation . 
  however , the problem is that if people think that they can get away with breaking that rule , you wind up with everyone littering . 
  then everyone has an unpleasant , trash-filled environment . 
  so the action is there to discourage breaking the rules so that the system continues to work . 
   same lesson is being learned in the us . 
  riots in fergeson caused property values to drop by 40 % , businesses left the city and everyone is worse off than before . 
  in baltimore , rioters looted and smashed up grocery stores . 
  now they complain that `` racist '' businessmen wo n't sell groceries in their neighborhoods . 
  eh , wrt the long-term economic impact of race riots , detroit is [ probably a much higher-profile of race riots causing serious long-term impact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_detroit_riot#aftermath ) , and predates [ ferguson ] ( http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2014/12/04/buildings-destroyed-in-ferguson-riots-worth.html ) :  the value of buildings in the ferguson area that were destroyed in last week 's riots amounts to nearly $ 4.6 million . 
    in ferguson , ** 17 businesses saw their buildings damaged ** so badly they are currently deemed `` unsafe structures , '' according to a list provided by the city manager 's office . 
  together , the ferguson buildings have an appraised valued of about $ 3 million , based on st. louis county assessor records . 
  the businesses destroyed include little caesar 's pizza and hidden treasures on north florissant road , and mcdonald 's , public storage and several others on west florissant avenue . 
    nearby dellwood had ** eight buildings that burned completely ** , according to that city manager 's office . 
  the building values for those locations totaled about $ 1.6 million . 
  among them were the autozone , o'reilly auto parts and conoco gas station on west florissant avenue . 
    several other buildings in both cities were damaged , but not destroyed , by fire , and many more had windows broken or suffered other damages . 
  in ferguson alone , another ** 37 buildings sustained damage ** through vandalism , according to the city manager 's office . 
  [ detroit in 1967 was far worse , even in not-adjusted-for-inflation terms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_detroit_riot#aftermath ) :  ** 2,509 stores were looted or burned ** , 388 families rendered homeless or displaced and 412 buildings burned or damaged enough to be demolished . 
  dollar losses from arson and looting ranged from $ 40 million to $ 80 million . 
  [ 29 ] [ furthermore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_detroit_riot#aftermath ) :  however , the most significant black politician to take power in the shift from a white majority city to a black majority city , coleman young , detroit 's first black mayor , wrote in 1994 :    the heaviest casualty , however , was the city . 
  detroit 's losses went a hell of a lot deeper than the immediate toll of lives and buildings . 
  the riot put detroit on the fast track to economic desolation , mugging the city and making off with incalculable value in jobs , earnings taxes , corporate taxes , retail dollars , sales taxes , mortgages , interest , property taxes , development dollars , investment dollars , tourism dollars , and plain damn money . 
  the money was carried out in the pockets of the businesses and the white people who fled as fast as they could . 
  the white exodus from detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot , totaling twenty-two thousand in 1966 , but afterwards it was frantic . 
  in 1967 , with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosion -- the outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand . 
  in 1968 the figure hit eighty-thousand , followed by forty-six thousand in 1969 . 
  [ 75 ] i do n't think that the us has * just * abruptly opened its eyes to the fact that race riots can do quite a number on a city . 
  if someone claims that they ca n't pay for the housing and they 're searched for it , it does n't meet the criteria of `` arbitrary '' . 
  might be a bad policy , but there 's certainly a justification there . 
   human rights violations appeared to be `` an integral part '' of a czech government policy designed to deter migrants and refugees from entering the country or staying there , he said in a statement . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the un does n't ban strip searches in its requirements for human rights . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eminent_domain#europe  this right is expanded by article 1 of the first protocol to the convention , which states that `` every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions . '', 
  again , this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or public interest , is in accordance with law , and , in particular , to secure payment of taxes . 
  settled case-law of echr provides that just compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation . 
  [ 18 ] i mean , it 's always possible to seize land and pay for it with public money , i guess . 
   handed every migrant a new down jacket and a portable kerosene heater , it would still be awful . 
  jackets are actually probably not a terrible idea -- it 's cheaper and easier to roll out * en-masse * than housing . 
  it may not be as pleasant as having well-insulated housing , but it 'll keep people alive . 
  if there 's enough electrical infrastructure , electric blankets are also one of the more energy-efficient ways to warm a person up . 
   but it has no goals , no vision hmm . 
  in what sense do china and the us have goals and a vision that the eu does n't ? 
   the european union faces an age of comparative economic decline i disagree . 
  compared to china , maybe . 
  china spent the last six hundred years -- and in particular , most of the last two hundred years -- in the economic doghouse . 
  it 's been spending the past few decades trying to repair itself . 
  but : * europe today is economically doing better than it has since the end of world war ii . 
  * i 'd say that europe has seen less wasted loss due to internal fighting than it has in hundreds of years . 
  * compared to north america , europe is economically at-par ( albeit less-cohesive ) . 
  compared to south america , europe is way ahead . 
  compared to africa , europe is way ahead . 
  given its population , at least , europe still makes a pretty good showing compared to asia . 
  australia is much smaller . 
  * i think that eastern europe still has substantial room for economic improvement , just by bringing productivity up to western standards -- that 's low-hanging fruit . 
  it 's harder for , say , the us to develop much more , because it has to go path-break something totally new . 
  i think that eastern europe has been and continues to show every sign of continuing down a path of growth . 
  i mean , no , europe is not a new british empire , but if you compare it to the bulk of the world , it 's doing pretty well . 
   the `` dream '' of a unified continent is at risk from `` fissures and fractures '' of national divisions and separatist movements , he said . 
  okay , let 's compare to [ 1945 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/end_of_world_war_ii_in_europe ) . 
  how does europe compare ? 
  [ 1961 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_crisis_of_1961 ) ? 
  1989 , when countries of europe were still behind the iron curtain ? 
  the world has seen no true wars between major powers for quite a while . 
  poverty has fallen across the globe -- and to the extent that poverty has fallen , yes , the wealthy places in the world are relatively weaker . 
  certainly it 's something to keep in mind as a concern for the future , since there are ways in which that might be a concern ... but i think that a lot of people would cheer that , not sink into gloom over it . 
  how many [ dictators have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julius_caesar ) seized [ power in the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin ) ?
