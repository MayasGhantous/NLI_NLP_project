  and france is n't under an international law obligation to provide that aid , though it 's probably a very good idea to cooperate with the uk -- friendly neighbors are a lot more-pleasant than unfriendly ones . 
  ah , that 's a legitimate point -- in the us , there is a meaningful gap along those lines . 
  http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/economic-diplomacy-foreign-trade/facts-about-france/one-figure-one-fact/article/2-01-the-average-number-of  the family policy helps to explain this `` french exception . '' france was the first country to introduce an active family support policy characterized by :   - the payment of family benefits ( housing benefit , family allowance , early childhood benefit )   - the introduction of specific forms of leave ( maternity leave , paternity leave ) ,   - tax allowances ( quotient familial ( number of people in the family ) ) or specific benefits ( cartes famille nombreuses ( large family card ) , retirement benefits , etc. ), 
    - child care facilities available from a very young age http://www.france24.com/en/20130611-why-french-women-make-more-babies-fertility-austerity-welfare-reforms-france  in march of this year , france 's national demographic statistics agency ined said it had observed a `` surprising '' trend . 
  while birth rates had dropped noticeably across the board in europe and north america following the financial crisis starting in 2008 , fertility in france has remained stable . 
  [ snip ]  according to ined 's olivier th\u00e9venon , an expert in populations and social programmes , france 's family welfare system goes a long way in explaining the trend . 
  when studying long-term trends associated with high fertility , he said two important factors had been identified : welfare programmes that include the availability of long-term care for children under 3 years old and regular cash transfers to families with children . 
   lest `` australian society '' be irrevocably lost . 
  that 's not really the same thing as multiculturalism . 
  i can understand saying `` multiculturalism has problems , and on the net is not a good idea -- we should strive for something closer to a homogeneity of culture '' . 
  maybe it 's inefficient to have different types of food or having cultures side-by-side produces divisiveness or something like that . 
  it might be right , it might be wrong , but there are a set of pretty clear issues . 
  but talking about australian society being lost is n't a question of multiculturalism , but one of cultural conservativism . 
  it 'd be entirely possible to have a monoculture but to have that culture shift . 
  if the concern is over * change * in culture due to outside influences , that 's a different complaint . 
  when it comes to retaining culture against foreign influences , it seems to me that if you want to talk the talk , one ought to [ walk the walk ] ( https://i1.wp.com/www.tuliptime.com/files/img/media/costumes/40910009.jpg ) now , okay , if you want to specifically say '' * islam * has problems '' , fair enough -- that 's something that can be debated and addressed , and i do think that there are certainly at least forms of islam where one can say `` there are real , practical issues here , things that i can identify and have the majority i am addressing agree on being undesirable '' . 
  but the question of ( a ) whether a given form of islam is undesirable to a given people , ( b ) whether multiculturalism is undesirable , ( c ) whether preventing culture shift is desirable , and ( d ) whether it 's legitimate to assert that all cultures are in some meaningful way equally desirable all seem like different issues . 
  that 's not terrorism : there 's not an attempt to terrorize the existing populace ( or at least not in burning down the camp ) .

   we should have simply gone to camps in the middle east and process people there and bring them to germany it would have been so much a better situation than this . 
  while i agree with the sentiment , a change would accomplish the same thing but with even less overhead : simply accept and process applications at camps without providing any form of preference to those who were applying within germany after illegally immigrating . 
  that almost certainly means implying caps ( since otherwise , the volume would be too large ... but in practice , germany is going to have to deal with caps anyway , even if those caps are indirectly and painfully applied by making it hard to reach germany ) . 
  that would end the illegal flow of people across the transit countries .

  i was somewhat surprised by how-visible a role the heads of european states have played in eu affairs relative to eu officials . 
  on both the ukraine situation , and on the migrant situation , chancellor merkel and president hollande , and increasingly chancellor merkel , seem to be involved in a great deal of the press coverage that i read . 
  there may be very good political reasons for this , but it was a bit jarring even to me , not an eu resident . 
  i 've seen other readers of this forum complain that they felt a bit disenfranchised . 
  if these are considered eu-level concerns , why is it not the case that eu-level officials act as the public face of the eu as much as possible ?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare  welfare is the provision of a minimal level of well-being and social support for all citizens , sometimes referred to as public aid ... canada has a welfare state in the european tradition ; however , it is not referred to as `` welfare '' , but rather as `` social programs '' . 
  in canada , `` welfare '' usually refers specifically to direct payments to poor individuals ( as in the american usage ) and not to healthcare and education spending ( as in the european usage ),

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy  after talks with the cuban government , the clinton administration came to an agreement with cuba that it would stop admitting people found at sea . 
  since then , in what has become known as the `` wet foot , dry foot '' policy , a cuban caught on the waters between the two nations ( with `` wet feet '' ) would summarily be sent home or to a third country . 
  one who makes it to shore ( `` dry feet '' ) gets a chance to remain in the united states , and later would qualify for expedited `` legal permanent resident '' status and eventually u.s. citizenship .

  i 'm sure that it could be wrong -- hence , an estimate -- but i do n't see any reason to believe that it 's particularly wrong . 
  i 'd assume that they 're just extrapolating linearly from the current rate . 
  apparently the slovenian army is now acting to police the border independently of the slovenian police force rather than under police command . 
   you are aware that they are not arrested and we ca n't curtail the freedom of movement within slovenia ? 
  that 's not true . 
  until you actually grant refugee status , you have the ability to restrict freedom of movement , at least wrt the 1951 refugee convention . 
  there may be some other eu or slovenian restrictions , but you 're okay to do that under the convention before you 've granted status . 
  that being said , i agree that there are practical reasons why it 's not reasonable ( or , perhaps , even a good idea ) to try to fence people in slovenia . 
  if you 're going to be fencing people , it might as well be in germany as anywhere else . 
  i also do n't really think that right now , fencing people * in * anywhere is the best way to deal with the problem . 
  it does n't buy much to have someone inside a fence than outside . 
  either people are reaching their destination country and registering ( in which case they show up in the database ) or they are vanishing ( in which case germany/sweden/etc is going to be faced with tracking people down * anyway * , and it 's no harder there than in slovenia ) . 
  they do n't : if you open the article , the second line of the article states that this is an updated * estimate * . 
  i do n't see any reason that sweden would have to intentionally-falsify the results . 
  if the government wants to change swedish immigration policy , it can presumably just do so . 
  i 'm sure that would-be immigrants * have * , somewhere along the line , made false claims , sure , but that does n't mean collusion from sweden . 
  germany is going to be called nazi as long as it produces a political impact in germany . 
   we need a eu wide program to deal with the migrants if that program consists of `` take in migrants themselves without addressing the pull factor '' , nobody is going to buy in because it just means that they get a huge number of people dumped on them and then they 're back where they were before with a worse problem in place . 
  what else was croatia going to do ? 
  that 's pretty much what every other country involved thus far has done . 
  it would be much-more-objectionable to kill refugees , it would be unrealistic to force them to stay , croatia ca n't accept all of them ... maybe not smuggle into hungary , but that was a pretty minor affair . 
  the only countries that reasonably have the ability to change the situation are : * germany/sweden/destination countries change their registration policy so as to not favor already-illegally-present domestic refugees ( and then necessarily impose a cap ) . 
  that 's not under croatia 's control . 
  * some other country with vast resources ( china , russia , the us ) just accepts millions of refugees . 
  that seems unlikely , and it 's not under croatia 's control . 
  * the eu physically blocks off movement into the eu ( which i think is going to be difficult to do , and ca n't be done by croatia alone ) . 
  * a coalition of countries in the world all band together and solve all problems that could possibly result in refugees at all . 
  good luck with that , and definitely not an option for croatia alone . 
  croatia apologizing for that is ... it just does n't make sense . 
  there were no other meaningful options . 
  fences * might * re-route people as long as there 's a reasonable alternative route , maybe send them through romania , but i still do n't believe that there is any way that they alone are sufficient to hold up to people who are stuck in place . 
   muslims should have put their own house in order years ago in the uk instead of sitting back watching the authorities struggle to cope with the ongoing rise of extremism .

   when it comes to your family a and family b scenario , family b basically relies on keeping the kids ignorant . 
  education ruins the b model , people who receive education mostly do n't follow it anymore . 
  ensure education and you can keep the bs down to a small segment of society , most of their children revolting against the strictures and becoming as . 
  that 's basically the situation in the u.s. , which started with all bs and is consistently getting a higher proportion of as . 
  the bs are only really still around because of local religious sects that keep people away from education and immigration . 
  that 's one answer ... but it seems unstable in the long run . 
  it relies on being able to reliably convert a b to an a and prevent bs from ever managing to ability to produce a strong percentage of bs : society ( of as ) then relies on being able to eliminate cultural views and practices from being propagated . 
  but if you look at , say , christianity in the roman empire , the lgbt rights movement in recent times and today , the shift in women 's roles that even raised this in the first place , the reformation in catholicism , and any number of other cultural upheavals that i can think of , the society at large was n't able to stop some social movement from happening , even though there was a great deal of resistance and the authorities tried to make use of education and authority to ensure that a competing culture could n't spread .
