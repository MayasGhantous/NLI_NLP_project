   and probably sold out ... to whom ? 
  rt [ says that russia is enthusiastic about accepting refugees ] ( https://www.rt.com/politics/314809-russia-ready-to-accept-syrian/ ) . 
   the head of the federal migration service , konstantin romodanovsky , told tass on wednesday that russia is ready to accept refugees from syria on condition that they violate no laws . 
  i guess that solves the problem !, 
   but countries had legislation in place about the acceptance of refugees and conditions surrounding that . 
  fair enough -- i 'm not familiar with whatever might have existed at that point . 
   i 'd point out that an unbounded right does n't exists now the convention does n't permit countries to cap the number accepted ( despite the fact that some countries do anyway and just backlog the remainder ) . 
  if it did , there would n't be a problem -- countries could just provide the number that they 'd accept and refuse refugee status to anyone else . 
  germany could say `` okay , we 'll take 200k , but anyone else who shows up here wo n't get a legal status . '', 
   eliminating pull factor would be to discard dublin ii and define a common asylum policy , where you apply to asylum in the eu , not individual countries , and have no control over which country you will be assigned to . 
  i disagree . 
  that is one possible implementation , but it would also be possible to permit remotely-applying and not bias applications in favor of physically-present applicants , and simply have a numeric cap . 
   you 'd be talking about binning something that has existed as a right within some eu countries for a very long time , i do n't believe that an unbounded right-to-asylum predated the 1951 refugee convention . 
  actually , that was n't even a permanent right until 1967 . 
  i was going to say that i did n't think that tb would have a very high mortality rate in developed countries ... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2848263/  in the united states , tb is sometimes thought of as a disease of the past . 
  in 2007 , however , 13,293 people were diagnosed with active and potentially infectious tb disease .3 severe cases of tb disease can require hospitalization and are extremely costly to treat , such that estimates of the total charges for the tb hospitalizations in the u.s. in 2000 exceeded $ 385 million .4 although highly curative therapy is available in drug-sensitive cases , in-hospital mortality remains considerably high -- ** ranging from 5 % to 28 % ** -- and the persistence of multidrug-resistant tb ( strains resistant to at least two primary anti-tubercular agents , isoniazid and rifampin ) combined with the more recent emergence of extensively drug-resistant tb ( resistant to almost all the anti-tubercular agents ) present challenges to tb-control activities . 
  in addition , persistent disparities between white people and racial/ethnic minority groups and between u.s.-born and foreign-born people continue to challenge progress toward tb elimination in the u.s. ... but it looks like that 's within the 10-20 % mortality rate of the [ 1918 spanish flu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic#around_the_globe ) :  the 1918 flu pandemic ( january 1918 -- december 1920 ) was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic , the first of the two pandemics involving h1n1 influenza virus . 
  [ 1 ] it infected 500 million [ 2 ] people across the world , including remote pacific islands and the arctic , and killed 50 to 100 million of them -- three to five percent of the world 's population [ 3 ] -- making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history . 
  [ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] ... the last serious respiratory disease we had -- even under modern , first-world conditions . 
   the government in the hague is seeking an amendment so that family reunification applications will only recognise marriages if both partners are over the age of 18 . 
    `` a 12-year-old girl with a 40-year-old-man - that is not a marriage , that is abuse '' , said politician attje kuiken , according to the bbc . 
  if that amendment goes through , i imagine that the most-obvious workaround , if someone wants to immigrate to the eu immediately and to make use of family reunification policy , is to [ adopt the spouse ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2012/02/should_a_florida_millionaire_be_prosecuted_for_incest_because_he_adopted_his_girlfriend_.html ) . 
  that might lead to some entertaining ( from a legal standpoint , at any rate ) family trees in the future . 
  in about half the states in the us , adult adopted incest is legal . 
  european countries do n't appear to tend to have the same us-style adoption/blood relations split , but some european countries [ permit adult incest , both blood and adoption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_regarding_incest#europe ) :  countries which allow incest between consenting adults include france , spain , the benelux and portugal . 
  [ 34 ] so as long as the two wind up keeping things quiet until the age of consent ( or maybe age of majority , probably need someone who knows the language in question to look at what the legal codes actually require ) , they could publicly-resume their relationship at that point , and game the immigration law to permit immigration immediately . 
   the 44-year-old attorney from damascus - who asked to be identified only by his first name - said living in the countryside `` is very , very boring '' . 
  that sounds like most city-dwellers being transplanted to the country . 
  how is that relevant ? 
  a syrian might have a harder time finding a job in a country where he ca n't speak the language , but the numbers in the article have nothing to do with that . 
  they 're just talking about things like providing medical care . 
  put it into low-management-fee mutual funds ? 
  oooh , good catch on the timeline . 
  i would imagine that they 'd do an nda for anything sensitive that was revealed . 
   `` we want to spread joy , not help kill '' .

   what have you got against the baltic states ? 
  if you 're familiar with / u/ltburtreynolds , he 's an american who does n't like nato at all . 
  he does n't particularly dislike the baltics . 
  fire inspectors have to regularly ensure that fire alarms are enabled and working . 
  if the only time this sort of thing came up was in attempts to incinerate people , they would n't need to do that . 
  i 'd lean towards a more-mundane explanation for the alarm , whether the fire was arson or not . 
  other life forms probably did it first , if the moon was indeed formed from a massive collision with earth . 
  they probably did n't live all that long , but then , the dog did n't last too long either . 
  edit : also microbial life does apparently rarely exist in the [ stratosphere ] ( http://www.space.com/18574-mars-life-microbes-earth-stratosphere.html ) , and if it can make it up to the top of the mesosphere , it 's possible that rather small , unpreposessing critters might have made it into space . 
  there 's been a [ pole in space before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros%c5%82aw_hermaszewski ) . 
  the meme should die . 
   unfortunately too much of the world still lives in relative barbarism . 
  the problem is that `` barbarism '' has a certain connotation : `` my social norms , which are obviously superior '' . 
  i 've no problem with someone finding that a culture is , in fact , just plain better , but i think that people also have a strong bias towards treating their culture as better than that of others . 
  perhaps that 's necessary for a culture to exist , else it would n't propagate , but it 's still worth recognizing the tendency . 
  the idea of a `` barbarian '' is one that has a parallel in other cultures . 
  chinese culture has had a concept [ that 's rather similar to that of the `` barbarian '' that we have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbarian#chinese_culture ) . 
  heck , our own word came from greeks taking a dim view of northern european culture . 
  if other peoples have the same view that their culture is best , and ( obviously ) the views conflict with each other , it seems to me that the standard for `` my culture is best '' has to be higher than simply feeling that one 's culture is best . 
  and while i do think that the west has done well in churning out technology , say , and any degree to which culture might have facilitated that is a credit to that culture ... i 'm also doubtful that western culture is clearly and obviously better overall . 
  in particular , since we 're talking about marriage , i 've been in several discussions on this forum talking about unsustainable fertility levels in the west . 
  this has been one argument used for why germany * should * take in immigrants , as germany 's society has failed to maintain a sustainable level of children . 
  if , over the next couple centuries , it turns out that the western model does n't wind up producing sustainable fertility levels and being able to compete favorably with other models , i think that there 's a reasonable argument that it 's the present western cultural structure around secular , co-equal , contraception-using deferred marriage that will have failed . 
  and that wo n't need to be declared by some abstract authority -- it will simply wind up being outcompeted over time by the alternatives , be they a conservative islamic model or [ some other model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quiverfull ) . 
  if i adopted a strategy that involved simply having as many children as possible within a country that will have others support those children , my strategy is a winning strategy . 
  in nature 's coldly-calculating eye , whoever has as many children as possible , as long as those children are viable and will themselves produce offspring , wins in the long run . 
  a welfare state that means that people can have an unbounded number of children and have those children supported means that it 's a good strategy to use the state 's resources to have children . 
  that also means that any genetic or cultural predilection to do so is an advantage , a positive trait . 
  if family a has a wife who works , undergoes education , defers having children , and the family makes use of contraception to plan children , and family b has a housewife who lives on welfare , has children as soon as possible , and avoids making use of family planning , and if family a supports family b , family b 's strategy results in a strategy that produces more children . 
  if family b 's approach is correlated with the approach that family b 's children use -- via culture , genetics , ( or any other factor ... theoretically , i suppose even contractual obligation ) -- then family b displaces family a in the long run . 
  in any event , i guess i 'm getting further away from my original point , which is that i 'm not sold that the western model of marriage should be treated as preferable . 
  a `` women go to work , marriage is deferred , contraception is regularly used , parenthood is labor - and money-intensive , parenthood 's subsidies are disconnected from welfare , people who adopt this model will financially-support competing models '' approach is only a couple of generations old and i think that there is plenty of room for continued adaptation and experimentation with policies -- i certainly would n't say that the current western model is fundamentally * broken * . 
  but i do think that there are quite-legitimate questions about how well it will compete in the long run without changes . 
  at one point , one 's children were expected to support their parents , and then there 's a reason to have children , and specifically to also have children that can also provide for themselves and their parents . 
  but if that 's * not * the case -- and the current welfare model disconnects the two -- then the window is opened for simply having many children , whether-or-not they can support a parent or even themselves , and having others support those children . 
  addressing this seems equally-uncomfortable . 
  do you say `` yeah , this approach has failed , we 're going back to a the social structure that the west had in 1800 , women are just child-carers across-the-board '' ? 
  that loses out on a lot of potential productivity , and brings back some of the social ills that we 'd like to avoid . 
  do you let people starve if they do n't provide for themselves , refusing to provide aid ? 
  that makes for a desperate society -- and a desperate society does n't follow rules , and our existing society does n't cope well with people not following rules . 
  do you prevent people from having an unbounded number of children if they are n't supporting them ? 
  that brings back all the very-real problems associated with eugenics , where the system becomes captured and abused by whoever controls it . 
  do you simply penalize people to control population in some way , a `` soft '' eugenics , a la china 's one child fines that favor the wealthy ? 
  maybe ... i 'm not sold that the same problems that afflicted `` hard '' eugenics in the past do n't apply . 
  and at least in theory , it seems like you 'd still leave open a window to have an unsupportable number of children -- what if someone simply insists on having more children ? 
  how miserable are you willing to make them over the matter ? 
  us and european law tend to be reasonably similar . 
  i 'm mentioning it because it 's what i 'm familiar with and tagging it as being explicitly us , because this is an edge case and it 's possible that they do differ or that france or some other country has an explicit ruling otherwise . 
  because eu members do n't have eu-wide unified immigration law and they also can differ ( i suspect that french law probably differs more from british law than british law does from us law ) technically i suppose it would be necessary to cover the law of every member to provide a meaningful answer for any one country . 
  as for tajikistan , it looks like parts of it practice sharia law and it 'd [ perhaps be closer to the other side of the interaction , if anything ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan_raises_legal_age_for_women_to_marry/2110273.html ) :  she said that in tajikistan , once a girl reaches 20 she is often considered an `` old maid '' and will have fewer suitors . 
  and that this [ still happens ] ( https://iwpr.net/global-voices/teenage-marriage-persists-tajikistan ) to some degree , despite recent legal changes in the last four years . 
  well , scotus rulings have been extended further than their initial context before ( in * bowers * , the ruling that * lawrence * overturned , the wikipedia article specifically mentions even the scotus justices making the ruling commenting that they had n't realized its implications ) . 
   justice lewis f. powell later said he regretted joining the majority , but thought the case of little importance at the time . 
  in any event , in my above edit3 , i agree after reading the * lawrence * conclusion that scotus explicitly avoided trying to encompass the issue in * lawrence * . 
  just to be clear , the post you 're responding to was written before the edits to the grandparent post : it assumed that * lawrence * applied , which i do n't think is the case , which means that the state probably is not constitutionally prevented from banning sex with someone 's spouse -- so regular old statutory rape laws would apply until they grew up . 
  huh . 
  so denmark appears to have an age of consent [ for sex at 15 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_europe#denmark ) and [ for marriage at 18 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marriageable_age ) -- so it 's possible to be married in denmark but not able to make use of spouse reunification ? 
  let 's say that an 18-year-old swede marries another 18-year-old swede . 
  the first swede legally immigrates to denmark . 
  is it not possible for the spouse to become a dane under family reunification for another three years ? 
  the bribe * itself * might be illegal , but ... honestly , would the turkish policemen even be breaking any laws in not stopping the refugees ? 
  the refugees are breaking greek law maybe , but i do n't know whether there 's any violation of turkish law . 
  in fact , i do n't even think that turkey * can * outlaw emigration without violating international law : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegal_emigration  the stance of the united nations is that freedom to emigrate is a human right , part of the right to freedom of movement . 
  according to the universal declaration of human rights , `` everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own , and to return to his country '' .
