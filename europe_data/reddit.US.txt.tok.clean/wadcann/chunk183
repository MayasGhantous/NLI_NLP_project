  i guess it would be possible to make illegal * helping * someone legally leave turkey and illegally enter another country , though i do n't know whether that is presently illegal either . 
   because german chancellor angela merkel offered the country a chance for faster progress in its bid to join the eu in return for cooperation on the refugee issue . 
  not going to lie -- if i were turkish , i * might * say `` if you pay me enough , i 'm willing to house people '' , but unless i 'm certain and i 'm certain that merkel is certain that everyone i host will be repatriated to syria , i would n't believe an offer that involved accelerated eu membership . 
  why would i ? 
  she does n't want refugees , so she puts them in turkey ... and then proposes adding turkey to the eu , thus pulling them back in ? 
  it 's implausible . 
  now , if it is definitely temporary , the eu could benefit and still be willing to add turkey , since the 1951 refugee convention mandates , during the duration of a refugee staying somewhere , providing welfare on par with that of what the natives get . 
  that means that , if you do n't want to violate or withdraw from the convention , it 's a lot cheaper to pay off a country that does n't provide much by way of welfare to take in refugees , since it dodges having to pay for your expensive welfare . 
  that would be plausible , and that could be a win-win for turkey and germany , if turkey shares a cut of the savings . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot  despite often being attributed to vladimir lenin , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] in 1987 , grant harris , senior reference librarian at the library of congress , declared that `` we have not been able to identify this phrase among [ lenin 's ] published works . 
   is there still such a thing in legal matters ? 
  at least in the us , apparently so : http://www.immihelp.com/immigration/genuine-marriage-proof.html  post marriage :   in addition to the proof that you have got married to the u.s. person , you should also show the proof that you have consumated the marriage as well . 
  you can show the proofs such as honeymoon arrangements , receipt of the hotel suite booking , decorated room , bookings of the hill station or seaside hotel , proof of travel such as airplane , train or bus , hotel bills , photographs etc. 
  i just mentioned it because the idea of immigration officers demanding proof that one has had sex with a kid to permit the kid to immigrate is n't what one would expect . 
   how is that defined today ? 
  what , [ consummation ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/consummation ) ? 
  in common english :  the first act of sexual intercourse in a relationship , particularly the first such act following marriage . 
  if dhs has some sort of more-precise definition because that 's unclear ( though i ca n't really imagine a whole lot of gray area there ) , i imagine that it lives enshrined somewhere on their website . 
   could bdsm couples with very strict chastity rules wind up in big trouble when marrying ? 
  i 've got no idea , but i suspect that this really only gets raised in corner cases , where it sounds like a spousal immigration claim might be sketchy , that someone with us citizenship is just trying to pull in other people to the us via bogus claims of marriage . 
  i 'd be enthusiastic if someone from france who knows french law would post what french law says on the matter :-), 
   first : you do realize you are in / r/europe i hope . 
  yup , that 's why i was explicit that i was referring to us law . 
  there are parallels ; * lawrence * was ruled specifically with reference to european law , but it 's also possible that there will be differences . 
  i talk about british law as well in a follow-up , but i 'm a lot less familiar with what various european countries do . 
   second , i think this is also created to make clear the state has no business in your bed , for instance regarding laws against anal and oral sex some states had/have ( which was done because of their ideas regarding homosexuality iirc ) . 
  amending the constitution could open up another can of worms ... yeah , i agree that that 's a real concern any time the thing is touched . 
  i 'm not trying to advocate for an amendment here , just exploring how far the loophole goes , as it 's not one i 'd ever thought of until op 's article . 
   ok , this might be weird , but if we are against having sex with a 14-year-old , and we say that even if she wants it you ca n't have sex with her because her brain is n't developed enough and she does n't know what she wants . 
  why women have menstruation so early ? 
  i do n't believe that the legal argument for [ age of consent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_consent ) is based on anything like the biological ability to reproduce , but rather whether someone can understand the full implications of same . 
  otherwise , it 'd obviously be pointless to have an age of consent at all : biology would handle things . 
  according [ to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_consent ) :  age of consent laws were , historically , difficult to follow and enforce : legal norms based on age were not , in general , common until the 19th century , because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable . 
  [ 5 ] [ snip ]  a general great shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex took place in the modern era and beliefs on the appropriate age below which girls should not be permitted to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood . 
  while ages from 10 to 13 were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in western countries during the mid-19th century , [ 1 ] by the end of the 19th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent . 
  [ 4 ]   the english common law had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of 10 to 12 , but in 1875 the age was raised to 13 . 
  after intense sensational media revelations about the scourge of under-age prostitution in london in the 1880s caused respectable middle-class outrage , the age of consent was raised to 16 in 1885 . 
  early feminists of the social purity movement such as josephine butler and others , instrumental in securing the repeal of the contagious diseases acts , began to turn towards the problem of child prostitution by the end of the 1870s . 
  [ snip ]  in the united states , as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at 10 -- 12 , ( in delaware it was 7 in 1895 ) . 
  [ 8 ] inspired by the `` maiden tribute '' female reformers in the us initiated their own campaign [ 9 ] which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at least 16 , with the ultimate goal to raise the age to 18 . 
  the campaign was successful , with almost all states raising the minimum age to 16 -- 18 years by 1920 . 
  [ 4 ] [ 10 ]   in france , portugal , denmark and the swiss cantons and other countries , the minimum age was raised to between 13 and 16 years in the following decades . 
  [ 4 ] though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality , since then the raison d'\u00eatre of the laws has changed to child welfare and a so-called right to childhood or innocence . 
  [ 11 ]   in france , under the napoleonic code the age of consent was set in 1832 at 11 , [ 12 ] and was raised to 13 in 1863 . 
  [ 13 ] it was increased to 15 in 1945 . 
  [ 14 ]   in spain , it was set in 1822 at `` puberty age '' , and changed to 12 in 1870 , [ 15 ] which was kept until 1999 , when it became 13 ; [ 16 ] [ 17 ] and in 2015 it was raised to 16 . 
  [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] looking at the dates , my guess is that this also might be somewhat tied to the [ contemporaneous rise of female education ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_education#modern_period ) . 
  if women were mostly going to have children and take care of the house , having an extended period of education was less important . 
  however , it might be harder for them to be taking care of a kid * and * undergoing education . 
  legally-deferring pregnancy might be a way to increase education among women . 
   even merkel 's party has a c in the name which stands for christian . 
  well ... hold on on that particular point . 
  at least in the us , there 's a separation between party ( a non-government organization that seeks to control and influence government ) and government . 
  while parties look a little bit like government sometimes , they are n't . 
  the party is permitted to do all sorts of things that government is not , including espouse and promote religion . 
  i realize that in some countries ( e.g. 
  one-party states like china ) , things might be different , but i 'd guess that most european countries probably do the same thing that the us does . 
  first , this is n't talking about how well the legal concept of consent would map to practical intentions , just the legal concept of `` consent '' . 
  legally , forcibly-amputating someone 's arm in the us is `` deadly force '' , even if done under conditions where there is no chance of the person dying , even if you 'd look at that and say `` i would n't call that deadly force ! '', 
  -- deadly force * legally * encompasses severe bodily harm , not just death . 
  second , i spent a while reading over the rulings , and as per the third edit , i think that * lawrence * would n't be applicable anyway ( though it might be that a scotus ruling where it did come up * would * support such a case , * lawrence * does n't cover it ) . 
  third , the post you were responding to did n't rely on whether-or-not consent was possible or not anyway -- it was musing about the possibility that a law that was based on age and violated spousal privacy would simply be void even before it got to questions of minors being able to consent . 
  < shrug  according to wikipedia . 
  could be that it 's wrong . 
  france is actually doing really well kids-wise , by european standards . 
  europe ( as well as other places ) established a welfare system that relied heavily upon borrowing from the next generation : that is , in their old age , people would simply rely on having the next generation support them . 
  this is n't completely new , in that old people used to expect their own kids to take care of them . 
  welfare replaced this , but also meant that the individual incentive to have kids went away . 
  no incentive , no kids . 
  no kids , nothing to mooch off during retirement . 
  so ... either the standard of living for the elderly drops off a lot , a lot of european countries discover oil , a lot of european countries start pumping out babies really quickly , or europe takes in a lot of immigrants and hopes that they can be mooched off, 
  asian americans [ do well in the us as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_asian_americans#education ) :  asian americans have the highest educational attainment of any racial group in the country ; about 49.8 % of them have at least a bachelor 's degree . 
  [ 38 ] since the 1990s , asian american students often have the highest math averages in standardized tests such as the sat [ 39 ] [ 40 ] and gre . 
  [ 41 ] their verbal scores generally lag , but their combined scores are usually higher than those of white americans . 
  [ 39 ] the proportion of asian americans at many selective educational institutions far exceeds the national population rate . 
  asians constitute around 10 -- 20 percent of those attending ivy league [ 42 ] [ 43 ] and other elite universities . 
  asian americans are the largest racial group on seven of the nine university of california campuses , [ 44 ] are the largest racial group of undergraduates in the system , [ 45 ] and make up more than a quarter of graduate and professional students . 
  [ 46 ] asian americans are more likely to attend college , [ 47 ] are more likely to apply to competitive colleges , [ 48 ] and have significantly higher college completion level than other races . 
  [ 38 ] according to a poll targeting asian americans in 14 states and the district of columbia conducted by the asian american legal defense and education fund in 2013 , 40 percent of asian americans have a college degree , with almost a quarter of them having achieved an education attainment greater than a bachelor 's degree . 
  [ 49 ] that same year , asian americans in their late thirties had the highest percentage ( 65 % ) of college graduates for that age group than any other race or ethnicity in the united states . 
  [ 50 ] however , it 's * also * worth noting that due to things like the [ chinese exclusion act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_exclusion_act ) and a number of later laws , immigration to the us from asia was relatively-limited until relatively recently ... and today , immigration policy is n't open-border ( as it was waaay back when ) , but tilts towards skilled immigrants . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_history_of_asian_americans  immigration of asian americans were also affected by u.s. war involvement from the 1940s to the 1970s . 
  in the wake of world war ii , immigration preferences favored family reunification . 
  this may have helped attract highly skilled workers to meet american workforce deficiencies . 
  another instance related to world war ii was the luce -- celler act of 1946 , which helped immigrants from india and the philippines . 
    the end of the korean war and vietnam war and the `` secret wars '' in southeast asia brought a new wave of asian american immigration , as people from korea , vietnam , laos , and cambodia arrived . 
  some of the new immigrants were war brides , who were soon joined by their families . 
  others , like the southeast asians , were either highly skilled and educated , or part of subsequent waves of refugees seeking asylum . 
  some factors contributing to the growth of sub-groups such as south asians and mainland chinese were higher family sizes , higher use of family-reunification visas , and higher numbers of technically skilled workers entering on h-1 and h-1b visas . 
    the contrasts between japanese americans and south asian americans are emblematic of the dramatic changes since the immigration reforms of the mid-20th century . 
  japanese americans are among the most widely recognized of asian american sub-groups . 
  in 1970 , there were nearly 600,000 japanese americans , making it the largest sub-group , but historically the greatest period of immigration was generations past . 
  today , given relatively low rates of births and immigration , japanese americans are only the sixth-largest asian american group . 
  in 2000 , there were between 800,000 and 1.2 million japanese americans ( depending on whether multi-ethnic responses are included ) . 
  the japanese americans have the highest rates of native-born , citizenship , and assimilation into american values and customs . 
    ethnic chinese immigration to the united states since 1965 has been aided by the fact that the united states maintains separate quotas for mainland china , taiwan , and hong kong . 
  during the late 1960s and early and mid-1970s , chinese immigration into the united states came almost exclusively from taiwan creating the taiwanese american subgroup . 
  a smaller number of immigrants from hong kong arrived as college and graduate students . 
  immigration from mainland china was almost non-existent until 1977 , when the prc removed restrictions on emigration leading to immigration of college students and professionals . 
  these recent groups of chinese tended to cluster in suburban areas and to avoid urban chinatowns .
