    in 1990 , there were slightly fewer south asians in the u.s. than japanese americans . 
  by 2000 , indian americans nearly doubled in population to become the third largest group of asian americans , with increasing visibility in high-tech communities such as the silicon valley and the seattle area . 
  indian americans have some of the highest rates of academic achievement among american ethnic groups . 
  most immigrants speak english and are highly educated . 
  south asians are increasingly accepted by most asian organizations as another significant asian group . 
  currently , indians , chinese , and filipinos are the largest asian ethnic groups immigrating to the united states . 
  the positive outcome there could be seen as an argument for skilled immigration policies . 
  i was going to say that australia is near indonesia and probably has a higher proportion of islamic believers than does europe , but i guess you 're right : [ australia is only 2.2 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_australia ) and [ as of 2010 , france is up to 7.5 % islamic , germany to 5.8 % ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/15/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/ ) , and the number steadily increasing . 
  [ apparently in alsace and moselle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/separation_of_church_and_state#france ) , catholic , lutheran , calvinist , and jewish priests are paid by the state and schools teach religion , and the catholic bishops of metz and strasburg are appointed by the french president ( the only country in the world in which this happens ) . 
   when was the last time america passed an overtly christian inspired law , huh ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that the 1996 [ defense of marriage act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defense_of_marriage_act ) would n't have had sufficient support for passage without christianity . 
  edit : the 2008 [ louisiana science education act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louisiana_science_education_act ) probably would not have had support for providing arguments for creationism in schools without [ young earth creationism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/young_earth_creationism ) , which is a christian fundamentalist view . 
  edit2 : the 2015 [ religious freedom restoration act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religious_freedom_restoration_act_%28indiana%29 ) in indiana probably also would not have gotten support without biblical condemnation of homosexuality . 
   `` flee from shit hole , better turn the new place into shit hole too . '', 
  i doubt that those four of ten muslims in denmark would feel that it is islam that made wherever they came from unpleasant . 
  `` but it * was * ! '', 
  < shrug  you might feel that that is the case . 
  i 'm just saying that they probably do n't feel the same way ; their view is n't inherently inconsistent . 
  i do n't know what country you 're from , but i doubt that your country would criminalize acts by a foreign citizen in a foreign country with another foreign citizen or even claim that its courts had authority to do so . 
  [ universal jurisdiction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universal_jurisdiction ) , even where claimed , has typically been very limited , only covering things like genocide . 
  edit : looks like the [ brits are an exception here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_offences_act_2003 ) , but on the other hand , they will still only permit british law to be applied if the act was also a crime in the country in question . 
  [ text ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/72 ) :  ( 3 ) if --   ( a ) a person does an act in a country outside the united kingdom at a time when the person was not a united kingdom national or a united kingdom resident ,   ( b ) the act constituted an offence under the law in force in that country ,   ( c ) the act , if done in england and wales . 
  , would have constituted a sexual offence to which this section applies , and   ( d ) the person meets the residence or nationality condition at the relevant time ,   proceedings may be brought against the person in [ england and wales ] for that sexual offence as if the person had done the act there . 
  though ... because legal codes differ , there 's no requirement that the crimes be equivalent , but just the act . 
  that may have some unintended consequences in british law . 
  i wonder if that this could lead to the bizarre situation where someone could live in iran , indecently ( but otherwise legally ) have sex in public with their nine-year-old wife , violate [ article 638 ] ( http://iranhrdc.org/english/human-rights-documents/iranian-codes/1000000351-islamic-penal-code-of-the-islamic-republic-of-iran-book-five.html ) of the iranian criminal code :  anyone in public places and roads who openly commits a har\u0101m ( sinful ) act , in addition to the punishment provided for the act , shall be sentenced to two months ' imprisonment or up to 74 lashes ; and if they commit an act that is not punishable but violates public prudency , they shall only be sentenced to ten days to two months ' imprisonment or up to 74 lashes . 
  ... immigrate to the uk , and be ( much more severely ) punished for having sex with a nine-year-old under uk law because of the iranian indecency violation meaning that uk law would be applicable to the act as a whole . 
  edit2 : also , amusingly-enough , from the immigration law bits i read while looking up the above , at least in us immigration law , unconsummated marriages are on shakier grounds than consummated marriages ( to avoid random people saying `` oh , yeah , we 're * definitely * married '' and handing out us citizenship to random people ) . 
  given that claiming that a kid is your wife or husband is probably well into the `` going to attract some scrutiny as to whether this is a bogus claim to permit citizenship '' class , i imagine that it would actually be advantageous to a spousal immigration claim to prove that one * had * consummated said marriage in the country of origin . 
  edit3 : one other tidbit that i ran into while poking through material for the above : the age thing aside , the us apparently does not recognize polygamous marriages from overseas . 
  these do happen in islamic countries and have apparently been the main source of people trying to argue for polygamy in immigration to the us . 
  if this holds and my understanding is correct , no the child could not , just that statutory rape laws that punish actions based on lack of consent which are based on age would be unconstitutional and thus void insofar as they apply to this particular case . 
  that 's kinda interesting . 
  i 'd never thought about that loophole , but if countries recognize marriages established elsewhere and permit spouses to immigrate , it might let people marry abroad and then immigrate and bypass age limitations . 
  http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1048&amp;context=wmjowl  b. 
  the rules for assessing whether public policy warrants an exception to the general rule favoring marriage recognition   for well over a century , courts and immigration authorities have recognized the general rule that marriages , valid in the country or state where celebrated , are valid everywhere . 
    in 1986 , congress codified that rule in the context of conditional marriage-based immigration benefits in the ina . 
  neither the rule nor its recognized exceptions have changed greatly since the term `` marriage '' was first introduced in the ina . 
  the exceptions depend either on the strongly held public policy of the state of domicile or on express federal public policies , such as the policies against polygamy and against unconsummated proxy marriages . 
   marriages to which a state of domicile objects on the basis of a spouse 's age or gender reassignment have been recognized in all reported bia cases when they were valid in the state where celebrated . 
  age of consent cases raise a unique standard , distinguishing between marriages that are void * ab initio * where celebrated and those merely voidable if the minor spouse acts to negate it before reaching the age of majority . 
  [ snip ]  a. 
  the general rule : marriages valid where `` celebrated '' are valid everywhere   generally , a marriage valid where celebrated is valid everywhere . 
  this principle is well settled under both conflict of law rules and immigration law . 
  the bia has explained that this rule of recognition was developed because `` [ i ] nfinite mischief and confusion would ensue with respect to legitimacy , succession , and other rights if the validity of the marriage contract were not to be tested by the laws of the country where it was made . ''   the bia apparently follows this general rule no matter how unfriendly the country or how illegitimate the legal system . 
  for instance , two bia cases soon after world war ii carefully examined `` the hitler discriminatory legislation concerning interracial marriages '' to determine the validity of `` marriages '' for u.s. immigration purposes . 
    the board based its decisions on the `` hitler law '' regarding marriage and divorce even though the divorce in one case was coerced by gestapo torture . 
  with parental consent , micronesia [ has no minimum age of marriage ] ( http://www.youthpolicy.org/factsheets/country/micronesia/ ) , and some countries have a low age of marriage , like [ iran at nine years old ] ( http://www.youthpolicy.org/factsheets/country/iran/ ) . 
  so at least in the united states , it looks like it is actually possible to be legally married to a five-year-old , albeit under an extreme legal corner case . 
  huh . 
  got ta admit , i had not expected that . 
  edit : and since [ * lawrence v. texas * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lawrence_v._texas#sexual_privacy ) ( not being able to ban sexual activity based on spousal privacy ) was ruled based on the constitutional right to spousal privacy found in [ * griswold v. connecticut * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/griswold_v._connecticut ) and spousal privacy rights would then apply , that seems like it means that prohibiting sexual activity with a spouse is unconstitutional ; both [ 18 u.s.c \u00a7 2243 ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2243 ) and equivalent state law , so the two could also legally have sex . 
  the only way to ban this would be via amending the us constitution , which is quite difficult . 
  google does n't turn up anyone actually trying to make this legal claim , but it sounds like it should hold . 
  that would probably create quite the shitstorm . 
  edit2 : hmm . 
  the summary of * lawrence * mentions `` adult '' , but it 's not clear whether this was an explicit part of the court 's finding or whether it was just mentioned because it was part of the law in question . 
  reading further : [ * griswold * ruling ] ( http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/381/479.html ) , [ * lawrence * transcript ] ( http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/02-102.pdf ) , [ * lawrence * ruling ] ( https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/558/case.html ) edit3 : okay , i * think * that this should n't apply . 
  if you read the ruling for * lawrence * , scotus was explicit that they were making no ruling regarding minors : `` the present case does not involve minors . '', 
  the ruling was based on the fourteenth amendment , and [ * michael m. v. superior court of sonoma county * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_m._v._superior_court_of_sonoma_county ) made a similar fourteenth amendment-based argument against the constitutionality of statutory rape restrictions and there scotus did not find the the fourteenth amendment limited statutory rape . 
  on the * other * hand , it was by a single vote * and * that was the burger court . 
  * lawrence * explicitly overruled the burger court on [ * bowers v. hardwick * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bowers_v._hardwick ) , which was also by a single vote . 
  so ... i guess the answer is `` there is not case law supporting an argument that a law prohibiting sexual activity between the married couple would be unconstitutional , but there 's also some argument that the current scotus would rule that the fourteenth amendment more-broadly limits statutory rape law than was the case in 1986 '' . 
  the marriage would presumably still be valid , though . 
  edit4 : just to be clear , ianal . 
  i think that you 're better-off with having your elected representatives do this . 
  the pros and the cons of having an additional member join seem like they 'd be difficult to try to fully explain to every person in europe . 
  and if you think that your representatives are refusing to serve your best interests , i think that it 'd be easier to boot 'em out and elect preferable ones . 
  i think that direct votes make the most sense where : * there is an * extremely * strong divide and/or the issue ca n't reasonably be decided on material grounds ( `` open door # 1 or door # 2 ? '' ), 
  and the real goal is to ensure that people do n't feel disenfranchised and are willing to go along with the decision . 
  * the issues involved can be reasonably explained to everyone . 
  or , maybe , they do n't need to be explained at all , and are primarily a question of values , like `` do we want to have capital punishment '' . 
  or alternatively : * the actual system of representation has broken down ( or someone claims that it has ) and the normal system needs to be completely bypassed : just short of or associated with a revolution . 
  maybe someone performs a coup and needs to obtain legitimacy , for example , and arranges for a direct vote on some issue . 
  direct votes are expensive , because you need to fully-inform everyone . 
  trying to teach hundreds of millions of people enough information to make a fully-informed decision on something is expensive , and i would n't do it short of a last-ditch effort . 
  i do n't think that adding a member state to the union is a good candidate for such a direct election : the geopolitical , economic , military , legal and so forth issues are large and hard to explain . 
  aside from maybe the simple question of `` should the eu contain an islamic state '' , it 's really hard to see this as a `` values '' question . 
  i do n't think that adding a state is something that produces the sort of intense divide that requires bypassing representatives . 
  it just does n't fit the `` a direct election would be a good fit here '' points very well at all . 
   damn , that 's rather embarrassing . 
  poland will have a bigger economy than russia if this continues :d poland is n't simultaneously fighting an economic war against the us and the eu . 
  edit : re the $ 700b , it 's not clear how serious that prediction is , or whether it 's inflation-adjusted . 
  china pays top dollar for [ illegally-harvested shark fins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shark_fin_soup ) and you 're establishing a trench chock-full of them .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_new_zealand new zealand is apparently fairly comfortable . 
  you and france have a twenty-mile moat and you two still squabble ( i mean , friendly-like , yes , but ... ), 
  according to http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/antipode-map/ that would be approximately joining new zealand . 
  oh , i understand the rationale : political difficulties and your concern , do n't get me wrong -- i 'm just saying that there 's no treaty * making * europe do this . 
  from europe 's standpoint , it would be legitimate by treaty requirements to grant no citizenship or permanent residence to migrants or their children and to forcibly-return them to syria/other country of origin once the place has been deemed safe . 
  i agree with you that europe is likely to not do this , but it 's also not because anyone is * making * europe do this : it 's a political choice that has been made . 
  well , if turkey is presently dealing with 2m refugees , and some of the issue is that turkey has been having to come up with the funds to try to provide camp facilities , that 's actually a pretty good deal for europe . 
  europe is almost certainly going to spend far more than $ 1400 per refugee that comes over . 
  and under the 1951 refugee convention , europe ca n't cut welfare to any less than it does that of what it provides domestically . 
  turkey provides a lower standard of welfare , so it 's actually terribly-useful to the eu to have people housed in turkey -- it lets them legally dodge the 1951 refugee convention requirements without either ( a ) having to cut welfare or ( b ) withdraw from the convention . 
  personally , i think that it would make a great deal more sense to withdraw from the convention and adopt a revised form that establishes the ability to impose limits on applications accepted , and addresses several other things that the convention falls over on ( e.g. 
  preventing difficulty-of-travel from being used as a filter , given how many problems that has caused ) . 
  i also think that it should be possible to limit , maybe within bounds , freedom of movement for security reasons , as that 's clearly in some cases a real concern . 
  but , there 's a twelve month delay on that , and i do n't think that there 's the political will to do that .
