  in this case , turkey is providing a pretty valuable service to the eu , at least if the eu is not willing to violate the convention ( as the us effectively does in imposing a backlog and setting numeric caps on acceptance ) or withdraw from it or cut domestic welfare . 
   so why do we have to host many of the immigrants permanently and invest in integrating them into our respective societies you do n't have such a treaty obligation -- the 1951 refugee convention lets you deport people as soon as its safe to do so . 
  your countries have chosen policies that do this . 
  good idea or not , that 's how it is . 
  ah , you 're right , it 's js . 
   that 's not true at all , it 's not some popularity contest . 
  [ here 's their methodology . 
  ] ( http://fr.rsf.org/img/pdf/methodology-en.pdf ) rather than measuring actual restrictions on the press in terms of , say , what laws are in place , which i 'd view as more-important , their metric is driven by taking an opinion survey that measures perceptions , and then attaching a score to them . 
  here 's [ their questionaire ] ( http://rsf.org/index/qen.html ) . 
  this asks various people to rank their impressions , on a scale of one-to-ten , and then derives the score from that . 
  first , it 's not clear to me that the respondents are in a great position to provide a globally-relative ranking : what you 're looking at is a composite score of a number of individuals putting down one-to-ten rankings of their country . 
  second , there 's a substantial degree of subjectivity in many of these . 
  third , many of the things that go into a score , be they desirable or not , are not things that i 'd clearly call contributing to freedom of the press : * lack of a mediator to assure dialogue between civil society and the media * lack of several codes or charters of professional or ethical conduct * whether there is a radio-tv regulatory agency * lack of what the respondent believes to be sufficient journalism training and post-graduate training * whether media represents the population 's language diversity * whether journalists are invited ( not necessarily by the government ) to press trips and the like , which might impact their objectivity . 
  * are journalists unionized ? 
  * does the law require that an individual have a right of response to a news article concerning him ( that is , does the same publication have to also publish someone 's answer to criticism ) ? 
  * how widespread is broadband internet ? 
  * how inexpensive are printing/distribution facilities ? 
  * are officials in a country focusing on expanding internet access ? 
  so , for example , i 'd consider restricting advocacy of nazism or communism to be a substantial restriction on the press . 
  i would not consider lack of unionization of journalists to be a substantial restriction on the press . 
  it does n't incorporate the practical degree to which lawsuits have been used to stifle criticism -- england , for example , has been a popular place to file libel lawsuits against publications in the past ( note that there were [ important revisions in 2013 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_defamation_law ) ) , which i 'd consider to be a substantial concern , but it 's a relatively-minor element . 
  while i sympathize with the idea that government spying on press sources may be a concern and that this is quite difficult to measure , i doubt that actual public perception of this maps well to the degree to which it is done . 
  ditto for monitoring of independent online media producers . 
  unless someone inside the government engages in whistleblowing , there is a revolution and documents and other material from the fallen regime or dumped , or someone is caught in the act , it 's pretty hard to measure . 
  sanctions are typically done because you 're causing problems for the other country , not because of how you interact with your own citizens . 
  your link is dead , but iirc their metric heavily weights public perception rather than actual restrictions , which may not be the best metric to use . 
  [ wikipedia : freedom of speech by country : germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_speech_by_country#germany ) is rather more comprehensive than the article . 
  also [ wikipedia : censorship in the federal republic of germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_the_federal_republic_of_germany ) . 
  apparently it 's actually not the largest source of pollution in the baltic : https://polskawue.gov.pl/files/polska_w_ue/polska_a_polityki_ue/strategia_morza_baltyckiego/pe.pdf  the biggest point load source of eutrophication in the baltic sea is the city of st petersburg . 
  st. petersburg 's south-western wastewater treatment plant was opened in september 2005 , which brought previously untreated waste waters of 700 000 people to modern treatment . 
  but the waste water of 800 000 people still goes untreated to the sea . 
  further investments are needed to channel this waste water to treatment plants and to improve the processes in existing waste water treatment plants . 
  there are also several smaller cities along the russian coastline without proper wastewater treatment . 
  the enlargement of eu has improved the situation in the new eu member states ; they are implementing community legislation also in the field of sewage water treatment . 
  there are important point load sources also in belarus and ukraine . 
  activities related to the reduction of the pollution of transboundary waters in order to decrease the pollution load to the baltic sea need to be implemented . 
  also , i was reading about baltic sea pollution last week , and i believe that a larger concern would be dioxins . 
  if you remember , this is what [ viktor yuschenko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_yushchenko ) was poisoned with . 
  [ see figure 3 on page 8 ] ( http://www.helcom.fi/lists/publications/dioxins%20in%20the%20baltic%20sea.pdf ) for a map . 
  this impacts baltic sea fisheries , and take much longer to leave the food system once they are present . 
  oh , to have bought fencing company stock . 
  i knew that spain controlled some land on the other side of the strait of gibraltar , but i had n't heard of melilla before this .

  i 'm not sure how interesting a prior profession is in predicting policy . 
  our last few presidents were : * a lawyer * an oil executive * a lawyer * an oil executive and cia director * an actor * a peanut farmer * a lawyer * a lawyer * a schoolteacher * a journalist * a soldier * a haberdasher * a lawyer * an engineer * a lawyer * a newspaper editor the decisions probably depend a lot on a mass of advisors that are domain experts . 
  i imagine that the doctor feels otherwise . 
  might improve real wages for workers that do n't compete with them , though -- if wages go down , so do prices , so the german doctor who is buying lunch gets a cheaper lunch . 
  you could just organize a separate soccer tournament . 
  so ... how about practical impact ? 
  that is , what promises have they made , what will their coalition partners likely require , etc ? 
   `` we will be needing talent . 
  over time , migration must change from a problem to be tackled to a well-managed resource . '' why wait ? 
  you could do that now by increasing your work visa system instead of just pulling in refugees without any numeric caps . 
  `` yup , we find that she was guilty after all -- consorting with satan and the works . '', 
   i would swap those russian oligarchs for 100 americans awww , shucks . 
  coincidentally , hitler 's [ try at autarky ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/germany/economicrev_print.shtml ) was done while re-arming . 
  hmm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_serbia  the serbian climate is between a continental climate in the north , with ** cold winters ** , and hot , humid summers with well distributed rainfall patterns , and a more adriatic climate in the south with hot , dry summers and autumns and rank daily average ** relatively cold winters with heavy inland snowfall ** . 
   when they all start coming change your mind and tell everyone to fuck off . 
  honestly , if the destination countries announced `` we refuse to grant asylum for any more migrants who have not applied by < tomorrow  , end of story '' that would be preferable , because that would eliminate the pull factors . 
  trying to do border control but keeping the reward at the end of the line just means that you get people who have already spent the money and committed to a try at making it through trying to figure out how to breach the border . 
  well , these got caught : * `` large rescue mission after boat carrying eight illegal immigrants to the uk from france sinks in the english channel '' on the daily mail , link disallowed * `` romanian people smuggler who tried to traffic group of afghan nationals into uk on a small rubber boat is jailed after the vessel broke down in the english channel '' ( no link , daily mail ) * [ people smugglers profiting from plight of refugees ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/people-smugglers-profiting-from-plight-of-refugees/a-18692656 ) `` reitano told dw that some occasional smugglers have been lured into the trade by the promise of easy money , smuggling one or two migrants across the english channel for around 1,500 euros . '', 
  * [ desperate afghan migrant rescued in the english channel on wooden raft with a bedsheet sail ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/desperate-afghan-migrant-rescued-in-the-english-channel-on-wooden-raft-with-a-bedsheet-sail-9327496.html ) * [ smugglers arrested as they try to sneak 200 illegal immigrants into britain ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/smugglers-arrested-try-sneak-200-3720159 ) so you have to assume that some of these guys are n't being caught . 
  if the penalties and risks are n't on par with , say , making half-a-million in selling drugs , it seems like a no-brainer to do this instead . 
   `` migrants and people smugglers need to learn that calais is a dead-end street . '', 
  i bet that it is n't . 
  it 's twenty miles wide and you can make it in a dinghy and there 's regularly boat traffic in the channel . 
  i would be * astounded * if there are n't people regularly smuggling migrants across . 
  i do n't have a way to change your policies either . 
  well , that 's kind of your fault for establishing any non-viable policies . 
  turkey had nothing to do with that and obviously has no way to modify policies of eu member countries . 
  well , some of it * was * that the country where people were registering was responsible for granting asylum and germany and some other countries were relying on using transit countries as buffers and refusing to grant asylum to people who had asylum there . 
  as a result , the migrants , who obviously did n't want to get stuck in greece , were hellbent on * not * being registered in those countries . 
  hard to register people who are actively trying to evade the authorities . 
  generally-speaking , it 's the responsibility of the country being entered to stop illegal entry , not the country where people are leaving . 
  if greece does n't have the manpower , legal authorities within the eu , or political will , that 's an eu issue , not turkey 's problem . 
  http://frontex.europa.eu/operations/rapid-intervention/  the basic idea behind rapid interventions is to bring assistance to a member state that is under urgent and exceptional pressure . 
  the pressure relates especially to large numbers of third-country nationals trying to enter the territory of a member state illegaly . 
    in the event of rapid intervention members of european border guard teams ( ebgt ) are intended to provide short-term assistance . 
  the host member state remains responsible for the control and surveillance of their external borders . 
    member states have a legal obligation to make their border guards available for deployment at the request of frontex , unless they are faced with an exceptional situation substantially affecting the discharge of national tasks . 
  frontex * is * supposed to be a mechanism to effectively take control of border guards from country a that is n't under pressure and use them in country b that is . 
  this would seem to fall under that mandate . 
   ca n't put out i do n't think that it is impossible to stop illegal immigration in europe ( well , at least at the current level ... you 're never going to * completely * stop it , true ) . 
  you do n't have to show an id to get on an airplane ?
