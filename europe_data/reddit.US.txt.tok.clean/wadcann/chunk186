   i would do the same on their position presumably if you put most people in the position of someone doing something objectionable , they 'd do that thing ... it 's because they * are * in that position . 
  i think that people are rather overestimating the effectiveness of a fence in making humans stay in one place .

  well , the uk would be free to extend them work visas . 
  it would n't be required to boot them out -- just would n't be required to let them stay , either . 
  i do n't know what the politics are like , but i personally would be surprised if a brexit translated to `` everyone out , now '' .

  perhaps turkey views the cost to turkey of taking said people as greater than three billion euros and thus is n't interested in that sort of arrangement ?

   how americanised is your country ? 
   in what ways is it americanised ? 
  tough to decide between american tourists and american culture showing up everywhere . 
   how do you feel about it ? 
  eh , seems to work well-enough . 
   general thoughts on americanisation ? 
  seems like kinda an artificial concept . 
  stuff just spreads to wherever people are interested in it , whether it 's anime from japan or pizza from italy or curry from india . 
  it winds up getting combined with whatever else the locals like , and a generation later , it 's part of the culture there . 
  nobody 's worried about egyptian culture showing up in the form of beer ... < shrug , 
  then you would have people being mugged and homes being burglarized and pay the cost of that . 
  well , or take some untried approach to integration/education/crime reduction -- i 'm just pointing out that the `` take poor people , spread them around , poverty goes away '' approach sounds nice but has n't resulted in the kind of success that its advocates were hoping for . 
  eritrea and somalia are among the [ major contributors to immigration to sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden ) , and their populations are black :  81,300 applied for asylum in 2014 , which was an increase of 50 % compared to 2013 , and the most since 1992 . 
  47 % of them come from syria , followed by 21 % from the horn of africa ( mostly eritrea and somalia ) .

  as someone who does n't live in the eu , i 'd say that i did n't even know juncker 's name until i started reading this sub , and over the course of reading about the last few crises , i noticed that media discussion of eu leadership went from cameron-merkel-hollande to merkel-hollande to merkel . 
  if the chancellor is going to be the most-visible leadership in the eu and treated as such by the media , she 's going to be used as the shorthand for the eu . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triomphant-class_submarine that being said , i do think that people here seem to be more-casual about the effect of the uk vanishing from an eu military standpoint than i would be . 
   volkswagen , for its part , is also engaged in a bit of soul searching around diesel ( at least , when it 's not recalling its 11 million law-breaking cars and dealing with criminal probes ) . 
  the company recently announced that it would take a major plunge into electric powertrains , creating a standardized architecture for a new wave of plug-in cars . 
  `` the volkswagen brand is repositioning itself for the future , '' said executive herbert diess . 
  yet this shift wo n't happen overnight . 
  because vw spent so many years dreaming up ways to evade regulators and sell diesel cars , it 's now playing catch-up to electric car companies like tesla . 
  oh , for crying out loud . 
  tesla is so overhyped . 
  they 're in completely-different markets . 
  tesla sold something like [ 35k vehicles in 2014 ] ( http://evobsession.com/tesla-sales-updates-estimates/ ) . 
  volkswagen sells [ ten million vehicles per year ] ( http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2015/01/14/gm-global-sales/21767991/ ) , about three hundred times as many . 
   you know what happens when you concentrate poor people into a single area ? 
  the area becomes blighted , job opportunities decrease , people from those areas are discriminated against and crime rises . 
  a self-perpetuating cycle of misery is created . 
  people feel trapped and hopeless and aspire less . 
    the best way to deal with this is by spreading poor people around . 
  so that they are always around middle class people . 
  [ * the atlantic * : american murder mystery ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/american-murder-mystery/306872/ ) is an article talking about the attempt to do this in the us ; it 's quite-critical of the results . 
  i do n't know anyone in the us who hates the eu . 
  it might not be very relevant to their lives , and they might not know much about it , but it definitely is n't going to be something that 's generally-disliked . 
  edit : note that i 'm talking about the eu as an institution , rather than as the collection of individual countries . 
  ehhh ... it 's maybe not unreasonable . 
  i know that you 're thinking `` oh , connected mafioso gets immunity for actions '' , but ... sanctions against * individuals * are an attempt to directly-manipulate people within the government . 
  let 's say that john kerry is elected president . 
  kerry does something that russia does n't like . 
  russia than seizes heinz company assets in russia or imposes restrictions on heinz , stating that this will only end if kerry switches back . 
  kerry ( or his wife , whatever ) loses large amounts of money . 
  now , that might well be legal , but it 's obviously a channel to potentially-influence leadership , and to align the interests of those leaders with russia and against the us public . 
  you would n't want a structure like that in place . 
  similarly , i think that there may be an argument for russia to do the same . 
  i agree that if you 're going to accept mass immigration , massively-scalable education is probably going to be the only way to go . 
  that being said , kinks in [ moocs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massive_open_online_course ) are still being worked out -- while one day they may take over education , today they 're still an immature form . 
  california went through a similar phase where toyota and some other hybrid manufacturers managed to get privileged access to carpool lanes for people who bought their vehicles ... and sure enough , people bought a lot of them . 
  what they wanted was n't so much the hybrid * car * , but access to a quick commute . 
  so , one of two things is happening there : * either there 's a real positive externality provided by use of the hybrids that 's on-par with the size of the subsidy , in which case there 's no problem . 
  * or the subsidy is too large ( which i suspect is the case ) and people are just trying to figure out how to get the plebs in the regular-old-gasoline cars to subsidize fast travel for them . 
  the thing is , i 've no problem with the idea of people paying a premium for fast travel -- after all , if you want to throw money at having a road , great -- but if you 're doing that , using a toll road means that you do n't have to deal with risk of having the guys in the regular cars buying your fast travel to an inordinate degree . 
  it also avoids having connected auto manufacturers having the public effectively transfer money from the road budget to the manufacturers . 
  there are two problems that i have with toll roads : * the logistics . 
  either i have to stop and pay a toll , which interferes with the benefit of using the toll road for anything other than long-distance travel , or i have to use some automated billing system , which kind of invades my privacy by dumping my life 's movements into a database . 
  * it can be hard to get the underlying land for a road , since every person in the path of the road can halt construction by simply refusing to deal ... and the state may have to use eminent domain to seize the land . 
  i 'm a little uncomfortable with the state using eminent domain to transfer large amounts of land to private companies . 
  still , * if * those issues could be solved , i 'd be fine with it . 
  if someone is willing to pay extra to construct a dedicated lane , and i do n't have to pay for it , it 's no skin off my back if they do that . 
  same thing if i want to pay for a dedicated that i particularly want to use . 
  eh , you can make a simpler point : we ran up a lot of debt during world war ii . 
  we reduced unemployment , yes , by running up debt , but they are n't talking about us unemployment , but us debt . 
  just because russia 's doing something does n't necessarily mean that it 's a good idea to also do it . 
  whether russia is getting a good overall return via funding these , is , i think , the question . 
  for example , the one here saying that a ukranian fighter jet shot down mh-17 is probably already a little bit embarrassing . 
   trading fossil fuel powered cars with renewable energy powered cars is a good trade off . 
  [ polandball : awkward ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2lskkm/awkward/ ),

  well , you can move from nominal per capita gdp to [ ppp per capita gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) to factor that in : norway : $ 67,166 united states : $ 54,370 sweden : $ 46,219 germany : $ 46,216 china : $ 13,224 somalia : $ 600, 
   the lanes reserved for public transport and electric cars are getting clogged by the plebs getting cheaper cars so the privilege of driving in the public transport lanes is about to be removed . 
  but it was a nice couple of years for sure .
