  assuming that the lanes were n't being over-subsidized and that people taking advantage of this route were n't just gaming the system , this seems kind of like a cry for toll roads . 
  if people are willing to buy an expensive car to get access to the lanes , there 's clearly willingness to pay a substantial amount of money for better road access . 
  whether-or-not that 's the case , the bulk of its parts are not involved in the migrant processing from southern europe up to germany . 
  i mean nato as an institution , rather than member countries -- it 's not as if jens stoltenberg is off delegating migrant-processing responsibilities . 
  instead , you 've mostly independent countries dealing with the problem as it shows up at their borders . 
  ... nato is n't involved with migrant processing . 
  hell , the eu level of the eu mostly is n't even involved with migrant processing . 
  well , i think that there might be an implicit assumption that the eu should handle it * and adopt the policies that they want * . 
  if you do n't have enough housing , you 're going to have to choose someone to get that housing . 
  there are some benefits to having a market allocate the housing -- this means that if there 's an undersupply and demand is sufficient , more housing will be constructed . 
  if you have a market allocating the housing and demand for an area rises across the board , that area is going to gentrify -- poorer residents wo n't be able to afford housing , and existing residents will sell out for the cash . 
  i think that the main group complaining about gentrification is people who can not afford housing . 
  the problem is that : * first , someone would be excluded anyway . 
  gentrification * only * happens when there is a shortage of housing . 
  they might want some other criteria to be used that might favor them more , something other than `` who is willing to pay the most for this housing '' , but if you , say , froze house prices , you 'd just wind up with people who are moving into london who want housing , the people driving the gentrification , being unable to find any housing . 
  * generally-speaking , i have a hard time seeing a criteria that everyone involved would accept as `` fair '' , and `` whoever pays the most for this house in a nice location gets it '' seems to be at least as reasonable as anything else . 
  * sometimes people complaining about gentrification is a symptom of not enough housing existing because of artificial restrictions , like height restrictions . 
  when this is the case , i think that people complaining about gentrification might be missing the point . 
  * choosing `` highest bidder wins '' at least works fairly smoothly with the construction of more housing , assuming that there are no artificial restrictions on construction of more housing . 
  housing prices increase , it becomes profitable at some point for a housing developer to construct a house , and housing goes up . 
  if you said `` we 'll allocate housing by random lottery '' , then you will increase the overall level of housing shortage and you need to start trying to patch over that with other approaches ( like having the state tax people and then spending that taxation on more housing construction than you 'd need with highest-bidder-wins ) . 
   rt reported [ snip ]  the german european parliament member fabio de masi told sputnik ... 
  so ... anyone other than russian state-funded media sources providing reporting ? 
   perhaps nato if our goverment would ask for it , but i doubt that is happening . 
  a couple of problems : * first , well outside the scope of nato . 
  nato 's a defense agreement , and member countries do n't have an obligation to deal with this . 
  obviously , countries who happen to be nato members * could * send soldiers to help -- militaries have been used in disaster relief -- but it would not be a nato requirement . 
  and this is really a policing job , not a disaster relief issue . 
  the reasons you use a military for disaster relief is that it has logistics capability and because it can operate without infrastructure , and neither of those apply here . 
  * second , it could be seen as having nato compete with eu responsibilities and harmful to federalization by federalists . 
  the eu * could * send in people , is the most-directly-responsible party , and has chosen not to do so , and i doubt that nato will second-guess the eu on this . 
  * third , this is politically-sensitive . 
  it 's bad enough when [ soldiers are required to do policing in their own country and things go south ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kent_state_shootings ) . 
  what happens if * foreign * soldiers screw up a policing job ? 
  like , let 's say there 's a fight and a us solder is sent in to break it up and a slovenian citizen gets killed . 
  there 's the potential for bad political fallout there . 
  to be fair , presumably it was the migrants being moved on the train who made a mess , not the hungarians , right ? 
  i have a hard time believing that the police were ordered to go trash the train ... 
  hmm . 
  okay , thanks -- i was kind of surprised , because i thought that the first thing to do in registration would be to uniquely-identify a person with time and location . 
  everything else , even stuff like medical screening for diseases or interviewing to to determine place of origin can follow , but without that information , you do n't have something reliable to attach the other information to . 
  the us historically allowed in [ more refugees than any other country ] ( http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/refugees-fact-sheet ) , but it 's nothing like these kind of numbers , and the us is more comparable to the eu as a whole than just to germany . 
  the us [ has been taking ~ 70k refugees per year from the whole world ] ( http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/refugees-fact-sheet ) ( skilled immigration not included ) . 
  the us has a gdp of $ 17t , germany of $ 3.8 t. 
  keeping things proportional there , germany could be expected to take 15,650 refugees per year if it wanted to stay on par . 
  the numbers here dwarf those . 
  definitely not accepted claims . 
  i believe that these are simply accepted applications for asylum . 
  if you illegally-immigrate , the 1951 refugee convention guarantees that you can not be penalized if you show that you had a need to do so , came directly from an unsafe country , and also register promptly upon entering a country : https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention  refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge   1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  arguably germany has grounds to reject on the `` not coming from an unsafe country '' criteria , but doing so would just screw over greece and italy again . 
  how would they double-count registrations ? 
  i can understand simple counting at a border post to just get a total , but my understanding was that a registration included fingerprinting and so forth and that people 's fingerprints were being checked against the database of already-recorded fingerprints . 
  it * is * important , though . 
  i 'd kind of like to have a legal resource that compares the current immigration policies of countries across europe , as ( a ) there are no common eu immigration rules , ( b ) the policies have been changing , ( c ) some statements have been mis-quoted , and ( d ) some of the numbers are quite confusing and sometimes listed in a misleading way by even the original sources . 
   contrary to what people think , the winter in the last years has not lead to a decrease of asylum applications . 
  what percentage of those people were crossing the med in overloaded , dubious boats , though ? 
  i mean , risk-taking is one thing , but there are boats sinking in calm weather -- i would n't want to be trying during a winter storm . 
  regardless of whether-or-not having the people in question immigrate is a good idea , it 's an impressive show from a logistical standpoint , so kudos to the agencies doing the processing for managing to scale up to 10k people a day . 
  they 're just following orders , so no sense in assigning blame to them , and they did a good job with that on a limited timescale . 
  < checks  my guess is that the peak was in 2010 , when the us was spending 43 % of global military spending , so fair enough -- the us would have needed to increase its budget by another 32 % of make it to half of the global budget . 
  are you sure that it 's armored ? 
  if [ this comment 's link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3oyc6z/afghan_migrant_shot_dead_by_bulgarian_border/cw1ohmm ) is of the van , that does n't look like it has armor .

   for the bbc to use terms like `` surviving '' - this implies that the others were specifically targeted to be killed and were lucky to be alive . 
  i do n't agree . 
  `` surviving '' should be appropriate whether someone is killed via a ricocheting bullet or a non-ricocheting bullet or just tripping over their own feet and breaking their neck . 
  it 's only talking about whether someone is alive or not . 
   amsterdam dance event will reportedly not charge attendees caught with five or fewer ecstasy pills sounds like meaningless promotional text to catch the eye of ecstasy users -- surely a festival organizer would have no role in charging people anyway . 
  assuming a roughly-fixed rate of processing , first-come-first-serve processing , and the processing rate being the bottleneck ( which i 'd suspect is the case ) those samples are probably biased towards older applications rather than reflecting recent large increases , though . 
  you are n't having people from the balkans traveling through greece , and there are a lot of people who * are * moving through greece . 
  http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/four-killed-during-migrant-rescue-operation  greece 's eastern islands , particularly lesbos , have dealt with the largest influx of migrants as more than 400,000 thousand refugees and migrants crossed from turkey to greece this year . 
  the state of data protection in telco and other areas is kinda disappointing relative to what one might hope for . 
   whereas ebola in europe would be breaking news on any channel on earth . 
  well , there actually [ is ebola in europe ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/health/wirestory/ebola-nurse-uk-rare-case-relapse-34489631 ) , but not due to migrants . 
  you 're right that it 's in the news ... 
  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/02/u-s-deportations-of-immigrants-reach-record-high-in-2013/  the obama administration deported a record 438,421 unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2013 , edit : ah , i had n't been following the debate , but apparently in the last couple years , we started classifying refusal to let people enter as being in the same pool as `` removals '' , whereas historically `` refusal to allow entry '' and `` removals '' were treated separately , so something under half of that were actual deportations . 
   this is somebody repeating rt/putin propaganda bullshit . 
  there is no reasoning with such people . 
  hmm . 
  that 's a pretty strong endorsement of rt 's effectiveness . 
  https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/molotovs-proposal-the-ussr-join-nato-march-1954  the document below is a translation of v. m. molotov 's proposal to the soviet presidium in march 1954 that the ussr should issue a diplomatic note to the western powers stating its willingness to consider joining nato . 
  the background to molotov 's memorandum was the launch of the soviet campaign for european collective security at the berlin conference of foreign ministers in february 1954 . 
  at that conference molotov proposed the soviet alternative to western plans for a european defense community ( edc ) involving the participation of a rearmed west germany -- the conclusion of a pan-european collective security treaty . 
  this proposal was linked in tum to a further set of soviet proposals on the german question , including germany 's reunification and neutralization in the cold war . 
    molotov 's collective security proposal was rejected by western representatives on two grounds . 
  firstly , because the united states was excluded from the proposed treaty and relegated , together with communist china , to observer status . 
  secondly , because the soviet proposal aimed , it was said , to disrupt nato as well as halt the formation of the edc . 
  molotov responded to these criticisms by saying that the soviet proposal could be amended and that he was open to persuasion about the value of nato as a defensive organization . 
  the goal here , arguably , would have been to neutralize nato . 
  [ fast-forward half a century later to 2009 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato%e2%80%93russia_relations#suggestions_of_russia_joining_nato ) :  the idea of russia becoming a nato member has at different times been floated by both western and russian leaders , as well as some experts . 
  [ 29 ]   in march 2009 , the polish foreign minister , rados\u0142aw sikorski , suggested including russia in nato . 
  [ 13 ] speaking to one of the main polish daily newspapers after the lecture , mr sikorski explained , ' i stand by everything i said , but that does n't mean i 'm inviting russia to join the nato . 
  i simply presented a certain hypothetical vision , a reference to a debate that took place in the nato in the mid-1990s . 
  then , under the clinton administration , there was a debate on whether , and on what terms , russia could become a member of the alliance . 
  ' [ 13 ] russian leadership , however , made it clear russia did not plan to join the alliance , preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level now . 
  in march 2009 , the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . 
  '' [ 13 ] [ a nato-with-russia would also be a real change in nato 's * purpose * in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato ) . 
   the first nato secretary general , lord ismay , stated in 1949 that the organization 's goal was `` to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down .
