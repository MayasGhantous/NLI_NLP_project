  i believe that the us position was that because afghanistan 's leadership refused to turn over the perpetrators and was guaranteeing their security and because those people were continuing to operate and intended more attacks , afghanistan was effectively acting . 
  that being said , i suppose that it would be possible to argue against but i do n't think that most states are super-enthusiastic about encouraging regimes that tend to try to knock off the legislators , executive , and military leaders of countries .

  she can take the position that there is nothing that germany would accept in exchange for reducing eu freedom of movement , and that 's what she 's trying to convey -- she 's saying that no matter what will need to be sacrificed to ensure that , germany will pay that price . 
  i think that there are very few things that are * actually * non-negotiable , and that the term is pretty over-used , but i doubt that she 's claiming to run the eu .

  realistically , if you * really * wanted to improve life globally at a large scale , funding high-standard education efforts and providing the essentials to students while they 're studying would probably be the most cost-effective thing to do .

  the researchers pumped air from the ward up to a guinea pig enclosure on the roof of the hospital for 535 consecutive days . 
  the guinea pigs were split into three groups of approximately 150 : the first group received air exposed to the uv lights in the ward , the second group received ward air treated with negative ionisers , and the third control group was given untreated air straight from the ward . 
  the guinea pigs were given skin tests for tuberculosis once a month . 
    by the end of the experiment , 35 % of the control group were infected with tb , compared to 14 % of the ionised air group and 9.5 % of the uvc group .

  when you start with third-world conditions and then [ add in war , you 're going to have diseased people running around ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/04/syrian-disease-outbreaks-inevitable-who ) : that article 's from back in 2013 and the who already knows what 's going to happen , because it 's seen it before in crises :  outbreaks of hepatitis , typhoid , cholera or dysentery are `` inevitable '' in syria and its neighbours this summer , while cases of measles and other infections are already growing because of the country 's broken health system and increasing numbers of displaced people , the world health organisation ( who ) has warned . 
    more than a third of syria 's public hospitals are out of action , in some areas 70 % of health workers have fled and 4.25 million internally displaced syrians are living in overcrowded , insanitary conditions , it said . 
  shortages of safe drinking water and disruption to vaccination programmes are increasing the risks . 
    with thousands of syrians crossing the borders each day , diseases already prevalent inside syria are being transmitted to neighbouring countries , according to the who 's regional office for the eastern mediterranean , just days ahead of new united nations appeals for funds to combat the humanitarian crisis . 
  `` all the risk factors that enhance the transmission of communicable diseases in emergencies are present in the current crisis in syria and its neighbouring countries , '' said jaouad mahjour , its director for communicable diseases . 
    `` we are anticipating a number of public health risks from water-borne diseases , specifically hepatitis , typhoid , cholera and dysentery . 
  given the scale of population movement both inside syria and across borders , together with deteriorating environmental health conditions , outbreaks are inevitable . '', 
    there have been significant increases of acute watery diarrhoea and hepatitis . 
  typhoid is also on the rise . 
  vaccination campaigns against measles have been hit and cutaneous leishmaniasis , a disease transmitted to humans through sand fly bites already endemic in parts of syria , especially aleppo , is spreading . 
    measles , tuberculosis and cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported among displaced syrians in jordan , lebanon , iraq and turkey . 
  mahjour said : `` jordan had previously reported zero cases of measles for three years , and was planning to officially declare that it was measles-free . 
  the situation will deteriorate if prevention and control measures are not scaled up soon . '', 
  and places like somalia have been worse-off for longer .

   he passed very liberal gun laws . 
  he was germanys last true guns enthusiast . 
  well ... liberal for some . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_gun_control_theory  few citizens owned , or were entitled to own firearms in germany in the 1930s . 
  [ 1 ] the weimar republic had strict gun control laws . 
  [ 6 ] when the third reich gained power , some aspects of gun regulation were loosened , such as allowing ownership for nazi party members and the military . 
  [ 4 ] :672 the laws were harshened in other ways . 
  nazi laws disarmed `` unreliable '' persons , especially jews , but relaxed restrictions for `` ordinary '' german citizens . 
  [ 4 ] :670,676 the policies were later expanded to include the confiscation of arms in occupied countries . 
  [ 7 ] :533,536 [ snip ]  in a 2000 article , author and attorney stephen halbrook said that he was presenting `` the first scholarly analysis of the use of gun control laws and policies to establish the hitler regime and to render political opponents and especially german jews defenseless . 
  '' [ 7 ] :485 in the article he cites the adolf hitler quote , `` the most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms . 
  '' [ 7 ] :483 [ 10 ] :403 [ note that the united states is not innocent here either , seeing various attempts immediately-subsequent to the american civil war to effectively disarm blacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saturday_night_special#regulation_in_the_united_states ) :  the earliest law prohibiting inexpensive handguns was enacted in tennessee , in the form of the `` army and navy law , '' passed in 1879 , shortly after the 14th amendment and civil rights act of 1875 ; previous laws invalidated by the constitutional amendment had stated that black freedmen could not own or carry any manner of firearm . 
  the army and navy law prohibited the sale of `` belt or pocket pistols , or revolvers , or any other kind of pistols , except army or navy pistols , '' which were prohibitively expensive for black freedmen and poor whites to purchase . 
  [ 11 ] these were large pistols in .36 caliber ( `` navy '' ) or .44 caliber ( `` army '' ) , and were the military issue cap and ball black-powder revolvers used during the civil war by both union and confederate ground troops . 
  the effect of the law was to restrict handgun possession to the upper economic classes . 
   first of all , our justice system makes sense . 
  we have this concept called `` bonus pater familias '' which is latin for ` the reasonable man ' . 
    it is basically assumed that every person can , for example , read a menu end have the ability to not order food with salmon if you ca n't handle fish . 
  - rather than the other way around . 
  this also means you ca n't sue mcdonalds for dropping your coffee ; that 's on you . 
  it sounds suspiciously like danish and us law do n't differ here . 
  the [ reasonable person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reasonable_person ) exists in us law and is used as a criteria for a number of things , like whether a `` reasonable person '' would feel that their life was being threatened in whether the use of lethal force in self-defense was justified to me . 
  you can sue for anything . 
  lawsuits need to pass an initial review , but ultimately if a case gets past the review and the jury agrees , it 's possible to win large settlements . 
  i agree that [ * liebeck v. mcdonald 's restaurants * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liebeck_v._mcdonald%27s_restaurants ) was not the proudest moment for the legal system -- you 'll find a few people who will argue in favor of the outcome , and i 'd say that these people are mostly of the `` corporations are always bad '' persuasion -- but it 's also not representative of a typical case . 
  mcdonald 's did n't change their policy as a result of it , nor did other restaurants -- they treated it as a freak outcome and just part of the cost of doing business . 
  i think that the important difference is that unlike the us , denmark does not appear , based on a quick google , to have [ punitive damages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punitive_damages ) -- just [ compensatory damages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/damages#compensatory_or_expectation_damages ) . 
  punitive damages are awarded a plaintiff not to cure the ill caused the defendant , but to punish the plaintiff , to discourage them from doing this again . 
  punitive damages can be quite large , and often if if you hear of a really large award , that 's where they 're coming from . 
  unfortunately , they create a bad incentive -- they make the plaintiff benefit tremendously from filing the case . 
  i 'd be interested in a reform where punitive damages simply go to the state rather than the defendant . 
  probably be opposed by the bar associations , given that it would mean less money flowing to the legal profession . 
   denmark is actually democratic . 
  unlike the us , where you only can choose between 2 parties . 
  in denmark the number of parties changes quite often . 
  just recently , ` alternativet ' was voted in the current government , but they did n't even exist during the last election . 
  whether-or-not a voting system that would favor more parties is a good idea , the conventional meaning of `` democracy '' does n't mandate some number of parties to be a democracy . 
   money is definitely there in politics , but politicians are n't controlled by it , as they are in the us - and if they are , any reasonable person can quickly spot them . 
  i 'm not entirely-convinced that perception accurately lines up with the reality here ; i do n't think that the public in the us have a particularly informed , objective view of this , much less the public abroad . 
   we also do n't have any insane laws , like legalizing guns or illegalizing ( ? ), 
  gay marriage . 
  you made same-sex marriage [ a recognized process in 1989 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_denmark ) . 
  i disagree on the merits of gun legality , but we probably wo n't agree on that , and certainly we agree that policy differs .
