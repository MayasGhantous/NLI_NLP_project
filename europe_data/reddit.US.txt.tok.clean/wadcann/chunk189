   since education is free , everyone has a chance to become what they want - and if you fail or trip on your way - either financially , health or other unforseen events ( death in family , pregnancy , sickleave , your parents 50 anniversary ) we got your back . 
  agree that there 's a difference -- in the us , there 's a more-direct way for market demand to translate into the fields that people enter . 
  if you 're making use of the country 's educational resources , you 've a good reason to study something that will let you produce something that 's in need . 
   this means we can , in turn , have a more educated population denmark has a lower [ un education index ranking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index ) than does the united states . 
  he 's in an embassy , not a `` hideout '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_who_took_refuge_in_a_diplomatic_mission it 's not as if he 's the only person to ask an embassy for protection . 
  [ j\u00f3zsef mindszenty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zsef_mindszenty ) was given sanctuary by the united states embassy in hungary for fifteen years . 
  you 'd think that it would be in russia 's interest to get a country friendly to russia ( or at least buyable by russia ) but not too large or great a loss into nato who would be willing to veto new accessions . 
  i think the point is that this could permit the government to influence the public 's representatives . 
  to be fair , i doubt that trump is so much as interested in germany 's situation as he is in how it ties into his domestic campaign . 
   although 58 of cafferkey 's contacts are being monitored , most experts believe that is a precautionary measure to reassure the public and that it is unlikely she is infectious . 
  well , to be fair , most experts also would have believed that it is unlikely that she could have had a resurgence . 
  while i do n't know whether the english translation accurately-reflects the original german question , the question in english implies has the positives talk about desirability , the negatives talk about ability . 
  `` the number of asylum seekers is too high '' versus `` germany could accept more '' . 
  these are n't in direct opposition -- for example , i could think that germany * should * accept fewer seekers but * could * accept more . 
  i think that a lot of estonians would have rather had the finnish post-world-war-ii experience than the estonian post-world-war-ii experience . 
  estonia had a comparable economy to finland when world war ii opened , and when the ussr broke up , a fraction the per-capita gdp . 
  while the two have been gradually closing , the ratio is still [ at 1:2.6 today ] ( http://country-facts.findthedata.com/compare/8-94/estonia-vs-finland ) , so it obviously still has a big impact on how estonians live . 
  i 'd probably be a bit irked too . 
  seems like a good reason to obtain a fingerprint or other unique data at the initial crossing .

   it 's predation masked as philantropy . 
  the iron curtain did n't let people out . 
  was it also predatory ? 
  because it seems hard to describe both making skilled people stay in less-desirable places as predatory and letting them migrate as being predatory . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_bloc_emigration_and_defection  eastern bloc governments argued that strict limits to emigration were necessary to prevent a brain drain . 
  the united states and western european governments argued that they represented a violation of human rights . 
  despite the restrictions , defections to the west occurred . 
  would you support a new iron curtain ? 
  related note : i still ca n't figure out how the british did n't homogenize more than was the case . 
  maybe some places having an agricultural society did it -- land ownership ties you to the land . 
  it 's probably better than `` go all in on oil and gas '' if the belief is that saudi arabia can hold out long enough . 
  spies do their job , which is spying .

  i 'm trying to figure out whether , as a polar bear , i 'd rather live in a zoo or not . 
  on one hand , your range is extremely-limited , and the bears are going to be bored . 
  on the other hand , the polar bear population is going to be kept in check by nature wiping out competition for food , something that present-day humans mostly are n't used to . 
  not having to worry about starvation is pretty nice . 
   even normal dutch people are crazy stingy when it comes to heating . 
  18c ( 64f ) for daytime is normal for them . . that 's not unpleasantly-cold . 
  heck , i 've had my air conditioner set to switch on to keep the house * below * 68 degrees fahrenheit before . 
  this does n't really apply here , but that makes me think -- it might make sense for a country 's constitution ( at least those with a structure like the us , where there * is * a constitution and there 's a high bar to revision ) to impose a limit on the time until a legislative change to citizenship policy can take effect . 
  the delay would be long enough to vote in other representatives . 
  otherwise , a party that achieves power could maintain power permanently by modifying citizenship criteria to shape demographics to support themselves . 
  in the us , it 's [ unconstitutional to * strip * citizenship from people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_clause#loss_of_citizenship ) , for the obvious reasons -- a party in power could simply strip citizenship from its political enemies , and thus remove their vote . 
  there 's a flip side to that , though -- parties could also modify citizenship criteria to extend citizenship ( and , notably , voting power ) to an arbitrary set of people who would support their policies . 
  there is not similar protection against that . 
  for example , let 's hypothetically say that i 'm a moderate islamist party . 
  a serious scandal causes the major party to make an extremely-poor showing , and i have a strong showing in a particular election . 
  i get a majority of the legislature . 
  i know that next election after the scandal is resolved , i 'm very likely to lose power , but for the moment , i have the helm . 
  now , theoretically , as a democracy should ideally work , this would mean that i should try to do a particularly good job so that voters will be sold on me . 
  however , at this point , i would have the ability to , say , modify naturalization criteria to extend automatic citizenship to citizens in another country of my choice that is more-ideologically-aligned with me . 
  at that point , i can establish a [ positive feedback loop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/positive_feedback ) that ensures that i permanently remain in power , since i can weight the voting population however i want . 
  another possibility -- since maybe we do n't want to take away the ability of a legislature to quickly adjust citizenship criteria -- would be a variant of this where the delay on changing immigration criteria may be avoided if the legislation also passes a popular referendum . 
  well , the point is that the kids * are n't * illegal immigrants , but rather citizens . 
  i would assume that willingness to marry also affects fertility rate . 
  less fun to be a single parent . 
  poland , ireland , and italy are all catholic-dominant , not protestant . 
  fwiw : [ california 's gsp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_california ) is $ 2,300 b , between italy and france . 
  of that , [ $ 46.7 b ] ( http://ajed.assembly.ca.gov/sites/ajed.assembly.ca.gov/files/fast%20facts%20on%20california%27s%20agricultural%20economy.pdf ) is agricultural production .

   curious that we decided the fasci regime in italy was deserving of this nomenclature , rather than nazi germany ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazism  national socialism ( german : nationalsozialismus ) , more commonly known as nazism ( / \u02c8na\u02d0ts\u026az\u1d4am / ) , is the ideology and practice associated with the 20th-century german nazi party and nazi state as well as other far-right groups . 
  usually characterized as a form of fascism ... 
  the person quoted is going to be the person generating the most news-worthy quotes ; probably better to use polls to get a more-representative idea of what opinions are .

  the bar to sending someone back is probably higher than the bar to accepting someone in the first place . 
  i 'd say that schoolchildren are actually the easier cases -- if you get someone just entering school , you 've got more time to infuse education and skills than you do with an illiterate adult . 
   now i recall reading similar things in anderson 's `` security engineering '' . 
  memory does n't seem to improve with age , it appears . 
  i read that as well , and iirc he was describing a `` mig-in-the-middle attack '' ( a play on '' [ man-in-the-middle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-in-the-middle_attack ) '' attack , since it 's a mig doing it ) . 
  i thought it was real for years , until i later found out that it was n't real . 
  this is a slightly different attack from a [ replay attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/replay_attack ) , though both would be issues : * mig-in-the-middle : the mig forwards the query to a transmitter that sends it to a real aircraft ( e.g. 
  a b-52 ) ; the response is then relayed via the mig back to the querying sam site , which sees a b-52 friendly aircraft . 
  * replay attack : the response from a friendly aircraft is recorded and then replayed back . 
  actually , i 'm lying when i say that challenge response is * necessary * , because including a timestamp and position and cryptographically-signing the response would solve both issues without challenge-response -- but challenge-response would be a way of addressing it ; certainly some form of cryptographically-secure message is required . 
  [ lend-lease ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease ) started started in march 1941 ; the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) was november 1939-march 1940 . 
  i guess the [ continuation war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) would have overlapped . 
  you can really tell how cheap metal and plastic changed the world in a handful of decades -- * everything * is made of wood in these . 
  the ussr attacking finland predated the nazis fighting the ussr , on the other hand , and finland was trying to recover what the ussr took . 
  i mean , you could , with more justification , say that the us was fighting on the side of stalin , but the two had pretty divergent interests . 
  and finland was n't a member of the axis , though she was a co-belligerent with the axis against the ussr . 
  well , there 's nothing in `` old '' that need imply `` bad '' . 
  oh , you 're right -- wrong month . 
   general breedlove which is supreme allied commander of nato said publicly on 30 june 2014 that russians had given medium or long range surface to air missiles . 
  i find it inconcievable that the supreme commander would say it publicly without our intelligence services having heard about it . 
  that was two weeks after mh-17 . 
  if the launchers were moved into the area , then used shortly-afterwards ( and , as could be expected , mh-17 generated a lot of questions from the civilian administration for military intelligence focus on whether there were sams in the area ) , i do n't see it as being impossible . 
  presumably russia would try not to make the presence of the launchers obvious to nato , which would potentially be handing off that information to ukraine . 
  i do n't know what russian doctrine is or anything like that . 
  but my assumption is that the presence or absence of a civilian transponder would not be an input in an iff system . 
  three reasons : first , civilian aircraft do not have any form of cryptographically-secure data sent in their broadcast . 
  an iff system does . 
  this is actually a concern of mine , since i strongly think that they should -- it 's possible for anyone with a radio to send false data to `` passive radar '' today , and some airports * only * have the cheaper `` passive radar '' -- not real radar , just displaying what the aircraft claim their position and identity to be . 
  second , it would be possible for a military to obtain any electronics legitimately on a civilian plane , and use that to cover itself . 
  if you trusted that data , you would n't shoot at actual enemy aircraft .
