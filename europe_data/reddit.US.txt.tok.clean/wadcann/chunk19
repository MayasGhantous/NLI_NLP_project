  besides , that 's just domestic politicking ; the nyt will take positions that are advantageous to the democratic party . 
  ... though to be fair , i suppose this might be too . 
  advocating for illegal immigration directly is politically-damaging for the democratic party , because the public does n't want that , but getting people upset about treatment of illegal immigrants without having to actually promote any controversial policies would maybe make political sense regarding trump , who i vaguely-understand is selling himself on a hard line on illegal immigration . 
  he 's probably an american ( e.g. 
  see use of his word `` liberal '' [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l2gtg/its_time_to_confront_islamism_head_onwithout/cv2u12g ) , which is the american use rather than the international use , along with other phrasing ) . 
  looking at his other posts , they 're mostly divisive , either greek-german , east european-west european , us-europe . 
  i 'm kind of assuming that he 's just trolling . 
  ca n't burn a chain link fence . 
  well , if they 've skills in demands and would be a net contribution , they 're certainly free to apply for a skilled worker visa in germany . 
  the problem with this is that traditional crowd control does n't work so well . 
  those police had riot shields -- each officer can only affect about one rioter . 
  if police are constrained to avoid use of tactics that do n't let a single officer control a great many rioters , you hit a critical mass and then rioters feel like they can run around with impunity . 
  in a riot , your major goal is to disperse the people involved to get below that threshold . 
  however , this is different . 
  it 's not going to disperse , because there 's more and more people flooding in from behind each day , so the ability of the police to control them can be expected to steadily fall off . 
  well , i 'd been predicting mass wire cutter usage and that has n't materialized yet ( seems like it 'd hard to stop people if they all coordinate to do it at a particular time ) , so the hungarian border system is ahead-of-the-game thus far . 
  the `` breakdown '' bit is due to the scale . 
  there are far more people living in poverty than there are people in europe . 
  while i agree with the general principle that people * do * tend to overestimate the long-term impact on a society , i do n't think that poverty can be the criteria for immigration unless europe is to become a drastically , drastically-different place . 
  other than mexico and central america , the us was mostly pulling in people -- admittedly , perhaps not always the cream-of-the-crop -- from countries that were fairly competitive places in a global sense over its history . 
   people still made those ridicolous claims of collapse of society , culture and economy when in reality it just made culture less wasp and more accepting well , it does make it less white and less protestant . 
  i strongly-disagree about being accepting , at least in the near term -- [ the most overwhelmingly anti-immigrant period in the us occurred during high high immigration ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i57x0/european_boat_refugees_a_century_ago_more_than_25/cudfp7r ) . 
  secondly , i guess you could say that they `` boost income '' in an aggregate sense , but if the state is to provide a subsidized standard of living , and so having people below-median-wage is detrimental , it really does n't wind up as a positive -- central american immigration reduced median wages in the us . 
  i think that nobody would disagree that if one were to eliminate welfare , then nobody would really object to large-scale unskilled immigration -- after all , no skin off your back -- but that 's not the case today . 
  finally , economies have changed substantially over time : people are n't just hauling stuff on a farm or even performing a repetitive activity on a factory line any more . 
  the unskilled-skilled income gap in the us has been growing for some time now . 
  if you want to have a relatively-flat society , the people you want to pull in are skilled workers , not gobs of unskilled refugees . 
   lybia in english , it 's `` libya '' . 
  well , / u/ltburtreynolds would probably be enthusiastic . 
  institutional inertia ? 
  i mean , do you want to be the administrator who sticks out and starts advocating for change ? 
  i think that a lot of people are very risk-adverse in their jobs due to the incentive structure . 
  they get relatively-little credit for doing an exceptional job . 
  their main incentive is risk of being fired . 
  not standing out is the appropriate way to avoid that . 
  if you 're some school official , it just does n't make much sense to try to improve things . 
   running away from war and utter poverty if you 're going to universalize accepting people in poverty -- a huge chunk of the world 's population -- your own system will break down . 
  that seems like a reasonable concern . 
  war might be more-viable , at least if the rate of war goes on a long decline . 
   i learned more about us and it 's history than i did eeurope . 
  i learned a lot more about the uk than eastern europe . 
  in fact ... i do n't really think that my schooling taught anything significant at all about eastern europe , through the entire curriculum . 
  we got more coverage of africa ( cradle of civilization and suez crisis ! ), 
  and of asia than eastern europe . 
   it stops being fun to me when i acknowledge that i 'm holding something that can kill with a single pull on the trigger . 
  too many things can go wrong . 
  honestly , the actions required to stay safe with firearms are a lot simpler than the ones required to do so with automobiles ( well , maybe you do n't drive , but just saying ) . 
   you 're too much of a pessimist from reading this forum and / r/polandball for some time , i 've decided that romanians are the most exceedingly self-critical people i 've ever run into . 
  as far as i can tell , all the adults at the front do n't care either . 
  the kids do n't look very enthralled either ( maybe the ones with their heads down are praying , though , on second thought ) . 
  all right , more than seven times the us number rather than more than ten times . 
  it 's not a terrible example of editorialization , but generally-speaking , it 's a really good idea to just use the original title . 
  people have an extremely bad habit of trying desperately to editorialize titles , so a lot of subreddits crack down really hard on any difference between the original title and your title , since it 's a simple , clear line to draw . 
  you could probably get away with it if it were a clear , inarguable reduction in bias , but i 'd normally always just use the submission title . 
  eliminates the risk . 
  maybe if you needed an image or subtitle to understand the title , but ... 
   honas issa , a 23-year-old information technology specialist from syria , said he applied for asylum in germany more than a year ago and he passed through the freilassing train station on the way back from the government office that is handling his application ... `` i 'm not so happy to sleep at home , 24 hours , like old people . 
  i am young . 
  i have an urge to study , to do something . 
  i have good experience . 
  i can do a lot , but nobody cares about that . '' germany should n't be taking that into account when evaluating the legitimacy of an asylum application . 
  asylum is claiming security from persecution , and germany would be violating treaty agreements if it were rejecting legitimate applications because of lack of skills . 
  a * skilled worker * visa is a different story , and it might potentially make sense for germany to accept skilled workers from syria ... but that 's not what he 's applying for . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules  2.3 editorialising is not acceptable . 
  editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a ( submission ) title . 
  you should , in most cases , use the title on the page you are linking to . 
  however , in the case of youtube , you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an nonpartisan and neutral title if the one the youtube video uses is clearly partisan and bias . 
   germany has the exact same policy . 
  do you have a citation for that ? 
  i have n't seen anything like that . 
  germany announced that it would not be enforcing dublin -- i.e. 
  booting syrian refugees back to greece/italy -- but that 's very different from granting * permanent residency * . 
  permanent residency means that they will never leave europe , even if the conflict is resolved . 
  it 's not something normally required by granting asylum . 
   each year the president , in consultation with congress , determines the numerical ceiling for refugee admissions . 
  for fiscal year ( fy ) 2015 , the ceiling is 70,000 . 
  germany , a much-smaller country , is talking about more than ten times that number this year , and most of the countries involved are much-poorer . 
  again , i 'm not trying to argue for the us to adopt such a policy : i do n't think that it 's in us interests . 
  i just think that it 's exceptionally-difficult for the nyt to justify demanding that eastern europe accept far more and criticizing the character and morality of europeans on this and being silent on the question of the us accepting at least as many . 
  http://www.seekasylumsweden.info/  current syria conflict   so far in 2014 , around 50 % of those seeking asylum in sweden who come from syria ( syrian citizens or stateless people from syria ) have been granted permanent residence permits to live in sweden by sweden 's migration board ( migrationsverket ) . 
  the other 50 % have been granted three-year temporary residence permits . 
  however migrationsverket 's assessment , as of september 2013 , is that the conflict in syria will continue for a long time to come . 
  for this reason , ** all of those seeking asylum from syria will now be granted permanent residence in sweden ** , even those who have not been threatened individually , following the satisfactory completion of an application for asylum . 
  migrationsverket continue to assess each asylum application on an individual basis . 
  ah , fair enough -- guess i just do n't . 
   i like to poke fun at pakistani and indians as ask them why it took them so long to kick out the english ( we got independence in 1916 ) . 
  * ireland start : [ following the norman invasion in the 12th century , england claimed sovereignty over ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ireland ) * ireland end : [ the irish free state was created in 1922 as a result of the anglo-irish treaty . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_ireland ) * india start : [ this was followed by a rapid expansion of british power through the greater part of south asia in the early 19th century .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union  the accession of serbia to the european union is the process of the republic of serbia being admitted into the framework of the european union as a member state . 
    on 7 november 2007 , serbia initialed a stabilisation and association agreement ( saa ) with the european union . 
  this was a milestone in serbia 's accession negotiations and was executed following the advice of chief war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte , who advised the eu that the country was complying adequately with the tribunal but ratko mladi\u0107 must be in the hague prior to any official signing being able to take place . 
  [ 1 ] mladi\u0107 was subsequently arrested on 26 may 2011 , and has since been extradited to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to stand trial . 
  [ 2 ] on 20 july 2011 , goran had\u017ei\u0107 became the last indicted fugitive to be arrested . 
  [ 3 ] after setbacks in the political field , on 7 december 2009 the eu unfroze the trade agreement with serbia [ 4 ] and the schengen countries dropped the visa requirement for serbian citizens on 19 december 2009 . 
  [ 5 ]   serbia officially applied for european union membership on 22 december 2009 , [ 6 ] and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate on 12 october 2011 . 
  after the vote of the 27 eu foreign ministers on 28 february 2012 , where with 26 votes for and 1 vote against , a candidate status recommendation was issued , and serbia received full candidate status on 1 march . 
  on 28 june 2013 the european council endorsed the council of ministers conclusions and recommendations to open accession negotiations with serbia .
