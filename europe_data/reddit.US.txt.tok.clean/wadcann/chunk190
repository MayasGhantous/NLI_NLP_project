  a lot of the indie people on / r/gamedev work with astonishingly-small budgets . 
  i 'm not super-hopeful , but let 's say that new grads want to start a company but have a hard time with the complexities of getting funding and this bridges the gap . 
  you get one halfway-successful company out of it that would n't have otherwise-happened in the uk , and it 's probably paid for itself . 
  the undersea part ; less controversial . 
  wherever does n't collide with an existing russian tap . 
   yeah but it is more of an unimportant operation that was never carried out . 
  i recognized the name off-the-top of my head , because even if it did n't happen , it had such a huge impact -- if it * had * gone through , the uk would probably have lost and then the us would n't have been involved ( and possibly the ussr would have then stomped germany and eaten europe ... or germany would have eaten the ussr ) . 
  the [ eu constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_establishing_a_constitution_for_europe ) got shot down by you guys . 
  that was a meaningful set of referendums . 
  you 're saying that the fact that some content was pushed through in a non-referendum-visible form was the issue ? 
  we rate-limit refugee applications ( which is why obama can say `` we will accept n refugees '' ) , and afaik we just backlog the remainder . 
  i imagine that whatever germany 's backlog is , it 's less than the us 's remainder in terms of ratio of processed applications to applications . 
  i wonder what case history in the us on this is . 
  the 1951 refugee convention does n't actually place any bounds on how long a country can take to process a refugee . 
  you could either say `` well , that 's a loophole that effectively nullifies the ` unbounded refugee count ' guarantees '' or say `` the courts need to find some reasonable number and make that the limit '' . 
  still , i 'd imagine that this has come up legally before . 
  i do n't really think that having germany 's doors open as wide as they are is in germany 's interests , but i do n't think that that 's a good objection . 
  obviously she ca n't personally pay for all of them . 
  her responsibility * is * to represent germans . 
  she might do a bad job of it , but she * is * entrusted with the public 's pocketbook , and dipping into that is within her authority and is the norm for a leader . 
  i could see saying `` i am unhappy with the decisions you have made with the stewardship i 've granted you '' but not `` you are n't in a position to make decisions for germany '' . 
  eubtab : european union bureau of taxation and bombardment, 
  fine , but then presumably it 'd make sense to just zero the corporate tax rate and get your tax revenue from income tax . 
  otherwise , you 're just burning smaller companies without the scale to hire tax experts to try to figure out how to game the system , and there 's no reason to favor large companies over smaller companies . 
  banning per-company tax incentives might be a good idea in both the eu and the us , though i have no familiarity with the consensus of experts on them . 
  i doubt that it 's so much a competitive issue as that it seems kind of like asking for corruption -- e.g. 
  government official gives company a tax break , government official gets subsequently hired by company . 
  that just legally hands money from the public to the company and then provides a kickback . 
  maybe there are too many workarounds for this sort of thing to achieve the same effect to make such a ban meaningful , or maybe it 's possible to create targeted tax breaks that affect just one company , but if it * were * practical to block them , seems like it 'd be helpful . 
  i understand that the us has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world , but a far lower effective tax rate . 
   summary executions . 
  i do n't think that dropping a bomb on a camp of enemies in a broad conflict really qualifies as `` summary execution '' -- or if one chooses to define it that way , certainly i 'd say that much of the stigma attached to `` summary execution '' would vanish . 
    i 'm sure that france is n't saying `` yes , woohoo , we killed a frenchman ! '', 
    are you sure ? 
  just look at this thread . 
  `` woohoo , we killed a jihadist . '', 
  they 're simply not distinguishing between the french and the non-french . 
  well , normally you 'd notify the country in question and they 'd arrest and extradite the person in question , but even * if * the assad regime were willing to extradite , i doubt that it has the ability to arrest the person in question -- it 's seeing a civil war , and its goal would be to kill the people too . 
  so it 's not really as if the normal non-lethal alternatives are available . 
  i 'm sure that france is n't saying `` yes , woohoo , we killed a frenchman !, 
  '' , but there 's also a practical issue of there not being great alternative choices . 
  i suppose that in theory france could have sent infantry in with orders to capture said people , but now you very likely have a lot of french soldiers being killed , and it 's not clear that you could take whoever alive . 
  i doubt that 's preferable . 
  people get killed in conflict -- that 's just the way it works . 
  the people in question chose to insert themselves into the conflict . 
  if they had traveled to french forces and surrendered , i 'm sure that they would have been processed via the regular french justice system . 
  edit : also , i * think * that france probably ran into this in far greater scale in the [ algerian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algerian_war ) :  after world war ii , equality of rights was proclaimed by the ordonnance of march 7 , 1944 , and later confirmed by the loi lamine gu\u00e8ye of may 7 , 1946 , which granted french citizenship to all the subjects of france 's territories and overseas departments , and by the 1946 constitution . 
  the law of september 20 , 1947 , granted french citizenship to all algerian subjects , who were not required to renounce their muslim personal status . 
  [ 24 ] i 'm vaguely-assuming that killed fln soldiers were mostly french citizens , and that would have been north of 140k . 
  six is a pretty small drop in the barrel in relative terms . 
  turkey 's climate is presumably warmer . 
  i imagine that whatever one uses in a swedish winter requires better thermal insulation . 
  i 'll be interested to see whether , after federation , assuming that it happens , eu countries will be permitted to leave ( either 2 -  1 or 2 -  nothing ) at all .

  google does n't turn up anything on rules of engagement for [ operation inherent resolve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_inherent_resolve ) , so no idea if the us has been operating all along like that .

  i mean , germany can call for it , but i do n't see why that would impact countries that have it . 
  i do n't think that most countries place a lot of emphasis on what external country x thinks about their justice system . 
  it does n't really impact germany other than maybe via extradition issues , either . 
  and i doubt that germany would institute the death penalty if the us suggested that it was a good idea . 
  i do n't personally have a terribly-strong attachment to the death penalty , but i am very unimpressed with the arguments against it , which seem to focus on `` it * feels * wrong to me '' or vague statements about not being able to take back the death penalty ( not that one can give back time served or that this frequently comes up ) . 
  if i were dictator of the us , i 'd probably retain it , though i do n't think that it buys the country a lot -- i think that opposition to or support for the death penalty is mostly a [ red tribe/blue tribe signaling mechanism ] ( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/ ) .

  if you 're looking for something on the winter war , of the winter war books on my bookshelf : * [ * the hundred day winter war : finland 's gallant stand against the soviet army * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hundred-day-winter-war-finlands/dp/0700619100/ ) by gordon f. sander probably has the best description of what i 've read of the international and domestic finnish politics before and during the war . 
  it also tries to cover something of the public mood via media , responses in the arts and other discourse , particularly in the us . 
  it also covers a bit of the soviet politics and unofficial back-channels that were used . 
  the author has a bit of a bone to pick with the soviets . 
  it 's more like ... maybe kershaw writing about nazi germany ? 
  it lacks military maps and it 's difficult to get a good overall idea of what 's happening militarily in finland over the course of the war , but it does talk about public mood and politics quite a bit . 
  read if you 're interested in how countries or their public respond to war . 
  * [ * the mannerheim line 1920-39 : finnish fortifications of the winter war * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/mannerheim-line-1920-39-fortifications-fortress/dp/1846033845/ ) by bair irincheev is obviously more-focused . 
  this covers on the southern defenses ( and on the physical defenses themselves ) . 
  it also covers a bit of the conditions that the finnish troops dealt with . 
  it 's useful in understanding some how how finland held out with quite-limited resources in the area where the fight most-favored the soviets . 
  this provides some nice photography . 
  it 's not the first source i 'd read on the winter war , simply because of its degree of focus . 
  * [ * the winter war : russia against finland * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/winter-war-against-ballantines-illustrated/dp/0345028902/ ) by richard w. condon is a concise overview focusing on the military side of the war , covering the thing as a whole . 
  it also talks about some of the politics at the beginning and end of the war . 
  if you 've already read wikipedia 's material on the winter war and are interested more in the military side this is n't a bad book to try . 
  may feel a bit dry to some . 
  * [ * a frozen hell : the russo-finnish winter war of 1939-40 * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/frozen-hell-russo-finnish-winter-1939-1940/dp/1565122496/ ) by william r. trotter : gives a good overall picture of the war . 
  author is not terribly-enthusiastic about the soviets either , though he 's not as acidic as sander . 
  has military maps , but they 're sort of scattered , individual things dealing with particular battles -- i think that it 's be harder than with condon to get an idea of the overall progress of the war . 
  on the other hand , it 's very readable , and covers the political side as well as walking through important incidents .
