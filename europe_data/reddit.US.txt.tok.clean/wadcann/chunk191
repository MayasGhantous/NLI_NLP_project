  covers some of the russian politics as well . 
  it highlights important bits of the war in an anecdotal way . 
  good coverage of the action in the northern part of finland , and if you 're interested in that -- the point where finland really made phenomenal wins against the soviets with ridiculous odds -- this is the best source for that . 
  if i had to choose a single book to read , it 'd probably be this . 
  * [ * the winter war : the soviet attack on finland , 1939-1940 * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/winter-war-1939-1940-stackpole-military/dp/0811714012/ ) by eloise engle and lauri paananen talks about politics a fair amount , and covers the military conflict more at a high level . 
  it has few maps -- you wo n't get a good idea of what 's happening overall militarily , but does have anecdotes . 
    the only proper military of the eu . 
    france . 
  i 'd consider the uk military to be reasonably-important to operate independently of nato -- something which some people here have expressed a desire for -- unless the remaining eu members are going to shift more resources to their militaries . 
  i was [ just commenting with someone about sweden ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3o9rpi/conservative_swedish_party_votes_for_nato/cvvxkhz?context=3 ) 's situation as an eu-but-not nato member . 
  if there were a conflict today between sweden ( or finland ) and russia , the non-nato nature of the conflict would strip out the us , canada , norway , and turkey . 
  if the uk were to leave , it would be up to the remaining eu members to provide a response , of which the major military power is france and to a lesser degree germany . 
  the remaining eu would still have more people and a larger budget , but this would be starting to get into much-riskier territory . 
   they get the benefit of nato protection nato does not guarantee a response in the event of sweden , as a non-member , being attacked . 
  the eu does provide a common defense guarantee to members . 
  however , if the uk does leave the eu in its upcoming referendum , that will also eliminate the uk 's military obligation . 
  nato non-involvement strips out the us , canada , turkey , and norway . 
  that would reduce any response to that which would be driven by the remaining eu members , the major military power of which is france ( and to a lesser extent , germany ) . 
  in those situations , was it that european proposals conflicted with and were overridden by the us ? 
  that is , i understand that most eu members did n't want to fight in iraq ii and avoided doing so , but do you mean that it wanted to block the us from doing so and your concern was that it did n't have the ability to do so , or , alternately , block the uk ( or , i suppose , poland ) ? 
  was there an eu position on georgia or ukraine that the eu wanted to take that was interfered-with by the us ? 
  for ukraine , my understanding is that merkel wanted to take the economic sanctions route , and that 's what happened . 
  the ukraine conflict happened because the [ eu had been seeking to connect ukraine to the eu ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nsm14/reurope_im_in_favour_of_a_noninterventionist/cvqx6tq ) and russia objected violently ; as far as i know , us involvement has supported eu goals . 
  for georgia ... i 'm less familiar with that . 
  going through it , the us supported nato membership for georgia . 
  germany and france were opposed , and thus nato membership did n't happen . 
  there were [ different positions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war#reactions ) taken vis-a-vis the russian involvement in the war : * the us , uk , poland , hungary , and ukraine strongly-criticized russia . 
  * france and germany ( and thus the eu ) took a passive position . 
  * italy and belarus supported russia . 
  afaict , the eu 's position on the russo-georgian war was not interfered-with by the us -- is there something that you wanted the eu to do that the us caused problems with ? 
   the suez crisis is the most obvious example what would be some less-obvious examples ? 
  ah , that 's true -- soes have dropped way off , but they 're still more-substantial than many countries . 
  as are all groups , i suppose . 
  this is n't a border issue , but a `` once people are inside , they may simply not apply for asylum '' . 
  probably can make more money than being legal in a turkish refugee camp . 
  seems like a bad idea for syrians , though , since they 're getting permanent residency in sweden . 
   if anything , we are going to move to a two speed europe i think that there 's two related concepts -- `` two circle '' , where there 's never an implication that members must all wind up at the same point , and `` two speed '' , where some can take longer but ultimately they all must wind up in a federalized sort of environment . 
  if i understand correctly , cameron is proposing a `` two circle '' environment rather than a `` two speed '' . 
   oh , and all this also smells like ` merkel is the only one having a say in this ' . 
  not saying that that 's not a legitimate concern -- i see far more of chancellor merkel in international news than i do of juncker , even on points that i would have thought would really be eu concerns . 
  however ... to be blunt , i do n't see how the uk could be blamed for that . 
   ... france and germany ? 
  lol ... 
  the 2 countries no one in the world trusts . . hmm . 
  is this because germany invaded europe and france did n't honor its alliance with poland in world war ii , or is there something else behind this ? 
  i would have thought that volkswagen would have been delighted to finally knock out the bullshit [ chicken tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax ) ... 
  he was saying that there was n't something concrete to judge yet , and that anyone who had made up their mind had done so without seeing the agreement that was up for offer . 
   oh , nothing , it 's how things go : if europe wants to start 2 wars effectively burning itself to the ground , it 's natural the us becomes the undisputed power . 
  no , i 'm not saying `` that 's not justified '' , but rather asking what it is that you wanted europe to do that it was n't able to do . 
  i 'm asking seriously about it , because i really do n't know . 
  there was the suez crisis in 1956 , where the uk , france , and israel wanted to seize the [ suez canal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) from egypt ; this would have effectively relied on us cover to keep the soviets out , and the us instead sided with the soviets in terminating the occupation . 
  that 's the one really major difference that i know about off-the-cuff , where us policy interfered seriously with intended plans of european powers . 
  is that what you 're referring to ? 
   why does n't he ask the us the same thing ? 
  we 've been under its political and economical domination since the cold war and the only thing that made us even close to stand as equals is the eu . 
  not that i hate the us for it or anything . 
  what would you have done differently that did n't go the way you wanted ? 
   with particular protections for the city of london . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19761919  only three of the 63 clauses in the magna carta are still in law . 
  one defends the freedom and rights of the english church , another relates to the privileges enjoyed by the city of london and the third - the most famous - is generally held to have etablished the right to trial by jury . 
  clause 13 : the privileges of the city of london   the city of london shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and free customs , both by land and by water . 
  [ tradition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrobz_hzzuc ) continues [ onwards !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ropikze-c ), 
  well , that 's his starting point for negotiations , at any point . 
  edit : also , why are these so objectionable ? 
   forcing brussels to make `` an explicit statement '' that britain will be kept out of any move towards a european superstate . 
  this will require an exemption for the uk from the eu 's founding principle of `` ever closer union '' . 
  that 's the case for `` multiple circles '' anyway . 
  is it preferable for the eu to have uk out rather than uk not tightly-bound ? 
  if not , it 's probably in eu interests to say yes . 
   an `` explicit statement '' that the euro is not the official currency of the eu , making clear that europe is a `` multi-currency '' union . 
  ministers want this declaration in order to protect the status of the pound sterling as a legitimate currency that will always exist . 
  why is this such an issue ? 
  it 's already the case with the eu and the ez , right ? 
   a new `` red card '' system to bring power back from brussels to britain . 
  this would give groups of national parliaments the power to stop unwanted directives being handed down and to scrap existing eu laws . 
  the implementation here seems to determine everything . 
  could be huge , could be a nothingness . 
   a new structure for the eu itself . 
  the block of 28 nations must be reorganised to prevent the nine countries that are not in the eurozone being dominated by the 19 member states that are , with particular protections for the city of london . 
  again , seems like implementation is what matters here . 
  certainly , if there 's a route via which ez members could clobber non-ez eu members , one would object to that : if the ez could , say , levy taxes on non-ez member states in the eu at some point in the future , he 'd be asking for trouble down the line . 
  i assume that he 's talking about some sort of eu program that transfers money from germany to elsewhere in europe . 
  [ wikipedia : list of countries by tax revenue as percentage of gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_gdp ) germany is the twelfth-highest -- up there , but there are a few european countries that tax more-heavily : denmark , sweden , belgium , france , finland , norway , austria , italy , and bosnia and herzegovina . 
  < chuckle  the country run by the [ communist party of china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_china ) is way down at 17 % . 
  no you do n't . 
  that 's only in the us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_united_states  the 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the united states of america , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe  the number of stars does not vary according to the member states as they are intended to represent all the peoples of europe , even those outside the eu . 
  you get a time-share on part of a star . 
  probably cheaper , that way , though . 
  flag manufacturers in the us [ get to sell all-new flags every time the state number gets revised ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_flags_of_the_united_states#historical_progression_of_designs ) . 
  has n't changed since 1960 , though , so we 've had a bit of a drought recently , but you never know -- puerto rico has been officially trying to get added since 2012 , so maybe puerto rico will be accepted someday . 
   in your opinion , how much of a threat to security in europe does the migration really pose ? 
  i dunno about europe , but the [ us spends effort on screening refugees ] ( http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/02/237501.htm ) :  ... ensuring we admit refugees in a way that is safe and consistent with our national security interests is absolutely a priority . 
  that 's why the process can take months , if not longer . 
  and we have a lot of experience with this with afghanistan , with iraq , with somalia , and other places where the united states has taken refugees in from . 
  refugees are the most carefully vetted of all travelers to the united states . 
  every refugee under consideration for admission to the united states undergoes the same intensive security screening involving multiple federal intelligence , security , and law enforcement agencies . 
  these include the nctc [ the national counter-terrorism center ] , the terrorist screening center , the department of defense , the fbi . 
  this process includes a lengthy overseas in-person refugee determination and security screening interview conducted by specifically trained -- specially trained dhs officers .
