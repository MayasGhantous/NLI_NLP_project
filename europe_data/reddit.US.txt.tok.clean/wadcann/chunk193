  europe has a [ number of different `` circles '' already ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:supranational_european_bodies-en.png ) , and as far as i know , that structure has n't inherently caused any serious problems . 
  to clarify : * [ swinger ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/swinger ) : a person who practices swinging ( sex with different partners ) . 
  * [ swing state ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/swing_state ) : ( us , idiomatic , politics ) a state which may vote democratic or republican , in a given election or generally ; a purple state . 
  well , i 'm not sure what the specifics of what you 're concerned about are , but certainly france * is * free to impose whatever taxation it wants and proceed to use that or incentives funded by that to redistribute wealth within france . 
  i 'm not really an advocate of a lot of this , but no trade deal will restrict that . 
  note that unlike with , say , / u/savannajeff , i do n't have domain expertise in trade deals , and i have n't been following the specifics much ( other than some interest in the pdo negotiations ) . 
  this is ( necessarily ) a pretty high-level take . 
  if i have to go in-or-out based only on what i know ? 
  for . 
  my belief is that the negotiators in question on all sides are sufficiently-informed to make an arrangement that is positive for their country and have the domain expertise necessary to make the right decision . 
  if they sign off , i would n't in turn attempt to overrule . 
  unencumbered trade in general is good , and to the degree that this promotes this , it 's a plus . 
  in the past , marketing campaigns surrounding other free trade deals ( e.g. 
  nafta ) treated the thing like an apocalypse coming , which it was n't . 
  that tends to make me take a very dim view of material critical of trade deals . 
  if it turns out that i 'm completely wrong and it 's a terrible idea , then i 'm sure that we 'll withdraw . 
   sorry dude , this deal , done behind closed doors , is for big corporations . 
  all real deal-making is going to be done privately , because the members do n't really want to have to worry about the public image of every thing they say . 
  yeah , the us congress is televised , but people do n't arrange deals there -- that 's just where they do choreographed speeches and so forth . 
  they still sit down privately to do actual work , same as anyone else . 
   they have their own interests at heart , and do n't give a damn about you or me . 
  true , but a market expects and can accomodate that . 
   as a consumer , you wind up with monopolies , less choice , and higher prices . 
  generally-speaking , one would n't expect a larger market with more companies and consumers involved to see more monopolies or less choice ; it would be more-competitive than one split up into smaller , individual markets . 
  same thing for higher prices , as you would n't choose the more-expensive option for two competing products saying the same . 
   countries ( read , huge corporations that have bought off our politicians ) do very well with such deals . 
  this is true . 
  i 'm sure that some will benefit , and some are worse off . 
  the pie as a whole can be expected to be larger ( due to the above-referenced comparative advantage ) . 
   would n't this endager millions of jobs in countries with high cost of living ? 
  yes -- and not merely those in countries with high costs of living , but in any country . 
  any time that the environment shifts significantly -- e.g. 
  a new technological breakthrough happens , or someone discovers a new resource , or , as here , a trade deal is made such that previous barriers to trade go away -- it is very likely that the optimal thing to produce will change . 
  as production changes , jobs are lost . 
  the flip side of that is that production in other areas will increase , and this will translate to creation of jobs in those areas . 
  export-oriented industries will tend to benefit . 
  trade is , at the end of the day , zero-sum , barring efficiency gains . 
  for france to import one euro worth of something that it had previously not imported , it will also have to export one euro worth of something that it had previously not exported . 
  to the extent that businesses and consumers are affected , trade is advantageous to both for the same reason : it leverages [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) . 
  as a consumer , i wind up with a broader range of products available -- i can get french cheese . 
  it means that i can get labor-intensive products manufactured in china more cheaply than i could if they were made in the us . 
  countries that have engaged in trade have generally done well , and countries that have isolated themselves , like ... oh , north korea , have n't . 
  [ ttip is disadvantageous to russia ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/11/19/vladimir-putin-hates-the-ttip/ ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that that was / r/polandball 's / u/dickrhino , and he 's swedish . 
  edit : yeah , it was part of the [ britain pleays stay !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2onq4h/contest_thread_britain_pleays_stay/ ) monthly contest , called `` our travesty '' . 
   leaving a continent is complicated eh , you guys made it out of eurasia . 
   the goal is to create something indisputable that could be posted on reddit and get not a single `` correction '' . 
  if you keep it solid and factual , that sounds good to me . 
  good for the debate as a whole , since it places focus on facts . 
  keep in mind that being factual alone does not mean that something is not open to a counter-argument : it 's possible to omit factual information that does not support a case . 
  for example , let 's say that i have a statistic saying that in the past , immigrants to country x have committed crime at n times the rate of the population as a whole ; however , i omit the fact that immigrants to country y have committed crime at a very different m times the rate . 
  my information there is entirely correct , but it is incomplete , and it might give a different picture from that of the whole . 
  you might also consider simply having the thing be open-contribution , a la wikipedia -- the downside being spam , but the upside being that your material is likely to be more solid . 
  i smell reality show potential . 
   considering the gas prices i would n't care if my car ran on ground up puppies and kittens as long as i got better fuel consumption and paid less at the pump for it . 
  [ i 've got great news for you ] ( https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/05/diesel-vs-biodiesel-vs-vegetable-oil/index.htm ) :  developed from vegetable or animal fats , biodiesel is functionally identical to petroleum diesel ... just got ta render kitties . 
   let 's encourage you to do the same estimation for the 9/11 ? 
  i have -- in fact , that 's where i started using that same example . 
  other news sources did as well , but it was well after the fact -- we lacked perspective , and a lot of people were panicking over something that was n't a huge risk to them . 
  whatever heuristic we use to judge how dangerous things are does n't work terribly well when the numbers of people are very large and when one of the more-unlikely risks is heavily-highlighted by the media . 
  five million people live in ankara . 
  if ~ 130 were injured and ~ 20 killed , that gives her about one chance in 33,333 of being involved . 
  in turkey , about [ one person in every 7692 is killed annually in a ] ( http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_traffic/countrywork/tur/en/ ) traffic accident -- worse odds , and and i 'm ignoring injuries here . 
  if you 're not worrying about car crashes , i would n't worry about bombings . 
  it 's [ about two-thirds the size of what you 're used to ] ( http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/how-big-is-a-house ) . 
   well i think it is really really dangerous to have a provision that says : `` you ca n't change this provision '' . 
  this goes against the basic concept of how constitutions and how democracy work . 
  on a related note , the [ rule against perpetuities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rule_against_perpetuities ) is a legal doctrine that prevents people writing up wills from placing conditions that last longer than a certain amount of time after their death -- the idea being that they could n't foresee what the future would be like -- for example , a hundred years ago , someone might require that someone must farm the family farm for n years and have no idea that almost nobody would be farming today . 
  same sorts of issues seem to come up with the [ eternity clause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eternity_clause ) . 
   the right to asylum is one very fundamental value , and dropping it would mean throwing out of the window those last bits of dignity the eu still has . 
  i suppose that 's hard to measure -- kinda subjective -- but i think that you 'll find that it really would not be on the radar twenty years later . 
  or , preferably , find and submit other interesting articles . 
  fwiw , to those not familiar with the '' [ the constitution is not a suicide pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_constitution_is_not_a_suicide_pact ) '' term -- it 's from us constitutional law . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3letf0/eli5_what_did_merkel_actually_say_about_germany/  she said that europe 's so-called dublin rules , which require migrants to apply for asylum in the first european union country they arrive , are not working . 
    http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/03/us-europe-migrants-germany-iduskcn0r31wp20150903   because of that , germany announced that it would take in refugees from syria regardless of where they first enter the eu . 
    first it was n't an official announcement , it was the german federal office for migration and refugees ( bamf ) that has issued internal instructions suspending the dublin procedure in respect of syrian nationals that went public somehow . 
    http://www.asylumineurope.org/news/24-08-2015/germany-halt-dublin-procedures-syrians   after that became public , merkel made her statement . 
   the last month of 2014 were riddled with stress from the vatmoss changes that i had to complete on js bin . 
  it took weeks to try to fully understand vatmoss , and what exactly would be required to satisfy requirements . 
  sounds like there 's a lucrative market for someone to handle europe-wide billing/vat . 
  the us border patrol probably has the [ 3.1 mm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexico%e2%80%93united_states_border ) mexican border as a primary concern , but there 's also the [ 8.9 mm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada%e2%80%93united_states_border ) canadian border . 
  i assume that the ocean borders , aside from maybe the carribean , with people fleeing cuba or smuggling drugs , are easier on the us side . 
  the eu has [ 13.5 mm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geography_of_the_european_union ) land borders , which is roughly-comparable to the us . 
  some of that is with norway , which i assume is not a huge concern , kinda like the us-canada border . 
  i agree that the mediterranean is a lot more-complicated than the us on the atlantic and pacific , but i do n't know whether the eu faces a radically-different problem on the whole . 
  i still like the idea of requiring shipping in the med to carry a device that send out cryptographically-signed beacons every now and then , and if a ship shows up on radar that is n't broadcasting within a certain distance of european coastline , to go check it out . 
  aircraft already do something like this ( well , unfortunately sans the cryptographic signing bit ... ), 
   but each state would `` retain control over the management of the external borders of its territory , '' according to the source . 
  there will be * some * sort of influence that frontex will get , since someone has to decide , say , which country guards are sent to . 
  but if you do n't have the ability to move guards around , you do lose a substantial amount of efficiency , since you have to stuff guards on every border all the time and it 's harder to adapt to increased demands at one point or another on the schengen periphery . 
  also , you * could * just have core countries pay into a pool and have that sent directly to border countries , but aside from that or a frontex-run border guards thing , you are stuck with a positive externality where core countries benefit from border guards in border countries but do n't pay . 
  finally , it seems to me that schengen * non * - border countries already effectively gave up a lot of control over their borders in joining schengen , by fully opening borders -- that seems more-concerning to the country in question than what the countries on the * exterior * of schengen would face . 
  i 'm not following -- are you saying that the us is trying to get turkey to encourage illegal immigration to the eu rather than hanging onto them ? 
  turkey 's hanging onto more refugees than all of europe put together at the moment . 
  some do get through , but just as in greece and italy it seems likely that turkey has no realistic way to hang onto everyone , much less desire to do so . 
  nor does it buy the us anything to have refugees running around in europe . 
  the taliban [ did something similar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buddhas_of_bamiyan ) . 
  i 'm not sure that destroying symbols of a religion is necessarily effective at obliterating it -- that rather , it 's the social structures around the religion that give it sustenance . 
  the destruction of the temple in jerusalem did not destroy judaism , for example .
