  i do n't * quite * have the kind of aversion to the loss of cultural artifacts that some others do , but their presence does n't seem to cause much harm to me , and some people might enjoy looking at them . 
  maybe someone will develop some new technique in the future to study them and will get more information than we were able to get . 
  it takes a long time to produce a very old structure , so it 's nice , at least for the sake of posterity 's entertainment , to hang onto the oldest ones : after all , we 're glad that the pyramids in egypt still exist . 
   feels like closing the stable after the horse has ran i disagree . 
  that phrase is used to refer to a solution that is now useless , because its value is gone . 
  this will be a long-term concern , and not one limited to even the present crises . 
  it 's true that there are * already * people illegally floating around europe and it does n't catch everyone , but that does n't mean that it does n't have value . 
   before anyone comment here , i 'd like to stress that this is not a meta-search engine hmm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qwant#criticism  shortly after the release , many observers expressed doubts about the nature of qwant . 
  according to them , qwant is not really a search engine but simply a website aggregating results of other search engines like bing and the `` qnowledge graph '' is only the content of wikipedia . 
  [ 6 ] the company has rejected the reports and assert that they do have their own web crawler and use other search engines for semantic indexing related purposes . 
  [ 7 ] curious . 
  not that that 's inherently a concern to me -- unless you 're worried about google and friends de-anonymizing search queries , it does n't seem like it 's a huge cost , but since you mentioned it explicitly ... 
  personal , or for russia ? 
  that seems like a pretty ineffective way to try to change national policy . 
  i would argue against that as well , but that 's still not applicable , as per the article :  the rule was all the more surreal he said , as it applied to the bakery itself not its employees , who were all given two days a week off . 
   i merely pointed out how ridiculous it is to make an argument that someone should work their ass off 7 days a week so you can have the minor convenience of being able to get fresh bread on a sunday after 12 o ' clock . 
  if someone likes the exchange of time for money , why are you overruling them and saying that they * can not * accept that deal ? 
  if it turns out that people are hell-bent on not working during that period of time , then it will wind up reflected in pay : an employer will have to pay sufficiently to attract enough workers who will work during those times . 
   `` in god we trust '' came about during the red scare older than that . 
  [ `` in god we trust '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_god_we_trust ) as an official term was a american civil war phenomenon . 
  the red scare just re-popularized it . 
  also , in the us , blasphemy laws existed until scotus ruled that they were unconstitutional in [ * joseph burstyn , inc. v. wilson * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_burstyn,_inc._v._wilson ) in 1952 . 
  that 's not all that long ago -- certainly there are people walking around now who were adults when those laws were in force . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law_in_the_republic_of_ireland  in the republic of ireland , blasphemy is required to be prohibited by article 40.6.1 . i. 
  of the 1937 constitution . 
  the common law offence of blasphemous libel , applicable only to christianity and last prosecuted in 1855 , was ruled in 1999 to be incompatible with the constitution 's guarantee of religious equality . 
  the lacuna was filled in 2009 by a new offence of `` publication or utterance of blasphemous matter '' , against any religion . 
  the continued existence of a blasphemy offence is controversial , with proponents of freedom of speech and freedom of religion arguing it should be removed . 
   it wo n't have your name attached to it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-anonymization http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/12/securitymatters_1213 that 's not necessarily a sufficiently-strong guarantee to ensure anonymity . 
  well , here 's a list of other concerns : ** race ** dna exposes race . 
  if hitler had had himself a nice genetic database to work with , he would have been in a rather-easier position to identify undesirables . 
  ** families ** this * may * not inherently be a concern , but the us maintains a dna database of criminals ... however , some people have objected to creep of its scope in that unlike fingerprints , if you have dna of a relative , you can identify unknown dna as being , for example , that of a child . 
  ** parentage ** dna exposes relationships . 
  if you 're adopted or your mother slept with someone other than your father to produce you , someone with the database can determine that , even if you do n't know . 
  ** genetic discrimination ** some people are concerned about the prospect of people being filtered for employment or insurance or other things based on their genes ; this conflicts with their idea of people having a sorta-kinda-equal starting place in life . 
  if something like this leaks , it might mean that someone who has some form of genetic predisposition to disease might have a hard time marrying . 
  i do n't know -- there are things that i think are very legit concerns surrounding dna databases , and it 's hard to `` take it back '' once that data 's been recorded . 
  i still think that there 's not enough political impetus to block them and they do have interesting uses , so i suspect that countries are going to tend to go ahead with them . 
  i do think that it 's interesting that the government will be able to determine which children are illegitimate or adopted , even if the children themselves do not know , as well as ( potentially ) their parents . 
  i 'm also worried about it leaking , even if you absolutely trust the government . 
  i mean , the us federal background check database , probably one of the most-sensitive things that the us might want to protect , got swiped by the chinese recently ; if that could go , presumably so could a dna database . 
  i laughed when i first learned that the spanish fisherman who pointed them in the right direction towards the bomb claimed salvage rights ( and apparently got something out of it ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_palomares_b-52_crash#weapons_recovery  once the bomb was located , sim\u00f3 orts appeared at the first district federal court in new york city with his lawyer , herbert brownell , formerly attorney general of the united states under president dwight d. eisenhower , claiming salvage rights on the recovered hydrogen bomb . 
  according to craven : [ 19 ]    `` it is customary maritime law that the person who identifies the location of a ship to be salved has the right to a salvage award if that identification leads to a successful recovery . 
  the amount is nominal , usually 1 or 2 percent , sometimes a bit more , of the intrinsic value to the owner of the thing salved . 
  but the thing salved off palomares was a hydrogen bomb , the same bomb valued by no less an authority than the secretary of defense at $ 2 billion -- each percent of which is , of course , $ 20 million . '', 
    the air force settled out of court for an undisclosed sum . 
  if she 's truly taking unpopular decisions , is n't the normal route in a parliamentary system to have a vote of no confidence ? 
  what would merit asking for a resignation ? 
  i do n't think that 's the case . 
  it would be visible and objectionable , and if the chancellor wanted skilled immigration it would be vastly-easier and create less political turmoil to just expand germany 's skilled worker program . 
  `` some '' is not a very strong statement -- all you have to do is find two people in a crowd . 
  polls are a lot more interesting than anecdotes , since they give more information about what the whole believe . 
  in the turn-of-the-20th-century us environment , people tended to get more-unhappy over time . 
  i 'm doubtful that this is a flash in the pan ( but , hey , we 'll see ) . 
  on the other hand , turkey is correct in that their hosting refugees costs them , benefits the eu , and is something that turkey could stop doing . 
  it or something similar makes sense for at the least schengen members -- it means that internal members are responsible for also handling the schengen border and buys the eu flexibility in moving guards where they are most-needed . 
  it does mean that the government can identify even people who are not in the database via determining their databased parents or siblings from their dna . 
  i think that , barring something like a holocaust that makes this overwhelmingly taboo , it 's probably likely to wind up happening around the world , though -- there 's too much useful in terms of controlling population , addressing crime , public health , and so forth that can be done with it . 
  it remains to be seen whether this will escalate to unfriending on facebook . 
  so , are eu cafeterias going to start serving bugs ? 
  russia has no reason to attack iran and very good reasons to avoid doing so . 
  i 'll believe that it was an accident . 
  edit : this does not mean that i am not going to poke fun at russian missile systems over this , mind . 
  ;-) i am just far , far , far more willing to blame incompetence than malice here . 
   she does not represent the german majority hmm . 
  it sounds plausible to me , but is there a poll or something showing this ? 
  unless you 're going to condemn pretty much all religion , i do n't agree . 
  there are moderate and even not-particularly-religious muslims . 
  i agree that the `` fringe '' goes into very extreme territory , but not that there are n't moderate muslims . 
  a good day for argentina . 
  http://www.andreolisa.com.ar/popcorn.html  argentina is the largest world exporter of unpopped popcorn and the second producer behind the united states ,, 
  thanks . 
  some is what i expect , and some is a surprise . 
   common agricultural policy , my vague understanding , perhaps incorrect , was that the agricultural subsidies existed as a temporary step to obtain political support from small farmers as europe moved away from small farms and that this would be expected to change over the long term . 
   i am concerned both about future changes of the status quo . 
  that 's fair -- that 's actually one concern i had about people trying to `` unofficially '' move things towards a closer union , since even if people do n't have an issue with the policy itself , the idea that they were n't able to sign up for it is concerning . 
  i was surprised that fiscal policy was n't raised -- the impression i got was that the uk tended to be fiscally-right of the eu , and i thought that this would have been a worry . 
  in particular , finance is important in the uk , and someone ( perhaps you ) were talking about eu policy changes that would be disadvantageous to the uk finance industry . 
   national democracy is undermined . 
  i 'm not totally sure what that means , but do you similarly feel that , say , a mainland european country or a us state would also have made a bad decision in their organizations because of the loss of local control ? 
   i think `` lone uk '' sounds a bit drastic . 
  i was n't intending to load it , just to contrast it with a `` maintain status quo '' or a `` establish tighter commonwealth ties '' approach . 
   the uk is still going to be part of the un , the unsc , the commonwealth , nato and many other international organisations . 
  yes , but ( a ) the commonwealth might become less-influential over time , and i strongly suspect that if the eu establishes an eu army and gains the clear ability to handle russia , that nato will tend to wither ( arguably to the disinterest of nato-but-non-eu countries like turkey ... )  i think this is a somewhat farfetched risk . 
  it is rare for democracies to go to war . 
  i think this risk is about on the same level as the risk of a canada v usa war or an australia v new zealand war . 
  well ... the us * did * invade canada that one time . 
  i was thinking more that historically , a military concern for the uk was a united , hostile continent and that an `` eu with uk out '' makes that potentially closer . 
  in july , the russian navy was demonstrating its missile capabilities and had a [ failure ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77j4gezvnwa ) . 
  i 've no idea what the politics involved look like , but i would imagine that the navy probably would rather not leave that as the most-recent public impression to make . 
  at the end of the day , credibility of a military service is also worth something . 
  ` sides , i do n't think anyone is going to be winning awards on cost-effectiveness here . 
  this article is n't really about the pros and cons of immigration . 
  it 's talking about the effectiveness of the eu governance in the current situation . 
  i 'm not convinced that said prince knew or had any interest in the statue being covered . 
  i recall reading at one point china banned magazines talking about the ongoing scandal of clinton getting a blowjob ; clinton was about to visit beijing . 
  the goal was supposedly to avoid upsetting him . 
  if that was the goal , i doubt that clinton would have supported it and probably did not know about it in advance .
