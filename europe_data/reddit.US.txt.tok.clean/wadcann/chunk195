  i thought that the eu held [ some sort of vote ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34331126 ) and that was where the authority came from .

  `` illegal immigrant '' is such a common term over here for someone violating immigration law that i did n't put a lot of thought into it . 
  i do n't think it 's that controversial , though -- the bbc , for example uses `` migrant '' as a generic to include anyone who has n't been granted refugee status yet . 
  it 's certainly in-line with the generic sense of the term : migrant \\ mi `` grant \\ , n. 1 . 
  a migratory bird , person , or other animal . 
  a person who changes residence frequently in search of employment , especially farm labor , such as harvesting crops seasonally ; also called { migrant laborer } or { migrant worker } . 
  sometimes the migrant worker is not a resident of the country in which the work is performed . 
  [ pjc ] i 'm comfortable with the term as-used . 
   hidden law system they use huh ? 
   1.5 million will come this year alone , with family reunification this is easily 3-4 million in a single year . 
  some of those wo n't be accepted . 
     in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations . 
  in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education . 
  how about second generation ? 
   while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family . 
  is that an inherent negative ? 
  it obviously has a substantial cost in living standards , but if that family is willing to pay the income hit ... that 's a potential right-wing answer to bringing europe 's low fertility levels up to a sustainable level , since the dropoff in birthrates was associated with moving women out of the home . 
  i 'm not convinced that it 's the * best * one , but it 's plausible that it would work . 
  and it 's far from clear that that tradition will persist across multiple generations , anyway . 
   `` a rejection [ of taking refugees in ] as a matter of principle , that is -- excuse me for being that blunt -- that 's a danger for europe , '' merkel said . 
  why ? 
   `` the refugees wo n't be stopped if we just build fences . 
  that i 'm deeply convinced of , and i 've lived behind a fence for long enough , '' she said . 
  i agree with that in the literal sense -- physically stopping people with fences alone is not going to work -- but not in the longer-term , abstract sense of people moving to europe . 
  europe * does * have the ability to choose whether to accept large numbers of people from conflicts around the world : national borders and legal rights to work and so forth are not meaningless , the state utterly ineffectual . 
  in merkel 's case , the fence was established to keep her from leaving by a rotten-to-the-core political structure that ultimately fell apart . 
  the factor that broke down the berlin wall was that people on both sides wanted to merge and only a few authorities were trying to keep people in . 
  i do n't think that it 's apt to compare it to choosing to keep large population movements from the rest of the world , wherever they come from , out . 
  i am not going to try to claim that it is necessarily * bad * for the eu to do this ( though i think that there are serious costs ) . 
  however , i do not agree with the idea that the choice is a non-choice , that practicality makes it impossible . 
  russia [ stomped the eu 's diplomatic initiative ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nsm14/reurope_im_in_favour_of_a_noninterventionist/cvqx6tq ) on ukraine . 
  in response , the eu and the us and friends imposed [ a steadily increasing number of sanctions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sanctions_during_the_ukrainian_crisis ) , alone probably not enough to change russia 's mind . 
  at this time , saudi arabia , a us-aligned larger oil producer than russia , abruptly decided to crash the world oil market via massive production , a decision which was rather expensive for them ( and badly hammered oil producers , like russia , and aided oil consumers , like most of europe ) . 
  [ they also made some rather strong statements ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/22/news/economy/saudi-arabia-oil-production/ ) about continuing to keep world oil prices forced down :  `` if they want to cut production they are welcome , we are not going to cut , and certainly saudi arabia is n't going to cut , '' al-naimi said . '', 
  [ that ] position we will hold forever , not [ just ] 2015 . '', 
  at the moment , saudi arabia is shifting wealth to most european countries and hammering russia economically . 
  trying to make life difficult for the government there may not be in eu interests , particularly if whoever would replace the regime there would be less pleasant . 
  sure , i 'm not promoting the idea that the eu should take in more people than it has , and i equally agree that it 's a bad idea to create bad incentives . 
  it 's just that the eu should not have some countries saying `` yes , we love taking people in ... you just have to get to us first '' to try to cap the refugee count without the diplomatic awkwardness of revising a treaty or ignoring it , then route people through other countries . 
  that creates problems for the transit countries in that they wind up with far more people than their own policies would actually draw in , and it seems to me understandable for them to be aggrieved . 
  certainly it seems reasonable for them to want the bad incentives to be cut off and something to be done ( deportation not denied them , redistribution in europe , etc ) of some of the extra people who wound up in their country because of the policies that established a pull factor . 
  i apologize on the echr -- i 'm a little fuzzy on the relationship between the council of europe and the eu . 
  certainly eu members * are * members of the council of europe , though . 
  the current approach had been putting pain on greece and italy , though it 's convenient for other members . 
  my point is that it 's obviously more-than-a-bit divisive if countries in the eu use greece and italy as buffers to soak up problems . 
  i 'm not advocating that the eu should take in gobs of refugees -- personally , i think that that is probably not in the eu 's interests , and that establishing caps would be a good idea . 
  however , saying `` not my problem '' yet having the euhcr fine italy for [ attempting to deport people ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/court-fines-italy-for-deporting-migrants-to-libya/a-15761455 ) is the eu punishing italy for trying to block off its own borders ; then refusing to let italy unload any refugees within the eu is to force the problem into italy . 
  while i can understand the term `` solidarity '' being overused , it seems very difficult for me to swallow that the eu should in any way require or pressure italy and greece to take in refugees , but refuse to also accept refugees among other members as well . 
  providing at least english instructions would have been nice , so that i do n't have to guess as to sources . 
  the 1,472 % increase statistic appears to be from the [ gatestone institute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gatestone_institute ) , a us zionist organization that appears to be annoyed with muslims because they conflict with israel . 
  anyway , re : the specifics :  in 1975 , the swedish parliament unanimously decided to change the former homogeneous sweden into a multicultural country . 
  forty years later the dramatic consequences of this experiment emerge : violent crime has increased by 300 % . 
    if one looks at the number of rapes , however , the increase is even worse . 
  in 1975 , 421 rapes were reported to the police ; in 2014 , it was 6,620 . 
  that is an increase of 1,472 % . 
  my understanding is that sweden uses a metric that tends to be rather expansive when it comes to rape , and that how this is measured changed as well : http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372  `` so , for instance , when a woman comes to the police and she says my husband or my fiance raped me almost every day during the last year , the police have to record each of these events , which might be more than 300 events . 
  in many other countries it would just be one record - one victim , one type of crime , one record . '', 
  [ snip ]  `` but the major explanation is partly that people go to the police more often , but also the fact that in 2005 there has been reform in the sex crime legislation , which made the legal definition of rape much wider than before . '', 
  that does n't attempt to quantify the impact or say that it 's fully-explained by this , but it is significant -- the timespan over which this change happened was from 1975 and included changes in measurement as well . 
  as far as i can tell from citations that i found poking around on the internet , the 77.6 % number is from an image generated somewhere ; it claims to refer to `` non-swedes '' rather than muslims , and the statistic is claimed to come from [ a swedish organization called br\u00e5 ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/rape-and-sex-offences.html ) . 
  i was unable to find that actual statistic on a skim of the bra.se site , including searching the site for material related to `` swedish origin '' . 
  it is possible that it exists , but only in swedish-language content , where i can not find it , but at the moment , i ca n't find an original source for it ; i do n't think that it 's supportable . 
  as an aside , note that the swedish rape measurements have apparently been a source of some discussion , and the br\u00e5 site itself talks about sweden 's measurements :  the number of reported sexual offences has increased in sweden over the last decade . 
  the increase is mainly due to a general rise in people 's tendency to report crime and the changes in legislation that have led to more crimes now being viewed as rape . 
    a new sexual offences legislation came into force in 2005 , which meant that some actions that were previously classed as sexual exploitation are now classed as rape . 
  the changes in the legislation resulted in a decrease in reported sexual coercion and exploitation , whereas the number of reported rapes have increased . 
  as of july 1 , 2013 , further changes were made to the legislation in order to broaden the term rape to also include cases where the victim reacted with passivity . 
  a woman who does n't actually actively refuse sex and simply fails to consent is not normally considered to be a rape victim elsewhere ]   however , there is reason to believe that certain types of sexual offences really have increased over the last thirty years , much due to changes in society , such as contact with strangers via the internet , more bars and pubs and increased alcohol consumption . 
  finally according to wikipedia , as of 2009 , [ the 2 % of sweden is muslim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_sweden ) statement is probably roughly correct -- two measurements are given , one ( ~ 1 % ) probably on the low side and one ( ~ 4 % ) probably on the high side . 
  in summary : * the 1,472 % increase exists , but is an increase since 1975 , and what appear to be the responsible organizations primarily attribute this to changes in measurement . 
  * i can not find an original source for the 77.6 % of all rapes in sweden being done by muslims claim . 
  * the 2 % of the population claim is probably more-or-less in line with what i could find . 
  as an aside , i 'd note that while a lot of people reference rape in regards to the immigration to scandinavia i 've [ only seen one particularly interesting statistic ] ( http://finlandtoday.fi/how-the-rape-in-tapanila-started-an-outrage-against-somalis-in-finland/ ) , which was that somalis in finland did rape at a level about three times that of the population as a whole . 
  that looks real , though it 's worth pointing out that the numbers involved were not large ( and iirc last time i looked at this , it looked like it was at least partly-explained by the fact that the somalis were disproportionately young men , who disproportionately commit rape in other populations as well ) . 
  well , that and it 's not just that the us provides fewer state-funded services , but that the us does n't provide much by way of welfare for illegal immigrants in the us at all . 
  as per the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , a country that grants refugee status to someone is required to provide the same welfare that it provides citizens :  article 23 . 
    public relief   the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals . 
   we know on the positive side that migration can boost economies this wording comes up a lot . 
  sure , if you add another person to the mix , you 're likely going to generate some form of economic activity . 
  however , that 's probably not terribly-interesting to most compared to per-capita measurements . 
  i think that few people in europe would be delighted to be suddenly transplanted to a desperately-poor-but-populous country elsewhere in the world . 
  would you please link to the source for those statistics ? 
  well ... central americans who migrate to the us have n't been catastrophic . 
  while mexico does rather better on the [ un education index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index ) , el salvador is barely above syria . 
  granted , the us/eu welfare difference may be significant here , but ... 
  i 'd think that a bigger issue than syria is eritrea , which is also a significant source of migrants to the eu and is second-to-last on the index , ahead of only niger . 
  pakistan is also a large source ( though i 'm not sure how many have been getting accepted ) and is only a few slots up . 
   and she could not hit him with 24 rounds fired at him . 
  i 'm not saying that there 's no difference between the sexes in marksmanship , but i 'm really not terribly concerned that women can not shoot , regardless of what happened in that particular case . 
  there might be legitimate issues if needing to use brute force , like wrestling someone down , but i doubt that those are typically insurmountable . 
  as long as whatever qualifying standards in place apply to both sexes ( e.g. 
  need to run n meters in s seconds with k kilos of gear ) and are applicable to evaluating ability , it seems tough to complain . 
  read the article . 
  they tried to swim in the calais port to a boat to get across the channel , not swim the channel . 
   like do not open the door to migrants , do not invite them , do n't say `` to the whole world , please come to europe '' . 
  chancellor merkel did n't do that . 
  i 'm not sure that argument-by-metaphor works very well .
