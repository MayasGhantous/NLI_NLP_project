  that simply asserts that the eu is fundamentally not-repairable for whatever it is that you 're upset about . 
  it seems to me that if uk does n't want to have a ton of refugees -- not unreasonable -- that it 's reasonable to expect the uk not to shuffle refugees onto italy and greece , as has been happening . 
  i mean , i certainly understand where you 're coming from , but in that case , the uk can hardly take the `` italy and greece make convenient dumping grounds so that we can avoid having to reform the 1951 refugee convention '' position . 
   watching this video well , i mean , the guy 's a career politician who is aiming for anti-eu opinion . 
  he should be making a compelling argument against . 
  if you go dig up some pro-eu guy , he 'll probably have all sorts of positive things to say . 
  i doubt that mr. farage was ever a huge merkel advocate . 
  just the nature of their political positions . 
   if germany is doing nothing , people call for germany to do something . 
  if it decides to do something , the same people complain about the allmighty germany trying to change everything . 
  you left out the * third * fun bit of being in a position of leadership -- when you actually do something , you get blamed for the long-term fallout of everything that happens . 
  < shrug  [ washington dc is majority black ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_washington,_d.c . ) . 
  i bet that the phenomenon is more-common than you 'd think , if you assume that the capital tends to be a cosmopolitan place and destination for a lot of people from abroad . 
  it 's also a way to get money via government employment -- the government will probably deal with a lot of money , so it 's probably an economic destination as well . 
  i 'd bet that national capitals probably have demographics that substantially-vary from some hypothetical `` average city '' in a country . 
  [ those are n't * true * scotsmen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) . 
  it 's not in the article , but i favor the idea of movable type being a critical factor . 
  movable type was when let cheap , non-oral-tradition information be stored . 
  east asia had * printing * since long before europe , but the languages there had huge numbers of `` letters '' -- that was n't amenable to having a bin of letters to pick from to construct a sheet , then print en-masse . 
  as a result , europe wound up movable type and east asia had to go without . 
  the real divergence also started around the time when gutenberg 's press showed up , which was when people started being able to mass-produce written material for everyone . 
  well , if they 're given refugee status , the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) prohibits withholding or limiting welfare ; full welfare given citizens must be extended :  article 23 . 
    public relief   the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals . 
  ... even if they are illegal immigrants :  article 31 . 
    refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge   1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  that being said , i 'm nitpicking on doctrine -- presumably someone being deported also is n't going to be someone with refugee status . 
  there 's also substantial agricultural work in those states . 
   although , even in texas ranchers can not just shoot them . 
  not deadly force unless they stole something and are in the process of running away with it or are spraying graffiti at night or something like that , at any rate . 
  it 's legal to use non-deadly force against trespassers in texas , though .

  protection of one 's own property . 
    ( a ) a person in lawful possession of land or tangible , movable property is justified in using force against another when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to prevent or terminate the other 's trespass on the land or unlawful interference with the property . 
    ( b ) a person unlawfully dispossessed of land or tangible , movable property by another is justified in using force against the other when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to reenter the land or recover the property if the actor uses the force immediately or in fresh pursuit after the dispossession and :   ( 1 ) the actor reasonably believes the other had no claim of right when he dispossessed the actor ; or   ( 2 ) the other accomplished the dispossession by using force , threat , or fraud against the actor .

  deadly force to protect property . 
  a person is justified in using deadly force against another to protect land or tangible , movable property :   ( 1 ) if he would be justified in using force against the other under section 9.41 ; and   ( 2 ) when and to the degree he reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary :   ( a ) to prevent the other 's imminent commission of arson , burglary , robbery , aggravated robbery , theft during the nighttime , or criminal mischief during the nighttime ; or   ( b ) to prevent the other who is fleeing immediately after committing burglary , robbery , aggravated robbery , or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property ; and   ( 3 ) he reasonably believes that :   ( a ) the land or property can not be protected or recovered by any other means ; or   ( b ) the use of force other than deadly force to protect or recover the land or property would expose the actor or another to a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury .

   while member states are primarily responsible for carrying out returns , the immediate creation of a dedicated return office within frontex should enable it to scale up its support to member states in order , inter alia , to facilitate , organise and fund return operations . 
  frontex 's current budget is , according to wikipedia , $ 89m . 
  [ us ice enforcement and removal operations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._immigration_and_customs_enforcement ) has a [ budget of $ 2.9 b ] ( https://www.ice.gov/factsheets/budget2012 ) , or about 30 times that of frontex , and deports about 438k/year -- which may be rather less than what frontex is staring at . 
  ero also has a mature workflow , whereas frontex is going to have an administrative nightmare to deal with in trying to coordinate all of this new stuff . 
  whatever frontex does , definitely it 's going to need substantial involvement from existing immigration agencies in many countries . 
  i do n't envy [ fabrice leggeri ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/about-frontex/organisation/executive-director/ ) , frontex 's top guy . 
  it 's not the same thing in that in the us , the state borders are irrelevant ; national borders in europe are quite meaningful for refugees . 
   marine le pen , the front national leader , addressed mr hollande as `` vice chancellor , administrator of the province of france '' . 
  mr farage said france was `` little more than a pipsqueak '' in a `` totally german-dominated europe '' . 
  odd bedfellows , yet they certainly seem to get along well . 
   i do n't know who you are but me and you are enemies someone posted something about [ blue tribes and red tribes ] ( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/ ) a while back . 
  while i think that it was longer than it needed to be to make its point , it 's got some interesting insights . 
   but do n't cars generally produce more pollution when driven at a lower speed ? 
  http://www.ce.nl/publicatie/why_slower_is_better/948  lowering the speed limit for cars to 80 km/h [ 50 mph ] can reduce transport co2 emissions on highways by 30 % in the longer term . 
   there doesnt seem to be a proper understanding of why europe `` won '' , at least none that would help developing countries . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence lots of examination , though . 
  hmm . 
  electricity apparently [ is about twice as expensive per kilowatt-hour in germany as in the us ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/ ) . 
  the uk about 50 % more . 
  probably does n't take into account subsidies , but a starting point . 
  oh , that 's a good point !, 
  hmm ... though ( a ) it 's still limited to something like the percent of the aircraft speed that the wind is and ( b ) ... are you sure about the direction ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jet_stream  many sources credit real understanding of the nature of jet streams to regular and repeated flight-path traversals during world war ii . 
  flyers consistently noticed westerly tailwinds in excess of 100 mph ( 160 km/h ) in flights , for example , from the us to the uk . 
  [ 11 ] the maps also seem to support this . 
  http://www.askmen.com/fine_living/travel_archive_150/195_3-days-on-the-cheap-in-las-vegas.html  unless you 're talking about the all-day breakfast buffets , `` cheap '' and `` vegas '' are two words that do n't usually match . 
  vegas seems to exist for the sole purpose of separating visitors from their cash . 
  eh , it 's a reasonable practice . 
  if you write an article like that every couple of days , sooner or later you 'll make a mistake . 
  you want to err on the side of having a safe , mechanical process to work from , and just putting `` alleged '' before anything that deals with judging guilt is a safe way to do that . 
  lots of military or aircraft or boating procedures can become ridiculously-redundant ( `` set switch a '' ... `` have second person check switch a '' ) just so that there 's a mechanical process that 's more mistake-resistant . 
  it 's not just journalism . 
  i do n't think that / u/planaxis is redefining something -- to do that would be to assert its meaning . 
  he 's saying `` when group x uses it in context y , they are trying to attach the following meaning '' . 
  that 's why he 's putting scare quotes around it in his use . 
  he might well be * wrong * in asserting that that some group is trying to convey the meaning he 's describing , but he 's not asking to redefine the word . 
  ayn rand would probably object to you invoking her as a libertarian and say that you should embrace the true path of objectivism . 
  it says that some guy drove one to [ catalina island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_catalina_island,_california ) , and that 's twenty-two miles offshore in the pacific . 
  i do n't think i 'd do it , but then again , [ this guy apparently crossed the atlantic in a five foot , four inch sailboat ] ( http://www.nmmc.co.uk/index.php?/collections/archive/fathers_day_the_smallest_boat_to_cross_the_atlantic ) .

  have to bring along some ridiculous amount of fuel too . 
  apparently the thing was discontinued because volkswagen was unable to meet epa emissions requirements .

  huh . 
  i was just going through their positions , and they have an awful lot of obscure positions . 
  the [ independent expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism ] ( http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/albinism/pages/iealbinism.aspx ) was definitely an odd one , so i clicked on it . 
  they 've even got a sign -- `` people with albinism : not ghosts but human beings '' . 
  i was thinking `` this sounds like the most improbable-to-be-important issue that i 've ever heard of and the most-likely to be a sinecure position '' , but apparently tanzania [ has a major issue with this ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/tanzania-bans-witch-doctors-curb-albino-killings-ghost-persecution-continues-africa-1483442 ) :  in tanzania , people affected by albinism are persecuted and killed as there is a widespread belief their body parts are essential ingredients for black magic potions . 
    in order to curb the killings and end the stigmatisation of albinos , tanzania banned witch doctors , accused of enhancing such discrimination by convincing people albinos ' body parts must be used to make charms and bring good luck . 
    as people with albinism in tanzania are often regarded as non-human , those who kill them are not considered murderers and thus they are rarely prosecuted . 
  culture shock ... 
  i read through the report -- it 's not long , 26 pages . 
  in the whole thing , i only found one relevant statistic cited ( though a number of anecdotes and a lot of assertions and musing ) :  in 2013 , there were 980 afrophobic hate crimes reported and in 2014 there were 1,075 afrophobic hate crimes reported .
