  its name is a portmanteau of `` amphibious '' and `` car '' . 
  the amphicar was designed to be marketed and sold in the usa . 
  [ snip ]  president lyndon b. johnson was known as an owner of an amphicar . 
  johnson , a known practical joker , was said to enjoy frightening visitors at his johnson city , texas ranch by driving them downhill in his amphicar , directly into his property 's lake , all the while shouting that he had malfunctioning brakes . 
  unless the airline is engaged in price fixing with all other trans-atlantic airlines -- which seems really unlikely -- i assume that it 'd be hard to extract money from a disparity in directions . 
  presumably most people are n't going to fly from europe to the us , never to return . 
  i wonder if it has something to do with cheap oil all over the place and a big chunk of flying costs being fuel . 
  one of these days , i should look up how the process works , but my guess is that it 's not a dominant input . 
  44 minutes later : okay , so i 'd always vaguely-thought that `` petrodollars '' simply referred to the fact that oil was , for some period of time , sold ahead-of-time in dollars ; that slowed dollar inflation , and because of that , expansion of the dollar money supply transferred real wealth from people holding dollar-denominated assets to parties responsible for expanding the dollar money supply . 
  that 's apparently not correct -- it 's simpler than that . 
  it just refers to where opec countries are stuffing their sovereign wealth funds -- primarily in dollar-denominated destinations -- and thus slowing dollar inflation by increasing demand for the dollar . 
  going off [ this document ] ( http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dp08-14.pdf ) :  currently there are approximately 40 swfs , 20 of which have been established since 2000 , holding estimated assets of $ 2 -- 3 trillion ( mccormick 2008 ) . 
  and [ this document has ] ( http://petrofed.winwinhosting.net/newsletter/wr-34_01feb08/w34_15.doc ) :  by our estimate , investors from oil-exporting nations owned $ 3.4 trillion to $ 3.8 trillion in foreign financial assets at the end of 2006 . 
  so , let 's take the highest estimate here , $ 3.8 t. 
  let 's assume that every last penny of it goes into dollar-denominated things , like dollar-denominated loans to homeowners in the us and us treasuries . 
  us inflation between 1990 and now has n't changed a whole lot , hovering between 2.29 % and 3.00 % in each decade . 
  let 's take the highest decade , the 1990s . 
  i do n't understand the mechanism via which the money supply expands and the real wealth gets redistributed into the hands of whoever holds the `` new '' dollars , but lets assume that it all winds up in the hands of the us with zero overhead . 
  so if we take the most-extreme edge of all of those edge-case scenarios , which probably are n't all the case , that 's $ 114b/year , or seven-tenths of one percent of annual us economic activity . 
  i 'm not saying that that 's not a fair chunk of change , but that 's also less than two-thirds of apple computer 's annual revenues -- the us economy is n't driven by that . 
  note that i 'm no expert here , and these are obviously back-of-the-napkin calculations , but i 'm also intentionally wildly-erring on the side of making the impact larger than it would be . 
   you have tons of oil , and other minerals , more navigable river than all the other countries together , big farm land , lot of space , a more dinamyc population ( less old , still growing quite fast ) etc. . . of course you are richer than europe , http://www.bea.gov/industry/gdpbyind_data.htm the top spreadsheet on that page provides value added by industry in the us . 
  in 2013 , total value added was $ 16.8 t. 
  of that , oil and gas extraction was $ 292b , all other mining was $ 78.8 b , and all agriculture was $ 227b . 
  a lot more of the economy is tied up in manufacturing ( $ 2.03 t ) , finance ( $ 3.38 t ) , professional and business services ( $ 1.99 t ) ... heck , entertainment and accomodation is a bigger influence than mining and and agriculture put together , at $ 622b . 
  the european union 's population is 508m , the us only 321m . 
   france 's foreign minister said on tuesday his country was working on a united nations security council resolution aimed at ~ ~ stopping syrian president bashar al-assad 's forces from using barrel bombs against his population ~ ~ making russia use a politically-awkward veto . 
  fixed that for the author . 
   non interventionism ( right ) : this is a russo-ukrainian conflict . 
  well , to be fair , it was ukraine and the eu looking at trade arrangements between themselves that led to all this . 
  the eu and ukraine were sending out feelers about a trade agreement that might potentially over time build into something more , russia tried to preempt future loss of ukraine by establishing an incompatible agreement with russia , ukraine saw protests and revolution , russia sent in the military and sliced off bits of the country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement  ... work on signing a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement between ukraine and the eu first began in 1999 ...   on 22 july 2008 , it was announced that a `` stabilisation and association '' - type agreement would be signed between ukraine and the european union . 
  [ 15 ] ... the eu association agreement ( aa ) was initialed on 30 march 2012 in brussels ...   at the time president yanukovych was also in negotiations with russia to `` find the right model '' for cooperation with the customs union of belarus , kazakhstan and russia . 
  [ 44 ] but also on 25 february 2013 president of the european commission jos\u00e9 manuel barroso made it clear that `` one country can not at the same time be a member of a customs union and be in a deep common free-trade area with the european union '' . [ 44 ] ... 
    the same day a ukrainian government decree suspended preparations for signing of association agreement ; instead it proposed the creation of a three-way trade commission between ukraine , the european union and russia that would resolve trade issues between the sides . 
  [ 54 ] prime minister mykola azarov issued the decree in order to `` ensure the national security of ukraine '' and in consideration of the possible ramifications of trade with russia ( and other cis countries ) [ 57 ] if the agreement was signed on a 28 -- 29 november summit in vilnius . [ 54 ] ... 
    on 26 november 2013 the ukrainian government admitted that russia had asked it to delay signing the eu association agreement and that it `` wanted better terms for the eu deal '' ...   the same day russian president vladimir putin called for an end to the criticism of the ukrainian decision to delay the association agreement , and that the eu deal was bad for russia 's security interests . 
  [ 64 ]   the eu rejected trilateral talks and asked yanukovich to commit to sign the association agreement , which he refused to do . 
  [ 69 ] at the end of a summit president of the european commission jos\u00e9 manuel barroso stated that the eu will not tolerate `` a veto of a third country '' in their negotiations on closer integration with ukraine . 
  [ 70 ] he also stated `` we are embarked on a long journey , helping ukraine to become , as others , what we call now , ` new member states ' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan  the demonstrations began on the night of 21 november 2013 , when protests erupted in the capital , kiev , after the ukrainian government suspended preparations for signing the ukraine -- european union association agreement with the european union , to seek closer economic relations with russia . 
  [ 79 ]   yanukovych was removed from power through a revolution and replaced by a new interim government in february 2014 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_pro-russian_unrest_in_ukraine  during the first stage of the unrest , crimea was annexed by the russian federation after a crisis in the region , russian military intervention , and an internationally criticized referendum . 
  protests in donetsk and luhansk oblasts escalated into an armed separatist insurgency . 
  [ 49 ] [ 50 ] this led the ukrainian government to launch a military counter-offensive against the insurgents , which resulted in the ongoing war in donbass . 
  [ 51 ] from late 2014 , cities outside of the donbass combat zone , such as kharkiv , odessa , kiev and mariupol , were struck by bombings that targeted pro-ukrainian unity organizations . 
  [ 52 ] [ 53 ] it 's not as if the eu was completely disconnected and idly standing by . 
  now , i 'm not going to say `` the eu touched it once , and so all future responsibility for anything bad in ukraine accrues to the eu '' . 
  but it 's also not the case that ukraine just spontaneously exploded and the eu was standing a ways away in surprise -- it was the result of a conflict between eu and russian diplomatic efforts . 
  finally , from a * realpolitik * standpoint : the powers of europe did not spend hundreds of years playing huggy-feely . 
  if ukraine going under the bus is * truly * best for them , then i 've little doubt that they will do that . 
  however , there are also real costs to simply walking away and watching ukraine undergo a severe beating for her presumption in dealing with the eu . 
  the us can and has provided clout in support , but at the end of the day , the eu will build her own reputation : if her diplomatic efforts can be countered by military force and she simply accepts this , future partners will doubtless remember and be loathe to risk themselves themselves to work with her ; international diplomacy is a [ repeated game ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/repeated_game ) . 
  if the eu bureaucracy does not have the support of the economic and military power of eu members , if it can not establish the reputation of being a good friend and a bad enemy , then the force of its diplomacy around the world will also be blunted . 
  had n't we just gone through lots of discussion about how chancellor merkel did whatever the majority wanted ? 
  that was a quick reversal of opinion ... 
  not off-the-cuff , but a quick google turns up [ * united states v. turner * ( 2013 ) ] ( http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1635734.html ) , and i 'm sure that there are others :  on june 2 , 2009 , harold turner published a blog post declaring that three seventh circuit judges deserved to die for their recent decision that the second amendment did not apply to the states :   if they are allowed to get away with this by surviving , other judges will act the same way . 
    these judges deserve to be made such an example of as to send a message to the entire judiciary : obey the constitution or die . 
    turner 's lengthy commentary declared that the blood of these three judges would `` replenish the tree of liberty , '' that the judges `` did n't get the hint '' sent by a gunman who had murdered the family of another federal judge in chicago , that they had not `` faced real free men willing to walk up to them and kill them for their defiance and disobedience , '' that their ruling was `` so sleazy and cunning as to deserve the ultimate response , '' and that the judges `` deserve to be killed . '' the next morning turner posted photographs , work addresses , and room numbers for each of the three judges , along with a map indicating the location of the courthouse in which they worked , and a photograph of the building modified to point out `` anti-truck bomb barriers . '' note that this is * not * a supreme court case , and afaik will not be appealed to the supreme court . 
  basically , some federal judges ruled that the second amendment was significantly-weaker than many americans felt that it was , he wrote some strong comments , including material which was taken as threats against judges . 
  [ aside : the supreme court overturned the restrictive federal court second amendment ruling and strengthened the second amendment ] . 
  a federal district court ruled against him on the a different free speech exception than incitement -- the [ true threat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/true_threat ) exception . 
  the case here was an appeal to a somewhat-higher federal court . 
  reading the ruling , while it looks like judge livingstone wrote the ruling ( which affirmed the earlier ruling , on the grounds that a true threat was made ) , livingstone dissented and said that he did n't agree that a true threat had been made , but felt that had the earlier case been on the grounds of incitement , he would have supported a conviction . 
  so while in this case , incitement * was n't * found , at least one judge would independently have ruled that it was present . 
  edit : also note that while i have n't reviewed all scotus cases for this , i doubt that there has been one on internet public speech . 
  the supreme court case of [ * elonis v. united states * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elonis_v._united_states ) has :  this is the first time the court has heard a case considering true threats and the limits of speech on social media . 
  [ 3 ] and that dealt also with true threats , not incitement , so there probably has n't been a scotus ruling on same yet . 
  ditto for [ this article on * elonis * ] ( http://www.nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/baniel-stark-2014-nyujlpp-quorum-99.pdf ) :  the issue that has caused the most interest in * elonis * is not the question of objective versus subjective standard . 
  rather , commentators and * amici * are concerned about how technology will play into the decision . 
  * elonis * presents one of the first opportunities for the court to comment on the characteristics of facebook and what the nature of social media means for speech transmitted via its channels . 
  indeed , many of the numerous * amicus * briefs filed in * elonis * in support of * elonis * focus on issues surrounding facebook . 
  i 'm * also * a non-european , but one who has been following with interest :  if schengen allows for free travel between countries , then why are asylum seekers so desperate to get to germany ? 
  because normally it is difficult to immigrate from a third-world country like syria to a wealthy first-world country like germany , where someone can , at least theoretically , make a great deal more money . 
  refugee status provides one of the few exceptions : realistically , outside of this , the vast bulk of the people involved will never be able to work in germany . 
  refugee status would permit at least working for a few years in germany ; it also may provide a route to permanently-stay in germany , which is almost-certainly the main point of interest . 
  it is likely that even if the war in syria end in the near future ( which theoretically means that people in another country due to refugee status should return home ) , that people who do what they can to produce legal arguments to remain . 
  germany is wealthier than most other countries in europe and has permitted a reasonably-high chunk of refugee applicants to stay . 
  germany is not the only target country , but the wealthy countries have been popular targets . 
  additionally , it is possible ( likely , i 'd say ) that at some point , european countries will tend to take action to restrict further population movement . 
  if this happens , it is vital to have already made it in , so there 's even more incentive to move over . 
  adding to the pressure is the fact that the prospects of a syrian are even worse than they normally would be due to a three-way civil war in syria . 
   why ca n't they seek asylum in e.g. 
  italy , and then just travel to germany ? 
  because normally , countries do n't permit people to randomly enter their borders . 
  the 1951 refugee convention , the relevant international treaty , requires that someone who has entered a country illegally and with good reason must not be penalized in determining their refugee status . 
  if they qualify as a refugee , they may not be sent back where they came from , and must be permitted to move around the country and work wherever they want . 
  so , if they sought asylum in italy , they could move around italy and work in italy . 
  however , they do n't get any special legal rights to travel to germany , and germany would deny them a work visa in that case . 
  the eu member countries have agreed to let * citizens * of other eu countries move to them and work in their borders . 
  however , someone granted asylum in italy does * not * become an italian citizen , so they have no right to work in germany . 
  germany would not permit him in . 
   why is hungary reluctant to let trains run from budapest out of the country - does n't hungary want the refugees out of their country ? 
  i 'm fuzzier on this , though it might be that a country should not be intentionally facilitating illegal travel from country to country . 
   are you allowed to apply for asylum at the border ? 
  this is complicated and a fine detail . 
  in the us , and i * think * other countries ( for at least germany , this is true ) , there are two very similar statuses which we mostly have been using interchangeably , but which are not quite the same : * refugee status * granted asylum someone may apply for refugee status from anywhere in the world that the country actually accepts such requests , including at customs at the border . 
  to apply for asylum , one must actually be past customs , in the country . 
  one has only a few days to prepare an argument for refugee status before being deported , and there 's a `` fast track '' in at least the us where even before someone 's case is heard in the judicial system , an official can simply give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down . 
  with asylum , one has something like a year in the us and does not have to get an official 's preliminary approval . 
  the idea behind having the two statuses is , i believe , that it 's common for people who should n't be in the country to get nabbed in customs , but rare for people to just deport people from the country .
