  also , someone at the borders is ( hopefully ) already prepared to justify crossing the border . 
  if you can just randomly pick people out of the country and boot them out , you run the risk of getting false positives from the population . 
  in any event , the fact that there 's a war on in syria means that there are grounds for someone to claim refugee status or asylum . 
  given that , and given the current bureaucratic and legal structure in place , the best route in terms of chances to get approval is to illegally-immigrate to the country where you want to remain , and then apply for asylum there . 
  in the past , germany and some other countries have relied upon the difficulty of actually * reaching * them , much less illegally-immigrating , to make it hard to apply for asylum ( and , i believe or refugee status ) . 
  my vague understanding is that if someone goes to the german embassy in turkey ( one place which has been hosting a lot of refugees ) is that the embassy will tell refugee applicants that they are already in a safe country , and do n't need refugee . 
  the net effect of this is that a lot of people wound up piling up in greece and italy . 
  other countries in the eu did n't show a lot of interest in providing financial support or in helping people to bypass those countries ( which would make for a flood of applications in the target countries ) and these `` transit '' countries complained . 
  germany and some other countries also tried to put in place policies that would make it even harder to make it to germany -- if someone managed to evade italian immigration control and law enforcement , germany would still return them to italy . 
  italy and greece kept getting more-and-more people and complaining more and more , and finally germany relented and said that they would n't return people to italy . 
  this meant that * if * someone could illegally-immigrate to germany , they 'd have a shot at immigration to the first world . 
  this increased the flood of illegal immigration precisely because migrants now felt that they had found a legal loophole to let them avoid the bureaucratic barriers that germany had thrown up . 
  you can find how-to-immigrate-to-the-us sites providing similar advice -- i.e. 
  if you can at all manage to do so , get past customs and * then * apply for asylum rather than applying at customs . 
  so the goal is mostly to try to get into germany proper without applying for refugee status or asylum elsewhere . 
  if it were granted , then germany could deny entry , saying that a `` safe country '' had already accepted them . 
  if it were denied , then i * think * ( do n't quote me on this ) that eu countries make use of some sort of information-sharing such that other eu members might also deny them on the same grounds . 
  so the goal is to get to germany , enter illegally ( to take advantage of the more-favorable asylum application rather than refugee status application ) , and * then * apply for asylum . 
  that 's why you get the business with the borders . 
  note that currently , this is completely-anonymous . 
  it could happen , but other than the degree to which * the times * has staked their reputation on not publishing a leak that does n't pan out , there 's ( a ) not necessarily a lot supporting this and ( b ) it 's not clear whether this is a final draft that the eu will be going ahead on . 
   between 2011 and 12 there have been :   580 male suicides between the ages 10-24 , a 1.6 per cent increase   2995 male suicides between the ages 25-44 , a 1.4 per cent increase   765 male suicides between the ages 45-64 , a 0.4 per cent increase   1725 male suicides between the ages 65-89 , a 1.3 per cent increase for most things , a ~ 1 % increase is n't all that big a deal . 
  nobody would care ? 
  edit : though doing it the day after 9/11 in the airport security line would probably get you hassled . 
  this is just the thing from february -- the police just decided to actually move ahead with charges . 
   ( not erdogan ) i dunno whether turkey under erdogan is actually all that religious compared to a lot of other societies in the area . 
  erdogan is just really quotable and has apparently decided to make lots of populist statements . 
   there is worse though . 
  i had gotten a visa from usa 2 years after 9/11 . 
  traumatic experience . 
   as of 2010 , apparently the updated questions include these :  do any of the following apply to you ? 
  ( answer yes or no )   a ) do you have a communicable disease ; physical or mental disorder ; or are you a drug abuser or addict ? 
    b ) have you ever been arrested or convicted for an offense or crime involving moral turpitude or a violation related to a controlled substance ; or have been arrested or convicted for two or more offenses for which the aggregate sentence to confinement was five years or more ; or have been a controlled substance trafficker ; or are you seeking entry to engage in criminal or immoral activities ? 
    c ) have you ever been or are you now involved in espionage or sabotage ; or in terrorist activities ; or genocide ; or between 1933 and 1945 were you involved , in any way , in persecutions associated with nazi germany or its allies ? 
    d ) are you seeking to work in the u.s. ; or have you ever been excluded and deported ; or been previously removed from the united states or procured or attempted to procure a visa or entry into the u.s. by fraud or misrepresentation ? 
    e ) have you ever detained , retained or withheld custody of a child from a u.s. citizen granted custody of the child ? 
    f ) have you ever been denied a u.s. visa or entry into the u.s. or had a u.s. visa canceled ? 
  hmm . 
   ** genocide ** checkmate , turkey . 
  one thing that probably will not encourage development of eu-based financing would be a transaction tax . 
  too creepy for you ? 
  obviously , [ it 's necessary to return to briton traditions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bog_body ) . 
  the article does n't list any statistics -- just the perception of one person . 
  i 'd be more interested in hard data . 
   but the un found that sweden did not properly address or acknowledge its involvement in the transatlantic slave trade . 
  i do n't particularly see how this supports the article 's thesis that `` sweden 's liberal image is a mirage '' . 
   a xenophobic political party , the swedish democrats , won almost 13 % of the national vote in 2014 and became the third-largest party . 
  yet sweden continues to cling onto its `` self-perception of being a tolerant and humane society , '' according to the un report . 
  my understanding from this forum is that sd was the only party that wanted to reduce immigration levels , and thus it 's quite reasonable to believe that this is an expression of society 's desire to limit immigration . 
  if the un is going to state that merely being opposed to immigration is inherently intolerant and inhumane , i suspect that ( a ) the un 's definition would clash with the commonly-used definition around the world and ( b ) that the un 's criteria for being intolerant and inhumane would include nearly more-or-less all countries in the world . 
  according to [ this chart ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/06/18/the-countries-with-the-most-refugees-per-1000-inhabitants-infographic/ ) , every country in the world has a lower per-capita refugee count than sweden except for lebanon , jordan , nauru , chad , djibouti , south sudan , turkey , and mauritania . 
  if sweden is intolerant and inhumane , so , presumably , are all countries on several continents ... including europe . 
  this does not meet the requirements to avoid protected free speech . 
  ( a ) it 's abstract . 
  ( b ) it 's not imminent . 
  i can cite one supreme court ruling and one recent incident off-the-top-of-my head that almost directly would demonstrate that this is protected in the us : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brandenburg_v._ohio  one of the speeches made reference to the possibility of `` revengeance '' [ sic ] against `` niggers '' , `` jews '' , and those who supported them . 
  one of the speeches also claimed that `` our president , our congress , our supreme court , continues to suppress the white , caucasian race '' , and announced plans for a march on washington to take place on the fourth of july . 
  brandenburg was charged with advocating violence under ohio 's criminal syndicalism statute for his participation in the rally and for the speech he made . 
  [ snip ]  convicted in the court of common pleas of hamilton county , brandenburg was fined $ 1,000 and sentenced to one to ten years in prison . 
  on appeal , the ohio first district court of appeal affirmed brandenburg 's conviction , rejecting his claim that the statute violated his first amendment and fourteenth amendment right to freedom of speech . 
  the supreme court of ohio dismissed his appeal without opinion . 
  the supreme court of the united states overruled this and ruled that this is protected free speech :  ohio 's criminal syndicalism statute violated the first amendment , as applied to the state through the fourteenth , because it broadly prohibited the mere advocacy of violence rather than the constitutionally unprotected incitement to imminent lawless action . 
  second , to repeat my [ other comment yet again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nq7tj/london_woman_charged_after_alleged/cvqmhvw ) :  in fact , this came up [ very recently ] ( http://www.christianexaminer.com/article/snopes.com.verifies.farrakhan.threats.but.doj.will.not.pursue.charges/49361.htm ) , when the leader of the nation of islam in the us said :    christian examiner , using a video clip of the fiery sermon and a printed version of the text from farrakhan 's website as sources , reported that farrakhan said to the applause of his audience at mt. 
  zion missionary baptist church that he needed 10,000 volunteers to rise up and kill whites , even if it cost them their lives . 
      `` retaliation is a prescription from god ... 
  so if the federal government will not intercede in our affairs , then we must rise up and kill those who kill us . 
  stalk them and kill them and let them feel the pain of death that we are feeling , '' farrakhan said . 
    [ snip ]    `` after looking into the matter we have determined that the farrakhan speech is protected by the first amendment and we will not be pursuing an investigation into the speech , '' louis delgado , spokesman for the u.s. attorney 's office , said . 
    you 've got the right to advocate in the abstract for mass killings in the us . 
  you ca n't say `` shoot this guy in the head now '' . 
  this would not meet the us criteria for being non-protected speech . 
  the us exception only really covers trying to convince a worked-up person to immediately tip over the edge so immediately that there would be no other way to address the situation . 
  trying to convince a person to shoot someone on the ground in front of them , or yelling that someone standing on a building edge should be pushed off the building would not be protected in the us , but this would be . 
  in this us , this would also be protected free speech . 
  furthermore , i support that being the case : i do n't think that society is faced with breakdown in a world in which said woman tweets such material . 
  we 've also generally-loosened the restrictions placed by libel and slander . 
  the internet blurs the lines a lot -- everything i say here is `` publishing '' something , but it 's a very different environment from what a newspaper author would be doing -- this is like broadcasting water-cooler conversations , and potentially to immense audiences . 
  it 's also often hard to track down the author of material . 
  realistically , we just expect people to not put a lot of trust in random , unattributed comments out there , and i think that that 's probably a better way of doing things . 
   yep , it would definitely fall outside protected speech in the us no , it would not : this would be protected free speech in the us . 
  it 's not advocating for * imminent * action , which is an element of the incitement exception . 
  in * hess v. indiana * , the speaker said `` all of us need to take this street [ now ] '' . 
  the #killallwhitemen was saying that in * general * , white men should be killed , and not immediately . 
  that is not imminent .
