   kill that white person tomorrow is not . 
  that still would n't be incitement -- that would n't meet the `` imminent '' test . 
  afaict from the link , they did n't * commemorate * it . 
  that 's a big difference in european laws , which often ban holocaust denial -- `` refusing to recognize '' is ambigious and sounds like it could be denial . 
  i thought that she was a crummy diversity officer , but i do n't really see the need for legal charges . 
  i would have kinda preferred that she be removed as diversity officer and not faced charges rather than remaining in place and facing charges . 
  it does n't matter whether the guy was actually a meteorologist or not , the soviets still had the * legal * right to shoot him down if he was over their territory without permission . 
  we thought that we could fly high enough that they could n't manage it ; we were wrong . 
  but the us never said `` hey , you had no authority to do that '' -- it was just trying to cover up the fact that it was trying to gather information on soviet territory . 
  that 's not the point -- i 'm not saying that the two sides do n't disagree over something of value . 
  my point is that neither side is going to say `` oh , someone flew their planes somewhere . 
  whatever gets resolved is either going to be : * via agreements made in some office building somewhere , which i suspect is very likely to be the case one day . 
  * through actual military conflict , which is n't accomplished by randomly sending a plane through . 
  * through non-military-but-not-official-channel moves ( e.g. 
  things like the [ green march ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_march ) or trying to buy off people living in the area ) . 
  turkey flying a plane over a greek island or greece flying a plane over the turkish mainland to protest turkey flying their planes somewhere wo n't advance anyone 's claims , and at least some of the area where people are flying planes is n't even disputed territory . 
  it does n't demonstrate military ability , because both sides are well-aware that the other side can bring in aircraft . 
  it does n't demonstrate willingness to fight , because both sides expect the aircraft to just wander through and leave again . 
  and it 's not as if the dispute is actually over the [ right to fly aircraft through ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/us-warplanes-defy-china-b-52-flyover ) , but over who owns the area -- flying an aircraft through does n't establish a * de facto * situation in either side 's favor . 
  normally , i expect an opponent of something to bring up the most-compelling arguments available . 
  given the degree to which ttip opponents have been relying on arguments over the structure of the negotiations rather than on saying `` we want to avoid grant of x or grant of y '' , i 'm assuming that there is n't a whole lot there for the public to actually be concerned about . 
  it permits for such a reaction in both cases . 
  it may not be * desirable * , but it is definitely within turkey 's rights under international law to shoot down a plane violating their airspace . 
  it may be a bad idea -- the [ kal-007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) shootdown was legal , albeit perhaps a bad idea . 
  it is not * mandated * by international law . 
  however , it is certainly permitted . 
  i 'm talking about [ things like this ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_greek-jets-violate-turkish-airspace-over-aegean-sea_374605.html ) :  according to the statement , two f-16s and one military helicopter were seen flying in turkish airspace on friday . 
  the two f-16s belonging to greece , with which turkey has had a prolonged territory-related dispute over the continental shelf , appeared at 11:14 a.m. over didim , a district in ayd\u0131n province on western turkey 's aegean coast . 
  even if it was done as a response to turkey violating greek airspace , it 's not actually buying either country anything . 
  neither side is going to change their territorial claims based on where a jet is flying . 
  i wonder what kind of military hardware syrian miners have stockpiled over the years ? 
  i mean , you and greece * could * sit down and agree to both knock it off . 
  it does n't buy either side anything -- neither side is actually getting anything from a territorial standpoint out of it . 
  and in nato . 
   one [ pegida ] banner portrayed merkel in a nazi uniform , but the swastika symbol was replaced by a euro sign . 
  well , that just makes this all the more-confusing . 
   if someone walking next to a `` non-nazi '' on a pegida march screams `` deutschland den deutschen , ausl\u00e4nder raus '' '' ( `` germany for germans , foreigners out ! '' ), 
  [ ironically-enough ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler ) :  hitler had formally renounced his austrian citizenship on 7 april 1925 , but at the time did not acquire german citizenship . 
  for almost seven years he was stateless , unable to run for public office , and facing the risk of deportation . 
  [ 129 ] on 25 february 1932 , the interior minister of brunswick , dietrich klagges , who was a member of the nsdap , appointed hitler as administrator for the state 's delegation to the reichsrat in berlin , making hitler a citizen of brunswick , [ 130 ] and thus of germany . 
  [ 131 ] `` germany for germans !, 
  foreigners out !, 
  deport hitler ! '', 
  `` you guys are such nazis ! '', 
  `` yeah , i ca n't believe that they want to deport hitler . 
  international law permits for such a reaction to airspace violations -- a country is free to say that military aircraft can not travel through its airspace if it wants to do so . 
  it does not require a shootdown . 
  it 's probably a bad idea to shoot it down unless there 's a reason to believe that the violation is a threat or that the violation is intentional and future violations ( which might be a threat ) can not otherwise be dissuaded . 
  saying `` there is a limit '' alone accomplishes nothing , though . 
  let 's say that you announce `` there is a limit '' . 
  other than that , policies remain the same -- germany ignores migrants who want to come to germany overseas and grants a special shot at immigration to all those who illegally travel through transit countries into germany . 
  now what happens is that everyone panics , because they know that germany is probably acting in a first-come-first-serve fashion , and at some point will cut people off ... but nobody knows when that is , so they will simply start flooding in as quickly as possible to beat that limit . 
  simply saying `` there is a limit '' without any other changes or defining that limit in a way that would permit a would-be illegal immigrant to europe to clearly know that he 's on the wrong side of the limit is probably the single * worst * thing that he could do . 
   the only reasons i could say against the current refugee policy is that the other european countries are giving us shit/hell for it and that it is party policy ... do you agree that germany is a factor in generating `` pull '' that is causing part of the illegal immigration issues for other countries ? 
  if so , do you think that germany should either ( a ) facilitate movement from turkey/lebanon/jordan directly to germany to avoid greek/italian other transit country problems or ( b ) establish that germany will not be granting any special status to anyone who transits those countries illegally ( e.g. 
  whether approved or rejected , they gain nothing over just applying for migrant status from turkey/lebanon/jordan ) ? 
  this would mean that germany could still accept as many refugees as you want , but will not generate undue illegal immigration into other european countries . 
  no , but if the schengen area is to move towards acting as a borderless area , it should be acting as if whatever actions required to address control at the schengen area borders are to be taken . 
  that is , germany should adopt a position that treats greece like saarland , so that any solution will equally address the problem for greece and for germany and for other eu countries . 
  using greece as a flow-rate limiter does not do that , nor does closing the german borders -- those are both attempts to treat greece specially , as a place to dump the problem . 
  revoking dublin avoids the `` treat greece specially and badly '' problem , but creates an unacceptable problem for the rest of the eu , which probably does n't want an unending flow of refugees that wind up dumped on them because they want a shot at the `` staying in germany/sweden '' lottery . 
  quotas might have made sense if it was clear that they were going to be capped and temporary . 
  there was n't any adoption of a policy that would have stopped more people entering europe before redistribution , and naturally , countries do n't want to be used to try to further what they see as a failed approach . 
  if merkel had said `` i 'm asking you to house people temporarily for one year until they 've been processed , all eu countries have announced that they will grant no precedence for the next three years to people applying domestically rather than remotely and will accept applications from outside the eu , and the eu announces that countries may impose self-chosen caps on long-term asylum acceptance '' , i think that would have done * much * better and would have addressed a good portion of the border country load . 
  wow . 
  i think that it makes sense for europe limit refugee count , but * i * do n't think that it makes sense for germany to address the issue via blocking people from crossing the german border . 
  * that does n't do anything to find people who are illegally present . 
  * germany is a destination country . 
  it 's not going to just re-route people like hungary . 
  nor is it a border country , so it wo n't secure the eu . 
  everybody germany would block at the german border is already in the eu , so it 's going to be an eu problem then . 
  * it does n't stop the inflow to the eu , which is the big concern . 
  * it does n't stop people from illegally-entering and then claiming that they were already present . 
  i still think that germany should announce a cap and announce that it 's treating applications in turkey/jordan/lebanon equally with applications domestically . 
  germany 's interest is in registering people and then deporting some percentage of those -- e.g. 
  someone comes in without any knowledge of acceptance or not , and either they walk out door 1 and to immediate deportation or door 2 and to asylum papers . 
  otherwise , it 's going to be a pain to find people and control the `` ikea stabbing '' crowd . 
   they thought that the first eu country where refugees arrive should be responsible for taking care of them . 
  italy and greece are n't generating the flow . 
  germany needs to make an announcement that will cut off the flow first , and frankly i think that germany should really have done so a while back . 
  give it time !, 
  ah , sorry , thought you were saying that you had some objection to it . 
   with free trade , that widget is now produced cheaper , but the price stays the same . 
  with free trade , the price will fall ( assuming that we do have a country y that can produce the thing more-efficiently , else there 'd be no impact at all ) . 
  this is because of the same reason that competitive markets are efficient in general , and nothing specific to trade -- because [ profits tend towards zero ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfect_competition#profit ) due to competition forcing them down . 
  if you are making $ 2 of profit per unit and i can go start my * own * company and make a competing product at $ 1.50 of profit per unit , i can take your customers . 
  that pressure pushes prices down . 
  if you think about it , it would be very peculiar for the scenario you described to be the case -- there 's no reason for the process involving country y 's manufacturers making widgets to `` know '' what the cost of production in country x is . 
   but less people have jobs , and you get need higher taxes , to pay for their unemployment money . 
  less people will have jobs in the immediate term -- people who work on widget assembly lines will be laid off . 
  those people will not remain unemployed -- they will go to find the next-most-desirable job after the widget assembly line job . 
  their wages will likely decrease -- but on the other hand , people in all the other industries in country x will now have less-expensive widgets , and their wages will effectively rise in that they can now buy more things . 
   now everyone has to pay even more than without free trade . 
  nah -- as friedman does above , you can give yourself a trivial example showing this not working . 
  you * could * take a collection of ten people , and they * could * survive in isolation . 
  they would n't be very good -- since they 'd have limited specialization of labor not being able to take advantage of the comparative advantage that i mentioned above , they would n't be doing much better than hunter-gatherers . 
  you would n't have pvc pipe being created , or terrycloth robes , or anything like that -- but you could isolate them and only let them trade with each other . 
  they would n't abruptly become more-wealthy -- they 'd be much poorer than otherwise . 
   i 'd argue apple has shown that the manufacturing cost and price of a product do not have to be related in any way . 
  apple produces a unique product -- they 've a monopoly over creating the iphone .
