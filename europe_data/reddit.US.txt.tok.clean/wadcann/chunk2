  i look at it , and i see a political sop that buys nothing in real terms . 
  i do n't personally object to it ( and i think that turkey should place an equally-low value on it ) , but i do not see it as being a terribly-important action for anyone . 
  just to be clear , i 'm not trying to obliquely shove in a `` it was the jews ' fault ! '', 
  argument . 
  it 's just that jews versus a number of other groups have clearly run into more friction in europe , and existing dislike for bankers during hard times combined with those bankers being a different group of people seems like the most-plausible cause i 've seen . 
  but what i 'm saying is that it was specifically jews being identified because jews were in finance in your example . 
  that is , the rationale was that the loan would have had to have come from someone jewish . 
  if that element were gone -- suppose that either christianity had permitted lending money for interest or judaism had banned it -- then would the friction have developed , is what i 'm curious about . 
  so that would generally be supporting a position of friction coming from the jewish role in finance then ? 
  okay , but if that 's the case , there was pretty significant friction that long predated that particular backlash . 
  no , just that you 're not required to have one ( actually , up until recently , you could go to canada without a passport ) . 
  lots of people just never leave the country . 
  turkey does possess a small amount of land in europe . 
  why do you guys care so much about acceptance ? 
  does acceptance come with financial reparations attached on the order of what israel got ? 
  are you wanting to make sure that every member state has condemned genocide to help discourage member states from engaging it in the future ? 
  i can understand resolving territorial disputes or concerns about democracy or corruption or whatnot , but i ca n't understand why the acceptance is considered such a big deal . 
  yeah , turkey killed a lot of people , but it also happened beyond living memory . 
  sucks , but it does n't have a lot of impact on people today . 
   do they even want to join anymore ? 
  let 's say that turkey is * not * going to get in and he is confident of this fact . 
  it probably looks a little silly to stand there begging over-and-over , so he 's going to head off and do his own thing . 
  but the issues go back much further than that . 
  some examples : * [ france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_france#middle_ages ) * [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_germany#a_period_of_massacres_.281096.e2.80.931349.29 ) * [ england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_england#persecution_and_expulsion ), 
  you 're talking about great depression-ish stuff . 
  friction between christians and jews in europe go back far longer than that . 
  i 've wondered as well what the driver is . 
  some might simply be that they were held apart , but then , nobody really cares about the amish in the us . 
  i strongly-suspect that a big part of it was that christianity once prohibited moneylending and judaism did not ( at least to christians ) , so you wound up with your bankers belonging to a different ethnic and religious group . 
  when things get tight and they demand to receive their debt service payments ... 
  `` banks '' are not just an abstract concept : if the german taxpayer has to bail out banks or eat losses , those are services that dry up and go away , or something that they could have otherwise had that they wo n't . 
  now , we may feel that that is a good idea , but it does n't make much sense to just treat it as `` banks '' on the left and `` people '' on the right . 
  there are people on both sides of the equation . 
   i 'm so high up on my horse that except for the lacking food products i can not cultivate myself and taxes , just about my entire income goes to organisations trying to solve this issue . 
  not only that , i have 3 migrants sleeping on my couch and many more to come . 
  fair enough . 
   japan got really soft and sexually weird too . 
  on being `` soft '' , japan : ( a ) suffered a huge amount because of what the expansionists in japan had done . 
  even if you did n't have strong feelings against them , their call killed a lot of people and cost japan land . 
  ( b ) was required to limit its military by the us , which did n't want to fight world war iii in the near future . 
  as for `` sexually-weird '' ... i 'm not sure that a large chunk of that is n't just cultural differences that extended to before world war ii , rather than post-war stuff . 
  oh , i see -- they 're trying to rotate the wheel , not pull it to the side . 
  thanks . 
  that being said , while i do like the image , i do think that real changes have happened in revolutions . 
  two hundred and fifty years ago , everyone here would have been in a monarchy , and probably one where the church still held a not-insignificant amount of power . 
  could you give a simple explanation of the image for me ? 
  i do n't quite get what it 's trying to symbolize . 
  that did n't happen in the us ( well , outside of the confederate states of america ) . 
  well , in the uk maybe things are different , but in the us , a passport is not required and lots of people do n't have them . 
  < checks wikipedia   ** eurofurence **   founded in 1995 , this european convention has been held in germany for fifteen of its eighteen years . 
  this unbroken span makes it the longest-running furry convention . 
  other hosted countries are sweden , the netherlands , and the czech republic . 
  and it [ looks like it 's in berlin again this year ] ( http://www.eurofurence.org/ef21/ ) . 
  also , san francisco and the rest of the us west coast seems to have taken a vacation inland . 
  canadians ? 
  the world clearly needs a projection that makes the more-equatorial nations look more prominent than they really are , so that there 's a counter . 
   i said people that are into sex with animals are furries . 
  my interpretation of :  it 's slang for zoophilia , basically was the other way around , but that 's not really what i was trying to get at . 
  i do n't have statistics for the converse handy , but if someone had sex with a sheep , i do not think that someone here would call them a `` furry '' . 
  on the sexual side of the culture , wikipedia has a disproportionately-high-compared-to-society-as-a-whole rate of homosexuals and bisexuals :  according to four different surveys , 14 -- 25 % of the fandom members report homosexuality , 37 -- 52 % bisexuality , 28 -- 51 % heterosexuality , and 3 -- 8 % other forms of alternative sexual relationships . 
  [ 9 ] [ 11 ] [ 32 ] i 'm kind of curious whether a furry would describe some of the elements of a furry convention as being on-par with the [ masquerade ball ] ( http://www.umich.edu/~ece/student_projects/masquerade/gender.html ) of centuries past . 
  ( and , yes , before anyone points the fact out , there is a substantial non-erotic side of furrydom too , and conventions are n't just orgies ; it 's just that the erotic portion draws a lot more interest and attention from the broader world . ), 
  if it 's properly-distributed , 1,700 is not a shoddy sample size . 
  a larger population does not require a larger sample size to retain statistical validity . 
   and america is currently host to more illegal immigrants than most countries hold in legal immigrants . 
  ( 12-20 million right now ) that being said : * the us has pretty-substantial opposition to granting citizenship to these people ( though their children , albeit born to parents present illegally , will become us citizens ) . 
  the us * could * expand the legal citizenship program , but does not do so . 
  * the absolute number is not very interesting compared to the percentage . 
  * while there is a religious split , most illegal immigrants in the us are from mexico , with a catholic background . 
  while catholicism/protestantism * have * had friction in the us before , it 's just not a huge issue for most people right now . 
  i do n't see a lot of people getting upset about the catholic poland being in the eu ( though maybe i just missed that and there was back when ) , but i do see strong opposition to immigration from islamic countries or turkey joining the eu . 
  the islam/christianity split may play a significant role . 
  the next sentence was `` it 's slang for zoophilia '' , which it certainly is n't , at least over here . 
  maybe in the uk , the word has a different meaning ... 
  spain [ is one of greece 's creditors , albeit not a large one ] ( http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1557-whos-still-exposed-to-greece/ ) : $ 300m in q3 2014 . 
  greece 's debt is too high already for that . 
  / u/delenda _ east was saying that it 's hard to make a single piece of propaganda that appeals to both men and women . 
  he says that the us wants to start world war iii to * improve its economy * ? 
  i saw another where he said that the us recovered from the great depression in world war ii . 
  yes , but it only did so by massive deficit-spending : it gave up good things that it would have had a few years down the road in order to fully-employ everyone in the military or producing military goods . 
  he says that it creditors collapse , debts wo n't be valid . 
  i guarantee you that whoever is holding us treasuries , even if they get them from someone else , will expect the things to be paid up on . 
  it says that the us will sell arms to the rest of the world . 
  well ... some of it probably will , but the reason that the us was building arms during world war ii was because europe was in a frozen state where germany could block arms production for the allies on the continent , the uk had nowhere near the capacity required in the short term , and russia was pulling a lot of available people into the war ( and even there , the us was more important for shipping food and raw materials to russia , not weapons ) . 
  china and india were n't industrialized , and thus were n't options . 
  you 'd have to have world war iii run for as long as ii and for the other industrialized nations of the world to be knocked out of the picture . 
  he said that this is happening now because the united states is facing imminent bankruptcy . 
  whatever the wisdom or lack thereof of running up the national debt , it is dollar-denominated , and bankruptcy would n't be what the us would see -- rather , inflation . 
   product of an asinine education system . 
  well , indirectly . 
  if a country develops a substantial ip portfolio such that it is a net exporter of intellectual property ( ip ) , it has an interest in enforcing ip . 
  when ip rights are enforced , then a business that pays for assets is n't viewed as a sucker by the competition , but rather one taking the safe , conservative route . 
   it 's why switzerland is not worth invading . 
  that actually is a better example than my own , probably . 
  at no point was switzerland able to actually hold off an attack by major european powers , but at no point did those powers consider an invasion worthwhile . 
  switzerland was a success story of that approach . 
   they 're an overseas countries with radically different terrain than the us , both of which were major factors that contributed to the us ' defeat . 
  the issue was that the us could concentrate force and smash any one thing , but behind the us , resistance would just pop up again . 
  simultaneously , the war was costly out-of-proportion to the benefits that it bought the us . 
  it 's true that tactics were used in vietnam against the us ( use of tunnels , use of heavy tree cover ) that would n't work as well in ukraine , but the idea is n't to use vietnamese tactics , but to make invasion too-costly to perform .
