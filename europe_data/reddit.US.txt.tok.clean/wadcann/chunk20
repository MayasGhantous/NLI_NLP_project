  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] in december 2013 the council of the european union approved opening negotiations on serbia 's accession in january 2014 , [ 9 ] and the first intergovernmental conference was held on 21 january at the european council in brussels . 
  [ 10 ] i mean , i do n't know what the political undercurrents are like there , but it does n't look stalled to me . 
   and merkel , for that sake , with her `` accept everyone '' policy . 
  that 's not what merkel said . 
  the closest i 've seen was sweden promising permanent residency to syrians who applied ( and even that was limited to syrians ) . 
  http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-migrants-morning-mediterranean-200-drowning-2297439-aug2015/  speaking yesterday german chancellor angela merkel named ireland as one of three countries not doing enough to tackle the migrant crisis . 
  lot of irish criticism of eastern europeans here . 
  maybe it 's time for russia to engage in some realpolitik and decide that militarily annexing bits of countries is n't acceptable in europe , no matter how appealing the draw of long-ago borders . 
  the rest of europe has avoided that siren call . 
  in this article , state-financed media of qatar , which has accepted no middle eastern migrants , will take poland , which has a ton of ukranians , to task . 
   despite popular perceptions to the contrary , migrants are often highly educated , and they generally do not burden the public purse . 
  stefano scarpetta , director of the department of employment , labor and social affairs at the o.e.c.d. , said immigrants often contribute more in taxes than they draw in public benefits ... europe 's best shot at prosperity is to build upon the diversity that immigration will bring . 
  we are n't talking about within-the-eu immigration here , we 're talking about dumping the contents of a third-world country into europe . 
  and syrians [ are n't all that well-educated by un standards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index ) . 
  and let 's assume that it * is * a net win , and lucrative . 
  why is n't a * new york times * economics writer advocating for the united states to get in on this cash cow ? 
  i 'm a bit embarrassed about the * new york times * constantly pumping out stories condemning europe -- and in particular eastern europe -- with nary a call for the us to take in a comparable number of refugees . 
  mind , i would n't agree with that policy , but at least it would n't be hypocritical . 
  it was one thing when they 're just hosting guest writers from europe . 
  it 's another thing when the publication 's editorial board is doing writeups slamming european morality . 
  the us department of state [ set crimea as the line , not donbas ] ( http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/03/238897.htm ) , and the exchange the end of sanctions , not syria . 
  well ... i do n't know ; polls have their own bias . 
  like i said , i think that it 's possible to infer at least that in change thus far , that has n't been the important factor from the fact that the flow rate * was * lower , yet i do n't believe that there 's been any relative shift in the turkish-camp-to-german-refugee-standard-of-living ratio . 
  all right -- let 's say that we close the underfunding gap . 
  housing/supplies/whatnot in the camps get better . 
  how much do you think someone in a refugee camp in jordan , turkey , or lebanon wants to stay there if they could migrate to germany and refugee status gives them the legal possibility to do so ? 
  outside of refugee status , it 's very difficult to get into the well-to-do countries . 
  i mean , i imagine that you 'd could say `` well , * any * improvement would reduce the pressure , and it 's still cheaper to put someone in a camp in turkey than to have to deal with them in the eu '' . 
  not saying that it 's not a factor , but frankly , i 'm a little doubtful that the dominant factor causing a flow of refugees is the eu getting richer than it was a couple years ago or the camps getting less-well-supplied . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if i were living on welfare , the value of my time would be lower , and i 'd be baking my bread . 
  i suspect that you 'll find a much higher rate of women being housewives in syria , and probably know how to prepare food rather better than i do . 
   what do they do exactly ? 
  is it the gatling gun ? 
  do n't tanks have the armour thick enough to stop those rounds ? 
  or is it the sheer amount/force of those bullets that fuks everything up ? 
  they 're close air support or attack aircraft -- they hit specific vehicles/buildings or fly over a battlefield and can add extra firepower into things that ground forces are fighting with . 
  the cannon existed to defeat [ reactive armor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactive_armour ) -- you know how you often see sheets of little `` squares '' on modern tanks ? 
  those are explosives , and they go off when various types of specialized anti-tank weapons hit them , which spreads out the force of the thing and keeps it from penetrating the tank . 
  the a-10 's large , very-rapid-fire cannon is one way of defeating it , since it puts a lot of rounds through . 
  the a-10 is older , and current heavy armor is a problem for its cannon , though that cannon * does * put out more energy than any other gun that an aircraft will fly with . 
  it 's still fine for destroying lighter things , like armored personnel carriers , but it needs to use the missiles that it carries to reliably destroy current-generation tanks . 
  the a-10 is also well-armored . 
  this was originally-intended so that it could fly low and slowly ( it 's not a terribly-fast aircraft ) over a battlefield without easily being shot down . 
  the problem is that surface-to-air missile systems capable of posing a problem for it are now more-broadly available . 
  it 's still a usable aircraft -- one of the longer-running us warplanes -- and was doing duty in iraq and afghanistan , but it 's now over 40 years old and for the us , the ultimate goal is to replace it with the f-35 . 
  it 's probably got another decade or so left . 
  because it 's quite unusual in appearance and sound its weaponry makes , it kinda stands out -- it 's an iconic us plane . 
  my guess is that it 's easier for the us military to move around the older a-10s than it is the newer , more-in-demand f-35s . 
  one thing that eastern europe would like is to have military from other countries there so that if eastern europe got into a conflict with russia , it would tend to draw in other countries , above-and-beyond nato/eu requirements , and a-10s are probably easier to send over without disrupting whatever the existing plans are . 
  competitive markets !, 
   they actually hired people who have known far-left beliefs to monitor anti-refugee posts on facebook ?!, 
  if their political/religious/whatever views do n't prevent them from doing their job , what 's the problem ? 
  `` ex-stasi '' seems a bit loaded . 
  yes , it 's true , but it 's obviously present to imply that germany is running a stasi-like service . 
  at least in the us -- and i assume elsewhere -- smartphones are typically subsidized by the phone company , and the loss made up by artificially-high service fees . 
  the up-front cost is n't that high , but the service fee is . 
  last time i looked at the numbers , you might pay , amortizing over a two-year ownership period , under $ 200 for a phone but over $ 2000 for services -- over the first two years , the service fees overwhelmingly dominate the cost , and only get higher as time goes on . 
  i do n't know how service fees vary ( i 'm sure that it 's cheaper the higher-density a country is and the cheaper the labor in those countries , and maybe people can use less data service ) , but i imagine that it probably still is n't that cheap . 
  point is , though , the up-front cost of the phone is n't the interesting bit . 
  neither the soviet union nor china claimed to have achieved communism , but rather to have simply been socialist . 
  the fact that `` communist '' was present in the name of the political party was simply to indicate that they aspired to reaching that point . 
  the west heavily used the term `` communism '' to both identify their names and to help isolate the socialist economies from any support from socialists in the west . 
  a [ communist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism ) society would be one without money or the state . 
  nothing at anything like the level of a country has ever met the prior two criteria , though there are small-scale communes in various places that have . 
  [ sevastopol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sevastopol ) is the big russian naval base in crimea . 
  like everything else in the black sea , can be easily cut off from the mediterranean by turkey . 
  russia , however , also has [ novorossiysk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novorossiysk ) and the smaller [ sochi port ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_sochi ) , as well as some smaller ports in the black sea . . syria leased [ part of a port to russia at tartus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_naval_facility_in_tartus ) in the med proper . 
  cyprus has also cut a deal with russia to let [ russia dock in its ports ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31632259 ) in the med . 
  no sympathetic tv coverage of ukranians . 
  need lots of small children shots . 
  [ not with that kind of attitude ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall ) . 
  i 'm pretty comfortable saying that multiculturalism is not a tool for capitalists . 
  a lot of people here were complaining that germany was n't showing enough strong leadership . 
  maybe , but given the information available then , i think that few would have predicted what things would look like in september . 
  presumably serbia is concerned about losing eu membership over it . 
  hungary is already in , so they ca n't lose membership . 
  you 'd think that german politicians would be aware of the effect of such casual comments , since it was so important in germany 's political history : the [ berlin wall fell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall#the_fall ) on such a casual , uncoordinated comment on border-crossing combined with misinterpretation in the press :  the wave of refugees leaving east germany for the west kept increasing . 
  by early november refugees were finding their way to hungary via czechoslovakia , or via the west german embassy in prague . 
  this was tolerated by the new krenz government , because of long-standing agreements with the communist czechoslovak government , allowing free travel across their common border . 
  however this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries . 
  to ease the difficulties , the politburo led by krenz decided on 9 november to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including between east and west berlin . 
  later the same day , the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private , round-trip , travel . 
  the new regulations were to take effect the next day . 
    g\u00fcnter schabowski , the party boss in east berlin and the spokesman for the sed politburo , had the task of announcing the new regulations . 
  however , he had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated . 
  [ 78 ] shortly before a press conference on 9 november , he was handed a note announcing the changes , but given no further instructions on how to handle the information . 
  these regulations had only been completed a few hours earlier and were to take effect the following day , so as to allow time to inform the border guards . 
  but this starting time delay was not communicated to schabowski . 
  [ 44 ]   schabowski read the note , he had been given , out loud at the end of the press conference . 
  one of the reporters , ansa 's riccardo ehrman , [ 79 ] asked when the regulations would take effect . 
  after a few seconds ' hesitation , schabowski assumed it would be the same day based on the wording of the note and replied , `` as far as i know effective immediately , without delay '' . 
  [ 44 ] after further questions from journalists , he confirmed that the regulations included the border crossings through the wall into west berlin , which he had not mentioned until then . 
  [ 80 ]   excerpts from schabowski 's press conference were the lead story on west germany 's two main news programs that night -- at 7:17 pm on zdf 's heute and at 8 pm on ard 's tagesschau . 
  this , of course , meant that the news was broadcast to nearly all of east germany as well . 
  later that night , on ard 's tagesthemen , anchorman hans joachim friedrichs proclaimed , `` this is a historic day . 
  east germany has announced that , starting immediately , its borders are open to everyone . 
  the gdr is opening its borders ... the gates in the berlin wall stand open . 
  '' [ 44 ] [ 78 ]   after hearing the broadcast , east germans began gathering at the wall , at the six checkpoints between east and west berlin , demanding that border guards immediately open the gates . 
  [ 78 ] the surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem . 
  at first , they were ordered to find the `` more aggressive '' people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to east germany -- in effect , revoking their citizenship .
