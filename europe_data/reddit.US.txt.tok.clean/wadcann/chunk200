  that causes the prices that android vendors charge to force down apple 's prices . 
  this is nearly what happened with apple 's macintosh computer back in the mid-1990s -- pc vendors sold less-expensive personal computers that were substitute goods for the macintosh and almost completely took apple 's entire market away , as apple charged a significant premium for their product .

  well , there * was * a war against christmas , but in england and the americas , and only when the protestants were in extreme dominance : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas#reformation_to_the_18th_century  however , in 17th century england , some groups such as the puritans , strongly condemned the celebration of christmas , considering it a catholic invention and the `` trappings of popery '' or the `` rags of the beast '' . 
  [ 59 ] in contrast , the established anglican church `` pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts , penitential seasons , and saints ' days . 
  the calendar reform became a major point of tension between the anglican party and the puritan party . 
  '' [ 99 ] the catholic church also responded , promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form . 
  king charles i of england directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old-style christmas generosity . 
  [ 92 ] following the parliamentarian victory over charles i during the english civil war , england 's puritan rulers banned christmas in 1647 . 
  [ 59 ] [ 100 ]   protests followed as pro-christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks canterbury was controlled by the rioters , who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans . 
  [ 59 ] the book , the vindication of christmas ( london , 1652 ) , argued against the puritans , and makes note of old english christmas traditions , dinner , roast apples on the fire , card playing , dances with `` plow-boys '' and `` maidservants '' , and carol singing . 
    the restoration of king charles ii in 1660 ended the ban , but many calvinist clergymen still disapproved of christmas celebration . 
  as such , in scotland , the presbyterian church of scotland discouraged the observance of christmas , and though james vi commanded its celebration in 1618 , attendance at church was scant . 
  [ 101 ] the parliament of scotland officially abolished the observance of christmas in 1640 , claiming that the church had been `` purged of all superstitious observation of days '' . 
  [ 102 ] it was not until 1958 that christmas again became a scottish public holiday . 
  [ 103 ] [ snip ]  in colonial america , the puritans of new england shared radical protestant disapproval of christmas . 
  celebration was outlawed in boston from 1659 to 1681 . 
  the ban by the pilgrims was revoked in 1681 by english governor sir edmund andros , however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating christmas became fashionable in the boston region . 
  [ 60 ] ironically , the us complaints a few years back about a `` war on christmas '' typically came from the us protestant tradition . 
  globally , it did a great deal to bring people out of poverty .

  if you say `` import of widgets is banned to country x so that we can keep up wages in the widget-manufacturing business '' , what you 're doing is artificially-increasing the price of widgets , which decreases the real wages of everyone else in country x and transfers that money to country x 's widget-manufacturing industry , some of which will wind up with widget-manufacturing workers .

   as for mixing this often makes me cringe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_language_influences_in_english  nearly 30 % of english words ( in an 80,000 word dictionary ) may be of french origin . 
   what makes me cringe , though , is frenglish . 
  it 's quite the * faux pas * . 
  the us is a massive engine converting spanish-speakers to english-speakers . 
  http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/irb_october2010.pdf  according to a pew hispanic center survey , 91 percent of second generation children from hispanic immigrant families and 97 percent from the third generation said that they speak english very well or pretty well . 
    although some people express concern that spanish-speaking immigrants will have children and grandchildren who speak spanish rather than english , research shows that the opposite is the case . 
  the children and grandchildren lose their parent 's native tongue as they grow up . 
  frank bean ( university of california , irvine ) and douglas massey ( princeton university ) found that `` although the generational life expectancy of spanish is greater among mexicans in southern california than other groups , its demise is all but assured by the third generation . '', 
  in the us , it 's statistically mostly black people shooting black people and white people shooting white people . 
  there are newer statistics , but they 're comparable ; [ the first search hit ] ( http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/miluc88.pr ) :  ninety-four percent of the black murder victims were killed by other blacks , and 76 percent of the white victims were killed by whites . 
  the [ us black homicide victim death rate is 7.76 times the white homicide death rate ] ( https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/black-americans-are-killed-at-12-times-the-rate-of-people-in-other-developed-countries/ ) . 
  the hispanic victim homicide rate is 2.08 times the white rate . 
  broadly-speaking , it 's neither white people going out and killing off black people , nor black people going out and killing off white people , though that 's often the impression that the us center-left and center-right like to give , respectively . 
  that 's also just homicides ; it excludes the fact that most us gun deaths are suicides ( if you included those , i suppose that you 'd have an even stronger correlation ;-) ) .

  dutch : turns the salt waste into fruitful land . 
  i do agree with you on the party thing -- in the us , the fact that the executive branch is separate from the legislative branch means that a common practice is to stall on anything that you do n't actually want to pass but do want to be seen as supporting until the other party controls one of the two branches and then say that you 'd love to pass it , but it 's just that other party blocking you .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiotrophic_fungus  radiotrophic fungi are fungi which appear to use the pigment melanin to convert gamma radiation [ 1 ] into chemical energy for growth . 
  [ 2 ] ... these were first discovered in 1991 as black molds growing inside and around the chernobyl nuclear power plant . 
  [ 1 ] research at the albert einstein college of medicine showed that three melanin-containing fungi , cladosporium sphaerospermum , wangiella dermatitidis , and cryptococcus neoformans , increased in biomass and accumulated acetate faster in an environment in which the radiation level was 500 times higher than in the normal environment . 
  exposure of c. neoformans cells to these radiation levels rapidly ( within 20 -- 40 minutes of exposure ) altered the chemical properties of its melanin and increased melanin-mediated rates of electron transfer ( measured as reduction of ferricyanide by nadh ) three to four-fold compared with unexposed cells . 
  [ 2 ] similar effects on melanin electron-transport capability were observed by the authors after exposure to non-ionizing radiation , suggesting that melanotic fungi might also be able to use light or heat radiation for growth . 
   frustrates me this , creates the impression that the animals are suffering no consequences to their health or that of their offspring . 
  nah , just that on the net , they 're doing better than they would be if they had no viable habitat and no radiation . 
  humans are n't yet desperate-enough for habitat to need to live in such environments , so from an animal 's standpoint , it 's a good deal .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/value_investing  value investing is an investment paradigm that derives from the ideas on investment that ben graham and david dodd began teaching at columbia business school in 1928 and subsequently developed in their 1934 text security analysis . 
  although value investing has taken many forms since its inception , it generally involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis . 
  [ 1 ] as examples , such securities may be stock in public companies that trade at discounts to book value or tangible book value , have high dividend yields , have low price-to-earning multiples or have low price-to-book ratios . 
    high-profile proponents of value investing , including berkshire hathaway chairman warren buffett , have argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value . 
  [ 2 ] the discount of the market price to the intrinsic value is what benjamin graham called the `` margin of safety '' . 
  the intrinsic value is the discounted value of all future distributions . 
  [ citation needed ] however , the future distributions and the appropriate discount rate can only be assumptions . 
  ( [ citation needed ] graham never recommended using future numbers , only past ones ) . 
  for the last 25 years , warren buffett has taken the value investing concept even further with a focus on `` finding an outstanding company at a sensible price '' rather than generic companies at a bargain price . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contrarian_investing  contrarian investing is an investment strategy that is characterized by purchasing and selling in contrast to the prevailing sentiment of the time . 
  [ 1 ]   a contrarian believes that certain crowd behavior among investors can lead to exploitable mispricings in securities markets . 
  for example , widespread pessimism about a stock can drive a price so low that it overstates the company 's risks , and understates its prospects for returning to profitability . 
  identifying and purchasing such distressed stocks , and selling them after the company recovers , can lead to above-average gains . 
  conversely , widespread optimism can result in unjustifiably high valuations that will eventually lead to drops , when those high expectations do n't pan out . 
  avoiding ( or short-selling ) investments in over-hyped investments reduces the risk of such drops . 
  these general principles can apply whether the investment in question is an individual stock , an industry sector , or an entire market or any other asset class . 
  [ snip ]  warren buffett is a famous contrarian , who believes the best time to invest in a stock is when shortsightedness of the market has beaten down the price . 
  some seem to be doing all right catching knives ; buffett 's the wealthiest investor in the us . 
   i do n't think that the labour rights should be ( de ) regulated purely based on the interest of investors . 
  that 's certainly the french voter 's prerogative , but on the other hand , it 's the investor 's prerogative to decide which country to invest in . 
  i have a negative gut reaction to france 's labor antics .
