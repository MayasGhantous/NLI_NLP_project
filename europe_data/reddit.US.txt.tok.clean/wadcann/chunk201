  but ... honestly , i 'm not sure that i can defend that reaction . 
  it might just be because it 's not what i 'm used to , and it 's * different * . 
  i think that the destruction of goods/impeding commerce is clearly worse -- that 's inefficient . 
  but the idea that executives can be humbled ... well , presumably someone going to be an executive in france knows what they 're getting into . 
  it might be that employees * value * the ability to do this sort of thing . 
  when george washington became the first us president and freedom of speech was guaranteed , from the get-go , he was uncomfortable with bogus claims of him having affairs and whatnot in the press . 
  his successor , adams , was so upset about this that he tried using the [ sedition acts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alien_and_sedition_acts ) to block criticism of himself . 
  today , we think that it 's utterly normal for political leaders to be subjected to public criticism and often ridicule , but that was n't always the norm . 
  it 's not really clear to me that the half-serious `` boss kidnapping '' thing , which as far as i can tell the french do n't seem to be too-concerned over , actually causes companies not to operate . 
  it 's different from us social norms , and it would not be tolerated in the us , and i 'm certainly not convinced that it 's a positive ... but neither am i convinced that it 's * clearly * worse than the us approach . 
  you should just blame the us . 
  ... actually , i 'm assuming that ttip is going to do some of that wrt agricultural reforms ... 
  it seems like it 'd be better to be able to craft your policies in a way that they could be sold to voters as opposed to sneakily-imposed on them . 
  i 'll happily believe that the gut response of a voter is n't optimal , but i 'm less-convinced that the public needs to be entirely-bypassed on issues that would normally be issues . 
  i hear that there 's water on mars . 
  we screwed up and [ accidentally created a 343 square mile sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salton_sea#latest_instance_of_the_salton_sea ) , which is kind of like one anti-dutch . 
  [ ** yahweh , day 1 ** ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=niv ) : and god said , `` let there be light , '' and there was light . 
  4 god saw that the light was good , and he separated the light from the darkness . 
  5 god called the light `` day , '' and the darkness he called `` night . '' and there was evening , and there was morning -- the first day . 
  ** dutch , day 1 ** : and the dutch said , `` let there be artificial light in the sky to produce optimal plant growth , '' and the dutch brought forth greenhouses upon the earth , and provided electrical lighting in the greenhouses . 
  [ ** yahweh , day 2 ** ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=niv ) : and god said , `` let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water . '' 7 so god made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it . 
  and it was so . 
  8 god called the vault `` sky . '' and there was evening , and there was morning -- the second day . 
  ** dutch , day 2 ** : and the dutch said , `` let there be panes of glass facing upwards that humidity and temperature may be regulated as we desire , '' and the dutch caused panes of glass to cover the land . 
  [ ** yahweh , day 3 ** ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=niv ) : and god said , `` let the water under the sky be gathered to one place , and let dry ground appear . '' and it was so . 
  10 god called the dry ground `` land , '' and the gathered waters he called `` seas . '' and god saw that it was good . 
  ** dutch , day 3 ** : and the dutch said `` let the water that is inconveniently placed be gathered to one place , and let dry ground appear , and let the salt be drained from the land . '', 
  and it was so . 
  the dutch called the dry ground `` holland '' , and the gathered waters they called `` future holland '' . 
  and the dutch saw that it was good . 
  [ ** yahweh , day 3 continued ** ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=niv ) : 11 then god said , `` let the land produce vegetation : seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it , according to their various kinds . '' and it was so . 
  12 the land produced vegetation : plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds . 
  and god saw that it was good . 
  13 and there was evening , and there was morning -- the third day . 
  ** dutch , day 3 continued ** : and the dutch said `` let there be gobs of tulips and some other stuff in the greenhouses , and there were gobs of tulips bearing bulbs . 
  and the dutch saw that it was good . 
  [ ** yahweh , day 4 ** ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=niv ) : and god said , `` let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night , and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times , and days and years , 15 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth . '' and it was so . 
  16 god made two great lights -- the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night . 
  he also made the stars . 
  17 god set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth , 18 to govern the day and the night , and to separate light from darkness . 
  and god saw that it was good . 
  19 and there was evening , and there was morning -- the fourth day . 
  ** dutch , day 4 ** : and the dutch said `` let the greenhouse lighting be placed on artificial timers , '' and it was so . 
  [ ** yahweh , day 5-6 ** ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=niv ) : and god said , `` let the water teem with living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky . '' 21 so god created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it , according to their kinds , and every winged bird according to its kind . 
  and god saw that it was good . 
  22 god blessed them and said , `` be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas , and let the birds increase on the earth . '' 23 and there was evening , and there was morning -- the fifth day . 
  and god said , `` let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds : the livestock , the creatures that move along the ground , and the wild animals , each according to its kind . '' and it was so . 
  25 god made the wild animals according to their kinds , the livestock according to their kinds , and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds . 
  and god saw that it was good . 
  ** dutch , day 5-6 ** : and the dutch said `` these gmos seem all right '' , and started creating new animals and plants . 
  and the dutch saw that it was good . 
  but what i mean is that if it 's tied to the idea that you want to have inflation more-restricted than would otherwise the case , then you 're back to my above objection :  if i 'm denominating oil or any other asset in a currency , the thing that 's interesting to me is the rate of ongoing inflation in that currency . 
  a one-off weakening in a currency does n't discourage me from denominating in that currency ( in fact , if the currency weakens before i do so , it 's even less-likely to do so after i 'd denominate my asset in that currency , which should be what i 'd care about ) . 
  that is , it should n't be particularly convincing to people trading oil to avoid trading in euro-denominated terms by weakening the euro . 
  it 's not the * absolute * strength of the currency that 's interesting -- it could be that a thousand euros equals one sandwich or one euro equals a sandwich , and it 's not as if an oil producer would care at the time of adoption . 
  it 's the change over time once the euro has been adopted . 
  if the us were to hypothetically weaken the euro * before * it 's been adopted by oil producers , it would not build a case against using the euro in this role . 
  to the extent that it would then be artificially-weakened ( and likely to strengthen ) , i would expect the euro to be more-appealing to oil producers , if anything . 
  ah , i did not know that . 
  would be interested if you have a link . 
  also , one * minor * tidbit that might be confusing you -- in both [ the us ] ( http://www.visanow.com/refugees-and-asylees/ ) and germany , i understand that `` refugee status '' and `` asylum status '' are actually slightly different , though we mostly use them interchangeably and for all intents and purposes they have the same effect once you have them . 
  basically , if you 're already * in * the us , you apply for asylum status , and if you 're not in the us but would like to come , you apply for refugee status . 
  that seems gamable to at least some degree . 
  supposing that i were to start a business that had people being paid less than market rate for their work . 
  in turn , part of their compensation would be that they could , unofficially , expect me to hang onto them for five years . 
  this happens to some degree in the us . 
  the h1-b program [ has ] ( http://cis.org/payscale-h1bwages ) ( note that the site i 'm linking to is opposed to immigration , but that as far as i know , its statistics are accurate ) pays a computer worker on h1-b $ 13k less than for a native worker . 
  that likely means that the employment status is worth something like $ 13k to the worker , and that it is priced into the salary . 
   the value of one dollar that has business with oil-sheik is more worth than the one dollar that does n't has business with oil-sheiks . 
  it produces inertia to the value of the thing such that increasing the money supply will produce less inflation , but that should require inflation , as per the above . 
   on top of that , the number of genuine refugees among this seemingly colossal influx is very well manageable . 
  i suspect that that 's something that some would disagree with , but i 'm not going to try to say `` n is sufficient '' or `` m is too many '' here -- it 's just that it is the route via which people are being accepted that creates the issue . 
   we only need to process them in a timely manner , send those back that are not really in need of our protection yeah , but a lot of those problems go away if the application itself is made overseas . 
  there 's no deporting involved , because the person is * already applying * overseas . 
  a person who has just burned their savings with a smuggler on getting to europe may be pretty upset and hard-to-process , and it 'd probably be in europe 's interest to not have people who are incredibly upset that they were just badly-burned floating around . 
  while it 'd solve the slovakia transit issues , it 'd be even better to not just accept refugee applications in greece , but in overseas camps as well . 
  once someone is in greece , you still have the above `` people wandering around at least in greece '' issue -- it does n't solve things from greece 's standpoint , even if it means that hungary is n't going nuts . 
   of course , that does absolutely not preclude being proactive and creating ways for refugees to be accepted into europe without requiring the services of traffickers in the first place . 
  it 's too optimistic , however , to believe that this would in itself stop all other attempted crossings , especially from libya . 
  no , but absolutely zero illegal immigration is n't a goal here -- nor need it be for the issue to be resolved . 
   well , qatar ( or some other oil-sheik country ) threatend usa , to stop selling oil in $ and instead use $ , that would had made a significant turn for the us economy . 
  i do n't understand all the implications of dollar-denominated oil . 
  however , this rationale does n't make much sense to me . 
  if i 'm denominating oil or any other asset in a currency , the thing that 's interesting to me is the rate of ongoing inflation in that currency . 
  a one-off weakening in a currency does n't discourage me from denominating in that currency ( in fact , if the currency weakens * before * i do so , it 's even less-likely to do so after i 'd denominate my asset in that currency , which should be what i 'd care about ) . 
   that 's not what your ( oft-repeated ) link says : that 's fair enough -- should just be immigrants . 
   it 's basically immeasurable , especially since there are a totally unknown number of illegal immigrants here . 
  estimates range from 10-30 million people . 
  no , but we can estimate it . 
   i 'm just laughing thinking how fucking mental the uk would be going if we were facing 1.5 million migrants in one year . 
  godspeed germany . 
  germany getting 1.5 m in a year is equivalent , on a per-capita basis , to about 187k in a year for greece . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/refugee-crisis-puts-athens-on-the-brink/a-18757016  to date in 2015 over 338,000 refugees and migrants are estimated to have entered greece by sea granted , they are n't all wanting to stay in greece , but it does give a picture of maybe how overlooked greece 's migrant-processing plight is . 
  well , the post i made that you 're responding to was correcting a number of incorrect claims in the post you made before that . 
  on the whole , as in , why did i post in the thread at all ? 
  it 's because i do think that people in european country x have legitimate grounds for concern about people traveling to their country and applying for asylum winding up permanently staying in that country . 
  now , you might say `` well , i 'm comfortable with substantial numbers of syrians/eritreans/somalians / etc permanently staying in germany '' or you might say `` well , i 've reason to believe that people * wo n't * want to permanently stay '' . 
  fair enough -- some people might disagree , but that 's not something that i 'd call out as wrong . 
  my objection is that saying that the concern is groundless because it 's not possible for people to stay permanently based on that initial temporary grant is n't correct . 
  once people are staying in germany or sweden or what-have-you , it 's certainly possible that they will never leave .
