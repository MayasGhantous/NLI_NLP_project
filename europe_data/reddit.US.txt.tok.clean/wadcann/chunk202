  you 're right that the * rationale * for refugee status being initially-created was to provide a temporary safe haven , but the fact that that was the initial rationale does not mean that it is not a useful legal loophole to move onto a route to permanently establish residence or become a citizen . 
  i do n't know . 
  but my point is that if you 're the one objecting to the policy , it should be expected to show the material supporting it . 
  i 've no objection to people bringing up statistics where they are supported . 
  thus far , though , the only really-interesting statistic i 've seen come up from people complaining about crime was that non-eu immigrants in finland [ had about four times the rape commission rate of finnish natives ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b2tfm/how_the_rape_in_tapanila_started_an_outrage/csin2oe ) . 
  that 's meaningful . 
  now , if people * are * committing crime at an elevated level , hey , i 'm all for highlighting that and bringing it to public attention . 
  it 's important , and it 's of public interest . 
  but it should be a real thing , something that should be supportable with statistics . 
  it 's too easy to get carried away with `` this is the * impression * i get '' type things and converting that into statements . 
  for example , i 've heard people talk about black people committing violent crimes in the us . 
  all right , you can dig up [ fbi racial statistics ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43 ) , compare to [ population demographics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_united_states#race_and_ethnicity ) , and find that there 's a legitimate basis here and you can quantify the number of times over the population as a whole that murder is committed . 
  that 's a real thing -- black people in the us really do commit murder at several times that of the populace as a whole . 
  on the other hand , i 've also heard people talk about all the crimes that illegal immigrants commit in the us . 
  if you go dig up incarceration statistics , illegal immigrants in the us -- obviously , disregarding the act of initially illegally-immigrating -- [ have a lower rate of being jailed for crime than do the native-born ] ( http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/myth-immigrant-criminality-and-paradox-assimilation ) . 
  i 'll believe that those people making the statement legitimately got the impression that illegal immigrants committed a lot of crime -- they probably were n't lying -- but they were wrong , or at least the data that we have available does n't support that . 
  finally , it 's easy for numbers to be mis-represented , and it 's hard for people to look for potential issues with the data being gathered without access to those numbers . 
  the only cure for that is just to make those statements based on statistics , and if they are n't available , to simply say `` it 's my impression that ... '', 
   firstly , asylum is not a residence permit [ wikipedia : german residence permit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_residence_permit ) :  a limited residence permit ( a so-called aufenthaltserlaubnis , literally residence permit ) is valid for a certain period of time and is issued for a certain purpose ... residence under international law or on humanitarian or political grounds people who are granted asylum in germany receive a residence permit . 
   the rejected applicants who are not deported or can not leave because they are not physically able to travel , do n't have a passport or face death in their countries of origin are merely tolerated , which means that deportation is suspended until they can leave . 
  this is also not a residence ... permit http://www.fluechtlingsrat-leverkusen.de/eng/3.4.4_ae_3en.htm  the types of aufenthaltserlaubnis ( temporary residence permit ) specified here will be granted , if , for instance , the asylum request was rejected and you can not leave the country . 
  people who do not receive asylum also receive a residence permit . 
  they do not receive the same privileges ( like freedom of labor within germany ) guaranteed refugees by the 1951 refugee convention . 
   less than 2 % of asylum seekers are even granted asylum . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_on_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applications,_2014_%28number,_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iv.png germany granted 33,310 refugee status grants of 97,275 first-instance evaluations in 2014 , or 34 % . 
  it granted another 7250 positive grants of another form in 2014 , or another 7.5 % . 
   this is also not ... a work permit the 1951 refugee convention requires that signatory countries , of which germany is one , grant the same rights to labor in germany that germany does to any guest workers : https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention  article 17 , wage-earning employment   the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the most favourable treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign country in the same circumstances , as regards the right to engage in wage-earning employment . 
  technically , germany could expel all guest workers and also deny refugees the ability to work and remain conformant to the 1951 refugee convention , but it 's obviously very undesirable for germany to do that . 
  i agree that germany is under no legal obligation from the 1951 refugee convention to provide work access to the 7.5 % granted non-refugee-but-not-denied-the-ability-to-stay status above ; it is for the 34 % who were granted refugee status . 
  it may additionally provide such access , or there might be eu requirements , but i do not claim that germany provides same or is bound to do so . 
   but i disagree about the assessment that it 's caused by some kind of caps i 'm not saying that it is . 
  i 'm saying that it 's the illegal migration that is causing the issues . 
  the problem is that germany ( and sweden and so forth ) do not want unlimited acceptance of refugees . 
  that seems reasonable to me -- there are realistic , practical concerns here . 
  however , the convention does n't permit for caps . 
  so what they do is rely on establishing a lot of barriers to make it really hard for a refugee to actually apply for refugee status in that country -- they have to traverse multiple countries illegally ( or find someone who can just air-drop them into the country without caring about the fact that their aircraft might get confiscated for human smuggling ) . 
  that is not such a crazy idea in theory -- it has the * pragmatic * effect of limiting the rate of immigration , and it does n't require violating or revising or withdrawing from the 1951 refugee convention . 
  maybe people would choose not to come to germany at all if it were hard enough to do so . 
  however , when it was actually tried , it turned out that the theory does n't actually work out well -- trying to use italy and greece and so forth as a flow-rate limiter to germany and sweden just results in massive logistical problems in those countries . 
  so , i 'm saying `` well , the right answer is to stop creating the incentive to illegally-immigrate across europe '' . 
  that can be done by simply accepting applications for refugee status at refugee camps in turkey , jordan , lebanon , etc. 
  * however * , that brings back up the old problem that germany and sweden and friends do not want the entire contents of those countries dumped into them that they originally tried to address by leveraging the `` directly from '' tidbit in the 1951 refugee convention . 
  that seems to me to be a very legitimate concern . 
  so i 'm saying `` just recognize the fact that for all practical purposes , you need to impose a cap , impose that cap with whatever legal rationale you find to be convention , and then go accept applications in turkey/lebanon/jordan '' . 
  that ends the bad incentives to be smuggled across the med and then illegally wander through europe , since either you get refugee status without illegal immigration * or * you were n't going to get refugee status anyway . 
  i * also * would advocate that germany continue to accept applications locally , because there 's no reason to * exclude * people once you 're also accepting them in turkey/lebanon/jordan . 
  so , doing this : * the refugees do n't lose out . 
  there is , whether it is recognized or not , a cap on how many people germany is willing to take in , and that cap was going to be imposed anyway . 
  * germany does n't lose out . 
  it 's still taking in refugees in whatever numbers it viewed as acceptable . 
  * the situation of the transit countries is greatly improved , since they no longer have floods of people washing across them trying to get to germany or sweden . 
   to use them against nato countries in baltic sea , well ... i suppose it would be useful if the regimes in syria or vietnam or similar fall and the russians want to re-establish it . 
  i mean , i strongly suspect that there are reasons why russia might want to conduct amphibious invasions of countries other than just the baltic countries . 
  well , italy has a larger economy than russia . 
  `` richer '' can mean various per-capita things too . 
  during world war ii , things sure went a lot faster than that . 
   many of these clubs are owned by middle-aged , predominantly foreign white men who are not in touch with london 's culture or multiculturalism . 
  if that is , in fact , true , and said owners are doing a poor job of serving those customers because of the fact that they are male , white , middle-aged and foreign ( which i 'm a bit dubious about , but let 's go with it for the sake of discussion ) , then it simply opens a lucrative door for someone ( i guess older , female , black , and british ) to open up a competing nightclub that does a better job of serving customers , which can then siphon off customers . 
  the market should have no problem sorting that out . 
  the issue i 'm raising is the number of people moving illegally across europe . 
  germany can set whatever cap it wants -- my point is that trying to limit flow via requiring illegal immigration that causes major problems for other european countries * is * a bad idea . 
  if germany is going to accept n refugees , regardless of whatever the n is , having them first stream across europe illegally is in no way advantageous to germany or europe . 
  germany might have , at one point , thought that it was a convenient loophole to limit the rate of refugee applications without needing to confront changes in the 1951 refugee convention and set caps , but the us already sets caps . 
  http://www.expatica.com/de/visas-and-permits/a-guide-to-german-citizenship-and-permanent-visas_108795.html  permanent ec residence   if you have been living in germany on a residence permit for five years , and satisfy certain other conditions , then you are entitled to stay on in germany indefinitely on a permanent ec resident permit . 
  once you have this permit , whether it 's from germany or another eu country , then you can live elsewhere in the eu permanently , too . 
    you must :   * have been living in germany for five , uninterrupted , years ;   * have a secure livelihood with health insurance and provision for retirement ( pension ) ;   * have adequate living space ;   * possess adequate german language skills and a basic knowledge of german life , legal and social systems ( by taking an integration course ) ;   * not have a criminal record . 
    settlement permit   a settlement permit also allows you to stay in germany permanently . 
  it is very similar to the permanent ec resident title except that it does not allow you to move around the eu , and , in certain conditions , you can get it much sooner than five years . 
  i think that a number of people would prefer that the existing skilled-worker bar be used rather than the lower bar of `` get asylum , wait five years , meet the above criteria '' . 
  certainly that would be my preference for the us . 
  why does the us have interest in the relative strength of eu member economies to the us ? 
  sure , it 'd be great if the us does better than it presently is in absolute terms , but that 's a different story . 
  let 's say that tomorrow , eu member states undergo a huge economic contraction . 
  how is this advantageous to the us ? 
  it eliminates sources of trade , so in absolute terms , it 's a loss in that it will tend to hurt the us in the loss of that trade . 
  no , but there are routes via which it leads to permanent residency . 
  i agree on the `` funding frontex is not a meaningful short-term response '' point , but i disagree that simply encouraging illegal immigration is a good idea -- that 's what * caused * the initial problem . 
  it would make much more sense to simply announce that germany is accepting refugee applications , in , say , turkish camps , that there is a cap on available slots , and that no preference will be given to those applying locally in germany . 
  well , maybe she 's stressing that now . 
  i ca n't believe that you beat the hipster hitler guy to that . 
  anglo-saxons and normans ? 
  okay , * why * does the us want to cause stagnation in eu economies ? 
  i think that statistics are lacking here -- that sounds uncomfortably like a claim of meaningful change that 's easy to latch onto without a real , measurable difference . 
  to say that this is meaningful , i 'd want to know what the ambush rate was , say , four years ago , and what it is now . 
  and if those numbers are n't available , it 's not clear to me that this statement is worth making -- it may not be supportable . 
  i think that he 's reasoning from first principles , seeing what would be best as a policy , not just trying to examine what current obligations would require . 
   but that 's not in their plans , they wants to halt , stagnate , our economy . 
  oh , for crying out loud . 
  the us definitely does not have interest in producing stagnation in the eu . 
   because after all you are the `` good guys '' . 
  darn straight !, 
  http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/11/turkey-syria-diplomats-nato.html  ** no chance turkey will be ` kicked out of nato ' ** [ snip ]  they pointed out that it 's a long shot , however , to look at this and argue that turkey should be expelled from nato . 
    these diplomats underscored the fact that there is no risk of this happening given turkey 's crucial geostrategic place on the map , and declared that security ties with ankara will remain strong , despite differences . 
    `` all the talk about kicking turkey out of nato reflects emotions more than facts . 
  it shows there is public frustration . 
  but the situation is a complex one , '' said a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his position . 
  `` no one will risk alienating turkey at a time like this because it is geographically placed at the center of almost all the crises the west is closely concerned with . '' [ snip ]  `` at any rate , talk of kicking turkey out is idle because nato does not have rules for this .

   but creating a subreddit that is handpicking user comments like that ? 
  that 's just ridiculous .
