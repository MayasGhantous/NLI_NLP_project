  well , saudi arabia is boned . 
  [ they only budgeted for 200 mosques ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/saudi-arabia-offers-germany-200-mosques-one-for-every-100-refugees-who-arrived-last-weekend-10495082.html ) . 
  they are n't currently eu citizens , so no freedom of labor elsewhere . 
  so ( aside from the broader issues of the migrant crisis ) i understand that germany is facing two problems : * a large number of people with dubious ability to find skilled employment showing up all at once . 
  * a lot of unskilled construction work on housing that needs to be done in the locations where migrants are . 
  if germany truly wants all of these people to stay , there does seem to be a kill-two-birds-with-one-stone approach . 
   us # 1 hell yes !, 
  honestly , though , pretty sure the [ ussr flooding the world with the ak-47 to put an end to colonialism played a bigger role ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-47#cultural_influence_and_impact ) . 
  if the coalition stopped backing the fsa and russia assad , it seems possible that isil would come out on top . 
  that might decrease refugees ... it might also increase them . 
   because one thing affects all and everybody , including the more skillfull in the immediate term , yes . 
  but then the people who are now being paid below-market-rate can demand raises in excess of inflation , whereas the people who were not doing so ca n't . 
   even here in ` murrica i do n't think you can get a grenade unless you pull off a heist on an armory . 
  [ yes , you can . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/title_ii_weapons ) you have to deal with the federal paperwork and fees -- it 's not as trivial as [ walking into wal-mart and coming out with a rifle ] ( http://www.walmart.com/browse/sports-outdoors/rifles/4125_546956_1107532_1225336_1225338 ) , and some states have banned them ( and as far as i know , that has n't been challenged in scotus ) but it is federally-legal . 
   title ii weapons , or nfa firearms ( weapons requiring a type 1 federal firearms license as well as a class iii special occupation tax to sell , and an atf form 4 with $ 200 tax stamp to purchase [ 1 ] ) , are certain firearms , explosive munitions , and other devices which are federally regulated in the united states by the national firearms act ( nfa ) . 
  [ snip ]  the ownership of title ii weapons is heavily regulated at both the state and federal level , but otherwise perfectly legal . 
  [ 27 ] numerous federal restrictions are imposed on the ownership of nfa firearms , including an extensive background check , a $ 200 tax on manufacture or transfer of an nfa firearm , and registration with the nfa registry . 
   title ii of the gun control act of 1968 is a revision of the national firearms act of 1934 , and pertains to machine guns , short or `` sawed-off '' shotguns and rifles , and so-called `` destructive devices '' ( including grenades , mortars , rocket launchers , large projectiles , and other heavy ordnance ) . 
   devaluing currency with free circulation of people and capital seems like an extremely bad idea i do n't see why the two are connected . 
  why would i find it more-compelling to leave if my wages are cut via inflation versus via having to change jobs ? 
   germany has faced worse crises before and emerged stronger than ever . 
  that 's probably not really a great metric , as i 'm pretty sure that the events that lead to severe issues do n't necessarily immediately appear to be unusually-severe . 
  i mean , i 'm pretty sure that the roman empire did n't look at a bunch of [ refugees showing up at the danube ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gothic_war_%28376%e2%80%93382%29 ) and say `` whoah , this is clearly worse than any other threat that the empire has ever faced before '' . 
  so should most or all of the current-day parties in europe with `` socialist '' in their names , but when your business is selling image , throwing out that image seems dicey . 
   in a market with free circulation of people and goods , assuming changing to a new currency will lead to its inevitable devaluation , what do you think it would happen to emigration ? 
  how to keep doctors and nurses and masons if their salaries go down and they can move anywhere else in the eu ? 
  i do n't believe that switching currencies is a cure-all , however , i do n't see why that 's the objection . 
  you can not maintain a trade imbalance persistently . 
  one way or another , pressures are going to be applied and wages will fall . 
  either the euro is used and those masons will be laid off and then re-hired at lower euro wages * or * the escudo is used and their real wages will just fall due to the escudo dropping relative to the euro . 
  the issue that people will leave for germany given freedom of labor is , it seems to me , a broader issue , and unrelated to the one of currency choice . 
   while immigration is generally great for a country 's economy in the long run skilled , selective immigration . 
  edit : well , i suppose i should really ask for `` great for a country 's economy '' to be defined before making that statement . 
  for example , it probably increases gdp , even if it winds up decreasing per-capita gdp . 
  the author might view that as great -- india has a poor people , but a higher gdp than switzerland . 
  if you take in a lot of random rural farmers from india , you 'll almost-certainly get more economic activity ... but in a welfare state , it may have effects that most would view as undesirable , like lowering the living standard of existing residents . 
  trucidator , you 're a fairly high-profile brit euroskeptic on here . 
  a couple questions , since i 'm curious about this : * if the eu terminated the `` ever-closer union '' bit , would you be comfortable with eu membership ? 
  that is , is your concern * future * changes or the status quo ? 
  * what are the main reasons that you object to uk membership in the eu ? 
  * what is the alternative that you propose ? 
  if it 's `` lone uk '' , what is your view on the possibility of ( long-term ) military conflict with the eu ? 
  conflict with a unified continent has been a historical concern for the uk . 
  * if there is a way to reform the eu to make it appealing to you , what changes would be required ? 
  * do you feel that your concerns also apply to other eu members ? 
  that is , do you think that france and germany should also exit , or do you feel that the concerns are unique to the uk ? 
  the eu has the economy and technology to be a military superpower if it chose to do so . 
   now compare it with how many times these people have negotiated with merkel , holland and cameron . 
  that 's because currently , the member states have not collectively wanted to give up the degree of authority to the eu to make juncker the most important authority in europe . 
  just because the uk chose to let ireland have independence and scotland hold a referendum on independence does not mean that every time one of its regions wants to spin off , that it will take that route . 
  now , true , the uk could n't , via veto , stop the eu from recognizing independence of any component of the uk that it wanted to . 
  in the same sense , the us could n't stop canada from saying `` north dakota is now independent and part of canada '' . 
  however , the country that you 're trying to split up will probably take a pretty dim view of this sort of thing . 
  obama has been attending the ( controversial ) christian church of [ trinity united church of christ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trinity_united_church_of_christ ) since 1988 , when [ he was 26 ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-ties-to-church-examined/ ) -- a decade before he became a politician . 
  if he 's a muslim , he 's constructed himself an awfully deep cover . 
  i think that obama being a muslim is about as plausible as for ron paul to be an ardent communist or bernie sanders to be just waiting to spring anarcho-capitalism on the country . 
  obama [ has publicly expressed support for germany taking in lots of refugees ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/social-europe-jobs/obama-praises-germanys-role-refugee-crisis-317114 ) . 
  i 'd guess that this is either because each one that 's taken in in germany is one that the us does n't have to deal with or because it plays well with domestic crowds . 
  if they get rejected , then just walk over to sweden and apply there , that would n't produce a deportation . 
  now , granted , that does n't mean that they 're not staying in europe , but it also does n't mean that they 're staying in germany . 
  while i do think that coffee is the most absurdly over-hyped thing in existence -- it 's some hot water drained past some mashed beans , dammit -- it 's certainly possible to get strong coffees in the us as well . 
  edit : well , i suppose that wine probably beats coffee , but i tend to run into coffee culture more than wine culture . 
  this is [ betteridge 's law of headlines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ) . 
  i 'm not sure that `` old adage '' is really correct , since wikipedia dates the earliest-known description of the phenomenon in newspapers to 2004 . 
  is n't that a false dichotomy ? 
  presumably the two are n't exclusive . 
   `` there should never be a trade-off between economic interests and the lives and liberties of people . '', 
  there pretty much is going to be if both involve use of resources . 
  i 'm actually really surprised not to see various advocacy groups on each side of the issue with various models coming up with estimates on each end . 
   for the moment , the kremlin has been dialing back the tensions in ukraine , which could lead to an easing of the sanctions imposed by the u.s. and europe over the crisis there . 
  so , `` dialing back the tensions '' being `` leaving crimea '' ? 
   jsut start another holocaust but with muslims two points : * no reason to kill people when you can just deport them . 
  there 's a pull factor right now -- people angling for migrating to europe . 
  if that does n't exist , my guess is that the inflow wo n't either . 
  * even [ hitler wanted to just deport people , not kill them , and it was logistical constraints preventing that deportation that led to the holocaust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that it 's possible to resolve the issue without outdoing hitler . 
  they 're [ not the only ones to do that sort of thing ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/19/gibraltar.world ) . 
   if you think all your neighbors are ass holes than there may be something wrong with you . 
  poor south korea . 
  on one hand , it seems an incredibly inane thing to me to get upset about . 
  on the other hand , until some greek guy straightened me out , i * also * thought that modern-day macedonia did the ancient greek empire , so there clearly is room for confusion . 
  also , the dutch clearly belong to the deutsch . 
  i was about to say `` that 's not true -- the us * used * to spend over half of the world 's military expenditures , but it 's come down since then '' . 
  i saw the same chart you linked and thought `` huh , i guess i was wrong -- the us is still just over half '' -- but that 's not the case . 
  that chart only shows the top ten military spending countries . 
  the us should be below half now . 
  nah , i 'm saying that the brits limit the former and permit more of the latter . 
  nukes are a strong symbol . 
  awfully-different question . 
  polish nukes means that the existing nuclear powers get irate with you ( and thus far , newcomers to the game have been snubbed to varying degrees for non-proliferation reasons ) . 
  on the other hand , as the unsc shows , at least to some degree , nukes do tend to translate to influence . 
  the problem is that living in the iranian window ( unable to achieve nuclear weapons , but working on it ) is expensive . 
  [ hosting us nukes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_sharing ) ... i do n't understand all of the game theory behind this , and i 'm pretty sure that it 's more complicated than what i see , too . 
  i kind of want to find a book about it and read it . 
  i would guess -- and i claim no expertise here -- that there are a couple of major factors here : * nukes being captured is not desirable . 
  there 's probably an argument that having nukes will make a country more likely ( or more credible in its claims that it will ) defend the area with the nukes conventionally . 
  my * guess * is that this is behind russia 's moves to placing nuclear-capable weapons [ in kaliningrad ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-placing-state-of-the-art-missiles-in-kaliningrad-2015-3 ) .
