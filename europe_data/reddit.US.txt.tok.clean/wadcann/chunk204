  this is probably advantageous to poland since it increases both probability of us involvement and credibility of us claims of involvement . 
  this is probably disadvantageous to russia , since it reduces their ability to act against poland . 
  this is both disadvantageous to the us , since it constrains us action towards involvement , and advantageous to the us in that it lets the us issue more-credible statements about becoming involved in a country . 
  * nukes being moved close to a front line increase [ first-strike capability ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-emptive_nuclear_strike ) , since there 's less time until the thing actually impacts -- the soviet missiles in cuba and the us missiles in turkey drove the cuban missile crisis . 
  poland hosting us nuclear weapons tends to make russia more-vulnerable to a first strike . 
  this also means that the other side likely gets twitchy about this . 
  this is potentially advantageous and disadvantageous to poland and the us in that it increases first-strike capability ... but disadvantageous in that it probably also places pressure russia to try to discourage it , and since that first-strike capability is unlikely to be used , may not buy much . 
  it is definitely disadvantageous to russia . 
  * because a nuclear weapon represents [ second-strike capability ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_strike ) , and the weapon does not require launch authorization from the host , it means that the host of a us nuclear weapon effectively automatically gets drawn into a nuclear war if the us is attacked with nuclear weapons -- this is because if the us were attacked by a first strike ( and as exceedingly-risky as it might be , this is probably the most-realistic existential military threat to the us today ) , it would probably respond with all remaining weapons . 
  thus , destroying these weapons as well becomes essential in a first strike -- which means nuking the host as well . 
  thus , trying to engage in a first strike against the us requires also inflicting a severe blow against a number of major european powers . 
  this is disadvantageous to poland , since it represents risk with no real payoff ( other than whatever it can get in exchange ) . 
  this is disadvantageous to russia , since it constrains its ability to perform a first strike on the united states . 
  this is advantageous to the united states because it helps increase the costs of attacking probably its weakest military point ; however , it more-advantageous to have the weapons in militarily-powerful countries . 
  * because the us [ somewhat-dubiously follows the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in training other countries to use the nuclear weapons themselves , this permits the us to rapidly elevate that country to the level of a nuclear power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_sharing#nuclear_non-proliferation_treaty_considerations ) : the military of that country can use it once the us sends out activation codes , and there 's thus the technical , albeit treaty-violating , ability to delegate authority over nukes . 
  this is advantageous to poland in that in certain disputes , it may wind up with the ability to threaten use of and make use of nuclear weapons . 
  this is obviously disadvantageous to russia in every way -- it increases the number of people who might use nuclear weapons . 
  this is advantageous to the us , in that it can permit ( and only on its own terms ) more-credible threats to be made . 
  for example , putin : `` obama , i 'm going to invade poland . 
  this is your advance warning . 
  you 're not going to do anything to our military , because you do n't care enough to risk nuclear attacks on san francisco and new york over me just attacking someone else . '', 
  obama < pushes button  : `` well , that 's one analysis . 
  now the poles have nuclear weapons . 
  are you as sure that they are similarly-unwilling to make use of them while poland is being invaded ? '', 
  finally , because every characteristic above is disadvantageous to russia , the * threat * of hosting nuclear weapons may have some value on its own , because russia would really rather not have the nukes there . 
  it 's not clear whether the uk threatening russia with [ shoveling us nukes back into the uk ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/uk-could-host-us-nuclear-weapons-again-white-house-weighs-response-russia-1956573 ) is to accomplish anything beyond the fact that it 's a disincentive to russia to have them there . 
  however , obviously the fact that 10 downing is publicly announcing the fact that it is producing plans to do so is because it hopes that the announcement will influence russia . 
   washington is controlled by jewish organisations , jewish organisations are controlled by reptilians and reptilians are controlled by aliens .

  that 's ... an interesting point , and embarrassingly-enough , not something that i 'd thought about . 
  i always vaguely thought of countries joining up in iraq as a `` okay , the us is running around yelling , let 's go keep the us happy '' , but there are real-life interests and goals beyond that .

  that does n't conflict with what i said . 
    do i need to remember you that us is the only country in the world that used mass destruction weapons against civilian population ? 
    atomic weapons , not `` weapons of mass destruction '' , which includes various weapons that other countries have used , there are countries that have used chemical weapons against civilian populations .

  i do n't think i 've ever met someone here who says that they do n't like canada . 
  i also always vaguely thought that austrians and germans were pretty much identical , so maybe that 's common ? 
  canada and the us have a lot of similarities . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_turkey  although the turkish government states that more than 99 % of the population is nominally muslim , academic research and polls give different results of the percentage of muslims which are usually lower , most of which are above the 90 % range . 
  in a poll conducted by sabanc\u0131 university , 98.3 % of turks revealed they were muslim .

  other than maybe not backing finland in world war 2 ( and that 's really finland 's fault , not sweden 's -- finland should have lined up alliances ahead-of-time ) , i 'm not clear why sweden would feel guilty about world war 2 . 
  [ shantytowns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shanty_town ) can presumably take up the slack :  although shanty towns are less common in developed countries , there are some cities that have them . 
  while shanty towns are less common in europe , the growing influx of illegal immigrants have fueled shantytowns in cities commonly used as a point of entry into the eu , including athens and patras in greece .

  i really , strongly suspect that there is a substantial human-smuggling industry happening across the english channel . 
  there are too many small boats and too narrow a stretch of water for it not to be happening . 
  calais tunnel breakins is just where people who do n't have funds/access to human smuggling will wind up . 
  i 'd be more-worried about segregating various muslim factions than christian and muslim groups .

   `` think of how stupid the average person is , and realize half of them are stupider than that . ''    -- george carlin it should be `` median '' , as `` average '' normally refers to `` mean '' . 
  it requires that whatever stupidity metric you 're using does n't put people in the same bucket ( `` equal stupidity '' ) right around that median , and ( to an obviously less-significant-degree ) requires that there be an even number of people .

  starting from a non-english language puts it at a disadvantage , since either you have to dub -- and get sometimes less-than-ideal lip synch -- or sub , and while i 'm fine with that , i suspect that it 's not comfortable for some people to read at the required rate while following the move , particularly young kids . 
  i do n't watch many new movies , but let 's see , what foreign-language media have i enjoyed ? 
  * the german [ * das boot * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/das_boot ) is probably my favorite naval warfare movie ( and i 've probably watched just about every naval warfare movie out there , so that 's saying something ) . 
  * the french [ * am\u00e9lie * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/am%c3%a9lie ) * the spanish [ * pan 's labyrinth * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan%27s_labyrinth ) * the italian [ * the good , the bad , and the ugly * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_good,_the_bad_and_the_ugly ) and [ sergio leone 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergio_leone ) later [ * once upon a time in the west * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/once_upon_a_time_in_the_west ) . 
  in fact , that 's a great example of taking a us-originating film genre ( the [ western ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_%28genre%29 ) ) and then generating a new genre ( the italian [ spaghetti western ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spaghetti_western ) genre ) that became quite popular in the us . 
  of course , these had been intended to target the us market as well from the get-go and made use of famous american actors , so maybe you do n't count it as foreign ? 
  * a ridiculous amount of japanese anime -- that 's a japanese-dominated field , and i 'm actually kind of surprised that high-quality , serious , hand animation did n't catch on elsewhere a lot sooner -- in the us for a very long time , it was heavily a low-budget thing for children . 
  * the japanese [ * seven samurai * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_samurai ) and other [ akira kurosawa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akira_kurosawa ) work . 
  i guess that i do n't listen to a whole lot of music in general , but the german-language [ rammstein ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rammstein ) and [ asp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asp_%28band%29 ) are on my regular playlist . 
  i 've typically been disappointed with english language lyrics in music when i understand them or look them up , and i 've actively-avoided looking up english lytric translations of the above , in fact -- but i do like the music .
