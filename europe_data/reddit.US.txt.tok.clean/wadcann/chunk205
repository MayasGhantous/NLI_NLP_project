  i suppose there 's a certain irony in me having [ * amerika * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxroitrg7tg ) in that playlist ... 
  i like nickelback . 
   swedish music is exactly like american . 
  so perhaps a better term would be `` international '' ? 
   yeah , but do you know about any chinese superhero ? 
  superheroes themselves in the sense of spandex-clad people defeating implausible schemes to take over the world ( an artifact of the [ us comic code authority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comics_code_authority ) ) with secret identities and superhuman powers are a us-developed genre , so the question is kind of loaded . 
  if you broaden the question a bit to just include people who fight with unrealistically-superhuman ability , yeah , you could include things like [ * crouching tiger , hidden dragon * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crouching_tiger,_hidden_dragon ) . 
   nobody can make a 300 million movie in france well , maybe not if it 's only going to sell to the french market . 
  in fact , frankly , i think that lyrics tend to be kind of disappointing . 
  there are many people who enjoy music while mis-hearing its lyrics and thinking that something was said other than the actual lyric . 
   [ post from guy with a british flair ]   english is the global language now thanks to america , heh . 
  not the british empire ? 
   i meant to say i have nowhere seen a headline about usa well , the problem is probably that you 've only been a reddit user for six hours , whereas the [ submission of said headline to / r/europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nbk88/three_m%c3%a9decins_sans_fronti%c3%a8res_staff_killed_in/ ) was * eight * hours ago . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intellectual ) :  an intellectual is a person who engages in critical study , thought , and reflection about the reality of society , and proposes solutions for the normative problems of that society , and , by such discourse in the public sphere , he or she gains authority within the public opinion . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] < looks at the number of subscribers and the voting system  i guess that 's us !, 
   french governments worry terribly that their island of culture is disappearing under a global tide of anglo-saxon pulp . 
  french culture is whatever french people wind up doing . 
  same as every other country . 
  it 's not as if george washington regularly engaged in street-dancing to hip-hop . 
  there 's no purebred pedigree there . 
  it 's just what became popular . 
  is it tainted because somewhere between then and now , it happened to become popular on one landmass rather than another ? 
  if the idea is to say `` kids must like the same fads and artists as their parents '' , good luck with that . 
  when i think of french culture that has a meaningful impact on pop culture in the us , i do n't think of moldy books from [ rousseau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-jacques_rousseau ) . 
  i think of [ parkour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parkour ) invading many popular video games . 
  ooop , guess you 're right , [ based on this source ] ( http://20thcenturybattles.com/2013/06/03/the-misunderstood-finnish-swastika/ ) !, 
   the swastika was also used by the finnish air force until 1945 , but is still used in air force flags . 
  that was a lot more-interesting and insightful than i initially-expected . 
  second the `` this is worth a read '' bit . 
  edit : though it 's also much-longer than it really needs to be to get its point across . 
  it would be better-written not as a narrative of the author 's thought process over time . 
  fair enough . 
  certainly europe is n't facing famine , and would be able to outbid other chunks of the world for food if food were globally scarce . 
  [ an * economist * chart showing the percent of total houshold spending going towards food and drink in 2011 ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/03/daily-chart-5 ) . 
  the numbers here range from a low of about 13 % of household income in the uk to a high of about 47 % in belarus . 
  [ this question ] ( https://gmoanswers.com/ask/are-gmos-increasing-price-food-submitted-part-gmo-answers-top-consumer-questions-survey ) references some estimates ; as of 2010 ( the most-recent chunk of numbers listed ) , avoiding use of gmos would increase prices by between 3.8 % to 9.6 % of the staple foods that were examined . 
  there 's also the question of what the effects on exports are , since it 's not merely a ban on domestic consumption -- the eu is a major food exporter , and this makes exports not price-competitive with gmo variants produced elsewhere . 
  hmm . 
  how do you define `` overpopulation '' ? 
  of the [ top twenty countries or sovereign territories by population density ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density ) , nine of the top twenty were part of a european country . 
  this [ map of population density ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/countries_by_population_density_in_2015.svg ) has europe being relatively-dense as most of the world goes . 
  i 'm still not sure i 'm following . 
  is `` yellow plague '' a euphemism for the [ sa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sturmabteilung ) ? 
  at least in us english , `` brownshirts '' would ring a bell with a few people , but i 've never heard of `` yellow uniforms '' and certainly not `` yellow plague '' . 
  this is what i would think of as urban , not suburban . 
  i 'm not sure exactly what a `` muslim extremist continent '' would be , but i 'm pretty sure that europe is n't it . 
  i 'm pretty sure that he 's not a vanguardist revolutionary . 
  it 's a random comment from some bureaucrat . 
  i doubt that anyone will notice it after tomorrow . 
  i think that the polish-soviet union relationship is a little different from the north-south relationship . 
  the us navy honored general lee , probably the best-known confederate , by naming the [ * uss robert e lee * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_robert_e._lee_%28ssbn-601%29 ) , for example . 
  i have a hard time seeing independent poland christen a ship the * orp josef stalin * . 
  wikipedia says that the [ official symbol changed in 1944 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_air_force ) :  swedish count eric von rosen gave the finnish white government its second aircraft , a thulin typ d. [ 4 ] its pilot , lieutenant nils kindberg , flew the aircraft to vaasa on 6 march 1918 , carrying von rosen as a passenger ... this aircraft is considered by some to be the first aircraft of the finnish air force , since the finnish air force did not officially exist during the civil war , and it was only the red side who flew a few aircraft with the help of some russian pilots ... von rosen had painted his personal good luck charm on the thulin typ d aircraft . 
  this charm -- a blue swastika , the ancient symbol of the sun and good luck -- was adopted as the insignia of the finnish air force . 
  the white circular background was created when the finns tried to paint over the advertisement from the thulin air academy . 
  [ 5 ] the swastika was officially taken into use after an order by commander-in-chief c. g. e. mannerheim on 18 march 1918 . 
  the faf changed the insignia after 1944 , due to an allied control commission decree [ 6 ] prohibiting the existence of pro-hitler and fascism organizations . 
  the swastika was removed due to the resemblance to the nazi swastika . 
   we are very forgiving of the nation state , allowing our states to continue in spite of gross mismanagement , < shifts eyes to the catalan secessionists , 
  that was written after world war ii , though . 
  post-iraq , looks a bit less-appealing . 
   heard about any polish corporation operating worldwide [gog.com ] ( http://www.gog.com/ ) ? 
  does the cap exist in order to buy political support from small-scale farmers required to pass other policies that the uk would like ? 
   but cheering for murderer 's on any side of the political spectrum is not something i can condone nor should anyone i 'm fine with it on freedom of speech grounds . 
   much of the left has ditched universalism/secularism/free speech and embraced a kind of maoist , third-worldist ideology . 
  i have a very difficult time swallowing that [ maoism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maoism ) is more-popular among politically-left groups today than in , say , the 1960s . 
  i expect that there always have been both left and right groups that are unhappy when freedom of speech looks like it 's harming their ideology . 
   never left their country in their mind kind of asserts that geography and ideology are bound up together . 
  it 'd be darn strange if i went to france and suddenly my political views were a clone of an average frenchman . 
  that 's a very weak statement to make . 
  i mean , i 'm enthusiastic about the fact that they were shot , but i certainly have * some * degree of sympathy . 
  i doubt that there 's any movement out there that i could n't find some degree of sympathy with . 
   realistically we should care a lot less about some random cartoonists getting shot up than america cares about it 's school shootings , but look how easily they shrug off a room full of dead kids without the slightest change in policy , bad example to choose -- these are low-impact in numbers , but extremely high media profile . 
  on the other hand , taking and exploring contrarian views is associated with critical thinking -- not simply blindly accepting whatever material someone gives you . 
  i think that many people would agree that this is something that has value . 
  hard to draw a line . 
  however : * they export more oil than russia . 
  * deposing the leadership would almost-assuredly result in a new leadership that would be worse on the grounds that people are upset here . 
  `` you '' being the united states ? 
  the period of occupation on the west german side [ terminated in 1955 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonn%e2%80%93paris_conventions ) . 
  i do not follow chancellor merkel 's politics very closely . 
  however , if the many german users who post here are correct about the two following points : * chancellor merkel 's statements have collectively never been aimed at explicitly encouraging more immigration ; rather , they were ambiguously-worded . 
  * chancellor merkel is famous for shifting her positions to track public opinion . 
  ... then such a statement seems unlikely . 
   [ sept. 24 ( bloomberg ) ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-24/u-s-drops-in-one-arabian-night-a-month-of-bombs-on-syria ) -- the u.s. dropped almost as many ~ ~ bombs ~ ~ flowers and ~ ~ missiles ~ ~ olive branches on islamic state positions in syria over the past two days as were used in the first month of ~ ~ attacks ~ ~ peace overtures on the extremist group in iraq .

  i realize that politics in general , and perhaps immigration even moreso , is a sensitive topic , but you can make the same point politely . 
   so we take a spectacular event that made national news and suggest that it happening is equal to a trend in sweden so widespread policing tactics are changing ? 
  no , i 'm saying that in the rare case where police * were * ambushed , the perpetrators were treated extremely harshly . 
   and it 's gone up even more since then . 
  according to google pde , they were at 2.1 in 2012 . 
  fwiw , 2.1 is approximately replacement rate in developed countries . 
  without the cap , would the eu 's open-market policies have been accepted ? 
  i assumed that it was a way of buying off small-scale farmers .
