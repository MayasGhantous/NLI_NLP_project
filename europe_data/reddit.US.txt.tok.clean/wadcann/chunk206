  the democratically-elected iraqi government did not want us soldiers to remain . 
  would you prefer that the us say `` no , the heck with your orders , we 're occupying you as long as we want '' ? 
  maybe bulgaria needs a website or something that contains a list of job offers with wages , because it sounds like there is some serious inefficiency in terms of labor finding where it should be if salaries for the same job see a 6:1 ratio from location to location . 
  hmm . 
  do n't you have to be kinda familiar with existing electrical standards , as well as pitfalls with it and changes that have happened from the past ? 
  i mean , [ california 's electrical code ] ( https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/bsc.ca.gov/gov.ca.bsc.2013.03.pdf ) is a thousand pages long as of 2014 . 
  the idea being `` instead of having a war , let 's just approximate our military might and formalize a process for resolving the thing that would reach the same outcome , and call it diplomacy '' . 
  if you start granting power that 's disconnected from military power , then the first time someone with disproportionately large military and small diplomatic clout gets upset , you get a war . 
  same sort of idea as democracy being a formalized , less-costly form of civil war and revolution -- instead of having each man pick up a sword and go out and chop each other up to fight over who runs things , we just all vote and get approximately the same effect , but without the blood and guts and pillage . 
  as hobbes puts it in * leviathan * , in his `` state of nature '' , each man has about the same ability to project force . 
  so a one-person-one-vote system kinda makes rough sense . 
  1971 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council  critics of the council often describe it as an undemocratic international body , and argue it fails its principal task , mainly because of the veto power granted to only five of its members -- russia , the united kingdom , france , china , and the united states . 
  [ snip ]  in mid-1944 , the delegations from the soviet union , the uk , the us and china met for the dumbarton oaks conference in washington , d.c. to negotiate the un 's structure , [ 10 ] and the composition of the un security council quickly became the dominant issue . 
  france , the republic of china , the soviet union , the uk , and us were selected as permanent members of the security council ; the us attempted to add brazil as a sixth member , but was opposed by the heads of the russian and british delegations . 
  [ 11 ] [ snip ]  on 25 october 1971 , over us opposition but with the support of many third world nations , the mainland , communist people 's republic of china was given the chinese seat on the security council in place of the republic of china that occupied taiwan ; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning us influence in the organization . 
  france is a nuclear power . 
  the only countries that are nuclear powers that lack permanent seats on the unsc are india , pakistan , north korea , and israel . 
  i suspect that all of these are vulnerable to a nuclear first strike ( e.g. 
  small stockpile or no ballistic missile-capable submarines ) . 
  france keeps ballistic missiles at sea * somewhere * , so at some point if paris vanishes in a mushroom cloud , the responsible party 's population is probably at risk of doing the same . 
  please hold off on personal attacks : you can make the same point just as well without name-calling . 
  last year , in stockton , california , there was a bank robbery by three [ norte\u00f1os ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norte%c3%b1os ) . 
  the suspects took a couple hostages and decided to stop and wait and use rifles to ambush the police that were following their getaway suv . 
  the bearcat armored personnel carrier that the police were following with and trying to keep in front of the pursuing police cars could n't keep up , so the unarmored police cars wound up taking fire . 
  the ambush attempts did n't actually manage to wound or kill any officers , but they managed to get the attention of all the area law enforcement agencies . 
  the [ point where their suv was finally stopped was videoed , and looked like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxb-d25vji8 ) . 
  note that one of the three suspects did survive the vehicle stop and ensuing gunfire with just wounds , though the state is presently in the process of [ aiming for the death penalty for the survivor ] ( http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-stockton-bank-robbery-trial-20150609-story.html ) . 
  i 'm suspicious that the jidf wound up being a net negative . 
  ditto for paying people to write pro-russian comments , though that 's still up in the air . 
  kinda undermines comment credibility in general . 
  i 'm enthusiastic about the us providing refuge for jews fleeing europe . 
  the last round worked out pretty well -- got lots of upstanding citizens . 
  honestly , i 'd be kind of pissed at someone , but i 'd have a hard time jailing most people for spraying someone with something slightly-annoying . 
  immigration is * a * solution to at least one issue , which is an imploding workforce at the same time that there 's a welfare system that performs intergenerational wealth transfer . 
  it may create issues of its own , and it may not solve all the issues you have ( will the income be at the same , level , and will the new population adopt your non-population-sustaining culture and basically die off themselves , or are they going to replace your culture with one that is sustainable ? 
  well , the whole point of a subsidy is that it would exist to transfer money . 
  i mean , it would n't make sense if it did n't perform a transfer . 
  well , one of the things that schools do is more-or-less providing raising services and childcare so that parents can work . 
  but the period involved is still maybe eight hours or so -- raise a kid , and for most people , most of their home time involves their kids from then on . 
  some places use boarding schools or summer camps where the kid gets sent away for a period of time over the year . 
  i was just wondering what would happen if the `` away '' time involved was shorter and more-frequent , if the state played a larger role in child-rearing , to lighten the burden in a more-fundamental way . 
  as a kid , you 'd just typically stay at the school for a stretch of 48 hours , sleep there , and so forth . 
  i do n't think that fully-socialized community raising works terribly well -- if you look at what communes have done , like some israeli [ kibbutzim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kibbutz ) , they have n't really met with overwhelming success . 
  so i think that the family model of raising children is still one that the state does not yet compete with well -- but perhaps having scheduled `` away time '' the way that people have weekends from work would make parenthood easier and more-appealing . 
  well , if it is n't going to be gdp-based , maybe it should also involve expenses being send to an eu pool that is , in one way or another , connected to gdp , since i think that there 's a very legitimate argument that there are economic costs associated with migrants . 
  this does seem to be an interesting general question for burden-sharing in the eu , not just an issue for the migrant crisis . 
  as usual , whenever [ this comes up ] ( https://i.imgur.com/fixzftr.png ) , time to post the kalashnikov comment . 
  i think that there are three major factors which would tend to favor review : * the original solution was intended as a stopgap internal-to-europe fix for the post-world war ii era , not a worldwide solution . 
  * there has been steady growth of the welfare state . 
  the guarantees provided in terms of benefits have become more-compelling . 
  * there has been increasing importance of educated labor . 
  it 's harder to pick someone out of a random country and put them to work in an industrialized country than it was a century ago . 
  there may be a good reason to have some sort of mechanism to deal with asylum , but i think that reviewing and perhaps altering the current arrangement is pretty legitimate . 
  it 's not just a `` oh , this came up now and so i need to throw it out because it 's inconvenient '' , but a real `` this may not be what we want to do '' issue . 
  oh , come on , merkel . 
  the eu already controls two seats . 
  the eu makes out * phenomenally * well compared to practical influence in the current situation . 
  that 's not a situation that i 'd want to upset . 
   it worked so well for the us . 
  nobody really thinks of themselves as a virginian any more -- it kinda did . 
  i mean , there are separations that show up , but where they do , it 's over political ideology or maybe race or something like that . 
  there is n't a lot of state-level nationalism . 
  i mean , texans are probably the most famously-proud , but ... that also means that when someone moves to texas , they tend to just pick up the same attitude . 
  you could say `` i do n't think that that 's * desirable * '' , but i think that it 's hard to say that it did n't * work * -- the us is , by-and-large , europe put in a blender and poured out . 
     how a compulsory program aimed at forced ( they get married and they become european , as do their children ) miscegenation is not a demographic or cultural genocide i can not fathom . 
  i do n't understand how erasmus is * forcing * a finn to marry a spaniard . 
  it 's just creating a situation that facilitates same . 
  i mean , i 'm all for adopting english , but why ca n't the esa put someone on mars ? 
   since there is no single `` eurolang '' the romanian says in english . 
  i mean , i guess you could just give them vouchers and let random food vendors sell stuff too . 
  i 'm not sure that i 'm comfortable classifying suicide as a mental health issue . 
  i can think of cases where i might want to commit suicide . 
  in countries without guns , you get people using other routes ( i 've had this discussion before with south korea , which has very few guns available -- there people have a wildly higher rate of suicide via fall -- e.g. 
  jumping off buildings -- and the rates are approximately the same ) . 
  in some european countries , you have legalized euthenasia . 
  i 'm somewhat sympathetic to this route as an alternative , since it means that someone will at least have someone talk to them before they just go off and do themselves in . 
  the obvious risk -- that you do n't want to be in a situation where doctors might be pressured to kill people or people pressured to go through with a suicide -- really does not seem insurmountable . 
  in the us , [ only vermont , oregon , and washington appear to permit active assisted suicide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euthanasia_in_the_united_states ) , though a couple of other states , like texas and california , permit removing life support . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_in_europe  the death penalty has been completely abolished in all european countries , except for belarus . 
  what if couples had some `` self time '' -- like , it was normal for schools to run two-day-a-week boarding school things , so that parents also have a break from parenting ? 
  2006 : https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/france-boosts-birth-rate-with-incentives-for-parents  paris , france , march 30 , 2006 ( lifesitenews.com ) -- efforts to increase the birth rate in france are beginning to have an impact on the nation 's population levels . 
  with a birth rate of 1.9 , france has reached second place in the rates of european countries -- only catholic ireland has more children being born . 
    in order to achieve this tenuous hold on a rising birth rate , the country has resorted to a whole gamut of financial incentives for parents , offering everything from graduated tax breaks to free family passes for museums and swimming pools . 
  2007 : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4274200.stm  france already has a generous childcare system , which has resulted in a birth rate of 1.9 children per family , well above the eu average of 1.5 . 
    but the government is worried that many middle-class professional women put off child-bearing until their late 20s . 
    the new financial incentives encourage families to have a third child . 
  it 's an interesting discussion point that fixed financial incentives presumably create disproportionate pressure on poorer families to have children : could be desirable , could be undesirable . 
  we broke up the old family and social system and `` if you have sex , you tend to have kids '' structure , and i think that the modern world is still figuring out what works as a sustainable replacement . 
  i do think that it 's entirely-possible to find a replacement , though -- just need to find the right incentives . 
   the u.k gdp is around # 3 billion so next to that it 's not that much . 
  the uk gdp is [ around # 3 * trillion * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  apple computer 's revenues in 2014 were $ 182b , and it sure is n't 60 times the size of the uk . 
  is there no fixed date ? 
  eh , people will build shantytowns . 
  well , for the us center-left , it 's because it 's an example of an economically-viable country with further-left policies than the us has . 
  for the us center-right , it 's because the us center-left uses it as an example . 
  i doubt that either are particularly-interested in what 's actually happening in scandinavia other than in how they might use it to influence domestic policy . 
  iirc when / u/sarmatae had a flair , it was bulgarian . 
   the weaker economies are lacking an essential tool to be competitive , which is a corresponding weaker currency . 
  wages can drop .
