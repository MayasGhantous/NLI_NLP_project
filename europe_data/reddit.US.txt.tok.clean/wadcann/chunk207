  it will mean people being fired and re-hired , and may be more costly , but you do n't * have * to have independent currencies . 
  the us has no problem violating international law on this point , and i think that it is a very difficult argument that regardless of the refugee situation , that all refugee applications can be accepted . 
  you might want a * high * cap , maybe high enough that it does n't apply in this conflict , but i 'm very doubtful that you want no cap at all , unless you plan to take in the people of every country in the world that sees war , persecution , and conflict ( or until you become poor enough not to be appealing as a destination , i suppose ) . 
   peter sutherland told peers the future prosperity of many eu states depended on them becoming multicultural . 
  [ snip ]  an ageing or declining native population in countries like germany or southern eu states was the `` key argument and , i hesitate to the use word because people have attacked it , for the development of multicultural states '' , he added . 
  i thought that `` multicultural '' was , in europe , a reference to having people not assimilate , but retain independent cultures side-by-side . 
  is it also a euphemism for `` multiracial '' ? 
  because the former sense seems pretty inapplicable to his argument . 
  he seems to be arguing for more raw numbers , and if he 's saying `` we need to draw from < random country around the world  to do that '' , i could maybe see him arguing for a multiracial society . 
  but i ca n't understand why a multicultural versus assimilation approach to doing that would be relevant at all -- you 'd think that you could pull people in either way . 
  germany , the eu , and nato [ are all now very unpopular in russia , not just the us ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/2-russian-public-opinion-putin-praised-west-panned/ ) . 
  [ russia is n't too popular around the world either ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/08/05/russia-putin-held-in-low-regard-around-the-world/ ) . 
   seems to be a reasonable analysis um . 
  i agree with the `` i 'm not at all sure that this is a brilliant move from putin '' sentiment , but the analysis here ? 
   let 's say the u.s. did nothing right now , and just let putin start bombing isis and bolstering assad . 
  how long before every sunni muslim in the middle east , not to mention every jihadist , has putin 's picture in a bull 's eye on his cellphone ? 
  i do n't see why this is particularly-threatening . 
  the us has been bombing isis for some time now , to say nothing of supporting the regime in iraq . 
  is russia particularly-vulnerable ? 
   the sunni muslims are the vast majority in syria . 
  they are the dominant sect in the arab world . 
  putin and russia would be seen as going all-in to protect assad , a pro-iranian , alawite/shiite genocidal war criminal . 
  putin would alienate the entire sunni muslim world , including russian muslims . 
  russia 's already been acting in concert with iran anyway . 
  to the extent that he 's taking a sunni/shiite side , it 's taken . 
   moreover , let 's say by some miracle the russians defeat isis . 
  the only way to keep them defeated is by replacing them with moderate sunnis . 
  syria 's regime had been doing all right for a long time . 
   which moderate sunnis are going to align with russia while putin is seen as the prime defender of the barrel-bombing murderer of more sunnis than anyone on the planet , bashar al-assad ? 
  the us has set up regimes after bombing them ( admittedly , iraq did n't work out all that well , but ... )  putin stupidly went into syria looking for a cheap sugar high to show his people that russia is still a world power . 
  or to retain an allied syrian leadership ? 
   attacking the minister is clearly a danger to the security of the country . 
  i do n't know what the story with the fire extinguisher is , but it is at least * possible * to interpret that as not being a serious crime . 
  i mean , it 's a dick move , yes . 
  and stabbing a police officer is serious . 
  and honestly , i would n't shed tears if the fire extinguisher blocked someone 's asylum attempt . 
  i 'm just saying that it 's not clearly wrong to treat spraying someone with a fire extinguisher as * not * being a serious crime . 
  well , they 're asking for an apology , not a government ban . 
  i would n't apologize either , but frankly , there are a lot of things that i 'd apologize for that are n't illegal . 
  i do n't think that norway permits for bans on this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_speech_by_country#norway  article 100 of the norwegian constitution has granted freedom of speech since 1814 and is mostly unchanged since then . 
  article 142 of the penal code is a law against blasphemy , but no one has been charged since 1933 , though it was upheld as late as 2004 . 
  article 135a of the penal code is a law against hate speech , which is [ debated and not widely used ] ( http://www.irr.org.uk/news/whatever-happened-to-norways-incitement-laws/ ) . 
    article 100 in the constitution states :   * there shall be freedom of expression . 
    * no person may be held liable in law for having imparted or received information , ideas or messages unless this can be justified in relation to the grounds for freedom of expression , which are the seeking of truth , the promotion of democracy and the individual 's freedom to form opinions . 
  such legal liability shall be prescribed by law . 
    * everyone shall be free to speak his mind frankly on the administration of the state and on any other subject whatsoever . 
  clearly defined limitations to this right may only be imposed when particularly weighty considerations so justify in relation to the grounds for freedom of expression . 
    * prior censorship and other preventive measures may not be applied unless so required in order to protect children and young persons from the harmful influence of moving pictures . 
  censorship of letters may only be imposed in institutions . 
    * everyone has a right of access to documents of the state and municipal administration and a right to follow the proceedings of the courts and democratically elected bodies . 
  limitations to this right may be prescribed by law to protect the privacy of the individual or for other weighty reasons . 
    * it is the responsibility of the authorities of the state to create conditions that facilitate open and enlightened public discourse . 
    norway has however several laws the bans the right to impart information , such as laws against alcohol and tobacco-advertisement in tv , radio , newspapers and on the internet . 
  the only exception listed there that might potentially be relevant would be the section 135 ( a ) of the norwegian general civil penal code . 
  an [ english translaction ] ( http://app.uio.no/ub/ujur/oversatte-lover/data/lov-19020522-010-eng.pdf ) of that snippet reads as follows :  section 135 a. 
  any person who wilfully or through gross negligence publically utters a discriminatory or hateful expression shall be liable to fines or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years . 
  an expression that is uttered in such a way that it is likely to reach a large number of persons shall be deemed equivalent to a publicly uttered expression , cf. 
  section 7 , no . 
  the use of symbols shall also be deemed to be an expression . 
  any person who aids and abets such an offence shall be liable to the same penalty . 
    a discriminatory or hateful expression here means threatening or insulting anyone , or inciting hatred or persecution of or contempt for anyone because of his or her   a ) skin colour or national or ethnic origin ,   b ) religion or life stance , or   c ) homosexuality , lifestyle or orientation . 
  that does n't look applicable here , even if there was a legal claim being made . 
   the us ( representing the nato as the strongest and leading country of it ) promised gorbatschow that the nato would expand a single meter eastwards . 
  offcourse they broke that promise [ nato-russia relations : the facts ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111767.htm )  ** claim : nato leaders promised at the time of german reunification that the alliance would not expand to the east **   fact : no such promise was ever made , and russia has never produced any evidence to back up its claim . 
    every formal decision which nato takes is adopted by consensus and recorded in writing . 
  there is no written record of any such decision having been taken by the alliance : therefore , no such promise can have been made . 
    moreover , at the time of the alleged promise , the warsaw pact still existed . 
  its members did not agree on its dissolution until 1991 . 
  therefore , it is not plausible to suggest that the idea of their accession to nato was on the agenda in 1989 . 
    this was confirmed by former soviet president mikhail gorbachev himself . 
  this is what mr gorbachev [ said ] ( http://rbth.co.uk/international/2014/10/16/mikhail_gorbachev_i_am_against_all_walls_40673.html ) on 15 october 2014 in an interview with rossiiskaya gazeta and russia beyond the headlines :    `` the topic of ` nato expansion ' was not discussed at all , and it was n't brought up in those years . 
  i say this with full responsibility . 
  not a single eastern european country raised the issue , not even after the warsaw pact ceased to exist in 1991 . 
  western leaders did n't bring it up , either . '', 
  well , what i was getting at is that the same rationale kinda was applied to international trade right before world war i , that economies were so intertwined that war between the industrial powers was no longer possible , and it did n't really pan out . 
  some people thought that major business magnates would manage to squash the war , but probably the most-high-profile example was [ henry ford trying to involve himself to end the war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_ship ) . 
  he did n't come anywhere near success . 
  < shrug  okay , i mean ... i 'm not adverse to the idea , but i do n't think that the us is going to be the nato member opposed to stronger sanctions . 
  the us already tends to avoid trade with russia , and while i have n't looked , i 'd guess that canada is in the same boat . 
  you 're going to need to sell countries like [ austria , hungary , greece , spain , italy , cyprus , and slovakia ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/russia-counts-eu-friends-avert-further-sanctions-303091 ) , which were dubious about sanctions . 
  let 's say that the eu establishes an army . 
  fair enough -- i think that there might be some reasonable arguments for that . 
  how does the establishment of an army achieve `` food for oil '' sanctions ? 
  or is the idea that the eu army would attack russian forces in crimea and dpr and restore that land to ukraine , and that sanctions really are n't all that interesting anyway ? 
  because i think that that 's going to be a tougher sell . 
  do n't get me wrong , i can see arguments for an eu army ... but i do n't really think that replacing nato in taking a stronger position on ukraine is that argument . 
    he is , but that is n't what nuclear weapons are for , they 're to prevent major wars like in the last century . 
    the world economy has already achieved that . 
  [ that 's what some people argued right before world war i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_illusion ) . 
  similarly , a motorcycle does not operate very well as a pencil ... and yet , i imagine that most people with a motorcycle would n't find the argument that a motorcycle makes a poor pencil to be a good argument to get rid of motorcycles . 
   as we see on syria example west ( us and a in particular ) would do anything to solve a global problem . 
  drink shampagne with putin ? 
  sure !, 
  forget crimea ? 
  why not !, 
  has this happened ? 
  i do n't see the us saying `` okay , sanctions gone '' . 
   cost of developing gmos is huge the cost to produce a given change via genetic engineering can be expected to be lower than the cost of producing that change via artificial selection -- that 's the reason behind the appeal , because it permits identifying changes much-more-quickly . 
  the barrier to entry is certainly higher -- i can do not-very-effective very-small-scale artificial selection in a window box tomorrow if i want , but it would certainly take me more time , effort , and gaining expertise to fiddle with gene sequences directly .
