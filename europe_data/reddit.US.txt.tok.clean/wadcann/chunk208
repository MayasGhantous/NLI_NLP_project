   and there wo n't be huge market where 1000 + companies will compete with each other . 
  i was looking at blackberry cultivars a while back . 
  i do n't know whether any/all of them were produced via genetic engineering , but they 're certainly an example of how many cultivars the market can commercially bear . 
  taking a [ quick glance ] ( http://www.fruit.cornell.edu/berry/production/pdfs/blkbvarietyreview.pdf ) :  ** darrow ** ( cornell university , ny ) produces large , long conic and often irregular , black , glossy fruit in the late season . 
  the fruit is mildly sub-acid with good quality . 
  secondary fruiting laterals produce fruit  into the early fall . 
  the erect canes are vigorous and winter hardy for a blackberry . 
    ** illini hardy ** ( university of illinois ) fruit is medium sized with good flavor and quality but acidic until fully ripe . 
  ripens in the late season . 
  canes are erect and vigorous with good winter hardiness . 
  it suckers mainly from the crown and is resistant to phytophthora root rot . 
    ** kiowa ** ( university of arkansas ) produces large fruit on erect canes . 
  yield potential is moderate over a long harvest period ( 6 weeks ) . 
    ** shawnee ** ( university of arkansas ) produces high yields over an extended period late into the season . 
  the fruit quality is good but tends to be so  ft and is suitable for local markets . 
    [ snip another 14 cultivars ] that 's for one berry , and just the ones listed on the first link i found . 
  if there was enough interest to develop this many cultivars of blackberries alone ( much less something like apples , with a very large number of varieties ) , is it unreasonable to believe that there 's room for a substantial number of companies ? 
   pretty much after a while it will be like in almost any other industry where few players will keep all the seeds . 
  i 'm not sure i follow . 
   do i need to tell you how wrong it is ? 
  from nation perspective , from farmer perspective , from consumer perspective ? 
  well , i do n't see any substantial downside from a nation 's perspective , no -- i 'm pretty enthusiastic about genetic engineering work on crops being done over here . 
  from a farmer 's perspective , there 's a legitimate concern * if * a company could become dominant -- if one company can make the only compelling product out there , normally if you 've got a supply chain where at some point in the supply chain , there 's only a single option , that 's where all the profit 's going to wind up . 
  but that 's no different from monopoly concerns in any other industry . 
  i do n't see how agriculture is special here , and we do well on a day-to-day basis in other industries . 
  from a consumer perspective , it sounds good to me -- if gmo options are * worse * from my standpoint , they wo n't sell , so if gmo has any impact on me at all , i expect it to be positive . 
   anti trust law ? 
  sure . 
  do you think they will be able to divide those megacorporations if they start to use their position ? 
  yes , but i do think that there are legitimate concerns about anti-trust in general . 
  but as i said , i do n't think that issues with monopoly dominate industry in all the other fields that i purchase products in on a daily basis . 
   like i said earlier if people will start to use better gmos than their normal ones this means other types of food will vanish . 
  after a while you wo n't be able to buy normal seeds because no one will be selling them . 
    finally monocultures . 
  go read about that . 
  these last two seem to be one concern . 
  if you want to purchase seeds and there 's sufficient demand to support someone retailing , they 'll certainly exist ; even if that were n't the case , there are [ seed banks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seed_bank ) that exist around the world specifically to retain copies of useful not-commercially-competitive seeds , because they might come in handy at one point , are hard to produce , and are n't all that expensive to store . 
  i do n't think that this concern is specific to genetic engineering or addressed by banning gmos , though -- the same issue comes up with artificial ( or , heck , even natural ) selection . 
   as for technological aspect . 
  question . 
  do `` some money '' ( because this will be only one branch of economy is worth the risk of destroying home seed market and everything above ? 
  well , money is just a counter , the incentive to produce something that has real value . 
  the reasons that i 'd purchase improved cultivars -- longer shelf life , disease resistance ( for me as a consumer , not having shortages or bad seasons ) , better resistance to transport ( better condition food when i get it , less expensive if more suppliers become available ) ... yeah , i think that those are a valuable goal . 
  i do n't think that gmos * are * a risk of destroying a domestic seed market , but ... let 's say that you are concerned about that ... would n't it * still * make sense to ban externally-developed gmos rather than banning use of gmos , so at least poland could still domestically-develop her own improvements ? 
  interesting , thanks . 
  the first link probably is n't propaganda in the sense of anyone trying to affect the eu ( something that i 'd vaguely-wondered about ) : the domain is registered to [ ghassan aboud ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghassan_aboud ) , who is definitely not a friend of the syrian regime or isis . 
  neither are any of us americans or the aussies or kiwis or some of the other folks that show up , but that 's okay -- the subreddit here is , as defined in the sidebar , `` a forum for discussion about europe and its neighbourhood . '', 
  rather than `` a forum for discussion by people who have citizenship in a european country '' . 
  it 's why there are non-european flairs at all . 
  actually , i think that he 's right . 
  unless the nice banner was historically-unusual , when i do a google image search for `` nazi banners '' , what i get back has many long banners , but the swastika is always centered . 
  it 's possible that the alignmment is ahistorical ( maybe intentionally , if it 's showing the unfurling , so that the unfurling climaxes with the swastika becoming visible ) . 
  everyone is unsuspecting .

  [ let 's take a look at google trends to see who in the world is interested in finland ] ( https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=finland ) : * people are less-interested in finland in general than they were in , say , 2005 . 
  finland , up your game . 
  * people in \u00c5land apparently care more about finland than anyone else . 
  * iraq is n't in the top countries that are interested in finland , but the `` refugee '' thing does seem to pan out -- after the usual suspects of \u00c5land , finland , estonia , and sweden , the countries digging up information on finland are ghana , cameroon , nepal , uganda , norway ( all right , this is probably just due to neighbor status ) , and nigeria . 
  the problem with megaupload , if we 're talking about piracy , is that it undermines the funding structure for content creation . 
  while * maybe * we could adopt alternate approaches for funding content creation or simply not fund it , i do n't think that anyone is seriously proposing it . 
  in the case of uber , i think that it 's fairly clear that the restrictions they 're running into ( okay , i can see the insurance one , though i understand that they did something like purchase a policy for drivers in some country ) do n't really have a strong basis outside of protectionist reasons , where the cab drivers are [ rent-seeking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rent-seeking ) against the general population . 
  that 's not an argument that uber 's approach -- ignore it and then deal with legal challenges as they come up -- is the best way of doing it , but i also suspect that the alternative approaches are going to be pretty bad too . 
  if uber had said `` let 's propose a legal change '' , it would have probably been a decade at least of people lobbying and various claims that studies were required and so forth and special interests doing everything possible to establish roadblocks . 
  now , there 's also costs to simply having people try to change the law by ignoring it . 
  that 's a real concern -- you do n't want to establish that as a precedent . 
  but i have a really hard time being sympathetic to the taxi businesses , too . 
  maybe the right answer would be a way to accelerate change ... but any time a law involves human safety , there 's an obvious incentive to be conservative . 
  maybe it would be possible to find a `` sponsor '' who would put money in an escrow fund for any damages for some period of time caused , if it would help reduce the barrier to changing laws .

  the first link said that a division `` betrayed the us and handed weapons over to jabhat al-nusra immediately after entering syria '' . 
  it does n't say that the us secretly provided support . 
  the second is an op-ed . 
  that 's probably the closest to what you 're looking for . 
  here 's the relevant quote :  a revealing light on how we got here has now been shone by a recently declassified secret us intelligence report , written in august 2012 , which uncannily predicts -- and effectively welcomes -- the prospect of a `` salafist principality '' in eastern syria and an al-qaida-controlled islamic state in syria and iraq . 
  in stark contrast to western claims at the time , the defense intelligence agency document identifies al-qaida in iraq ( which became isis ) and fellow salafists as the `` major forces driving the insurgency in syria '' -- and states that `` western countries , the gulf states and turkey '' were supporting the opposition 's efforts to take control of eastern syria . 
  the author switched from `` al-qaida '' , which he was talking about in the first portion of the sentence , for `` the opposition '' , which he 's talking about in the second , to give this impression . 
  he goes on to engage in similar intermingling . 
  i do n't know if there 's a better term for this practice than [ weasel words ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_word ) , but it 's precisely how bush managed to convince most americans that hussein was behind 9/11 : he 's never * quite * making a concrete , incorrect claim , but the author is intentionally switching back-and-forth between the two to create a desired impression , without ever making a hard statement that he can be called out on . 
  [ this is the document in question ] ( https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pg.-291-pgs.-287-293-jw-v-dod-and-state-14-812-dod-release-2015-04-10-final-version11.pdf ) . 
  at no point does the original document say that the west is supporting al-qaida , which is the relevant claim -- it says that the `` west , gulf countries , and turkey '' support the syrian opposition , and additionally that al-qaeda in iraq supports the syrian opposition . 
  it clearly is using `` opposition forces '' not as a term to refer to simultaneously refer to all forces opposed to the regime , as it 's using it to just refer to the syrian free army in 8 . a. 
  it does n't say that the us is enthusiastic about isis -- it explicitly-warns that there 's the risk of an islamic state being declared and that this would be disadvantageous to a unified iraqi state being established . 
  the third link is talking about a free syrian army member . 
  i 'm not seeing the support here . 
   either the burdensome taxi regulations go away for everyone i do n't think there 'd be a lot of objection to this other than from current taxi operators . 
   if you go somewhere where taxi licensing is not strictly controlled , you 'll find yourself getting ripped off and will have to be very careful of your safety . 
  is that a risk for uber ? 
  i do n't use the service , but i understand that the service lists the cost and there is , in advance , a public record of the person taking the trip , the person taking them , and a timestamp . 
  seems like it 'd be even more-difficult to mug/kill/rape / whatever a passenger than it would be with the traditional taxi system . 
  i do n't recall hearing about uber having any instances of this , much less objectionably-high levels . 
   andreas richter and piotr koper 's announcement provoked huge international interest , with hordes of amateur treasure-hunters descending on the small polish town despite there being little evidence the train ever existed . 
  the ufo craze converted roswell , new mexico into a tourist destination . 
  clearly polish entrepreneurs need to get on this and start selling metal detectors , shovels , get-your-photo-taken-on-a-pile-of-faux-gold postcards , t-shirts , and the works . 
   isis + al nusra : supported by gulf states ( mainly ksa ) but secretly also get support from usa , israel and fsa rebels who join them please provide a reputable source for secret support for isis from the us . 
  i imagine that i probably had killers , rapists , and who knows what else if you go back far enough . 
   this anti-science thinking was usually the case in us ? 
  you mean re : human evolution having a common ape ancestor ?
