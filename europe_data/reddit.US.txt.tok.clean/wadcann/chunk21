  however , this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through `` as schabowski said we can . 
  '' [ 44 ]   it soon became clear that no one among the east german authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force , so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of east german citizens . 
  finally , at 10:45 pm , harald j\u00e4ger , the commander of the bornholmer stra\u00dfe border crossing yielded , allowing for the guards to open the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking . 
  [ 81 ] as the ossis swarmed through , they were greeted by wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing . 
  soon afterward , a crowd of west berliners jumped on top of the wall , and were soon joined by east german youngsters . 
  they danced together to celebrate their new freedom . 
  that itself sets a precedent , because it establishes the viability of an amnesty , and then everyone else is worried about missing out on any future amnesty . 
  after the [ reagan amnesty in the us , illegal immigration increased ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/the-weak-argument-defending-executive-amnesty/382906/ ) . 
   i myself have given up on politics , you just feel like hitting a brick wall when you read the papers . 
  i 've always been suspicious that people tend to feel that political bias is more-present today than in the good ol' days . 
  then i started reading press bias a couple of hundred years back in the us and decided that , no , things are probably more-or-less about the same . 
   stupidity is the norm today . 
  there 's the [ flynn effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flynn_effect ) . 
  plus , the world population is more-educated than it ever has been before in history . 
  would n't that same argument apply to any written law , and for domestic civilian perpetrators as well as those granted asylum ? 
  while i 'm not opposed to the death penalty myself , / u/savannajeff is claiming that there is some ethical standard that any `` civilized state '' must meet : non-use of the death penalty . 
  if you agree with that assertion , i do n't see how this particular case is special in who `` imposes '' the penalty compared to use of the death penalty in other cases . 
  hmm . 
  while i 'm not innocent of it either , you 're familiar with the [ omission bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omission_bias ) ? 
   the omission bias is an alleged type of cognitive bias . 
  it is the tendency to judge harmful actions as worse , or less moral than equally harmful omissions ( inactions ) because actions are more obvious than inactions . 
  it is contentious as to whether this represents a systematic error in thinking , or is supported by a substantive moral theory . 
  for a consequentialist , judging harmful actions as worse than inaction would indeed be inconsistent , but deontological ethics may , and normally does , draw a moral distinction between doing and allowing . 
  [ 1 ] the bias is usually showcased through the [ trolley problem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trolley_problem ) . 
     the trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics . 
  the general form of the problem is this : there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks . 
  ahead , on the tracks , there are five people tied up and unable to move . 
  the trolley is headed straight for them . 
  you are standing some distance off in the train yard , next to a lever . 
  if you pull this lever , the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks . 
  however , you notice that there is one person on the side track . 
  you have two options : ( 1 ) do nothing , and the trolley kills the five people on the main track . 
  ( 2 ) pull the lever , diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person . 
  which is the correct choice ? 
  while i kinda-sorta agree , it 's also true that typically people on work visas * can * be deported for various reasons , so obviously the penalty for acting up for them is higher than that for a citizen who took the same action . 
  is there not normally correlation between the two ? 
  i mean , it still seems like an interesting result , given the prominence of immigration as an issue right now . 
   she just fucking told them to come in en amass that may very well be the ( unfortunate ) impression that was given , and she may have some responsibility for her speech to be unambiguous-enough that it ca n't be misinterpreted on critical issues like this , but as a number of germans pointed out , that 's really not a very accurate summary of what she said . 
  i 'm assuming that you 're joking , since the nationality of the person driving should n't be relevant . 
   when the proletariat takes power in each country approximately at the same time , a world revolution is achieved and armies become unnecessary ... you are way past these stupid ideas ... in the west some people are not . 
  did n't the ussr give up on world socialist revolution over ninety years ago with the move to [ socialism in one country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism_in_one_country ) ? 
  i do n't see anything on [ his wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeremy_corbyn ) page that indicates that corbyn is advocating for world socialist revolution . 
  i do n't know what / u/wholelottatoughlove is referring to as regards his territorial integrity concerns , but i 'd like to see some hard evidence that corbyn is advocating for world socialist revolution . 
  that seems kinda unlikely . 
   seriously eu ? 
  we do not need to send a few millions , we need to send billions to improve the conditions in the neighboring countries . 
  otherwise people wont stop coming here . 
  you mean via eliminating a legal rationale for immigrating ( no war , hence no grounds for refugee status ) or via making syria and other states so desirable that people wo n't bother coming to the eu ? 
  the former is going to be tough for places like eritrea , unless you want global involvement in everything that 's considered to be objectionable-enough to let people classify as a refugee . 
  the latter has n't even been done internally to the eu yet -- a lot of people are still immigrating from around the * eu * to germany . 
  bringing the entire * world * up to that level seems like a pretty large task . 
  `` higher plane of existence '' sounded kinda mystical . 
  well , it 's a pool that would be paying for this -- the bid is for the `` accept '' . 
  there 's already presumably some eu system in place for determining `` how people pay for things '' that 's weighted for wealth and population and so forth , since the same problem will come up for every other issue that involves eu spending . 
  they are coming from syria , iraq and afghanistan . 
  via serbia . 
  you are entitled to adopt that interpretation ( maybe `` directly '' means `` not residing somewhere else for a year '' or something like that under your system of classification ) , but it 's not the one that the countries in question have taken , i do n't think that you 'll find legal support for it , and it 's not the one that i take . 
   very few , if any . 
  most only accept asylum applications on their own soil . 
  in at least the us and german systems , `` asylum '' and `` refugee status '' are very slightly different -- `` asylum '' refers to a request when you are already inside that country , and `` refugee status '' refers to a request when you are outside that country . 
  they certainly exist in at least those countries . 
  now , that being said , the convention does n't place restrictions on * how * countries accept those applications either , and i suspect that countries are going to take an interpretation that places a pretty high bar on things . 
  yes , but my approach addresses that -- you are converting the cost to a financial one , in the `` everyone has their price '' sense -- but you 're free to factor in that cost into a bid . 
  national geographic has done shots of muslims too . 
  in fact , which is arguably their [ most famous cover ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afghan_girl ) was of a muslim girl . 
  you know , this is from the editorial board , not guest writers from europe . 
  if the * new york times * wants to advocate for something , it seems a lot more reasonable for it to advocate for the us to take people in than to keep slagging on eastern europe . 
  that is n't the most neutral , objective way of describing the situation that i 've ever seen . 
   they are coming directly from a territory where their life of freedom was threatened . 
  no , they are coming from serbia : hungary 's argument is based upon these grounds . 
   otherwise it would be practically impossible to seek asylum in most european countries , for example . 
  that 's what a lot of european countries past greece and italy have been making use of . 
  note that it 's not really * impossible * -- you could take a ship that travels all the way around the european coast in international waters , then dumps people into rafts and they boat in on cheapo boats ... or if you were willing to potentially-sacrifice a plane , you could charter a flight in . 
  you can also apply to a country for refugee status without entering at all : this clause only deals with giving the exception to permit punishing illegal immigration . 
  i understand that , but what 's the benefit of such an approach over what i described ? 
   under geneva conventions you can not prosecute an asylum seeker for illegal entry . 
  i strongly doubt that , because the [ geneva conventions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geneva_conventions ) predate the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , which explicitly allows for prosecution under certain conditions ( which the proposed policy meets ) :  article 31 . 
    refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge   1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i ** , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  the contracting states shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularized or they obtain admission into another country . 
  the contracting states shall allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country . 
  if hungary views serbia as a safe area , then any attempts to enter hungary from serbia illegally violate the above constraint , and hungary is permitted to punish illegal immigrants . 
   you can go with interim solution with these refugees . 
  i suppose that it 's not unreasonable that if europe does this , it similarly ask the us to do this . 
  certainly the us faces the same political difficulties ( well , the us does have the question of birthright citizenship , but outside of that ... )  once they settle that 's it , they will be a problem to the hosting country . 
  while i agree that there 's a legitimate concern that `` interim '' might be used as a politically-convenient way to sell `` permanent '' solutions ( and it is absolutely certain that there will be lawyers using any opportunity they can to try to elevate it to permanent ) , i do n't think that it 's * impossible * to provide credible guarantees here . 
  if the practical need is strong enough , whatever the legislative/treaty changes are required could be pushed through quickly : the laws are a tool , not shackles . 
   yes , that 's a good example , i 've heard of the irish conflict being described that way , but not very often in regards to other conflicts . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sectarian  of , or relating to a sect . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sect  an offshoot of a larger religion ; a group sharing particular ( often unorthodox ) political and/or religious beliefs . 
  there just are n't all that many ( violent , at any rate ) conflicts in europe driven by disputes between religious sects today . 
  on the other hand , a shiite/sunni conflict is definitely a conflict that at best involves differences between religious sects of one religion ( not that it 's likely to be disconnected from politics or ethnic conflict either , same as the troubles ) . 
   i guess the yugoslav wars can be regarded as such , but i do n't often see that word used especially in popular usage the word is not really appropriately-applied to muslim/christian conflict ( which is what the bosnian genocide would have involved , to the extent that it involved religion ) , since it is n't dealing with sects of a single religion . 
  europe used to definitely have sectarian violence like crazy due to the protestant/catholic fighting , but aside from the troubles , that 's mostly some time back . 
  they would probably need a guarantee that would be binding on unhcr . 
   even if they have 5 anchor babies in that time courtesy of our nhs and benefits system . 
  `` anchor babies '' do n't apply to the uk under current uk law . 
  in the us , the [ term is applied to children used in the process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anchor_baby ) where people who come to the us illegally , have a child , and then use family reunification policies as a way to grant the parent citizenship :  anchor baby is a pejorative [ 1 ] [ 2 ] term for a child born in the u.s. to a foreign national mother who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence . 
  [ 3 ] the term is generally used as a derogatory reference to the supposed role of the child , who automatically qualifies as an american citizen under * jus soli * and can later act as a sponsor for other family members . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] that only works because of how us citizenship guarantees and immigration policy are set up .
