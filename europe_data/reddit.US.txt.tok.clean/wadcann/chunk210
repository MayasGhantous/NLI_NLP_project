  it 'd be more-interesting to see what polls said than a photograph of a sign . 
  [ as of may 2011 , gallup polling reports that  ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/148427/say-bible-literally.aspx ) * 30 % of americans describe the bible as the actual word of god , to be taken literally , word-for-word * 49 % describe it as being the inspired word of god , but that not everything in it should be taken literally * 17 % say that the bible is an ancient book of fables , legends , history , and moral precepts recorded by man . 
  note that a literal interpretation is not the same thing as being merely inerrant , since inerrancy does not require a literal interpretation ( e.g. 
  the world being created in seven days could maybe be interpreted as being a metaphor for billions of years involving geological processes ) . 
  a literal interpretation does not permit for this reading . 
  note that while there is positive correlation between less-reliance on the bible and education , even the highest-educated category ( postgraduate ) has only 25 % of americans describing the bible as a book of fables and legends . 
  according to a december 2013 pew poll , [ 33 % of american adults reject evolution and say that humans existed in their present form since the beginning of time ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/12/30/publics-views-on-human-evolution/ ) . 
  it seems likely that there is a [ selection bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selection_bias ) in choosing people to write an article where things worked out rather than where they did n't . 
  honestly , for a post in which you 're normally supposed to grease the wheels of diplomacy , he does n't seem very well-suited for a poland-russia position . 
  i mean , unless he was asked to create an incident intentionally for whatever reason , it seems like a pretty bad diplomatic mis-step . 
   if jesus had not been a pacifist but a warlord , what had europe looked like today ? 
  [ matthew 10:34 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+10%3a34&amp;version=niv ) :  do not suppose that i have come to bring peace to the earth . 
  i did not come to bring peace , but a sword . 
  some of those games are pretty rage-inducing . 
  well , to be blunt ... the us ignores the 1951 refugee convention in imposing limits . 
  i think that at the * least * , countries facing the possibility of significant immigration have to impose some kind of limit . 
  now , it may very well be that countries want to retain the `` do n't deport to country of origin '' tidbit , but countries are going to be violating the convention to at least some degree anyway , realistically . 
  aside from a few people concerned about automation and wanting to radically restructure society , i see little support for actual [ socialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism ) . 
  i think that it 's far more-common to want [ capitalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capitalism ) with just a higher level of redistribution than is presently the case : the bulk of industry to be privately-operated , but for government to tax it more-heavily . 
  a bunch of the [ classical liberals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_liberalism ) , infuriated that progressives swiped `` liberalism '' , eventually wound up settling on '' [ libertarianism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarianism ) '' , which in turn infuriated [ left-libertarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left-libertarianism ) who had been using that term for something else . 
  fdr probably should have stuck with `` progressivism '' . 
  it 's a loaded term , but we deal with that for pro-life/pro-choice by just using each side 's own self-description -- not the end of the world . 
  i thought that it was * just * the us with this usage , but some dutch guy on here told me that some other countries use the us-style use as well , and he thought of the traditional use as something british . 
  certainly * the economist * uses it in its traditional sense . 
  it 's certainly interesting ( particularly in combination with [ the recent discovery that there are some forms of terran life that can survive and grow at martian surface conditions ] ( http://www.astrobio.net/topic/origins/extreme-life/lichen-on-mars/ ) ) , but i 'm having a hard time seeing the european tie-in . 
  i guess it was a story in * the guardian * , but ... 
   i 'd recommend something based on the 1911 for home [ post linked from the / r/guns faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/ph9kr/runnybear_i_want_buy_handgun_pls_tell_me_why_you/ ) on new handgun owner defense handgun recommendations :  second , let 's talk disqualifying features :   * a reputation for unreliable operation . 
  this is quite obviously important , and disqualifies taurus ( huehuehue ) , the sig sauer p250 , and the sw99 . 
    * the presence of manual safeties . 
  i really , really do n't like putting another step of operation between the user and a functioning gun . 
  it 's just one more thing that can go wrong , and depending on it is a great way to get people killed . 
  so long ... well , a lot of otherwise great guns . 
  more on that later . 
  ** this means no to the 1911 . 
  **   * magazine disconnect safeties -- while it seems great in theory , it can lead to a deadly sense of complacency . 
  also , it 's another thing that can malfunction . 
  hooray . 
    * grip safeties . 
  again , one more thing that can and will go wrong . 
  also , you 'll shoot your cat . 
  ** this also means no to the 1911 ** . 
    * a pathetically low capacity for a given size . 
  this basically disqualifies all revolvers out there . 
  ** this also means no to the 1911 . 
  **   * internal locks and other mumbo-jumbo -- there are too many stories of s&w revolvers locking up due to recoil out there . 
  fuck that shit . 
  he did , but then he claimed that he did n't . 
  not the smoothest pr moves . 
   have the bottle is this a german idiom that i 'm not familiar with ? 
  how do you activate a razor-wire fence ? 
  just leave periodic holes that are n't closed until a thumbs-up ? 
   a mosque is not just a building where muslims can go to pray , it 's a political center for the city . 
  christianity played a similar role , frankly . 
  go back a hundred years and to a rural area , and the church was frequently the core of the community in rural america -- where you 'd raise issues and engage in activism . 
   official eu language realistically , if 1m people migrate from syria this year , there 's already more speakers of arabic in one year from one country than there is of [ maltese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maltese_language ) , which has only half a million speakers . 
  it seems to me likely that there will be a push to adopt arabic as an official eu language if maltese can enjoy that status . 
  ehhh ... it 's easy to over-simplify this . 
  i think that few wars are * purely * driven by racial or ethnic or religious issues , even if in cases those are major causes . 
  rather , i think that often these simply make up a fault line along which various disputes can break . 
  example : the [ second sudanese civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_sudanese_civil_war ) : yes , some of it was ethnic and religious :  some sources describe the conflict as an ethnoreligious one where the muslim central government 's pursuits to impose sharia law on non-muslim southerners led to violence , and eventually to the civil war . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] but some of it was good old wanting a larger propotional share of the pie than is currently the case , and for someone else to have less :  the second war was partially about natural resources . 
  between the north and the south lie significant oil fields and thus significant foreign interests ( the oil revenue is privatized to western interests as in nigeria ) . 
  the north wanted to control these resources because they are situated on the edge of the sahara desert , which is unsuitable for agricultural development . 
  oil revenues make up about 70 % of sudan 's export earnings , and contribute to the development of the country which , unlike the south , does not depend on international aid . 
  interesting , but does n't answer the really-interesting-to-me questions : how do you deal with verifiability and enforceability ? 
  verfiability : by its very nature , surveillance is going to be somewhat-hidden . 
  a country has a very strong incentive not to expose the workings of its intelligence agencies . 
  without actually knowing what 's going on , how do you address the issue . 
  rely purely on whistleblowers ? 
  that might be leading uncomfortably-close to encouraging espionage , and there are ways to address this sort of thing , like putting sensitive people on a watchlist such that they and their family can not simultaneously leave the country . 
  enforceability : let 's say that we find out that obama is , in fact , listening to merkel 's dulcet tones on the phone . 
  what is going to be done about this ? 
  and that 's just the extreme case -- how far would , say , the eu and the us be willing to go to discourage domestic surveillance in china ? 
  today , they 'll make some noises about it , but it 's not as if a trade embargo or something as drastic as that would be in the cards . 
  at one point , was it more-core to the party ? 
  because that 's how political drift will presumably happen -- people with other concerns get brought in , and their interests and concerns start influencing the party 's direction . 
  i 'm just saying that the `` issue is important because it 's in the party name '' criteria may not be a great one . 
   the problem is when religion becomes fundamentalism , ethnicity becomes nationalism and ideology becomes totalitarism . 
  just a couple of clarifications : `` fundamentalism '' does n't mean `` hardliner '' . 
  [ fundamentalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fundamentalism ) simply means `` getting back to the fundamentals '' of a religion . 
  sometimes , religions slowly accrue dogma and reintepretations , and to take a fundamentalist position is to basically start over and take a look at the original materials . 
  the thing is that in mainstream christianity ( and mainstream judaism , and i assume mainstream islam ) , a lot of positions that were kind of out-of-whack with what people actually wanted to do in society had `` reinterpretations '' placed on them . 
  for example `` well ... usury is actually okay '' or `` that tidbit about creation of the universe was just meant as a metaphor , and the days were n't really twenty-four hours '' , or so forth . 
  people in these situations who were `` fundamentalist '' wound up effectively ignoring newer doctrine and typically being more socially-conservative in that they realized that the religion was effectively standing on , well , pretty dubious interpretations and that it actually mandated behavior that conflicted more-strongly with social norms . 
  they 'd throw out the new sketchy stuff and go back to basics . 
   ideology becomes totalitarism if you 're referring to islamism , while i 'm no expert , i do n't think that it 's generally-viewed as [ totalitarianism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/totalitarianism ) , though i suppose that some elements of the moral policing aspect might edge in that direction . 
  ah , the `` zombie reagan '' tactic . 
  we get that too . 
   the only reason race plays a role in usa 's iq is due to disproportional poverty there 's correlation between poverty and a low iq , but i think that you 'd have to find something that demonstrates that poverty causes a low iq . 
  it seems at least as plausible that the causation goes the other direction or that both are caused by a common third factor and simply correlated . 
  intelligence tests were originally devised in france to fix school placement tests -- because the older tests had relied upon cultural knowledge somewhat , they 'd under-predicted actual long-term performance of rural students , and so the intelligence test , isolated from cultural knowledge , was constructed . 
  it 's exactly this sort of `` overprediction of the efffects of a poor background '' that this was intended to address . 
  now , that does n't mean that being poor wo n't be correlated with a lower score on a properly-callibrated intelligence test -- but only to the degree that being poor is correlated with historic poor long-term performance . 
  granted , there 's inevitably some inertia there , but ... 
  that being said , it 's also worth noting that correlation is n't causation . 
  i can think of plausible reasons for heterogenity to be correlated , but not cause , of low levels of trust . 
  for example , urban areas are a place that i would expect to have a vastly weaker community and lower degree of trust , but also to see much more ethnic diversity ... and i 'd be a little suspicious ( not that i have any data to support it -- it 's just a hypothesis that would also fit the data ) that it 's the sheer size of the community that 's a factor . 
  people immigrate to cities . 
  cities are also so large that people can not form the `` trusted small communities '' that we evolved with . 
  one way to find more support for this would be to identify ethnically-homogenous cities and see if trust levels are higher there .
