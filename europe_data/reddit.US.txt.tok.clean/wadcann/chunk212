  i 'm imagining people in iceland meeting someone , surreptitiously pulling out their smartphone , pushing some buttons , and then sighing in frustration at the result . 
  the issue is that people with a monopoly can produce [ market failure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/market_failure ) : it 's one situation where a market stops being economically-efficient . 
  one concern people have is where someone with a monopoly in one area uses that monopoly to squeeze people out in another area . 
  if , for example , google becomes dominant in the search market and then makes sure that it 's easier to use , oh , google earth for any users of its search engine than any competing product , then it gives them an edge . 
  i do n't know if google is doing this or not or if i 'd agree with the criteria used , but in the broader sense , the idea of trying to prevent people from levering a monopoly in one area into another is n't crazy . 
  there are multiple carriers . 
  that 's the distribution map for * aedes aegypti * . 
  it can also be spread by at least * aedes albopictus * , which is [ present in europe ] ( http://healthintelligence.drupalgardens.com/content/visualizing-global-distribution-aedes-aegypti-and-ae-albopictus ) ( as well , as you point out , in the us ) . 
  i 'd be less-concerned about the initial , direct risk , though ... and more for whether it 's possible for zika to start spreading via mosquitoes in europe . 
  there [ are ways to beat mosquito-borne diseases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/window_screen ) even once they start ranging freely :  by the 1950s , parasitic diseases were largely eradicated in the united states in part due to the widespread use of window screens . 
  [ 2 ] today most houses in australia , the united states and canada have screens on all operable windows . 
  [ 3 ] ... but it 'd really suck if europe picked up a serious , mosquito-borne disease if it did n't have to do so . 
  while it 's true that there 's falloff as numbers rise -- i mean , it 's pretty hard to compare with , say , being able to afford enough food to stay alive -- i remember looking at a poll that asked people how much money they 'd really need to be happy and it was strongly tied to how much money they were making . 
  i suspect that people simply adjust their perception of what they consider necessities as they get used to things . 
  and , of course , there 's always keeping up with the joneses : people judge how acceptable what they have is relative to their neighbors . 
  is it possible to insure the car in france for more than its approximate value ? 
  i mean , where 's the win for a scammer ? 
  i tried googling , and [ this ] ( https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/arson/aaw14_media_kit.pdf ) says that the common route is someone buying a car that they ca n't afford on credit and falling behind in payments and wanting to exit the deal . 
  that the case here ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_prevalence_of_opiates_use heroin does n't look like it 's that popular in the us compared to the uk , italy , or ... good lord , there 's a difference between poland and the baltics on that . 
   some people say https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_word  a weasel word ( also , anonymous authority ) is an informal term for words and phrases aimed at creating an impression that a specific and/or meaningful statement has been made , when only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated , enabling the specific meaning to be denied if the statement is challenged . 
  * who * says that your society is terminally feminized ? 
  it does n't seem to be a prominent claim to me . 
  in general terms , the flip side of not imposing restrictions on firing people is that companies are a lot-more willing to hire people , because they are n't exposed to the same amount of risk . 
  i suspect that more of his political campaign and positions were planned than you are giving him credit for . 
   about 44 per cent of officers said they had received verbal threats at least once a month , while 7 per cent said it happened daily . 
    more than a third ( 35 per cent ) experienced unarmed physical attacks at least once a month , while 6 per cent said they were attacked with a potentially lethal weapon such as a bottle or gun at least once a month . 
  that 's * insane * . 
  a ** third ** of officers are being physically attacked at least once a month ? 
  honestly , the `` most british laws have to be approved by the european parliament '' being believed by 61 % of britons seems more of an issue than the precise number of member countries in the eu . 
   officials based their estimates on 600,000 migrants arriving this year , 400,000 next year and 300,000 in each of the following years , the report said , adding that they expected 55 percent of recognized refugees to have a job after five years . 
  that gives baseline numbers , since arrival rates and job uptake can be compared to predicted levels . 
  [ that was from 1949 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_geneva_convention ) . 
  it post-dated the [ population transfers in the ussr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) and was not retroactive . 
  if it * were * retroactive : ( a ) the ussr would n't have been a signatory . 
  ( b ) frankly , i wonder how many countries * would * have been . 
  maybe some island nations somewhere ? 
   so the visuals are not really part of the competition bid . 
  maybe that was n't made explicit to the popular voters . 
  i was going to say that maybe the voting * should * be on the visuals as well , but then i realized that then it turns into more of a budget game than would otherwise be the case . 
  aight , fair enough , i take it back then . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  still , if people are having language education funded by the eu , i doubt that the goal would be , say , reviving welsh and yiddish . 
  i admit that perhaps i misunderstood you ; the context of your earlier post was about increasing centralization and standardizing on one set of rules , and i ( perhaps incorrectly ) assumed that this extended to the language portion of the proposal . 
  had the same nationalist indoctrination thing . 
  though really , i do n't see anyone in the us caring all that much about nationalism , but it seems like europeans are constantly up in arms about it . 
  i suspect that it has a lot to do with world war i and ii and the idea that less nationalism might avoid world war iii or something . 
  define `` modern times '' . 
  i 'm not convinced that there was any point in history where civilians stopped being killed in wars ... 
   i do n't want europe to become another usa , seeing america 's flaws . 
  i do n't want europe to become uniform , so there is always a place for everyone . 
  from a us resident : i suspect that media has more to do with cultural homogenity than bureaucratic structure . 
   wwii was fought between a european-american alliance and a european/asian alliance . 
  was n't much of the european part of that remaining after germany took europe , though . 
  what remained , the uk and cyprus ? 
   at minimum the eu should have introduced centralised banking regulation , centralised unemployment benefits , and massive spending on language education for everyone in the eu i live in the us , not the eu , but based on the degree of resentment that us residents have over the possibility of needing to learn spanish , it seems that deciding on `` the language of the eu , which everyone should be encouraged to use '' would be kind of politically-charged . 
  providing centralized benefits would probably be awfully disadvantageous to those in better-off countries . 
  wars tend to do that . 
   the use of ascension island that is a british territory , and i do n't think that we were too-enthusiastic about being seen as engaging in hostilities with argentina :  in 1982 a british task force used ascension island as a staging post during the falklands war , [ 3 ] though according to matthew parris , [ 8 ] '' ... at the start of the falklands conflict washington at first refused britain permission to use the usa-operated airfield facilities for refuelling raf jets . 
  only after mrs thatcher intervened with ronald reagan did the americans reluctantly concede . '', 
  i think that a number of people , including myself , see a russian military buildup and hostile propaganda in terms of how it relates to europe 's security . 
  that 's a plain , straightforward view : putin misses the days of russia holding land by force , so russia identifies small areas that it can take without inducing a conflict that it can not afford and takes control of that land , snippet by snippet . 
  but ... what if a better way to look at this is to see europe as having presented a more-appealing economy , political structure , and way of life ? 
  that is , in concrete terms , what 's actually affecting russia , including ( at least , the bulk of ) ukraine drifting away . 
  that 's a * cultural * threat , not a military threat , and that threatens ultimately the fall of the regime and the separation of allied states . 
  one way to counter foreign appeal is to have the people in question looking at that foreign appeal as a national threat . 
  north korea does n't want a war with the united states -- it could start a serious conflict any day it chooses but does n't do so -- but it * regularly * threatens one and domestically drives home the fact that it is at dire risk from the united states . 
  what it wants is a nation in a state of perceived conflict such that the regime can not collapse . 
  its concern is that the north korean people will say `` hey , south korea looks pretty good ... let 's go do what they 're doing '' . 
  i vaguely imagine that some of the anti-communist material in the west during the early cold war had similar concerns behind it : communism became * personna non grata * domestically . 
  if the russian people feel that they are under military threat from the west , it undermines pro-western domestic factions in russia : those people are seen as unpatriotic or traitors . 
  if that 's true , yelling threats back is counter-productive ; a hands-off approach is overwhelmingly the best way to counter what is attempted by putin . 
  ( i 've never studied international relations , and i realize that a number of people on here have , so certainly take with a grain of salt ... ), 
  my understanding is that [ the primary obstacle to macedonia joining the eu has been that greece is blocking eu membership due to a dispute over their country 's name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_macedonia_to_the_european_union ) . 
  yesterday , mr. varoufakis claimed that if greece left the eurozone , it would also necessarily leave the eu . 
  that would remove the greek political objection obstacle . 
  would this mean likely macedonian membership ? 
  in the past few years , i 've watched with some-interest as * russia today * , a funded-by-the-russian-state media source intended for international consumption -- which would be described by critics as propaganda -- stopped commonly-using the term `` russia '' in its name and moved to typically identifying itself in its media as simply '' * rt * '' or the associated '' * ruptly * '' brand . 
  i 've wondered about whether this might be an attempt to appear more-neutral and , to the casual viewer , less connected to russia . 
  today i noticed that * al jazeera * apparently has a somewhat-similar effort with the * aj + * brand , which perhaps makes it sound a bit less middle eastern . 
  given that we link to other news sources and do talk about bias , i decided to take a look at english-language , state-funded or - run media to see the current state of affairs , looking for four characteristics : * the current name of the state-funded media source . 
  * the funding nation . 
  * whether the name of the funding nation is included in the source . 
  i 'd assume that a source that does this has no problem with its media being clearly-identified as coming from the funding country . 
  * whether the media source 's website 's `` about '' page prominently-discloses that it is funded by the funding country . 
  i 'd assume that a source that does this has no problem with a casual reader interested in seeing where its material comes from learning that a state is funding it . 
  | source | funding nation | name in source | discloses funder | | - | - | - | - | | [ rt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt_%28tv_network%29 ) | russia | no longer | [ no ] ( http://www.rt.com/about-us/ ) | | [ al jazeera ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_jazeera ) | qatar | no | [ no ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/aboutus/ ) | | [ press tv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_tv ) | iran | no | [ no ] ( http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/12/31/390988/about-presstv ) | | [ voice of america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voice_of_america ) | us | yes \u00b9 | [ no \u00b2 ] ( http://www.insidevoa.com/content/popup/1686739.html?nocache=1 ) | | [ radio free europe/radio liberty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_liberty ) \u00b3 | us | no | [ yes ] ( http://www.rferl.org/info/faq/777.html ) \u2074 | | [ bbc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bbc ) | uk | no \u2075 | maybe \u2076 | | [ france 24 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/france_24 ) | france | yes | no | | [ cctv news ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cctv_news ) | china | no | no \u2077 | | [ xinhua news agency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xinhua_news_agency ) | china | no | yes \u2078 | | [ korean central news agency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_central_news_agency ) | north korea | yes | no | | [ nile tv international ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nile_tv ) | egypt | no | no | | [ sputnik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sputnik_%28news_agency%29 ) | russia | no | [ no ] ( http://sputniknews.com/docs/about/index.html ) | \u00b9 voice of america prominently uses the term `` voice of america '' , but often uses `` voa '' as an acronym as well as a short form . 
  in at least english-language media , i do n't see `` voa '' having replaced `` voice of america '' -- it 'd be hard to not know that `` voa '' did n't stand for `` voice of america '' -- but it 's possible that this is different in non-english-language media . 
  \u00b2 voice of america does indicate on its about page that it is funded by the broadcasting board of governors . 
  while this is a us government agency , it may not be immediately clear to the casual reader that this is the case , as * that * name does not include terms like `` united states '' or `` america '' . 
  \u00b3 i do n't entirely understand the relationship between rferl and voice of america . 
  as a reader , it seems like rferl is much-more-willing to contain material that has an overt agenda , whereas voice of america is quite neutral in tone : to the extent that political agenda exists on voa , it 's not obvious to my ( subjective ) eyes . 
  \u2074 very explicit : `` rfe/rl is funded by the u.s. congress through the broadcasting board of governors ( bbg ) . 
  the bbg is a bipartisan federal agency overseeing all u.s international broadcasting services . 
  in addition to rfe/rl , this includes voice of america , radio free asia , alhurra , radio sawa , and radio marti . 
  under irs rules , rfe/rl is a private , nonprofit sec . 
  501 ( c ) 3 corporation . 
  chartered in delaware , it receives federal grants as a private grantee . 
  rfe/rl maintains a corporate office in washington , d.c. '' \u2075 the bbc at one point regularly-included the term `` british broadcasting corporation '' , but the term did not show up in currently-produced videos on youtube , and does not show up on either its old or new main page on its website . 
  \u2076 the '' [ about the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/ ) section '' is so immense and bureaucratic that i eventually just gave up trying to find a statement .
