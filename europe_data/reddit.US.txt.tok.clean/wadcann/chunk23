  or anyone angry . 
  bush could do [ this ] ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-poll-iraq_x.htm ) with our public in the wake of 9/11 . 
  i imagine that putin , who has a higher visibility , can probably do at least as much . 
  that 's the first one of those that looks halfway decent . 
  the other two i 've seen pictures of ( including the pig head one ) were grungy bits of cardboard with someone scribbling something on them with marker and packing tape used to glom the thing together . 
  this woman looks like she got a large-format printer or something . 
  and she even got the uncommon ends-in-s-plural-possessive apostrophe right , which i see wrong all the time even here in the us with native english speakers . 
  the triggering event that started the vietnam buildup was an error , but was not a false-flag . 
  a false-flag would be intentionally acting while pretending to be the agent of another state . 
  the second attack at gulf of tonkin has been examined quite a few times over -- it 's an error . 
  you can find plenty of similar cases of people making similar errors and fighting nothingness or their own side in war . 
  if you look at something like the [ battle of the coral sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_coral_sea ) , you see both sides often having a wildly-confused idea of what 's actually going on . 
  nor was iraq a false-flag event : you did n't have people in us uniform go pretend to be iraqis and do something offensive . 
  you may have had an insufficiently-strong case -- that is , bush gathered up all the less-than-impressive evidence available at the time that he could take advantage of anger over 9/11 , and i 'd agree that bush certainly intentionally conflated 9/11 and iraq . 
  but that 's not the same thing as a false-flag operation . 
   intellectuals pointed me to books on berlin in the 1920s and the concept of `` ressentiment , '' a philosophical term that describes a simmering resentment and sense of victimization arising out of envy of a perceived enemy . 
  it often has its roots in a culture 's feeling of impotence . 
  in berlin in the early 20th century , it helped explain the rise of german fascism . 
  in russia in august , it seemed to have many targets : ukraine , gay people , european dairy products and above all the united states . 
  ukraine -- okay , fine , ukraine went with the sexy eu instead . 
  gay people -- okay , everyone else did the same thing , fine . 
  us -- yeah , the us spent decades as russia 's adversary . 
  european dairy products -- i do n't get this . 
  what 's the beef here ? 
  the fact that cheese was one of the russian counter-sanctions against europe ? 
  it 's silliness like this that keeps / r/yurop from competing with / r/murica !, 
   the `` right to asylum '' is not the same as the `` right to live in germany '' . 
  as long as people are safe and have their basic needs met camps on the borders are perfectly adequate . 
  if it 's germany that grants asylum , [ that 's not really the case under the 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) :  article 26 . 
    freedom of movement   each contracting state shall accord to refugees lawfully in its territory the right to choose their place of residence and to move freely within its territory subject to any regulations applicable to aliens generally in the same circumstances . 
  now , if you 're talking about the fact that people who enter germany probably have n't traveled directly from a territory `` where their life or freedom was threatened '' and thus should have registered in that other country and had asylum granted there , that 's a legitimate point . 
  but unless germany withdraws from the 1951 refugee convention , * if * it grants asylum status to someone , it is bound to let them move freely within germany . 
  that 's close , but not quite . 
  / u/dclauzel puts the french in regular typeface and the english in italics to imply that it 's english that is the foreign language . 
  that 's a lot of garbage , and presumably this just goes on for kilometers . 
  seriously , they 're going to need a ton of workers to retrace the steps and do cleanup work once winter sets in and the flow decreases . 
   so , what kind of person am i , mr `` i want an educated f\u00fchrer for the country '' ? 
  i realize that this is does n't relate to your main point , but hitler did n't finish secondary school . 
  if this is an eu issue , and all countries should exist solidarity , why is n't germany sending over german personnel to help pull people out of lesbos ? 
  this problem has been building for some time , after all . 
  at the end of the day , the reason germany wants hungary to take in refugees is so that germany does n't have to put up with them . 
  so germany sees a benefit from what hungary 's doing , but is n't funding either the registration/processing costs or the refugee costs . 
  i do n't think i 'm being inconsistent here -- i also advocated for the uk to fund french-side work in calais , since it 's mainly uk interests being served . 
  if france is expected to do this out of the goodness of france 's heart , the uk can expect this to be funded less-well than the uk might want . 
  if -- and i do n't necessarily think that settling refugees in europe is the best way to go -- europe wants to settle refugees , i think that it 'd make more sense to establish an eu-funded pool and then auction slots to take refugees for n years to eu members . 
  that * does * create some issues in that this is n't directly an issue for , say , the baltic states -- they are n't seeing anyone entering into their country , and would n't be paying for refugees anyway . 
  but it 's got to be better than quotas . 
  i 'd say that they 're part of a federation ( albeit reacquired via military force ) and do n't get to control their immigration policy any more . 
  ;-) but , seriously , probably would be a bad idea politically for pretty much everyone involved to force people on an area that strongly does n't want them . 
   shit like that reminded not only him but nearly every other austrian i talked to of the `` darkest times from our continent '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the plagues beat world war ii . 
  i literally do n't think i 've ever seen a nato discussion on here that you miss mentioning nato costs in . 
  well , those were n't actually nato article 5 requests-for-aid-in-the-event-of-an-attack , so nato members have no obligation . 
  the us did do that once , after 9/11 , with afghanistan , so it 's not fair to treat it as a zero-commitment thing either . 
  to be fair , the us also has its own obligations in east asia , and if a european war with russia actually broke out and was anything other than a brief nuclear exchange , it 'd probably also be the time for countries to engage in their own land-grabs in east asia , same as in world war i and world war ii . 
   the manoeuvres , which took place in march , assumed that a western-backed uprising against president vladimir putin was taking place in moscow . 
  under the scenario posited by the exercise , russia responded by launching a simulated assault on four regional neighbours . 
  so , if the rationale here is to be taken seriously -- not just as a way to present exercises for an offensive operation as a form of defense -- if the west tried overthrowing putin , russia would take a big chunk of her putin loyalist troops and instead of using them to quell the uprising , proceed to send them out of the country and invade a collection of nato , non-nato , eu , and non-eu countries . 
  i got ta say , that sounds really implausible to me . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/planned_destruction_of_warsaw#rebuilding_of_the_city  the destruction of the city was so severe that in order to rebuild much of warsaw , a detailed 18th century landscape of the city painted by the italian artists marcello bacciarelli and bernardo bellotto , who had been commissioned by the government before the partitions of poland , had to be used as a model to recreate most of the buildings . 
  so a city was built from a painting . 
  and provided great us pr cover !, 
  it 's got all the makings of a polandball plot . 
  eu : united states , what 's up with this snowden spying-on-me business ? 
  us : uhhh ... errr ... eu : waiting for an answer . 
  not squirming out of this one .

  < punches ukraine in the face  eu : < distracted  what the * hell * is wrong with you , russia ? 
  [ other proposals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_estonia#alternative_proposals ) . 
  if you 're going to make that your criteria , england is included . 
  our fence does n't cover the whole stretch . 
  serbia has the same degree of legal obligation that hungary or any other country would , as it 's a [ signatory to the 1951 refugee convention ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3b73b0d63.html ) . 
  how are you going to prove that ? 
   but itv news europe editor james mates in hungary reports that the last three metre gap in the 109-mile razor wire fence along its southern border with serbia is now being closed by workmen . 
  so ... hardware stores near the border report an uptick in the sales of wire cutters ? 
  well , if it becomes expensive enough , [ it gets automated ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/robots-step-into-new-planting-harvesting-roles-1429781404 ) .

  well , he was making an argument on altruistic grounds . 
  i 'm very enthusiastic about skilled immigration , but i 'm arguing from a self-interested standpoint , just like a company would be -- if i can appeal to your best employees strongly-enough to run off with them , that 's great for me . 
  the eu has more member countries now than it did in 2003 ; was referring to that . 
  what better way to address a flood of refugees than to attack the country containing the bulk of the refugee camps that had been sopping them up ? 
    the fact that the saudis are still considered allies is probably the biggest fuckup of us foreign politics in the last 14 years . 
    saudi arabia as anyone 's ally baffles the mind . 
  < shrug  europe enjoyed not having the middle east 's oil in the hands of the soviet union to flip on and off during the cold war . 
  the dalai lama is n't a politician ? 
   although i suppose they arent able to fire anymore why not ? 
  the us government has a program to [ sell large numbers of its old refurbished weapons ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/07/31/buying-m1-garand-cmp/ ) , including its [ main world war ii battle rifle ] ( http://thecmp.org/cmp_sales/rifle_sales/m1-garand/ ) , to civilians via the civilian marksmanship program for ~ $ 600/rifle . 
  they still work . 
  it 's not like when a firearm hits twenty years , it just gives up the ghost . 
  i suppose it depends on your way of looking at things , whether it 's `` better '' or `` worse '' . 
  gun ownership certainly is globally correlated with wealth , though , and africa is poorer . 
  well , you 're describing why you did n't like the parties . 
  * sp\u00d6 : `` social only by name '' * \u00d6vp : `` neoliberal poodle of germany '' * fp\u00d6 : `` right wing populists '' * greens : `` no common sense '' * neos : `` neoliberal , if you are no bobo with a start - up , they do n't care about you at all '' all critiques contained something that i 'd read as `` needs to be further fiscally-left '' ( except for maybe fp\u00d6 -- right-wing populism in austria might be different ) other than the greens , who were seen as impractical . 
  also , that work would almost-certainly cost more if it were done legally . 
  just out of curiosity , what would your preferred approach have been ? 
  simply say `` well , the greek government over-borrowed , but that wo n't happen again '' , and instead of having the public of other eu members eat part of the debt , have them eat the full debt ? 
  why assad rather than the western-backed factions ? 
   me too .
