  we are at maybe 600k and the reception capacity is completely maxed out . 
  that should n't affect how many people come in -- it 's not a measurement of capacity to handle . 
   the number of new arrivals should go down when hungary closes their border ... we 'll see . 
  i 'm dubious about effectiveness of closing borders . 
   and the weather make crossing the ocean and the balkan almost impossible . 
  that might be significant , though . 
   i was watching `` fear the walking dead '' and realized that there are probably more citizens with guns in los angeles than the whole european union . 
  unlikely . 
  http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/a-yearbook/2003/en/small-arms-survey-2003-chapter-02-en.pdf  if one uses the police foundation survey as a baseline and adds subsequent non-military purchases of new guns , extrapolating up to the present , there are currently some 234 million civilian firearms in the united states . 
  based on the batf market data alone , there are approximately 273 million civilian and police guns . 
  adding police and military firearms increases the estimated totals to 238 million and 276 million respectively . 
  both figures should be used with caution . 
  but , given an american population of some 287 million in 2002 , either firearms figure leads to the conclusion that the united states is statistically approaching one gun per person , with roughly 83 to 96 guns per 100 people . 
  by any measure , the united states is the most armed country in the world . 
  it far surpasses second-highest yemen , home to roughly 33 to 50 firearms per 100 people , or third-highest finland with 39 per 100 . 
  [ snip ]  among the 15 formal member countries of the european union , the total stockpile of civilian firearms is more than 67 million . 
  the us has a lot more civilian firearms than the eu , but la [ only has 4m people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/los_angeles ) . 
  even if it follows the us averages , there 's no way that la comes close to having 67m firearms . 
  edit : and growth of the eu since this report would also tend to make la having more firearms even more unlikely . 
  if you 're using cheap-enough boats and putting enough people on them , still viable . 
  people know that they 're going to be handed by the navies to europe , so you get whatever is cheap and sacrifice the boat . 
    is that not the whole reason of their independence war ? 
  they are n't in context of opposition to independence . 
  iraq did n't turn out well , and many of these never met the level of nation-building . 
   iraq the government failed , but not because it was n't left in the hands of its people : they 'd elected that government . 
   afghanistan i have n't been following afghanistan closely , but as far as i know , the most-recent election in afghanistan was improved re : concerns about fraud and the people [ did choose their government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohammad_ashraf_ghani ) . 
   libya that 's true : there was no government built in libya , but simply aid provided to the rebellion . 
  that being said , i 'm not sure that one could say that libya today is less-democratic than it was under gadaffi . 
  i suspect that the standard of living is worse ...  somalia the government there had collapsed , and the involvement was a limited one . 
  i suppose you could say `` well , it should have gone further , then '' , but i do n't really see how that would be worse than having simply ignored the situation . 
  you 're right that no government was established , though . 
   lebanon same as above -- there was limited involvement . 
   vietnam this is the one that i will give you . 
  i 've been reading about the political issues here , and the us very clearly was supporting a very unpopular government that had no willingness to permit more-popular figures show up that would be more politically-viable . 
  that is n't simply because of altruism -- a politically-unpopular government is an unstable one , and one where the dog you backed might vanish at any point . 
  there was effort in the 1950s from the us to democratize the situation , which failed ; the regime was n't interested in stepping aside . 
  covert aid to the coup resulted in an even worse series of governments , and attempts to get them to reform met with no traction ; emphasis was also on anti-communist military efforts . 
  on the other hand , the communist alternative turned out to be pretty rotten for the vietnamese too , and it seems likely that that would have simply taken over without us involvement ( though perhaps the war would have been a smaller , less-costly one without us aid prolonging it ) . 
  / u/baguette _ c has an austrian flair , not german . 
  eh , footage of that would probably just be used by your political enemies . 
  when i see apologies , it seems to me that it tends to be not for what the individual politician did , but something pleasantly-abstract , like `` this policy that my institution took under some long-ago predecessor was a bad idea , and we regret having taken up this policy '' . 
  [ this study on us `` temporary '' taxes ] ( http://taxpolicycenter.org/uploadedpdf/413285-temporary-taxes.pdf ) found that a large chunk of them become permanent :  ... we look at 14 states and the district of columbia ( dc ) that together enacted 25 temporary tax increase measures between 2008 and 2011 . 
  among the temporary taxes that have passed their expiration date , about half were allowed to expire on schedule . 
  the remaining measures were made permanent , modified and made permanent , or replaced with alternatives . 
  i imagine that it 's because ( a ) it 's easier to sell a `` temporary '' tax than a permanent one , and ( b ) it 's easier to make permanent an existing `` temporary '' tax than to pass a new tax . 
  so basically , you want someone who is further-fiscally-left than most of the austrian parties . 
   those swedish assholes are trying to stick it to finland and norway , even offering free train tickets . 
  i really think that you 're underestimating the human ability to traverse terrain . 
  humans may not be that fast , but they ( assuming they 're in reasonable shape ) have tremendous endurance , and can keep plodding all day , day-after-day . 
  they can contact people to find good routes -- there are always going to be human smugglers -- and they can wear warm clothing or bring floatation devices . 
  i do n't have personal familiarity with the terrain , but i 'm very dubious when people say that they can block illegal immigration across borders by just controlling border crossings . 
  i think that you 'd be better-off just fingerprinting people at borders so that they can be later identified -- that way , they * might * not try to bypass the border station . 
  if they are blocked , they 're liable to just go around . 
   17 pm is n't it either 12 hour ( am/pm ) or 24 hour ( 0-23 ) , but not both ? 
  well , to be fair , the us * does * tend to establish self-governing democracies . 
  the beef the founding fathers had with britain was that the colonies were n't self-governing , and you had the uk establishing forced trade monopolies and imposing taxes and the like , where the colonists did n't have the ability to choose not to take part . 
  [ not a lot of colonies left ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/non-self-governing.png ) . 
  probably a reason that various countries dropped them . 
  if i had to guess : ** the relative value of unskilled labor fell off ** . 
  probably more-exciting things to do than to try to extract some of the surplus from some already dirt-poor african country . 
  countries stopped becoming wealthy by turning poorer countries into colonies and extracting surplus wealth , and so i suspect that the economics do n't work out all that well any more . 
  hail automation and industrialization and all that . 
  ** lack of technological advantage . 
  ** a critical element of being able to take over countries in africa was a military technological advantage . 
  that [ no longer exists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maxim_gun ) :  the maxim gun was first used by britain 's colonial forces in the 1893 -- 1894 first matabele war in rhodesia . 
  during the battle of the shangani , 700 soldiers fought off 5,000 warriors with just four maxim guns . 
  it played an important role in the swift european colonization of africa in the late 19th century . 
  the extreme lethality was employed to devastating effect against obsolete charging tactics , when native opponents could be lured into pitched battles in open terrain . 
  as it was put by hilaire belloc , in the words of the figure `` blood '' in his poem `` the modern traveller '' :   * whatever happens , we have got *   * the maxim gun , and they have not . 
  * [ 8 ] the soviets and the chinese have dumped [ gobs of ak-47s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-47#cultural_influence_and_impact ) all over the world . 
  [ as the founding fathers in the us pointed out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalist_no._46 ) , it 's a bit difficult to impose government on people who do n't want you running things when the populace is well-armed . 
  maybe some new technological jump , like moving to drones and fully-automated something-or-others ... but i do n't think that the gap will ever be as large as it once was . 
  ** changing level of communication ** . 
  it 's easier ( barring maybe something like north korea ) for people to see that they 've got a raw deal today , because they can cheaply talk to many people elsewhere in the world . 
  technology may make it easier for the state to control that -- i think the jury 's still out on whether it facilitates totalitarianism or not -- but i 'm not sure that the environment would still be conducive to colonialism . 
  there 's us and them . 
  i 'm rooting for us . 
   while in fact all it will end are war refugees coming from syria . 
  it will also prevent people claiming that they are war refugees coming from syria . 
  what is that , realistically , going to do ? 
  you have a border checkpoint . 
  it 's not allowing people in . 
  so they walk a mile off to the side and cross the border on foot . 
  not just one , but every last politician in germany is retarded ? 
  it 's not clear from the article whether this is only true for a320s destined for the us , or for all a320s . 
  for those not familiar with the reference , [ * papers , please * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/papers,_please ) . 
  well , there 's [ mr. ice cold ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3keb9m/with_eyes_on_europe_iraqis_line_up_to_leave/cuwy13m ) . 
  is n't doing the will of the people democratic ? 
   as i explained , they 'd have no right to live , work , or draw benefits in another country . 
  and you have to live off something . 
  there are eleven million illegal immigrants over here in the us . 
  they are n't starving . 
  there 's a premium in that they are constrained to only work illegally ( and thus they are poorer than they otherwise would be ) , but it seems to me that unless europe adopts successful regulation that the us has not , it 's not reasonable to assume illegality of work alone is going to stop illegal immigration . 
   walk ? 
  we do n't have border controls due to schengen , we 'd have to close the borders again . 
  i still think that schengen is n't all that relevant to illegal migration . 
  what does closing the borders actually mean ? 
  some guys in little customs houses ? 
  you can still go around those . 
  okay , in some places there are wide rivers , and that will slow things down , but the us [ has a river too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9jqtiknh5g ) , desert on the other side , a fence in places , and helicopters and all that .
