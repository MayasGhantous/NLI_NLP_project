  if you want to close schengen , fine , but i really do n't think that it 's going to buy most countries a whole lot in terms of blocking illegal immigration . 
  my guess will be that sometime next year or so , assuming that problems arise , there will be a political lobby saying that any integration issues are because people have n't been granted citizenship , and without that citizenship , they do n't feel like they 're fully part of society . 
  syria is a [ bit over 20 % illiterate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_literacy_rate ) . 
  that being said , the illiteracy is somewhat-more concentrated among women , presumably because of cultural differences ( i.e. 
  women should stay in the home , etc ) , and men only have a 14 % illiteracy rate . 
  at least for the moment , the migrants are predominantly-male , so until families start coming over via family reunification policies or the demographics change , you probably can expect something more like 14 % illiteracy . 
  also , note that basic literacy does n't entail a whole lot of education across the population .

  so , by that standard , germany is way behind poland on taking in refugees on a per-capita basis ? 
  everyone else the heck out , the welsh are taking the islands back !, 
   this is why this delusion is strongest among eastern europeans commentators . 
  their thought process is basically `` but why suffer with non-white immigrants , we 'd love to emigrate and we 're white , and that 's obviously better '' do n't eastern europeans -- at least among eu members -- already have right-to-work and right-to-live ( albeit not citizenship ) anywhere in the eu ?

  an arctic conflict would be with either nato members , sweden , or finland . 
  if russia is n't planning to mix things up with nato , running very large , very expensive arctic training exercises has a limited number of alternative targets . 
  and russia * has * invaded and established occupations of parts of two of their neighbors in the last seven years . 
  now , granted , you could say that that 's just ( resource-intensive ) posturing too . 
  because it would then block nato actions , the point of nato for a lot of members is dealing with russia , and unanimous agreement is required by existing members to add a country . 
  also , because what russia 's been doing recently is pretty much exactly what a lot of people who want to be in nato were worried that they might do . 
  for at least conflicts with russia , there 's road and rail access to move soldiers and equipment .

  granted , it 's not as if aircraft are directly comparable , but if we 're just looking at total inventory count , as you were , the eu does n't seem to be all that badly-off ...

   i thought defence alliances were against the swedish constitution or something . 
  http://www.riksdagen.se/en/documents-and-laws/laws/the-constitution/ i do n't see anything in the swedish constitution that looks like it would qualify . 
  the closest thing is requiring that the legislature must be involved in international treaties and in declaring war . 
  ( of course , the us legislature approving is * also * supposed to be a requirement for the us to wage war , and that 's regularly-ignored due to it being politically-unpleasant ) ... 
  in fact , the swedish constitution appears to explicitly authorize this :  deployment of armed forces   art . 
  the government may send swedish armed forces to other countries or otherwise deploy such forces in order to fulfil an international obligation approved by the riksdag . 
  swedish armed forces may also be sent to other countries or be deployed if :   1 . it is permitted by an act of law setting out the conditions for such action ; or   2 . the riksdag permits such action in a special case . 
   as older people are more likely to vote conservative , the government is more likely to do whatever they want and bollocks to the rest . 
  would n't the government be more-interested in what appeals to swing voters ?

  * japan had committed deeply to an occupation of china and had been fighting for quite a few years by this point ; the us put them in a position where they either had to back out of china or fight the us . 
  * japan [ never expected to be able to win a long war against the us ] ( http://www.history.army.mil/books/amh/amh-23.htm ) -- it did n't have the capability to do that -- but to rely on the cost in blood and gold of the war being higher than the us would be willing to pay . 
  the idea would have been to put the us and other allies in a position where winning back the land lost would have cost a lot of lives , gamble that the public would n't be willing to do the bleeding , and then offer to hand back a bunch of the land if the allies recognized some of their conquests . 
  that may-or-may-not have been realistic . 
  it 's true that japan badly-misjudged the political effects in the us of attacking the us -- the public was not willing to let the attack go . 
  on the other hand , the us also misjudged japan , since the us thought that japan would simply give up on the occupation of china . 
  at that point , japan ( and in particular , the rather independent military ) was heavily-invested in the occupation .
