  even if you ca n't swim , you can carry an inflatable floation device . 
   also armed security guards right , but then you 're back to `` a combination of the two '' . 
  well , okay , you could have non-military guards -- i was thinking of `` soldiers '' as guards in general . 
   infra-red people sensors . 
  does n't do anything on its own -- you 're stuck with having someone respond to the thing going off . 
  the only viable non-humans-involved approach that i can think of would be [ automated weapons with sensors ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/05/israel_robo_sniper_gaza/ ) . 
  since those are n't quite in an off-the-shelf state and it requires actually killing the people trying to cross , in practice , that probably means that there are going to be people stationed out there if you want a realistic barrier . 
   either soldiers or a fence or a combination of the two , '' nikola poposki was quoted as saying in an interview with hungarian business weekly figyelo . 
  well , a fence alone * definitely * is n't going to do anything . 
  it can demarcate a border or slow people down , but a human being is quite capable of making it over any fence . 
  really ? 
  you actually predicted that when you heard the initial story ? 
  i certainly did n't . 
  that 's a terrible subreddit name -- it 's not specific to the particular crisis . 
  also , i do n't really think that setting up iron curtains for population to keep people in place again is a great idea . 
  and i think that it 's very reasonable to point out that this wo n't be a one-off quota : this sorta kicks the can down the road . 
  here are some others approaches that i think would be preferable . 
  they all provide a long-term solution rather than a short-term patch , and i do n't think that they create mis-incentives or political pressures likely to cause the eu to fragment . 
  ** the federalist approach ** the 1951 refugee convention was n't really written with the idea of a supranational entity like the eu in mind . 
  it guarantees freedom of movement within a country . 
  extend to refugees freedom of movement within the eu , just like citizens have . 
  in the long term , if permanent residents are given citizenship * anyway * , they wind up with freedom of movement . 
  if necessary , brussels could be given a veto or ability to cap individual countries extending citizenship to refugees . 
  that 's the `` more federalist '' approach , and i think that , at least for countries that want a shift towards federalism , this is the most-sensible approach , since many of the decisions today will affect the eu as a whole . 
  pros : does n't create long-term friction when people who got in through one country 's policies get into the eu as a whole anyway . 
  if you 're a federalist , this means that you do n't create future barriers towards moving towards a federal environment , since it means that they likely open their borders to anyone who gets citizenship long term . 
  think of the kind of friction that gypsies created , and if countries do n't want refugees in their country , they wo n't like it more when it becomes bound up to eventual federalization . 
  refugees will love it . 
  no internal control issues . 
  results in a consensus decision . 
  if you favor a pro-immigration approach , you 'll like this ( though some implementations will cap total numbers ) . 
  cons : the uk wo n't like this at all , since it kills the value of the english channel to them , and the timing is bad as regards referendum * and * its a move towards a federal state that the uk may not want , at least for itself . 
  sweden and germany probably wo n't be enthralled either : it basically means that they take in everyone . 
  malta may not like having their ability to extend eu citizenship capped . 
  ** the australian approach ** the 1951 refugee convention creates bad incentives : pleasant idea to try , but in practice , it creates too many problems . 
  drop it , and instead adopt a new convention that disallows freedom of movement and of labor . 
  australia set up overseas camps in new guinea for people claiming refugee status to eliminate the economic incentive to apply for refugee status , and the eu can do the same . 
  individual countries or the eu identify a reasonably-isolated ( island ! ), 
  that 's safe and sets up camps there . 
  this means that refugees will be given short-term asylum , but wo n't receive permanent citizenship . 
  pros : solves the war refugee problem , potentially in very large numbers . 
  easier to sell to public concerned about immigration . 
  makes it easier to resettle syria once the conflict dies down . 
  if you favor an anti-immigration approach , you 'll like this . 
  can transition fixed numbers of people from this to the federalist approach by granting them eu citizenship if the eu has a consensus decision to do so . 
  cons : withdrawing from major international treaties is awkward . 
  foregoing labor ( or , if you want to set up a special economic zone , limiting it ) is inefficient . 
  ** the seal-off-the-schengen-zone approach ** the `` harden your hearts and simply look away '' approach . 
  this entails withdrawal from the 1951 refugee convention as well . 
  the eu ( well , schengen members ) fund border control along schengen and do not accept any refugees . 
  pros : inexpensive . 
  i think that this is probably more-realistic as regards future conflict in africa : i do n't think that wars are going to end , and there are some compelling arguments that future wars , in a more-connected , slightly-wealthier africa will result in similar huge outflows to europe . 
  if you favor a strongly-anti-immigration approach , you 'll like this . 
  cons : a lot of refugees are going to remain where they are , in really lousy situations , and some are going to die . 
  going to be tough to sell to [ cosmopolitanists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cosmopolitanism ) . 
  the result of that will be western europe leaving nato because now russia is intermarium 's problem . 
  which means most of the major sources of non-us military funding also doing the same . 
  oooh , that article has a link to another great potential submission to / r/russiadenies : http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/164125/russia-denies-military-buildup-in-syria, 
  soviet pilots did fight us pilots . 
  as far as i know , the korean war is considered a proxy war , not `` a proxy war but not with respect to the chinese '' . 
   the new penalties include three years in prison for anyone climbing over the newly-built razor wire fence along the border with serbia i 'm not sure how credible of a threat this is . 
  hungary has to actually have enough room to imprison people to do this . 
  http://dailynewshungary.com/number-of-people-incarcerated-in-hungary-up-by-50pc/  andras csoti , hungary 's top prison official , said between 17,500 and 17,700 people are incarcerated in hungary at present , although the capacity of jails and prisons is only 13,736 . 
  cell space for another 6,000 is planned to be built by 2019 , he added . 
  so hungary at the * best * of times can only handle 14k people and is already well over capacity . 
  updated : i believe that you 're correct . 
   moscow has granted its approval for the creation of a panel to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons in the syrian conflict . 
  the un security council passed a resolution on the matter more than a month ago . 
  huh . 
  how did the unsc pass anything that moscow objected to ? 
  [ goes two months back ]  russia , syria 's veto-wielding ally on the security council , agreed to endorse the measure during a friday vote . 
  so moscow was n't actually all that upset about it : they just wanted some additions to it . 
  makes things less politically-awkward to get un endorsement . 
  also , i imagine that the uk does n't hurt from ensuring that the unsc authority is maintained . 
  hmm . 
  i 'd been using asylum as a synonym for `` refugee status '' , since that 's what the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) does . 
  there are apparently slightly different meanings in some countries . 
  at least [ in the us ] ( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/asylum-or-refugee-status-who-32298.html ) , they 're almost identical , but you apply for asylum if you 're already in the country when applying , and refugee status if you are n't in the country . 
  skimming the english-language version of some german government sites , it looks like germany also has some difference , and that the difference is also very minor -- it may be the same as the us , though i could n't find an explicit description of the differences . 
  i did see many pages that used the terms more-or-less interchangably . 
  `` asylum '' and `` refugee status '' definitely do n't distinguish between permanent and temporary residency grants -- that 's a different division , and [ definitely both only result in temporary grants ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/en/topics/migration-integration/asylum-refugee-protection/asylum-refugee-protection_germany/asylum-refugee-policy-germany_node.html ) , though at that point i imagine that there might be various legal paths for someone to start trying to work on obtaining permanent residency . 
  [ discovering romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lin2y6lpxua ), 
   that does n't mean they will get it . 
  ~ ~ germany has stated that they will not reject syrians . 
  that does n't mean that they will guarantee a grant of permanent residency * a la * sweden , but if someone makes it to germany and is from syria ( well , can convince germany that they are , i guess ) , they can expect to get asylum . ~ ~ i believe that / u/silmarillion _ is correct : all of the discussion re : germany has been around dublin , though many articles have had rather vague titles .

  and just to be clear , for / u/dclauzel critics -- `` shit '' is not merely a euphemism for `` things that / u/dclauzel disagrees with '' . 
  last time i saw him removing a post , it was a pro-immigration post removed for an pro-immigration editorialized title . 
   it does n't necessarily need to be `` competitive '' , it just needs to be cost effective . 
  you pay a one off fee and then you never have to pay for your energy needs again . 
  it 's just another way of expressing the same thing , because you can say `` in the long run , if you amortize the cost out '' . 
   the same is not true of solar panels . 
  well , all right , let 's take pv-electric generation . 
  a few notes : * electrical companies generally do n't use pv-electric generation , and the same economic realities apply to them as to you : that is , if pv-electric were really great , they 'd have every incentive to use pv-electric . 
  the [ 2014 breakdown in the us ] ( http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&amp;t=3 ) is 39 % coal , 27 % natural gas , 6 % hydropower and so on and so forth and eventually all forms of solar , including pv-electric , are at 0.4 % . 
  that electrical generation company is n't dumb -- if it can make more money via pv-electric , it 's going to do it . 
  but it 's choosing not to do so . 
  when it happens , it 's due to subsidization . 
  * pv-electric cells do n't last forever : they do need to be replaced , so you 're amortizing costs over their lifetime .
