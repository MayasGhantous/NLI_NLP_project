  hungary has no legal obligation to do this , but certainly it would be * less * disagreeable to the article subjects , as they 'd become permanent residents of europe . 
  they would n't live in wealthy sweden , but then ... it seems a bit difficult to say that syrians need to be guaranteed a higher standard of living than unworthy hungarians . 
  i do n't really think that hungary should do this , but at least i could understand where someone is coming from . 
  i would point out that countries had the option to write up the 1951 refugee convention to agree to grant * permanent residence * and specifically chose not to do so -- instead , it only grants asylum for the duration . 
  so hungary is certainly no more-objectionable than the rest of the world . 
  sweden [ promised permanent residency to all syrians who applied , starting two years ago ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20130903/50030 ) . 
  sweden is probably a much larger factor than germany : germany only promised that syrians would n't be rejected , not that they 'd get permanent residency . 
   that thay would take on everyone who could make it sweden did n't say that they would accept everyone who would make it . 
  they said that they would grant all * syrians * who applied permanent residency . 
  they 're going to sweden , which , as of two years ago , promised permanent residency to any syrian who showed up . 
  i 'd guess that that 's a substantial reason for the deluge heading across all of europe northwards . 
  proxy war . 
  the deaths do n't determine the status . 
  the korean war was a proxy war , but soviet and chinese and un soldiers all died . 
   the british have been exemplary hosts to those in distress . 
  the jews expelled by edward i. . . that is n't actually the most-compelling argument to start the paragraph with . 
  that is most-definitely posed . 
  well , i guess that there 's a chance that it 's not , in which case the mother is sending her kid 's unprotected face through razor wire , but i kinda doubt it . 
  i wonder how much money the european commission spends on generating these reports . 
  i honestly believe that most people would prefer to work rather than intentionally remain unemployed . 
  they may or may not all be able to find work , but i have a hard time swallowing the `` everyone in the country is just gunning for welfare '' . 
  that does n't mean that mass immigration would n't mess up the welfare system , but i 'd at least buy that people are * willing * to work . 
   there is no mention in refugee law that states a refugee must claim asylum in the first safe country . 
  that 's not correct . 
  they are only guaranteed immunity against being treated as an illegal immigrant if they do this . 
  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention  article 31 . 
    refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge   1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i ** , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  if they 'd applied remotely , say via contacting the government of germany , germany might be stuck having to deal with them . 
  but illegally-immigrating after having passed through a safe country ( or failing to promptly register with authorities , or failing to show a good reason for the immigration being illegal ) throws this away . 
  and it 's possible , i expect , that one such penalty for illegal immigration might be refusing refugee status . 
  the same complaints of unpleasant conditions apply to people around the world , and the countries in question are far from the worst -- i 'd say that some civil wars further south in africa have been rather worse . 
  if you advocate an accept , even if you 're purely making a moral argument , you also need to either : * let everyone in . 
  * describe criteria for why your moral criteria excludes person x in , say , malawi or nepal . 
  i think that that is at least as unpleasant to answer . 
   `` hungary does n't want us here , but they wo n't let us leave . '', 
  hungary will not let you illegally move further northwest into the eu . 
  hungary is not holding you prisoner : if you ask to be deported , hungary will most certainly permit that . 
   four days of wet clothes that hardly dry before the rains come again and no humanitarian organization , no government -- no one to do something as simple as setting up a tarp . 
  this is staying at a border and trying to cross it . 
  if someone asks for asylum in the country where they are presently , they should wind up being processed . 
   the `` they '' that lets things happens tends to be the west . 
  and despite `` they '' having failed to act time and time again , many still continue to cling to the hope that perhaps , this one time , they will act . 
  you have a civil war . 
  stopping a civil war promptly means an invasion . 
  yes , the united states and the uk and france and any number of other countries could invade and set up a government and end a war , and this would be expensive and might not be stable -- one of the primary complaints today are that the government that was established in iraq * did n't * stay stable . 
   this is the gateway to a life of dignity , where human rights are respected . 
  or so the refugees thought . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the eu never advertised illegal immigration across the country as a route that they 'd support to obtain residence in germany or the uk or whatnot . 
  of course , i ca n't speak as to what opinions were formed , but unless the eu issued a statement otherwise , it 's pretty hard to claim that the eu needs to do this . 
   her only hope to save them is to get to germany and legally bring them to join her . 
  and germany , in turn , probably does n't really want to have the population of syria transferred to germany . 
   just the mention of `` camp '' in hungary creates a visceral reaction among the refugees . 
  the camps are loathed and feared . 
  because it would mean having to live in a poorer country ? 
  if so , the `` hope '' is n't one of safety from war , as described above , but in making an economic migration . 
  http://www.theloop.ca/how-we-measure-up-penis-lengths-and-bra-sizes-around-the-world/ denmark is above-average . 
  scandinavia and russia are at the top . 
   age-old lessons that europe forgets hmm . 
  i 'm kinda doubtful that , say , a couple hundred years ago , europe would have been dramatically more-enthusiastic about taking in the same migrants . 
  how about per-capita statistics ? 
  hmm , i guess there was a history there :  in february 2014 , the swiss voters narrowly accepted a referendum limiting the freedom of movement of foreign citizens to switzerland . 
  the european commission said it would have to examine the implications of the result on eu -- swiss relations . 
  [ 12 ]   the implementation of this referendum would entail the renunciation of the agreement on the free movement of people and , absent agreement otherwise , the triggering of the guillotine clause collapsing the other six bilateral i agreements . 
  the eu withdrew from negotiations about swiss participation in the new eu scientific agenda , [ 13 ] which results in ( at least temporary ) exclusion from swiss students and universities from the erasmus programme , european research council grants , and downgrading switzerland from associated to third country in horizon 2020 calls . 
  it signed an agreement in december 2014 . 
   the american railway system is geared towards transporting goods , not people . 
  [ * economist * article with more detail ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/16636101 ) . 
  there are a few places where passenger rail manages to break even in the us , like the corridor from new jersey into new york city , but that 's also where the population density is on par with the uk . 
  but ... switzerland is n't even part of the european union . 
  it 'd be like the eu deciding that mongolia should take in refugees . 
  has there been any past tradition of the eu making policy calls in switzerland ? 
   the same thing annoyed me when the white house flat-out refused the proposed televised debate between ahmadinejad and obama a few years back , since they did n't want to give a platform to iranian rhetoric . 
  huh . 
  when ahmedinejad came to talk at columbia , opponents there arranged for cultural wedge questions and [ turned it into a propaganda coup against him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zael96pxgei ) . 
  i mean , come on . 
  if there 's one organization that knows how to sell political ideas and people in the us , it 's the big two parties , and obama is where he is because he was the best politicker of the people that they could offer up . 
  you really think that ahmedinejad is going to out-sell obama ?

  i do n't really see any way to reasonably judge her age -- she 's got a hand covering her face . 
  well , this should be a grand social experiment to settle the question , then , since we 've a range of countries with very different welfare systems in place that we 'll be able to compare . 
  hmm . 
  well , if you have a war that kills off a lot of your population ... biologically , women are the reproduction bottleneck . 
  so if country a sends both its men and its women to war , and country b sends only its men to war , the next generation , country b potentially has a lot more people than country a.
