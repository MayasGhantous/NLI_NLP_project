  by that metric , men are more expendable than women . 
   forty per cent of muslims between the ages of 16 and 24 said they would prefer to live under sharia law in britain , a legal system based on the teachings of the koran . 
  the figure among over-55s , in contrast , was only 17 per cent . 
  it 's not clear to me that that 's a particularly-interesting statistic in terms of showing a generational difference , though : the young and the old are also dramatically politically-split in the us as well : concerns and views shift with age . 
  on the other hand , there 's a [ pew study on muslims in the us ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf ) that ( partly ) avoids the age issue -- for some questions , it compares just first-gen muslim immigrants to other muslims , and while it states that muslims in the us are significantly-more-moderate than muslims in the eu , there is certainly a higher degree of `` split '' in native-born than foreign-born muslims -- native-born muslims more-strongly want mosques to play an important role in advocating their views , for example . 
  some questions do n't eliminate age :  there are few differences on this question in the united states across muslim ethnic groups , but age is an important factor . 
  younger muslims in the u.s. are more willing to accept suicide bombing in the defense of islam than are their older counterparts . 
  among muslims younger than 30 , for example , 15 % say that suicide bombing can often or sometimes be justified ( 2 % often , 13 % sometimes ) , while about two - thirds ( 69 % ) say that such ta ctics are never justified . 
  among muslims who are 30 or older , by contrast , just 6 % say suicide bombings can be often or sometimes justified , while 82 % say such attacks are never warranted . 
    the higher levels of support for suicide bombing seen among young american muslims resembles patterns found among muslims in europe , where muslims also constitute a minority population . 
  in great britain , france and germany , muslims under the age of 30 are consistently the least likely to say that suicide bombing is never justified . 
  in other words , the share who think suicide bombing against civilians can ever be justified , even if rarely , is higher among those younger than 30 compared with those who are older . 
  about a quarter ( 26 % ) of younger u.s. muslims say suicide bombing can at least rarely be justified , 17 percentage points higher than the proportion of muslims ages 30 and older ( 9 % ) who share that view . 
  the age gap is about as wide in great britain ( 18 percentage points ) but somewhat narrower in germany ( 12 points ) , france ( 11 points ) and spain ( 7 points ) . 
  what little cross-european-country data existed here showed that muslims in * germany * , interestingly-enough , have a different political opinion profile from those in the uk , france , and spain , and instead look like us muslims . 
  first it was our `` we protect christianity and family values against your atheism '' schtick that russia swiped . 
  then it was the `` outlaw '' harley-riding [ biker gangs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/night_wolves ) running rock concerts . 
  now it 's waving the american flag everywhere . 
  somewhere , russia 's propaganda folks have some marketing guy who is really , really gung-ho on a 1950s us motif . 
  i 'm just waiting for the rooskie marilyn monroe . 
  what is the practical impact of being the largest party ? 
  my ( unfamiliar with swedish politics ) understanding is that thus far , other political parties in sweden have simply refused to form a coalition with sd ; if all other parties agreed to form a coalition with other parties in preference , i 'd think that they could kill sd 's political power , at least until sd gets up to 50 % . 
  when they made the decision , they were apparently getting something like 7k applications per year . 
  the policy-makers may not quite have anticipated the scale of the response that would come . 
  there are statistics that support this ? 
   jonny jihad beheading women then a democratoc state those are n't mutually-exclusive options . 
   america is still in germany . 
  it is still in japan . 
  it is still in korea . 
  but not as an occupier or with government authority : at the request of the government there . 
  the us [ terminated the occupation of japan april 28 , 1952 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupation_of_japan ) . 
  the allied powers [ terminated the occupation of germany october 23 , 1954 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_and_paris_conferences ) . 
  the us occupation of korea [ ended in 1948 ] ( http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/9.htm ) ( sorry , corrected ) . 
  the iraqi government did not want us troops to remain . 
  doing otherwise would have been an occupation . 
   nato isnt a country , it 's an imperialist pact . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire  an empire is defined as `` an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government , usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom , as the former british empire , french empire , russian empire , byzantine empire or roman empire . 
  '' ... an imperial political structure can be established and maintained in two ways : ( i ) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or ( ii ) as a coercive , hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power . 
  nato membership is not coerced ( at least by the us or by germany ; what military threats russia might pose are n't under control of those parties ) . 
  a nato member can choose to leave at any time , pending a one year delay after notification . 
   of course russia will be angry when americans and germans use baltics as puppets . 
  yes , because if there 's one thing that the us is really , really interested in , it 's `` puppeting '' the baltic countries . 
   germany and usa can build their missile defense systems in their own country , but shouldnt be allowed to build in in anothers country . 
  what if that country is happy to have those systems there ? 
  should they be disallowed to host them ? 
   at the end of the day , baltic people will suffer well , i do n't believe that it 's happened yet , but if so , they can leave and avoid said suffering . 
  why is it called the `` nato fence '' ? 
   shocking ugh . 
  consistently , every time i see a british article containing this word , the article is bad . 
  there does n't seem to be any quantitative data at all in the article indicating that there has been an increase in sex crime . 
  `` it cost much gold , blood , and sweat , but , my irish brethren , we are finally successfully united with the uk ! '', 
  i do n't think that a snippet of text written on-the-spot is as reliable as wikipedia , which at least has undergone rounds of people looking for egregious content in it . 
  if they were quoting history book passages , that 'd be one thing . 
   but the problem is that the people will just go north to you instead of traveling across the atlantic . 
  ( a ) central america is n't the same thing as south america : [ dari\u00e9n gap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dari%c3%a9n_gap ) ( b ) you offer south americans citizenship in spain/portugal/france / whoever speaks the language in question , and i am quite confident that you will get as many volunteers as you have open slots . 
  i get really annoyed about askhistorians mandating original work rather than quoting existing material like wikipedia . 
  < shrug  seems to me to be more brotherly feelings in the eu than you folks in russia saw in the ussr . 
   especially with germany arrogantly hectoring other eu member states about how many migrants they should admit . 
  from the uk 's standpoint , that 's understandable . 
  from germany 's standpoint , i expect this looks like trying to protect greece and italy from being swamped by a wave that they did n't create . 
  what if the people who immigrate wind up secularizing and dropping islam and this turns into the greatest de-islamization that the world has seen ? 
  some people in the us southwest were pretty panicky about the wave of spanish coming in and taking over : in practice , it meant that a lot of people wound up learning english . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold_war_ii#other_european_countries  the russian leadership under putin sees the fracturing of the political unity within the eu and especially the political unity between the eu and the us as among its main strategic goals .
