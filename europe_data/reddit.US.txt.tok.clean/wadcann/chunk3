  guerrilla warfare is focused entirely around leveraging the ability to make an opponent 's costs unacceptably high ( via making for an expensive * occupation * ) . 
  even if ukraine is n't conducting guerrilla warfare , the idea is still the same : make whoever is invading have to weigh how much the invasion will cost them , and for that cost to be too-high to be worthwhile . 
  it 's still almost-certainly not controlling for population density , though . 
  https://xkcd.com/1138/ in fact , the * example * given was `` furry pornography '' on a heat map . 
  xkcd is always relevant ... 
  i 'm assuming that you mean poor , urban blacks ? 
  well ... no , i do n't think so , though you do have a valid point that the above groups do n't map perfectly either . 
  the two other americans saying that the comparison there would more-reasonably be to gypsies than chavs in europe probably is accurate . 
  `` chav '' , as i understand it , implies someone who is a youth , poor , limited education , limited `` knowledge of polite society '' , `` anti-social '' in the sense of harassing people , wears ostentatious designer clothing . 
  i 've read some interesting articles about how people from a wealthy background spend money versus how those from a very poor background spend money . 
  people who have a poor background statistically tend to spend more money on flashy , high-profile examples of that wealth : expensive brand-name sneakers , shirts , hats , shiny bits on a car , etc. 
  people from a wealthier background tend to spend money in a lower-profile way , like vacations . 
  my guess is that that 's the source of the designer clothing and the infamous burberry hat ; it 's people wanting to show their peers that they 've `` made it '' . 
  that certainly * does * show up in the us , and there are `` brand '' - showing subcultures . 
  the majority of the us has a car-based culture , which tends to geographically-isolate the poor , which i suspect is a factor in reducing street harassment ( or at least its visibility to society as a whole ) . 
  a `` redneck '' might have limited social education , but i 'm having a hard time thinking of a named us social group that does so specifically in the context of harassing people . 
  there are a lot of groups that all have * elements * of `` chav '' , but i ca n't really think of a single group that directly corresponds . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/furry_fandom  the furry fandom is a subculture interested in fictional anthropomorphic animal characters with human personalities and characteristics . 
  [ 1 ] examples of anthropomorphic attributes include exhibiting human intelligence and facial expressions , the ability to speak , walk on two legs , and wear clothes . 
  furry fandom is also used to refer to the community of people who gather on the internet and at furry conventions . 
   a `` furry '' is someone who is into dressing up as an animal and pretending to be an animal at the least , and into beastiality at the worst . 
  it 's slang for zoophilia , basically . 
  no , it 's not something that is equivalent to beastiality . 
  or at least , not in us parlance . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/furry_fandom  a portion of the fandom is sexually interested in zoophilia , although a majority take a negative stance towards the former . 
  [ 37 ] in a survey conducted by david j. 
  rust in 1997-1998 , about 2 % of furry respondents stated an interest in zoophilia , and less than 1 % an interest in plushophilia , though the survey 's accompanying study does n't comment on these results , . 
  that looks like a population density map to me . 
  probably more-interesting to weight by inverse population density . 
   german chancellor angela merkel , however , has never showed a particular affinity for defense spending . 
  at the munich security conference last month , she looked ukrainian president petro poroshenko in the eye and told him he could not win a war against russia ... and vietnam [ could n't beat the us in a war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnam_war ) , and chechnya [ could n't beat russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_chechen_war ) . 
  it is always the case that one country or coalition of countries in europe has been stronger than another , but it 's not as if everyone outside of that zeroed their military spending and bent the knee in abject surrender to the strongest . 
  the goal does n't need to be capable of prevailing in an all-in , damn-the-consequences war , but to be painful enough to attack that there will not be an attempt in the first place . 
  well , you would n't want to destroy the pipeline to russia . 
  what you ideally would want would be shipping capacity to handle existing ( or at least at-an-acceptably-reduced-level ) capacity , so that either all suppliers need to collaborate against you * or * the power of any one supplier to induce political pressure is limited to the price difference between the least-expensive supply that is n't their own and their own supply . 
  * my understanding is that lithuania 's construction of lng facilities some time back were to create such an alternative . 
  * as the article says , this ca n't replace a total russian gas shut-off : the capacity buildout does n't exist . 
  i 'd thought ( some document i 'd read ) that it could , theoretically , handle 17 % of present lithuanian usage ; the article says `` about one-fifth '' . 
  furthermore , there are other east european countries , and lithuania ca n't fully-handle its own demand , much less supply them . 
  however , certainly ( possibly combined with rationing ) if there was brinkmanship with a cutoff , it would help extend the time that they could hold out , and the political power of a cutoff comes from the ability to hold out longer than the other side can . 
  the bound is apparently the lithuanian-side lng unloading or processing capacity , so it 's not just a matter of shipping it from a source other than the us to get more capacity . 
  * the shipping makes the gas more-expensive . 
  the article does n't list the difference , but i recall reading an article that the price could not compete with piped-in russian levels . 
  assuming russia was guaranteed not to cut off lithuania , lithuania would prefer to use russian gas . 
  edit : sorry , someone else pointed out that russia simply currently increases charges to lithuania enough to drive the cost above what lithuania cut the deal for on the lng ; they apparently have some pretty-hefty margins . 
  actual costs , the price that russia * could * go down to , though , are lower than the price that could be gotten via lng shipping from the us . 
  * if someone wants to get an export license on the us side , this is probably politically a good time for them to do so . 
  dow chemical and other petrochemical manufacturers have been trying to block licenses to export gas to europe to artificially keep down gas prices in the us and thus their cost of production . 
  * the lithuanian lng facility is not the only one in europe , and there is infrastructure elsewhere in europe to unload lng , from the us or from other countries who could ship lng . 
  i was reading about [ one in italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adriatic_lng_terminal ) . 
  while i 'm not sure how-close to capacity it operates , assuming that gas can flow relatively-freely within european energy markets , whatever free capacity it has can probably also be used to ship gas to poland and the baltics . 
  wikipedia also [ lists a number of european lng terminals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_lng_terminals ) that probably are not operating at full capacity , but could be made to do so in a crisis : one in belgium , three in france , one in greece , two in italy , the one in lithuania , one in portugal , seven in spain , five in the uk , and two in turkey . 
  i do n't know what kind of fees countries in europe charge to permit gas to flow through their gas pipeline network , but that would also open up options . 
  are we bound to united kingdom culture for using english ? 
  that 's kind of ironic . 
  also , if the uk were regularly in the business of knocking off people on russian soil , you really would think that russia would be a little more cautious about litvinenko . 
  if it can be done and there 's no mechanism to discourage it , it will probably happen . 
  on [ reddit a while back ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/24sdzp/i_think_i_just_got_a_drone_in_the_mail/ ) , some redditor had an [ rq-20 puma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aerovironment_rq-20_puma ) , a us military surveillance uav , accidentally mailed to him . 
   ... has a more balanced opinion than `` lets deport everyone and shut every border up tight '' or `` we must accept every person that even thinks about coming here '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_to_moderation  argument to moderation ( latin : argumentum ad temperantiam ) -- also known as [ argument from ] middle ground , false compromise , gray fallacy and the golden mean fallacy [ 1 ] -- is an informal fallacy which asserts that the truth can be found as a compromise between two opposite positions . 
   the us has kept itself strong through strict federalism which , one should note , meant sending in the military to squash secessionism . 
  if there are any isolated enclaves within those regions , they should independently secede !, 
   as far as international relations are concerned , they are a city-state inside the country of china . 
  taiwan has a tld , a military , and for all practical purposes to the world operates independently of the prc . 
  you can decide whether diplomatic niceties are more-important . 
  the confederate states of america thought that they were going to peacefully secede from the united states of america too . 
   basically our generation only inherited a lot of debts ( retirement will never happen for millenials , welfare is going extinct & healthcare in a massive deficit ) i do think that there 's an interesting argument here . 
  in the united states , and as far as i 'm aware , everywhere in the world , it 's not possible to inherit debt . 
  estates will need to be settled , so someone might inherit a smaller or nonexistent positive inheritance , but it 's not possible to inherit debt . 
  for whatever , reason , policymakers decided that it was disadvantageous to permit a sort of established intergenerational debt-slavery . 
  fair enough -- i can see there being plausible reasons for that . 
  however , we * do n't * have that same restriction for * public * debt , and that seems to create a major loophole . 
  my parents can take out an arbitrary amount of debt against me , as long as that debt takes the form of public debt . 
  granted , a particular bond will expire , but it * is * normal to keep rolling over debt from generation to generation -- in effect , the debt is persistent . 
  i 've wondered occasionally whether that 's perhaps a bad thing , whether credit should be restricted . 
  so , for example , any decision to take out debt via a bond would split the debt up according to some formula among the people who were voters at the time that the debt was taken out . 
  any time someone with outstanding public debt dies , any outstanding debt would be levied against their estate ; any excess would be retired , with the creditor eating the loss . 
  it 's not clear to me that it would be inherently-beneficial or inherently-harmful to do this , but i think that it * would * avoid inefficient over-spending via debt financing , where one generation can spend the money of the next . 
  if this * were * to happen , it 's likely that there is some amount of * intentional * inter-generational wealth transfer that we would want to explicitly continue ( e.g. 
  old age welfare ) . 
  my reason for wanting this is to avoid the externality where one generation makes the * decision * to spend , where the next generation foots the bill -- without this , my guess is that we probably take out an economically-inefficient amount of debt . 
  this would also certainly have the effect of making credit more-expensive to obtain and probably reduce the amount taken out . 
  interested in thoughts , pro- or con - , that people have . 
  worth noting that , like most animals , polar bear population is going to be constrained by food . 
  there 's going to be enough starving off to maintain population equilibrium . 
   as elsewhere in france , pollution is made worse by the prevalence of diesel vehicles , which successive governments have promoted by subsidizing the fuel and making it 15 % cheaper than gasoline . 
  how about we just use gasoline and not have a car-free day instead ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polar_bear#long_distance_swimmer  researchers tracked 52 sows in the southern beaufort sea off alaska with gps system collars ; no boars were involved in the study due to males ' necks being too thick for the gps-equipped collars . 
  fifty long-distance swims were recorded ; the ** longest at 354 kilometres ( 220 mi ) ** , with an average of 155 kilometres ( 96 mi ) . 
  the length of these swims ranged from most of a day to ten days . 
  yeah , they 're pretty good swimmers . 
   programmed to kill - video games , drugs , and the ` new violence ' well , with [ jack thompson out of the picture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jack_thompson_%28activist%29 ) :  his basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as `` murder simulators '' to rehearse violent plans . 
  ... i guess we were overdue for the next round of activists . 
  glad to hear it , guys !, 
   why middle esstern people seem unable to take responsabilities for themselves and the fanaticism in their own lands ? 
  would you take responsibility for something the united states did because it 's in the west ? 
   the smartest choice is to actually start deporting bad elements in immigrant communities . 
  what criteria do you use to determine whether someone is a `` bad element '' ? 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/29/highereducation.internationaleducationnews  terrorism has little or nothing to do with economics , according to a new analysis of the social background of hizbullah militants in lebanon . 
    after also examining the income and education of palestinian suicide bombers and israelis implicated in civilian assassinations and attacks , the study concludes : `` any connection between poverty , education and terrorism is indirect and probably quite weak '' .
