  concerns were also raised that iranian gunships were trailing a u.s. container ship . 
  iran additionally fired shots over the bow , and seized , a ship registered in the marshall islands , part of a long-standing dispute between the two nations . 
  not to mention that russia says that the west needs to drop this atheist nonsense , which is destroying family values . 
  the us and poland are complaining that germany is n't sufficiently-militarized , [ poland and the czech republic are enthusiastic about germany , and germany and france are enthusiastically locking lips ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/05/29/chapter-4-views-of-eu-countries-and-leaders/ ) . 
  the us has a government subsidy for healthcare , and [ china and russia are competing with the us on low effective tax rates ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/17202505 ) . 
   it 's been 12 years ... you 're due . 
  we left in december 2011 . 
  it 's been less than four years . 
   western and russian planes in direct confrontation . 
  the [ korean war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ) had direct combat with chinese and russian planes on one side and un planes on the other . 
   coast guards should handle this , not the navy since this lacks a military dimension . 
  a minor note of semantics -- at least in the us , the coast guard [ is a branch of the military ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_armed_forces ) . 
   just a couple of days to remove the warlords/crimelords that are ruling the coast with a few troops of special forces , build some camps for the refugees and establish order . 
  i even think tunesia and egypt would applaud it . 
  well , the [ iraq war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraq_war ) ran for over eight-and-a-half years and cost the us alone [ somewhere north of $ 1t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_cost_of_the_iraq_war ) . 
  i mean , sure , things are different on a country-by-country basis , but i have a really hard time buying into a `` couple days '' just to militarily clean up multiple countries , much less build a viable , sustainable , stable nation in the place or build the facilities that you 're talking about . 
    because that plan went so well in iraq , afghanistan etc ? 
    that was ` murica , not us < shrugs , fetches popcorn  all right . 
  show us how it 's properly done . 
  i mean , hey , i think it 'd be interesting to see the eu in action , and it certainly is a direct and significant eu concern . 
   or are you just going to sink every moored boat from istanbul to benghazi on general principle ? 
  well , i guess that 'd [ solve one problem ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/life/nature-environment/1.604929 ) ... 
  if you want to deport , just deport and do whatever treaty/political stuff is required to make this viable . 
  there is no conceivable way in which it is politically harder to deal with deporting people than it is sinking ships and killing off refugees . 
  secondly , this is not * that * urgent for any reasons other than domestic political ones ( e.g. 
  maybe someone grants citizenship or something ) , and those are entirely-addressable by domestic policy-makers . 
  if you had pirates in the med looting your ships , that might be grounds for nato , but this is just complaining that it 's awkward to find politically-acceptable policies . 
  if nato came in , they 'd have no special mandate to sink that your existing coast guards and navies do n't have and would be bound by international law to rescue people from sinking ships . 
  if you use nato , that means that you have to sell even * more * countries on killing off a lot of refugees . 
  you have all the time in the world to round people up and deport them , if that 's what you want to do . 
  you should n't need to be killing them off . 
   you really do n't need to go through denmark . 
  ferries depart to sweden from kiel , rostock and travem\u00fcnde . 
  no papers needed and no questions asked . 
  < shrug  i do n't know the factors that go into it , but `` sweden as destination '' is [ also what the bbc is reporting ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34203366 ) :  danish police also closed a motorway between the two countries when some asylum seekers began walking north after being forced off a train . 
    they say their destination is sweden . 
  it could be that there are other people going directly from germany too . 
   cheers , although if the uk leaves the eu , i might be out of a job pretty quickly . 
  really ? 
  i 'd think that that would make for even more bureaucratic and legal complexity in interactions between the two . 
  is it at least reasonable to agree that the status quo is not doable for italy and greece ? 
  and that if that is the case , either they need to be subsidized , permitted to move refugees elsewhere ( and thus other people to accept them , and thus quotas ) , or to have an exemption to taking in refugees ? 
  maybe it does n't have to be quotas , but * one * of the above approaches would seem to me to be necessary . 
   schengen can be suspended ... you know , i 've been thinking about this ... i 'm going to be totally honest -- i really do n't think that dropping schengen is actually that useful here . 
  i realize how vulnerable it * feels * to know that `` once someone is illegally in , they wo n't be picked up '' , but i 'm very doubtful that this is anything other than an annoyance -- if someone * is * intending to live illegally somewhere , it 's a good bet that they 're going to avoid crossing any borders at the checkpoints if they really do want to cross a border . 
  there are things that could be done if you want to try to flag people who are running around within the schengen area , but i think that realistically , it 's going to rely on valid id being shown for things that one can not reasonably go without , not on paying some guy in a uniform to inspect cars where a border and a road intersect somewhere . 
  i suspect that edge-of-schengen borders are useful for catching smuggled , low-value , bulk goods , like people trying to sell apples without authorization or without paying tariff or something like that . 
  but for actually blocking the movement of a determined illegal immigrant ? 
  maybe for iceland , greenland , or the uk/ireland but outside of that ? 
  it might stop someone * commuting * across a border daily , but traveling across once ? 
   xenofobic bigots `` xenophobic bigots '' non-phonetic english is influenced by greek , among the many other languages it inherited from . 
  i agree that that seems like a plausible factor in her decision to go forward ( though , hey , i was n't there ) , but that does n't mean that he did n't meet the definition of rape under swedish law , which is quite expansive relative to most countries . 
  it just means that the victim has the ability to selectively choose whether to press charges , not that there was n't a violation of sweden 's definition . 
  walking down the list of images : * kid * kid * kid ( duplicate of the above ) * woman * man * woman holding children * man ( well , man with presumably-wife-and-children , but he 's really the center of the image ) * kid * kid * woman * kid being held by woman * man ( i think ... he 's sleeping and i 'm not absolutely-certain , but the clothing is masculine in style ) * woman holding baby * man * plastic bottles * three kids , man and woman ( not a focal center of any individual . . i wo n't classify this one ) * woman holding kid * woman total : | category | count | | - | - | | man | 4 | | woman | 6 | | kid | 6 | as others have pointed out , that 's not really a terribly-representative snapshot of the state of affairs . 
  i 'm also wondering about what will happen if those permanent residency grants become citizenships . 
  repeating [ my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k80ub/serbian_president_on_immigrants_theyre_becoming/cuvqqyr ) :  currently the eu is in a somewhat-unique status where member countries still control immigration ( and can grant permanent residency or citizenship ) , but the eu * does * automatically grant freedom of movement and freedom of work within all members once any member extends such a grant . 
    that means that basically any member nation has the power to whitelist any population in the world to live and work in any other member nation . 
    historically , europe took the individual-countries-are-sovereign approach to the problem -- countries have full control over their own immigration process * but * granting citizenship does n't let people then travel and work in other countries . 
    the us currently takes the federalist approach to this -- the federal government controls immigration , so it requires consensus among the public as a whole to permit more immigration . 
    but the way the eu is at least temporarily-structured , it means that anyone can make use of the weakest citizenship requirements in the eu to become a citizen of the eu . 
    that seems like something that eu members would reasonably object to , since it means that only one nation -- the one with the weakest immigration restrictions -- is happy with eu immigration rules , and all the other member nations are * unhappy * with them . 
  that seems like a real eu policy question of interest to this subreddit -- the federalist answer is `` just move forward to full federalization , and have member nations cede all control over immigration to the eu '' , and the state-sovereignty answer is `` do n't let individual eu states extend unbounded access to live and work in other member states to the world 's population '' . 
  however , certainly the currently half-transitioned state of things as regards eu immigration seems to be at least potentially open to serious abuse . 
  i think that a larger question is whether the permanent residencies will transform into grants of citizenship . 
  currently the eu is in a somewhat-unique status where member countries still control immigration ( and can grant permanent residency or citizenship ) , but the eu * does * automatically grant freedom of movement and freedom of work within all members once any member extends such a grant .

  how hard was it to realistically do that before ? 
  i mean , let 's say that you , personally , were faced with a desire to travel illegally in europe . 
  the borders are up , so now you 've a checkpoint on the road . 
  could you not simply walk and avoid them ? 
  mexico 's population does n't seem to have a terribly-difficult time with the us border , and there * is * border control on the us-mexico border . 
  it seems to me that disallowing schengen is more interesting in preventing , say , smuggling bulky goods than movement of people who are willing to move illegally . 
   i 'm saying that you ca n't stop it , which was suggested by the op . 
  he suggested that by not making concessions to the nsdap , all would have been fine and will be fine if we do the same here . 
  i agree that large-scale immigration has at least historically produced quite a strong backlash , and that i think that some politicians involved are perhaps underestimating the scope of any such backlash . 
  i do n't know if i 'd go as far as to say that it 's * inevitable * -- that 's a pretty strong statement . 
  thanks for the summary , though . 
  also , while i agree that in terms of social policies , the weimar republic was progressive and that some of the nsdap 's political appeal at that time was a reaction to that , i do n't really think that that this was the dominant factor -- i think that larger factors were : 1 . 
  the great depression , and germany 's 25 % -30 % unemployment 2 . 
  class shifts during the time stemming from technological changes -- bad news for the once-nobility and farmers , and good news for professionals . 
  3 . a german public that was looking at penalties from world war i that stretched long off into the distance if that 's the case , if someone wanted to avoid a backlash , more-important inputs than progressive social policy would be avoiding extremely-deep unemployment , limiting the rate of class shift , and placing limits on the amount of debt that may be placed on the public ( perhaps relevant to the greece situation ? 
  so you 're just saying that ( a ) immigration is inevitable and ( b ) that there 's then going to be an inevitable nationalist reactionary movement ? 
  because they do n't want to be registered . 
  i do n't think that germany * is * the popular target , and i do n't think that merkel 's comments were actually a significant factor , though she 's been getting a lot of blame on here . 
  it 's sweden , and to get to sweden , you go from germany to denmark . 
  sweden announced ( twenty-four months ago ! ), 
  that they are handing out not just refugee status , but [ permanent residency to any syrians who show up ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20130903/50030 ) . 
  this is almost the holy grail of immigration , one hop short of swedish/eu citizenship : even after the war is over , someone can continue to live and work in sweden , even if they would not meet un refugee requirements :  swedish migration authorities have ruled that all syrian asylum seekers who have come to sweden will be granted permanent residency in light of the worsening conflict in syria . 
    sweden is the first country in the eu to offer permanent residency to refugees from syria , news agency tt reported . 
    the decision covers all asylum seekers from syria who have been granted temporary residency in sweden for humanitarian protection . 
  they will now receive permanent residence permits , the swedish migration board ( migrationsverket ) announced on tuesday . 
    previously , around half of syrian asylum seekers had been granted permanent residency , with the remaining half receiving three-year residence permits . 
  i think that the point is , though , that the countries that do n't want a quota would also be willing to support italy , greece , bulgaria , and romania not accepting refugees if they were given a choice between `` those four do n't accept '' and `` accept mandatory quota ourselves '' . 
   they are generous , offer accommodation and aid , and refugees still go elsewhere . 
  i do n't think that 's an accurate description . 
  someone with refugee status does n't have freedom of movement within the eu -- they are n't romanian citizens .
