  he 's clearly not talking just about the fact that it is illegal inherently being objectionable , but that there are other costs to human trafficking , and he might be focusing on those as being the real negative . 
  that being said , yeah , it does sound pretty silly if one 's primary concern is in reducing that flow . 
   so germany will have a harder time attracting those skilled workers than us and uk .

   the ongoing brain drain and lack of financing is not the only reason russian science has suffered in the years since the fall of the soviet union . 
  the increase in pseudoscience has been so strong ... what 's even more absurd is that these charlatans cooperate with our state . 
  oh , i do n't know . 
  pseudoscience had [ a pretty impressive showing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism ) in the soviet union , too : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism  lysenkoism ( russian : \u041b\u044b\u0441\u0435\u0301\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) , or lysenko-michurinism was the centralized political control exercised over genetics and agriculture by trofim lysenko and his followers . 
  lysenko was the director of the soviet union 's lenin all-union academy of agricultural sciences . 
  lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964 . 
    lysenkoism was built on lamarckan heritability of acquired characteristics that lysenko named `` michurinism '' . 
  [ 1 ] lysenko 's theory departed from darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection and genetics and the concept of the `` gene '' . 
  [ 2 ] research and teaching of hormones , neurophysiology , cell theory , genetics and many other biological disciplines were banned . 
  [ 3 ]   lysenko 's theory was primarily based on dialectical materialism , an ideology that was supported by joseph stalin , and promised many advances in breeding and agriculture that never came about . 
  [ 4 ] proponents claimed to have discovered , among many other claims , that rye could transform into wheat and wheat into barley , proposed that natural cooperation was observed in nature as opposed to natural selection , weeds are transmutations of food grains . 
  [ 4 ] [ 2 ]   ultimately , lysenkoism failed to deliver on its promises in agricultural yields and even had unfortunate consequences such as the arresting , firing , or execution of 3,000 biologists due to attempts from lysenko to suppress opposition to his theory , the president of the agriculture academy was sent to prison and died there , and overall , scientific research in genetics was effectively destroyed until the death of stalin in 1953 . 
  [ 4 ] [ 2 ] due to lysenkoism , crop yields in the ussr actually declined as well . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   lysenkoism is used metaphorically to describe the manipulation or distortion of the scientific process as a way to reach a predetermined conclusion as dictated by an ideological bias , often related to social or political objectives .

  you 've got [ alternative medicine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_medicine ) ranging from your widely-established nonsense like [ chiropractic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chiropractic ) :  d.d. 
  palmer founded chiropractic in the 1890s , and his son b.j. 
  palmer helped to expand it in the early 20th century . 
  [ 23 ] it has two main groups : `` straights '' , now the minority , emphasize vitalism , innate intelligence and spinal adjustments , and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all disease ; `` mixers '' , the majority , are more open to mainstream views and conventional medical techniques , such as exercise , massage , and ice therapy . 
  [ 3 ] throughout its history , chiropractic has been controversial . 
  [ 8 ] [ 24 ] chiropractic 's foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine , and has been sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and innate intelligence [ 25 ] that are not based on solid science . 
  [ 9 ] to the less common [ new age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_age ) - y [ dolphin healing ] ( http://www.dolphinhealing.net/ ) :  it has been well documented that people have had miraculous healings being in the presence of live dolphins , both wild and captive . 
  there are many captive programs that bring autistic and developmentally challenged individuals to swim with dolphins and they come out happier , healthier and more verbal .

  2013 : [ sweden offers residency to all syrian refugees ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20130903/50030 )  swedish migration authorities have ruled that all syrian asylum seekers who have come to sweden will be granted permanent residency in light of the worsening conflict in syria . 
  [ snip ]  previously , around half of syrian asylum seekers had been granted permanent residency , with the remaining half receiving three-year residence permits . 
  i 'd come to sweden too . 
  they are n't handing out simply refugee status -- temporary asylum -- but permanent residency . 
  that 's rather-better than germany 's guarantees . 
   the catholic church has standards and is less open to interpetation on things like this . 
  good point . 
  they have great church theologians like thomas aquinas to clarify things . 
  surely such luminaries can produce a proper , authoritative catholic interpretation based upon new testament material :  i answer that , with regard to heretics two points must be observed : one , on their own side ; the other , on the side of the church . 
  on their own side there is the sin , whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the church by excommunication , but also to be severed from the world by death . 
  for it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith which quickens the soul , than to forge money , which supports temporal life . 
  wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority , much more reason is there for heretics , as soon as they are convicted of heresy , to be not only excommunicated but even put to death . 
    on the part of the church , however , there is mercy which looks to the conversion of the wanderer , wherefore she condemns not at once , but `` after the first and second admonition , '' as the apostle directs : after that , if he is yet stubborn , the church no longer hoping for his conversion , looks to the salvation of others , by excommunicating him and separating him from the church , and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death . 
  for jerome commenting on galatians 5:9 , `` a little leaven , '' says : `` cut off the decayed flesh , expel the mangy sheep from the fold , lest the whole house , the whole paste , the whole body , the whole flock , burn , perish , rot , die . 
  arius was but one spark in alexandria , but as that spark was not at once put out , the whole earth was laid waste by its flame . '',

  i 'm not sure that i want to invest the time to read fifty pages to understand what your comment is claiming is going to happen . 
  / u/fortytwowilldo referenced weimar republic -  hitler :  weimar republic was tolerant towards hitler and thought he would go away if they made concessions . 
  look where that went . 
  you then said `` it 's a cycle and you ca n't stop it '' , hence my assumption . 
  it might be faster if you 'd briefly summarize what it is that you feel can not be stopped . 
  well , by `` philosopher-king '' , you 're presumably referring to plato 's ideal in * the republic * , and those sorts of things are much in line with * the republic * . 
  as karl popper put it in [ * the open society and its enemies * ] ( https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jksadegh/a%20good%20atheist%20secularist%20skeptical%20book%20collection/popper%20-%20the%20open%20society%20and%20its%20enemies.pdf ) , criticizing * the republic * :  ... it is nothing less than the demand that all literary education be strangled by a close adherence to the example of sparta with its strict state control of all literary matters . 
  not only poetry but also music in the ordinary sense of the term are to be controlled by a rigid censorship , and both are to be devoted entirely to strengthening the stability of the state by making the young more conscious of class discipline , and thus more ready to serve class interests ... ( d ) there must be a censorship of all intellectual activities of the ruling class , and a continual propaganda aiming at moulding and unifying their minds . 
  all innovation in education , legislation , and religion must be prevented or suppressed . 
  some relevant snippets from [ * the republic * ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1497/1497-h/1497-h.htm ) :  now let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers , and look about and pitch their camp in a high place , which will be safe against enemies from without , and likewise against insurrections from within . 
  there let them sacrifice and set up their tents ; for soldiers they are to be and not shopkeepers , the watchdogs and guardians of the sheep ... of such a kind is the skill of the guardians , who are a small class in number , far smaller than the blacksmiths ; but in them is concentrated the wisdom of the state ... the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers ... and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or against one another ... whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our state -- let them be our guardians .

  [ some of us on the other side of the atlantic tried ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/spelling-reform.htm ) . 
  if you guys would just help sell the brits on the idea that american english is * clearly * the way to go , we could get things properly-moving again . 
  that 's true , and certainly the `` re-use and refit '' thing has a lot of historical precedent . 
  however , i 've seen some recent posts on here that were very critical of several things : * modernizing for air conditioning . 
  okay , the eu and the us have a bit of a difference over this -- the us has some hotter climates and people want their a/c . 
  but the middle east gets almost as hot as the hottest places in the us , and it 's * everywhere * in the country . 
  the problem is that historic architecture to deal with hot environments used different approaches . 
  instead of sealing off an area with zero airflow and air conditioning it , it tried to greatly-increase airflow . 
  instead of trying to avoid moisture buildup in a sealed area , [ it used central ponds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persian_gardens ) . 
  instead of wanting to minimize surface area to minimize heat loss from an air-conditioned location ( e.g. 
  low ceilings ) , it wanted to increase thermal inertia and airflow ( high ceilings ) . 
  a lot of these changes mean external glass . 
  * this is n't * essential * , but modern buildings often let a lot more light in than was historically the case ( sealed windows , lots of glass walls , you do n't need secure slit windows of the sort that you 'd have on castles ) . 
  unless you 're going to do pretty substantial rework of a castle , it might be hard to keep up with modern expectations for sunlight . 
  well , two points . 
  first , i suspect that a lot of authors that someone a hundred years ago would have known have passed into history : if you asked me to name an english writer of popular works from more than two hundred years ago , i could name shakespeare ... and not sure about anyone else -- i 'd just know philosophers and the like , not people writing for a mass audience . 
  i 'm certain that that is n't what a man from 1800 would say . 
  and secondly , let 's say that we do accept the `` poe is immortal culture , infrastructure is transient , and the two should be treated separately . '', 
  this would have been akin to a government or company headquarters , plus some defensive works . 
  does such a thing count in the former `` infrastructure '' category or in the latter `` culture '' category ? 
  would you feel that the world of the year 2250 should be constrained to retain the government and company headquarters buildings that are being built today ? 
  take , say , the german-built [ atlantic wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantic_wall ) . 
  those are defensive works by an occupier -- roughly comparable to what 's being discussed here . 
  is this something that france should preserve for hundreds of years hence ? 
  people have intentionally-destroyed many of those works . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the bulk of cases in which there was large-scale immigration did not wind up seeing organized genocide driven by the newcomers . 
  well , i doubt that it 's all that life-threatening to get into the uk -- you 're not trying to just get into the water and shipwreck yourself within range of a european navy , but get across and claim asylum there . 
  it does n't take much of a boat to make it across the english channel -- heck , for a first-rate swimmer , it 's swimmable . 
  * it 's english-speaking , which is probably more-widely-spoken around the med rim and in eritrea and somalia than german . 
  * germany is getting a lot more applicants , which means that there 's going to be a glut of people shooting for job openings that have similar language , education , and background constraints in germany , and gobs more on the way . 
  i would n't really want to be competing with all of those other people when i could make it into the uk . 
  the downside is that the uk asylum grant rate is pretty low -- it does n't compare favorably to , say , sweden .
