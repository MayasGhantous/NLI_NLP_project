   fine by me , but we 'll also provide refugees the basic fundamental rights of the eu - that includes freedom of movement . 
  the uk may not be very enthusiastic about that . 
   what 's the problem ? 
  you mean just deport anyone of a particular religion ? 
  even above and beyond the refugee convention , that 'd probably violate a lot of other agreements , both international , eu-level , and probably in most european countries . 
  hmm . 
  germany is a desirable place to live by global standards , and germany could do what the uk does , which is focus on skilled immigration ; that 'd seem to be more in germany 's interests if the concern is maintaining an economic base . 
  eritrea is the second-least-educated country on earth . 
   temporary residence that 's the 1951 refugee convention requirement , but some countries are apparently going beyond that . 
  https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5634497  all syrians who have arrived in sweden as refugees are to get permanent residence permits . 
  the swedish migration board has made the decision as a result of the crisis in syria , reports swedish radio news . 
  additionally , it 's likely that if people have been living for a while in the country in substantial numbers , there will be a significant legal and political push to grant permanent residence . 
  why would it be relevant ? 
  eu membership grants right to work to romanian citizens . 
  lack of schengen just means that they have to submit to border control when passing through those borders . 
   not being in schengen transforms us into a very useful refugee trap , since they wo n't be able to leave . 
  my understanding : refugees who have their asylum applications under review or have had it granted are not eu citizens , and do not have the right to legally work elsewhere in the eu . 
  if * germany * granted asylum , it would be bound to provide freedom of movement within germany and freedom to work under the 1951 refugee convention . 
  schengen is just a convenience : you do n't have to have border checks . 
  it is n't what blocks legal movement , and while it might block large-scale smuggling , it 's not possible to keep a single person from making it across the border , schengen or not . 
  ehh ... i do n't know . 
  if germany buys into the `` schengen is tied to quotas '' approach then the uk is presumably going to use this argument against the uk being obligated to accept any quota . 
  i 'd assume that germany is more-interested in getting the uk to accept a quota than in getting romania to do so . 
  that alone is n't a guarantee : so were your older leopard tanks until you sold them off to greece . 
  honestly , i think that people tend to greatly-exaggerate the failings of particular firearms .

  why not ? 
  i do n't think i 'd have knocked down the castle either ( that is , seems like there are probably other reasonable places to put the skyscraper ) , but come on -- it 's not as if old buildings have a permanent lease on life . 
  the people who built it built it for a functional purpose , which no longer exists . 
  if it was attracting huge amounts of really-valuable tourism or something , that 's one thing , but otherwise you 're just safeguarding a big , obsolete building . 
  it 's presumably already been examined from an archeological standpoint and mapped and whatnot . 
  i mean , if a building makes it to 235 years old , is it just a `` ca n't get rid of it '' from then on ? 
  we 've got a whole world full of buildings and historic artifacts from people in the past , after all . 
  i have seen exactly one statistic supporting an elevated level of rape commission , dealing with a small number of somalians in finland . 
  i think that extrapolating to the whole med region and to all of europe without additional data is a bit of a stretch . 
  in the us , immigrants have a lower rate of crime commission than do natives . 
  what / u/wwoodi meant by `` beat '' in his comment was `` come out ahead '' , as in a contest , not `` physically attacked '' .

  quoting the bible as a moral authority tends to kick open a hornet 's nest . 
   whoever sacrifices to any god other than the lord must be destroyed . 
  -- [ exodus 22:20 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+22%3a20&amp;version=niv )  if you hear it said about one of the towns the lord your god is giving you to live in that troublemakers have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray , saying , `` let us go and worship other gods '' ( gods you have not known ) , then you must inquire , probe and investigate it thoroughly . 
  and if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you , you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town . 
  you must destroy it completely , both its people and its livestock . 
  you are to gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the lord your god . 
  that town is to remain a ruin forever , never to be rebuilt -- [ deuteronomy 13:12 -16 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut+13%3a12-16&amp;version=niv )  if a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the lord gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the lord your god in violation of his covenant , and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods , bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky , and this has been brought to your attention , then you must investigate it thoroughly . 
  if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in israel , take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death . 
  on the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death , but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness . 
  the hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death , and then the hands of all the people . 
  you must purge the evil from among you .

  does n't seem to be particularly more-objectionable than the practice of jailing citizens . 
   budget android smartphones can be picked up for well under # 100 , at least in the us , it 's not the consumer-visible price of the phone itself that dominates , but the cost of the data service associated with it ; the phone 's price is subsidized and later recouped via inflated service fees . 
  this works well because consumers tend to pay an inordinate amount of attention to up-front costs and not enough to later fees . 
  basically , when you get a phone , you 're borrowing money to buy the phone and paying it back via service fees . 
  someone [ ran the numbers for an iphone 5s ] ( https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/apple-iphone-5s-iphone-5c-total-cost-ownership-211747620.html ) . 
  sure , the phone itself `` costs '' a subsidized $ 199 ... but the total amount you 'll pay , over the first two years of ownership , is between $ 2119 and $ 2839 . 
  this is probably the most-exciting thing that has ever happened from rt 's standpoint . 
  i think that most people in the world would like more stuff , and most people in the world are not off raping and murdering .

  people are n't that complicated . 
  the overwhelming majority of people just are interested in a bigger piece of the pie , everywhere . 
  that does n't mean that it 's in europe 's interest to let them in , but the bulk of the people coming from syria or eritrea or wherever are interested in getting more * stuff * , not in killing people off . 
   we need to draw a line in the sand , say fuck you turkey , fuck you america , fuck you saudi arabia i 'm mad as hell , assad is the only one who can keep the shit under wrap and we 're rolling over isis tomorrow i know that you tend to take a pro-russia position , but i 'd point out that stability in syria does not entail * assad * running things . 
  it 'd also be possible to have an anti-assad faction running syria .

  i doubt that it 's realistic to expect every policy to work without a hitch ; after all , they do n't work that way at the national level , right ? 
  and how many successes also show up that you 're not mentioning ? 
  the bad ones stand out in memory , but how much easier is it to operate in europe as a company or individual than it was fifty years ago ?

  in english , it 's not correct to use the masculine for a country . 
  either feminine or neutral . 
  fortunately , that 's one of only about ten places that gender-applying-to-things-without-genitals-in-grammar actually comes up in english , so not super-hard . 
  contrast this with some other languages ... my understanding is that german uses one each of the masculine , the feminine , and the neutral for knife , fork , and spoon ( though i do n't know which is which ) . 
  honestly , the gypsy situation is one of the more-interesting arguments i 've seen for wanting to be cautious about accepting a huge number of refugees . 
  if europe has n't managed to integrate and deal with gypsies successfully to date , and the thing is somewhat politically-divisive in europe ... is taking on an even larger challenge a good idea ?
