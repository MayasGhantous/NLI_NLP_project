  ensuring that people feel that they can trust the state authority and know who they can contact is also probably important . 
  in the us , by some of the worst violence and illegality in the past has stemmed from when an economy exists where police and the judicial system can not be involved , like the drug trade . 
  if people are avoiding police that 's bad news . 
  * i do n't think that there 's any reason to kill people , like sinking boats coming over . 
  some people angry at apparent eu ineffectiveness have brought that up . 
  you always have the ability to deport in a situation where you could kill , and that 's preferable in pretty much every way .

  iirc lucky13r is russian . 
  he 's also an / r/conspiracy user . 
    destabilize europe and get a stronger dollar , because the us is fucked if they do n't   please at least provide an alex jones link to back up your claims , because reality certainly does n't . 
  could be from kremlin-originating propaganda . 
  i recall seeing similar claims once before ... 
  if you remember the infamous propaganda [ russian occupant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65swzhabes ) video that was making the rounds a while back ... i glanced through their other material as well . 
  [ they had a video in a similar style about one year earlier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ppdyil-7y ) . 
  that collected a number of conspiracy theories ( e.g. 
  ukranian false-flag fighter shootdown of mh-17 as part of a joint ukranian-cia plot ) . 
  one of the claims was that the us is trying to pull russia into world war iii with nato to rescue the us economy and to try to destabilize europe 's economy as a competitor to its own . 
  at the time , it included topical material ( mh-17 ) . 
  since then , the refugee crisis happened . 
  could just be updating to include current material . 
  huh . 
  the linked page on reuters is still showing the `` migrant on the tracks '' image . 
  well , here 's an `` anti-immigration '' pan-eu approach to the crisis . 
  the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) does not specify how countries must make the determination of whether someone qualifies for refugee status on the '' * well-founded * fear of persecution '' bit -- just that the fear must be well-founded in theory , it could go as far as needing to demonstrate quite a bit of hard evidence that a particular individual is going to be persecuted and has no in-country recourse . 
  they * could * establish an board for the duration of the crisis that requires all eu members to opt into a particular process being used to `` thumbs-up '' a refugee . 
  that would probably result in a very high bar being set for having to prove that an individual is actually a refugee . 
  yes . 
  i think that it would impede us intelligence agencies quite a bit in their actual role to be involved in that . 
  now , that does n't mean that company x might not be off trying to steal company y 's secrets , within the purely-private world -- i think that securing communications and data is a good idea in general . 
  i just think that it 's very unlikely that the nsa would do so . 
  i also think that it 's unlikely that zero evidence would have ever turned up over this if it were happening . 
   us does n't want to solve the syrian problem , the flow of refugees is to destabilize europe and get a stronger dollar , because the us is fucked if they do n't < facepalm , 
  it might require a long-term presence . 
  the us was able to easily wipe out iraq 's military and take over . 
  however , creating a stable , self-sustaining government , even with massive aid and gobs of weapons and so forth being supplied was much harder . 
  it was n't another post-world-war-ii germany or japan . 
  if you need to have european soldiers propping up a regime there , you also have to be aware that there are costs and risks as well . 
  think of france and algeria : that was n't much fun , and i imagine that france does n't want to do that again . 
  it might be the best option , but i think that it 's something that should only be done after making an informed decision that europe ( and perhaps the us ) will be nation-building in the med . 
  that is , if we want to do this , it should be done aware of the potential costs . 
  what happens if russia 's dog in the race , assad , gets booted out -- will russia decide to fund efforts to destabilize the new government in syria ? 
  that could be an ongoing pain in the neck . 
  i 'm not enthusiastic about germany 's approach , either , but let 's be honest . 
  let 's say that germany says `` okay , we 're going to accept n refugees , but only from camps in syria '' . 
  even * if * n is large enough , you 've already had hundreds of thousands of people who have paid human smugglers to get to europe . 
  they 're not going to just disappear or go back to syria , and they 're going to massively-overload greece and italy . 
  i agree that there is a real problem with making statements that can be perceived as accepting unbounded illegal immigration , but the answer probably ca n't be `` dump everything on italy and greece '' -- you could have the eu deport , or you could have the eu do quotas or you could have the eu even put people in some isolated , offshore place , but saying `` it 's greece and italy 's problem '' just is n't going to work all that well either . 
  i 'm not sure that that 's a great metric . 
  / u/dclauzel has done the bulk of the legitimate post removals that i 've seen -- i 've commented on several posts that a title is editorialized ( i.e. 
  not the original title ) , and he 's invariably the mod that winds up also seeing the post and removing it and commenting with what what the poster needs to do differently . 
  the point is , a lot of that removal would need to happen regardless . 
  [ one such example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jqdi1/this_shows_which_european_countries_have_have_not/ ) from the last day . 
  for what it 's worth , that was a `` pro-immigration '' submission . 
  afaik , the nsa does not do industrial espionage . 
  i have not seen evidence to the contrary : the closest that came up during the snowden revelations was using industrial criteria as a filter . 
  i do n't think that the nsa would engage in industrial espionage ( perhaps outside of military technology against enemies ? ), 
  because doing so would result in countries that grant access that is useful to the nsa stopping doing so . 
   redditor for 12 hours, 
  but living in a `` fucked up '' country is n't grounds for claiming asylum . 
  that criteria is : https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention  owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable , or owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . 
  if the assad regime wins , those refugees might have a shot at not losing asylum status , since they could claim that they 'd be attacked as part of the political opposition upon returning . 
  but if assad loses , it seems like it 'd be a difficult claim . 
  it 's not schengen that 's relevant , as i understand it . 
  * the eu grants right-to-work to all citizens of eu member countries . 
  if you 're a citizen in an eu , the eu has agreed to let you work in any other eu member country . 
  you might have to go through border checks to get there , but it 's all aboveboard . 
  * the schengen area are countries that have no borders . 
  all this means is that there are border checks , and it 's not connected to whether you have the right to work on the other side . 
  it 's entirely possible to be in schengen but not have right-to-work . 
  for example , a citizen of poland has no right to work in switzerland , because switzerland is in the schengen area but not in the eu . 
  it 's also possible to have right-to-work but not be in schengen . 
  a citizen of poland has the right to work in the uk , which is in the eu but not in the schengen area . 
  he will have to undergo a border check when entering the uk , but once there , he can work as he pleases . 
  bizarre world we live in . 
  bizarre world we live in . 
  i do n't speak french , but [ does n't it have a lot of variations too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varieties_of_french ) , including grammatical variation ? 
  wikipedia says that [ african french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_french ) is one with grammatical deviations :  in the urban areas of francophone africa , another type of french has emerged : fran\u00e7ais populaire africain ( popular african french ) or fpa ... fpa has its own grammatical rules and lexicon . 
  can either mean `` this person annoys me very much '' or `` i 'm dying for him/her '' depending on the circumstances . 
  `` il ou elle commence \u00e0 me plaire '' signifies a feeling of exasperation ( whereupon it actually means `` he or she starts to appeal to me '' ) , and friendship can be expressed with `` c'est mon m\u00f4g\u00f4 s\u00fbr '' or `` c'est mon bram\u00f4go . 
   permanent asylum that 's not what `` asylum '' means : asylum is fundamentally tied to an issue of safety . 
  i think you mean `` given permanent residence '' . 
   sanctions are an act of war . 
  i think that you 're thinking of a blockade . 
  a blockade militarily prevents * other * countries from trading with a target country , and that * is * normally considered an act of war . 
  sanctions mean one country refusing to trade with another country , and is not an act of war -- every country with less-than-perfectly-free-trade status would , if it chose to move to the status quo from a perfectly-free-trade status , be said to be `` imposing sanctions '' , and obviously nobody treats this as an act of war . 
  it 's an anonymous quote saying that it 's being discussed . 
  no , i believe that the issue is rather between different european countries , none of whom consider them to be citizens . 
  http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/92883/reflexive-love-where-does-love-me-some-come-from  to give it a name , the construction is called the `` personal dative '' and is loosely attributed to african american vernacular english and some other southern white dialects . 
  it 's not correct , no , but yeah , it 's an error that will show up in some backcountry or poor areas . 
  [ this article is talking about it in appalachian english ] ( http://microsyntax.sites.yale.edu/personal-datives ) , which would be in west virginia and that region . 
  edit : if you were going to choose a `` redneck-ish english '' , i suppose that appalachian english would probably be a prime example . 
  that took me a moment to get ... 
  ireland ? 
  really ? 
  hmm . 
  i do n't know -- i see a lot of online discussion about this : http://www.minorityrights.org/1758/germany/romagypsiessinti.html  germany has an estimated 170,000 -- 300,000 roma/gypsies and sinti , the majority of whom do not have citizenship . 
  about one-third of romanis are sinti , who are settled in various parts of germany . 
  the majority are homeless and stateless . 
  http://www.unhcr.org/3eb7ba7d4.pdf  individuals may also find themselves stateless because of faulty administrative practices , the failure or refusal of a state to ensure the registration of births , or because of conflicts in the nationality laws of different countries , particularly when one adheres to the principle of jus sanguinis ( citizenship on the basis of descent ) and the other adheres to the principle of jus soli ( citizenship on the basis of the place of birth ) . 
  [ snip ]  the roma or gypsies of central and eastern europe have often been described as ` stateless ' or ` border ' people .
