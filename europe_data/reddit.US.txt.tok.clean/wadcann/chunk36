  it might take longer for estonia greece had its government over-borrow and then falsify data to support further borrowing . 
  why would this need apply to estonia ? 
   so , in britain , almost everyone views the euro as a total failure . 
  no polling data here subsequent to 2012 , but it does look like [ there 's been a general trend towards the uk public being increasingly opposed to the euro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_and_the_euro#public_opinion ) . 
  apparently [ methamphetamine use is more common in the uk than in the us ] ( http://theconversation.com/explainer-methamphetamine-use-and-addiction-in-australia-13280 ) . 
  it seems pretty compatible with him planning to play hardball with the creditors , believing that he could win , and not coming out on top . 
  i guess i can see where you 're coming from , but he could n't possibly credibly renegotiate the debt if his campaign promise consisted of saying `` i will bluff '' .

  also , no european government is likely to be interested in encouraging having european countries have fragments of their country rip away without buy-in from the parent country ; after all , they might run into the same thing themselves , or someone else might , and that 's a good way to wind up with war in europe . 
  i doubt it . 
  it shows a steady decline across four censuses . 
  also , [ wikipedia : milan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milan ) :  in addition , the city 's decades-long population decline seems to have come to an end in recent years , with signs of recovery as it grew by seven percent since the last census . 
  and  however , in the 1990s , milan was badly affected by tangentopoli , a large political scandal in which many local and national politicians and businessmen were tried for alleged corruption . 
  the city was also affected by a severe financial crisis and a steady decline in textiles , automobile and steel production , that led to a deep reorganization of its economy . 
  [ 1 ] ... decline in milan 's manufacturing production it might just be the same post-industrial changes that cities like detroit have seen -- steel and vehicle and other manufacturing go overseas ? 
   because she didnt give in randomly just because syriza lied to their own people saying that she would ? ... tsipras has to go to jail for his lies . 
  you mean on renegotiation of debt ? 
  it did n't work out well , but what laws did it break ? 
  < shrugs  well , if out of some half-a-million subscribers , nobody is both : * capable of explaining why a statement is wrong . 
  * willing to explain why it is wrong . 
  then i have to agree that there 's probably going to wind up with an apocalyptic line of discussion being dominant . 
  i take some pro- , some anti- positions . 
  seven hours ago , i [ read a post claiming that since native americans were taken over by europeans , europeans would be taken over by africans , and explained why i did n't agree with that line of reasoning ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jonw6/austria_and_germany_to_let_refugees_in_from/cura0wr?context=1 ) . 
  i do n't think that it was all that difficult or lengthy to point out . 
  i certainly do n't think that it 's unreasonable to expect someone on a discussion forum to do that . 
  i definitely would not support a `` ban everyone who politically-disagrees with me because i do n't want to see their discussion '' position . 
  so just to be clear -- you 're not saying that the us is flying strategic bombers inbound to russia with transponders off , which is what / u/hlpe was talking about , but just that it has spy planes flying near airspace and has conducted naval exercises ( and , i should note , nato 's have been [ vastly smaller than russia 's ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russias-military-exercises-are-way-bigger-than-natos-2015-2 ) ) ? 
  the banking crisis does n't interact with as many eu policies and issues . 
  with the immigration crisis , you 've got : * schengen member responsibilities vs eu member responsibilities . 
  * how to deal with schengen-external borders . 
  * nationalism * uk in-or-out * east-vs-west social concerns , including russification * the europe-africa relationship * the makeup of europe itself * east-west migration, 
   that 's why we need scream loudly and try to rationalize the xenophobia by apocalyptic scenarios i agree that some comments are over-the-top . 
  it bothers me that people who think that they * are * over the top do n't respond and explain their viewpoint on why they think that they 're over the top . 
   to avoid economic stagnation in the long term , europe needs migrants . 
  would n't accepting skilled migrants be more in europe 's interests if this is the motivating factor , though ? 
  the submitted title is not actually the article title -- it does n't claim to specify what is `` fair '' , but simply that people are seeking a fair distribution . 
  i do n't believe that 's correct . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  bigger gdp than some , though . 
   guards from ukrainian border were sent there pulling guards off a border with a country that is actually being invaded does kinda drive home the point . 
  it was amended in 1967 to to apply outside of that .

  we [ used to do that a lot during the most-hostile points in the first cold war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_chrome_dome ) . 
   this is a freaking shame and every western country should end all ties to those countries for their counties atrocities in the middle east . 
  let 's turn this around . 
  why not take into account geopolitical issues in choosing to `` end all ties '' ? 
  oil is what matters to the world in that region . 
  are you going to make those governments hostile ? 
  attack them and try to establish new governments in their place that are more-compliant ? 
  let 's say that all of those countries could n't sell oil to europe any more . 
  that would be great for russia , but it 's not clear that that would be so good for the eu . 
  finally , while i admit a lack of familiarity , is it actually * state-backed * , or simply people within those countries doing so ? 
  crediting or blaming the us government for what , say , bill gates does , even if his wealth depends on the us , is n't quite the same thing as crediting or blaming the us government for what the us air force is off doing . 
  well , eritrea has people [ fleeing the draft ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/03/national-service-eritrea ) , and while i think that there 's an argument that this does n't qualify for refugee status , it 's also certainly possible to argue the other way . 
  somalia has people fleeing [ very long-running civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somali_civil_war ) . 
  re : the * new york times * ... i do n't hold you responsible for the content of what * bild * or * spiegel * editors think . 
   exclusive : under the plans , legal responsibility for deporting people deemed to be economic migrants would pass from the member states to the european union grr ... this is interesting , but short on specifics . 
  does the eu * determine * whether someone is to be an economic migrant , or simply take responsibility for the deportation once a member nation makes that determination ? 
  they 'd be out whatever the human smugglers charged them , and they could be fingerprinted . 
   they authorized the sale of javelin anti-tank missiles , donated two transport aircraft , and right now , a pair of f-22s is on a goodwill tour in estonia - not to mention rotating ground troops . 
  first , i should point out , though , that relative to us capabilities , this is not all that big a deal . 
  those were two light transports , not c-5 galaxies or something like that . 
  and a goodwill tour is n't much of a real commitment . 
  second , i 'm not sure that the [ recent nato base ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnlwstghyy ) stuff is all american , before we start slamming europe . 
  wikipedia says that the 2014 establishment of nato patrols from [ \u00c4mari air base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%84mari_air_base ) started with danish planes , not us planes . 
  turkey * could * put all refugees into unsecured camps in eastern thrace near the border . 
  i think that you 're underestimating turkey 's options . 
  if millions are trafficked and the average price is 1000 euros , it 's not a sensationalist title . 
  it does n't really seem germane -- the question is whether they should be banned-for-life from this foundation for having said it at one point .

   the flier for the ramadan events promises well-respected religious scholars but among the invited there figures a preacher who has described the charlie hebdo massacre in paris as `` the sequel to the comedy film of 9/11 '' and another cleric who says , `` jews and their helpers must be destroyed . '' are the people actually advocating for this in this context , or did they simply once say this ? 
  look , i 'm not saying that your plan is impossible . 
  i 'm saying that if it can be executed , it also seems viable to do the same thing but without killing the passengers . 
  and if that 's the case , the only reason to kill the passengers would be if you really think that nothing short of death would dissuade them -- and that seems unlikely to me . 
  well , for your plan to work , you 'd have to be able to identify boats that contain illegal immigrants , and be able to intercept them , right ? 
  if you can do * that * , how is it less-viable to simply withdraw from the treaties about refugee handling and simply stop the boats , pick up the people from them , and drop them off back in north africa at a likely location ? 
  the ottoman empire was powerful and long-running and multicultural . 
  the european conquest of the americas would not have happened ( or at least in nothing like the form it did ) without disease . 
  there was a thirty-thousand-year-split between the americas and the rest of the world for new diseases to show up elsewhere . 
  when europeans came over , they introduced many diseases all at once ... and received few serious ones in return from the less-populated americas . 
  as far as i know , syphillis was the only serious one . 
  that caused the death of , if i recall correctly , something north of 95 % of the native population . 
  with hugely-disrupted societies , it was n't that hard for a more-technologically-advanced competitor to move in . 
  the closest equivalent to this in europe would have been the plagues , where east asian disease made it over due to trade routes . 
  but that was n't all at once , and there was no ongoing invasion , and east asia and europe never had a long-enough separation to build up a huge difference in disease resistance . 
  there may be problems in europe from a lot of immigration , but the critical factors -- technological capability and disease -- that caused the collapse of the americas in the face of europe should not be present here .

  i 'm interested in all four of the issues of federalization , greece , russia , and immigration . 
  i stand by my `` you 're responsible for submitting interesting issues outside these topics '' position . 
  looking at [ new articles ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/new/ ) , of the first 25 items : * fourteen are related to the migration crisis * three are related to ukraine/second cold war * one is related to federalization ( though this is hard to judge ) * one is a meta `` just adding content that is n't part of the above '' thread . 
  * one is related to ttip/trade ( one of the other top topics that generated a lot of discussion ) that spans the last nine hours on the subreddit -- there have n't been people digging up new interesting material of general interest and related to europe . 
  nobody , out of some half-a-million subscribers , has dug up a list of changing trends of popular music in europe , or of newly-invented food products in europe over the past fifty years , or a map showing a poll indicating which european countries have people that prefer men to wear cologne . 
  so it comes down to , to me , saying `` i want people to dig up new and generally-interesting material '' without doing it oneself . 
  if every subscriber on the sub put up one new interesting item every year -- something that i consider easily doable -- then just under 95 % of the content would be something new and interesting beyond the existing material .
