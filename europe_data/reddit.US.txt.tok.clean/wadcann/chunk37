  for european federalists , i 'd note that currently most us welfare is funded via the federal government rather than the state government :  not including social security and medicare , congress allocated almost $ 717 billion in federal funds in 2010 plus $ 210 billion was allocated in state funds ( $ 927 billion total ) for means tested welfare programs in the united states medicare is federal and is [ $ 452b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medicare_%28united_states%29 ) and [ social security ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_security_%28united_states%29 ) is also federal and is $ 1.3 t. 
   an anglophobic pejorative phrase how come you get one of those and we do n't have one ? 
  well ... how many of those are currently not in the country and instead are in europe ? 
  might be possible to take advantage of the timing . 
   steffen angenendt from the german institute for international and security affairs ( swp ) , which has been advising the government as well as companies for over 50 years , has warned seeing the integration of migrants through the lens of a `` cost-benefit analysis . '', 
  [ snip ]  `` we had a rather fierce debate among various economists on this recently . 
  and they all came up with different numbers - for migrants alone , '' he says , adding that it is even harder to predict the numbers for refugees . 
  well , yes ... you 're having to make some simplifying assumptions . 
  that 's the norm when predicting things . 
  but that 's not normally treated as a rationale to simply throw out what information you do have in making predictions : you work on improving those models where possible . 
  we 've taken all sorts of complex , chaotic systems and gone from near-inability to predict what will happen to far better , including things like nuclear explosions to weather . 
  any context as to cause ? 
   the reason they 're going on to vessels is because they know they will be saved . 
  yes , obviously ... but international treaties requiring rescue at sea do n't make provision for having people trying to infer intent . 
  and i think that 's reasonable -- it should n't be up to some random captain as to what the intent of someone is . 
  the immediate situation should be resolved and people brought back to safety . 
  if at * that * point , the country grants residence or is unable to deport when it is in its interests to do so or has other bad incentives set up , that seems like a problem of policy on land , not at sea , and i think that it would make more sense to fix that root problem than to try to patch it over by mucking around with the responsibility to rescue . 
  besides -- do you honestly want to * kill * illegal immigrants just for trying to break immigration law ? 
  or do you just want the illegal immigration to stop ? 
  because i would claim that it is quite possible to stop further illegal immigration without killing people , and it seems far-preferable to do this . 
  i 'd certainly think that it makes more sense to revisit treaties on how asylum applicants are handled long before revisiting laws of the sea . 
   if you have free immigration in the way in which we had it before 1914 , everybody benefited . 
  the people who were here benefited , the people who came benefited . 
  i agree with the rough overall point , that it 's the existence of a welfare state that really introduces an economic reason to discourage immigration . 
  however , to be fair , the existence of extreme domestic poverty also has negative externalities even in the absence of welfare -- after all , any sensible person would mug people or burglarize if the alternative is starvation -- and some of the point of welfare is to mitigate that . 
  north korea 's pretty close .

   of the data that 's diverted , only a few percent is actually kept by the military ( the u.s. says less than 5 percent ) , and what remains is returned to scientists within the following days , with the intention of eventually declassifying all of it . 
  got ta admit , i laughed . 
   the jones act guarantees the continued existence of an american ship building industry surely such a blanket guarantee is not needed for that ? 
  and that justification would be used by * any * industry asking for subsidies . 
   and jobs for american sailors i do n't see why buying icebreakers domestically is required for american sailors to have jobs : even if we wanted to subsidize sailing , it 's not clear why we also need to subsidize ship-building . 
  for that matter , it 's not clear to me why i benefit from artificially pushing americans into sailing rather than any other form of work . 
  finally , obviously that would n't be directly-applicable to at least these ships , since these would be coast guard anyway , and would be staffed by us uniformed servicemen . 
   when a country like china talks about building a navy they do n't just mean building the ships . 
  they mean building up the experience base so that those ships can be crewed and maintained . 
  first , china already has a merchant marine fleet , which is what this would be subsidizing . 
   the u.s. with a more robust maritime history than china 's ( we are descendants of the british after all ) has long understood this and we 've placed great emphasis on supporting our shipping industry . 
  i 'm dubious that it 's the portion of british heritage driving decisions about subsidizing ship-building/shipping . 
  and for that matter , the uk did n't grow into a naval power because it weakened other industries to try to artificially-strengthen its ship-building industry . 
  i remember that one of the causes of the war of 1812 was the uk press-ganging people ( some of whom had fled the uk ) into british naval service . 
  that does n't quite sound like extreme desperation to subsidize british-only seamen . 
   the idea being that should america find itself at war we have a ready pool of industrial talent to call on as well as a large pool of experienced sailors which can be enlisted in the navy . 
  the problem is that the `` national security '' justification can be applied to nearly every industry to some degree , and it 's not clear to me that the us would n't have a functioning ship-building industry were it not for mandating subsidies for ship builders for intra-country shipping . 
  it 's certainly not clear to me that we need to ensure a straight 100 % come from the us . 
  and there are costs to this : every time we use us resources that would be better-off doing something else ( and we know this , from the above more-than-triple costs ) we sacrifice whatever else they 'd be doing . 
  i 'm pretty comfortable giving up icebreaker expertise to somewhere else ( well , maybe not finland , which i suppose is a likely risk for russian involvement ) , but outside of the us ? 
  sure . 
  heck , if we 've only had two icebreakers operating , then we obviously did n't feel any need to have a domestic icebreaker industry thus far .

  assuming , for the sake of discussion , that europe goes with quotas , i 'd agree that tradability is preferable to non-tradability .

  darpa decided to [ create a futures market for political change in the middle east a while back ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/policy_analysis_market ) . 
  sounds nice but there are certain risks associated with people making a lot of money off whether-or-not someone gets assassinated or not ... and some political objection to same as well . 
  i 'd come down on the side of any quotas being tradable , though . 
  anyway , any quota system also has to deal with running into treaty agreements . 
  still not clear to me how someone who is granted asylum ( assuming they are granted asylum and there is n't simply a separation made between asylum * applications * and asylum * grantees * ) could be required to go anywhere other than the country in which they made the application without treaty violation , though . 
  not going to win this one . 
  this is as bad as the `` dead kid '' , just on the anti-immigration side . 
  it 's an emotional appeal . 
  basically , what i see can increasingly be categorized into two camps of articles : * black young african men either acting physically-threatening or raping europeans : the `` anti-immigration emotional appeal '' . 
  * shots showing light-skinned children and young , attractive women ; these normally look hopeful or sad : the `` pro-immigration emotional appeal '' . 
  both of these are just appeals to emotion . 
  they are n't really grounds on which it 'd be possible to have a very meaningful discussion about actual , practical issues and ways to address them . 
  how about more graphs and statistics or examinations of how similar issues were addressed in the past ? 
  i do n't . 
  mods wind up spending their time dealing with people , and i like / u/savannajeff 's trade and economy posts . 
  http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/paperclip_maximizer  some goals apparently serve as a proxy or measure of human welfare , so that maximizing towards these goals seems to also lead to benefit for humanity . 
  yet even these would produce similar outcomes unless the full complement of human values is the goal . 
  for example , an agi whose terminal value is to increase the number of smiles , as a proxy for human happiness , could work towards that goal by reconfiguring all human faces to produce smiles , or tiling the solar system with smiley faces ( yudkowsky 2008 ) . 
  if you 've structured the market such that there are externalities , yes . 
  the problem with these answers is that they are `` litmus test '' answers , and i find it increasingly hard to give a straight `` yes '' or `` no '' to them . 
  let 's take the first one as an example . 
   if economic globalisation is inevitable , it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations .
