  well , i think that economic globalization is very much a good idea . 
  i can imagine a society that avoided it , but i do n't have an issue with it happening . 
  i do n't see there being any particular conflict between a transnational corporation doing well and humanity doing well . 
  now , i 'd guess that i 'd be economically-right-of-center on that , because i think that few , including myself , would say `` the economy * should n't * serve humanity '' . 
  if that 's the case , the * real * question is whether they see a conflict between a transnational corporation doing well and humanity doing well -- that is , should a corporation be * stopped * from doing well . 
  on the other hand , i could imagine a case where monopoly power became a problem , and that would be worth addressing , so i would n't say that a conflict is * impossible * . 
  i do think that , compared to the center of society , i see less conflict . 
  but it 's difficult to capture the above by just indicating how strongly i agree with the statement . 
  < dubious  i think that the us would tend to de-emphasize the role of the state relative to europe . 
  the blue square would have the state having a larger role . 
  what , on anti-illegal-immigration measures ? 
  [ i 'd say that they 're off on projects ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/13/minuteman-project-vows-return-to-border-as-immigration-influx-continues/ ) . 
  that 's not comparable , though -- they 're paying off human smugglers , and currently boats used are at risk of confiscation , and a smuggler is going to have to factor that into their cost ; in addition , the boats are smaller and less-efficient for bulk shipping . 
  i 'm talking about what would be involved in a massive * legitimate * transfer of humans from africa to europe , using liners and whatnot . 
  in , say , the world war ii era , it was definitely cheaper to use ships -- that 's what the us used to shovel massive numbers of soldiers across the ocean . 
  but that might no longer be the case today . 
  ever heard of a [ blunderbuss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blunderbuss ) ? 
  they could load them with scrap metal , nails , whatever . 
  if they 're not , then hopefully they 're making sensible investment decisions and are moving resources where those resources will do the most good anyway . 
   oh some of them will be left poor destitute by the standards they live now but the sheer amount of wealth they command means that at least some portion of them will remain wealthy for the long forseeable future . 
  a fool and their money is soon parted . 
  concentrate a lot of money in one place , and you 've many people with an incentive to go after it . 
  i 'm watching with some amusement the people trying to sell sub-par investments to the norwegian public for the norwegian sovereign wealth fund -- at $ 1.15 t , quite a sum of cash -- on [ activist investor grounds ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/norwegian-fund-giant-puts-premium-on-ethical-investing-1.3194881 ) . 
  it 's like [ calpers all over again ] ( http://www.city-journal.org/2013/23_1_calpers.html ) . 
  i 'm sure that there are a lot of people going after extracting inherited wealth from wealthy middle eastern families . 
  serbians probably are n't looking at a lot of people dead-set on settling in serbia , yes ? 
  it 's just a matter of people transiting across serbia . 
  maybe if the eu asked serbia to accept a quota for membership , things might change , but i 'd think that serbia is unlikely to be terribly-impacted by this . 
  well ... there was a lot of unhappiness about a flood of catholicism coming in at the time too . 
  the us used to be more-protestant and change in religious makeup , even between two relatively-similar religions , was n't painless . 
   you seem to be under the impression that the bulk of illegal migrants to the us are families with children for some reason they 're not ; they 're men coming to work and send money home . 
  [ that 's not correct ] ( http://immigration.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceid=000845 ) . 
  there 's a male bias , but it 's not overwhelming : of the 11.4 m illegal immigrants in the us in 2012 , about 47 % were female and 53 % male . 
  secondly , in an autobiography i read about the young iraqi guy coming to the uk , his goal was to come over and then make money to bring his family over ( he was n't able to make money as quickly as he thought , and wound up stealing some money from a finance company and getting in trouble for it , but ultimately did manage to bring his family over ) . 
  i 'd assume that this is a sensible approach , if the cost of moving people on a person-by-person basis is substantial and a young man can be expected to be the most-likely to be able to earn wages and make some degree of return on that investment . 
  it would n't make sense to move over retirees or children , and my guess is that ( particularly if coming from a conservative culture ) , males are expected to operate with more independence . 
   most muslims consider their religion to come before their nationality . 
  if you are a real , true believer in most religions , it would pretty much have to do so . 
  i kind of suspect that a lot of `` true believers '' are n't , though . 
  if germany wants to do this : * why an aircraft rather than a ship ? 
  is it cheaper to fly ? 
  ( it might be ... i always vaguely thought that aircraft were used to save time , but maybe the costs of feeding people on a ship actually do make it more-affordable to fly . ), 
  * why fly people to germany , rather then setting up processing centers to grant asylum overseas , at airports there or in embassies or whatnot ? 
  it does n't seem like physically flying lots of people back-and-forth just to evaluate someone 's case buys much . 
   as for the ~ 11m illegal immigrants , most of them eventually leave and are replaced . 
  the estimated net numbers have been decreasing , but there are two factors that apply to the us but not to europe here : * first , the us uses [ * jus soli * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) ; europe [ * jus sanguinis * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ) . 
  in the us , illegal migrants age out and die and their children become ( legal ) citizens ; there is no possibility of long-term statelessness . 
  you can not have multi-generation illegality in the us ; with a life expectancy of 79 years , the total count of illegal immigrants must fall even if nobody leaves . 
  contrast this with europe , where it quite possible and does happen that large chunks of people simply become stateless , [ like gypsies ] ( http://www.errc.org/article/faces-of-romani-statelessness-in-greece/1076 ) , and the count does not drop . 
  * second , even if someone did want to leave and return somewhere with worse pay , less opportunities for their children , more disease , and so forth , i suspect that it 's rather easier and cheaper to hop borders overland from the us to central america than it is to cross the mediterranean from europe . 
  i 'm not sure that the author has captured all the incentives fully ( though interesting to see a fee article ) . 
  international aircraft flights have well-controlled movement of people -- they 're going to funnel people through immigration control . 
  looking at this , it looks like [ the policy for dealing with people applying for asylum in at least the us is different based on whether the application is past border control ] ( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/asylum-or-refugee-status-how-32299.html ) :  ** applying at u.s. 
  borders and entry points ** . 
  if you 're at the u.s. border or airport and have a valid visa or entry document , it 's best to use that to enter , without raising the issue of your need for asylum . 
  if , however , the u.s. officials do n't want to let you in , you can explain that you fear returning to your home country and ask to apply for asylum . 
    at that point , things will move very quickly . 
  you may be put into a detention facility while you wait to be sent to a `` credible fear '' hearing with a uscis asylum officer , which usually happens within a day or two . 
  the officer does not have the power to approve your request for asylum -- only to decide whether you truly seem to be afraid of persecution and , therefore , deserve to have a judge hear your case . 
  however , the officer has the power to deny people 's requests and send them home without further appeals . 
    if you convince the asylum officer that you have a credible fear of persecution , you 'll get no more than seven days to prepare to see an immigration judge -- which can make it very hard to find an attorney and properly prepare your case . 
    ** applying in the u.s. ** if you successfully make it past a border or entry point and into the united states , you 'll have more time to apply for asylum . 
  in fact , you can take up to a year after entering the united states to start the process . 
  ( if that deadline has passed , talk to an attorney -- exceptions are possible , and the uscis may show leniency when it comes to the deadline . ), 
   [ snip ]  if the asylum office denies your case , it will refer you to immigration court . 
  there , you can present your case again , to an immigration judge -- and add more documents and evidence , if needed . 
  your own attorney will interview you in front of the judge , after which an attorney for the u.s. government will question you . 
  the judge can ask more questions , as well . 
  such hearings can go on for hours and still not finish . 
  it 's common for them to be rescheduled to continue on another day . 
    if the judge denies your claim for asylum , you can appeal it -- first to the board of immigration appeals ( bia ) , then to a federal circuit court , then on up to the u.s. supreme court . 
  under current rules , a migrant apparently gains substantial benefits by illegally entering the country -- hard to do via aircraft -- and * then * filing for asylum . 
  it is disadvantageous to him to apply at border control ( or an embassy , for that matter ) . 
  i 'm not sure whether the same is true of german law , but if so , it 's greatly in his interests to enter the country illegally , and that probably means via land . 
  it 's just a custom image that someone uploaded and put on their card . 
  come on , this is a non-story ; it 's like someone having a custom t-shirt done or having a desktop background set on their computer . 
   my political ideology is that the state should maximize citizens ' happiness . 
  swathe them in a cocoon and stimulate brain pleasure centers . 
  not many . 
  war in africa is n't going to mean gobs of people streaming over here . 
  people have tried the `` refugee route '' before -- there 's been no incidence where both people had easy access to the us * and * there was a war in an area from which people could easily reach the us , so has n't come up . 
  though i bet that the moment that there 's any war in the americas , the us will be the overwhelmingly-popular target . 
  you can just boat up the coast , too -- do n't need to do anything sketchy like traveling through another country . 
  the us [ * has * granted asylum to cubans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy ) due to the castro situation ( though that was a bit different -- there it was anti-castro types , where the us stopped granting asylum unless people actually made it to us soil ) . 
  afaik , that is effectively an automatic permanent residence . 
  there have also been overseas incidents ( like vietnam ) that resulted in asylum grants , but there the us was n't really faced with gobs of people with the ability to flood over the ocean . 
  actually , i do n't think much of this as a story -- it 's a `` let 's go for the gut '' emotional appeal . 
  i complained about the video images lacking context of some pissed-off guy yelling `` allahu akbar ! '', 
  on the anti-immigration side , and i do n't like these much on the pro-immigration side either . 
  neither actually inform the reader in any meaningful way . 
   this is an important story i do n't agree . 
  a story saying `` n deaths occur per week '' would be important material . 
  this is emotional fluff ; it just just incidentally happens to be on the pro-immigration side . 
  some countries have a fairly-high total fertility rate . 
  syria is n't insanely-high ( 2.68 ) , albeit higher than europe , but eritrea is 4.14 . 
  if a woman is 9 months in labor , that 's an average 37 months in labor . 
  eritrea has a life expectancy of 68 years for females . 
  i do n't know what your statistic counts as a `` woman '' rather than a girl , but suppose we start at 18 ( which might be too-conservative , but it 's not far-off ) . 
  that 's a bit over 6 % of the average lifespan of a grown eritrean woman that 's spent pregnant , on average . 
  so 1 in 10 -- which you 'd expect to generate 10 % , given an even distribution of women over all ages -- is n't all that far off .
