  a few more relevant factors : in 1990 , eritrea 's life expectancy was [ only 36 years ] ( http://www.madote.com/2011/05/eritreas-life-expectancy-leads-sub.html ) . 
  so when you assume that some women who could have been older never survived to do so and that the population is growing , it 's a pretty good bet that the population is tilted towards the young . 
  that means that you do n't get an even distribution between women in their childbearing years and women in menopause , but a distribution loaded towards women in their childbearing years . 
  at least for eritrea , that can probably more-or-less explain those numbers right there , rather than assuming that pregnant woman are unusually-likely to immigrate to europe . 
  i understand that [ unlike the united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) , european countries do not [ automatically grant citizenship to anyone born on their soil , even if their parents are present illegally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ) , which means that there 's no particular incentive to making it to europe before giving birth in the way that there theoretically could be to the us . 
  also , i 'm a little dubious -- no data , just going from the gut -- that a woman would choose to become pregnant to try to extend refugee status for herself , at least before making the trip or knowing whether refugee status has been granted . 
  i 'd think that facts and numbers would be more-interesting than those photos . 
  i 'll give my view , though it may not be representative of the views in the country as a whole . 
  * relative to military/economic role in the world and other major historic powers , comparatively-hands-off ( though some of this might just be due to technological change and controlling land being less-important ) ; the us is probably one of the few nations to intentionally give up land on the net during its time of peak power . 
  * a relatively inward-looking public . 
  * unusually religious , though really decreasing in recent years ; i think that the gap between the us and the rest of the industrialized world has been narrowing . 
  * ideologically-capitalist/market-oriented . 
  i generally * agree * with those positions ( and would be fiscally-right-of-center in the us ) , but there are cases where i do n't think that there 's necessarily a clear , pragmatic argument for or against private ownership ( e.g. 
  utilities with a natural monopoly , space exploration ) , and i think that there 's an out-of-proportion to the actual data push to privatize . 
  * cultural influence at a global level , but i personally think that this is very much a short-term phenomenon . 
  europe and the us were the wealthier places in the world when mass media and telecommunications and other things that brought the world together showed up , and europe picked that same time to gut itself with world wars ; as a result , the us wound up being the place that a lot of global * stuff * got developed just as the world was coming together . 
  in fact , a lot of the stuff that spread around the world was n't particularly-historically-american . 
  i do n't know how much of this was due to other social factors over the past hundred years ( the final collapse of aristocracy , changes in costs , broader global economic mobility ) but i think that one big us global social influence that * did * show up was a real disregard for formality in clothing and social manners , and to this day , i think that the us is relatively-informal . 
  one observation i 've repeatedly heard with some people i work with who have come from some other other countries is that the us has a `` flat '' social institutions -- e.g. 
  people from india say that indian culture is much more hierarchical . 
  i also see similar points is `` how to avoid making social errors in the us '' guides . 
  * backed out of two overseas or offensive wars ( 1812 , vietnam ) , but outside of maybe the south , has n't * lost * a war in terms of being conquered . 
  as with pre-world-war-ii japan , i think that this had somewhat of an impact on the culture and glamor of war . 
  * possibly because of a number of global successes , culturally suffers from something of a [ `` not-invented-here '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/not_invented_here ) symptom . 
  i know some people who have some real ideological resistance to use of metric ( yes , odd as it sounds ) . 
  as part of the european project , a lot of european nations and publics learned to swallow their pride and work together with historical rivals . 
  asia had countries choose to westernize . 
  turkey under attaturk radically reformed . 
  the us has n't had to really say `` yeah , we 're doing things the wrong way '' and needed to reform . 
  while the us has certainly been a cultural backwater before , i think that letting practicality be overwhelmed by pride has been a weakness . 
  * monolingual . 
  one of the most-striking characteristics i see when i talk to people from abroad ( who are , admittedly probably rather urbane examples of their countries ) is how common multilingualism is . 
  that * exists * in the us mostly in the terms of spanish being spoken in the southwest , but the country as a whole does n't look like india or europe , where it 's very common for people to speak multiple languages . 
  * car-centric , obese , gun-loving . 
  yup , they 're true ( albeit obviously subject to deviation by region ) . 
  people may not understand all the legal details , but a few rights , like an adherence to freedom of speech , are widely-valued . 
  * general distrust of government . 
  despite the fact that the us 's various levels of governments in many ways would rate well globally on , say , corruption , i think that there 's a higher level of cynicism about government than would be the case in the uk or canada . 
  social change is viewed as something not-generally-best-driven by government , but [ rather by ngos ] ( http://www.humanrights.gov/dyn/fact-sheet-non-governmental-organizations-ngos-in-the-united-states.html ) . 
  * an implicit trust of anything related to science/technology : some of this is warranted , some not so much . 
  while this is a global phenomenon , i think that the us sits at the `` implicit trust '' end of the range . 
  scientists serve as something of the role of the historical priest in society in terms of being trusted figures to advise on almost anything , even in areas where they might not necessarily have legitimate authority . 
  you could compare , say , us trust in genetically-engineered food versus the eu ( admittedly , marketing plays a role here too , but it does n't drive all of it ) . 
  i can think of relatively few us deviations or reactionary movements against this trend ... maybe the [ new age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_age ) movement or the [ anti-psychiatry movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-psychiatry ) . 
  [ romanticism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanticism ) existed in the us , but was really driven by europe . 
  while i generally think that there 's a lot to be said for this position ( certainly technological advance has drastically change the world in a short period of time ) , it 's also led to dramatic errors in the public on the side of trust , such as with the [ lobotomy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lobotomy ) . 
  * acceptable to be nationalist/patriotic . 
  this is maybe not so unusual globally , but it does seem to be when compared to europe . 
  i admit that i may have a skewed image here , but i get the impression that in the post-war era in europe , one of the big social efforts was to tone down nationalism to help achieve the post-war goal of long-term peace on the continent . 
  some of the things that i 've seen described as taboo in some european countries , like flying a national flag outside of sporting events or certain other environments ... well , let 's just say that it would clash with us culture , and even having this first described was somewhat-shocking to me . 
  i could see someone being criticized for being gullible to jingoism , but certainly not for flying a national flag . 
   otherwise , nature over there is fantastic , canadians coming to the us for getting away from civilization ? 
  huh . 
  i thought that we did that with canada ...

  [ this sort of article ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3219177/germany-turns-britain-migrant-crisis-aide-angela-merkel-says-no-sympathy-one-country-viewpoints.html ) probably does n't help , looking at the comments . 
  eh , didijustobama is opposed to the eu and generally-enthusiastic about highlighting pain points on the eu . 
  i do n't think that he personally has a lot of concern one way or the other re : dublin . 
   `` this really is a departure from what the u.k. has done in the past , '' said neil quilliam , an analyst at the london-based think tank chatham house who has called for britain to resettle 10,000 syrians . 
  not if you think about the fact that the uk has taken in skilled immigrants rather than refugees in the past . 
  if they claim asylum in germany , she ca n't deport them against their will under the 1951 refugee convention . 
   i 'd take the last line more seriously if every other nato member also did . 
  well , it kinda guarantees paralysis if every member will point at every other member and say `` they are n't there yet '' . 
   it feels like us and uk are picking up the majority of costs and legwork with little to show for it . 
  and france ( and the baltics themselves , though they 've an obvious interest ) . 
  well , that 's a much-broader question -- that is , is it in the uk 's interests to * be * in eastern europe . 
  i do n't think that i personally have the familiarity required to argue that , but i do think that it 's worth pointing out that the uk did thumbs-up baltic , poland , etc nato membership . 
  if the uk * did * make a commitment in that form , presumably it was because it did feel that having russia out of those countries was in its interests . 
  if the concern is just `` why is n't germany pulling its weight '' ... while i kinda sympathize and agree , i do n't know if the best response is `` okay , pull out in turn '' . 
  what if , for example , nato was able to internally-agree that all members would place a population - or gdp-proportional count of soldiers in eastern european countries ? 
  would that be acceptable from your standpoint in terms of ensuring that the uk was n't being treated unfairly ? 
  does n't need to be a large force that would be threatening . 
  if simply having soldiers in eastern europe that would run into conflict with russia if russia attacked is provocative ... are you not comfortable with that level of provocation ? 
  if you mean the direct costs , it does n't need to be a substantial force ( in fact , could be existing military simply being rebased there ; then the cost is just additional travel ) . 
  if the uk is serious about nato article 5 , though , it helps clearly signal that fact to all parties involved . 
  based on [ alexa stats for reddit.com ] ( http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com ) : * reddit is pretty much exactly representative of the internet as regards male/female ratio . 
  * people on reddit are slightly less-educated ( though this might be due to a presumably-younger age and not having completed studies ) . 
  * people on reddit are radically more-likely to be browsing from school than the internet average ( and thus probably students ) . 
   would that do anything to help stabilise europe ? 
  specifically , what are the european stability problems that you feel that the uk and/or france having nukes causes ? 
  til . 
  how sis earned a famous , franchised character with theme music and her majesty 's diplomatic service did n't is one of the great mysteries of british culture . 
   pls dont vote or reproduce anymore that 's not very nice . 
   i 've recently seen a video by some idiot claiming the constitution is undemocratic and unrepresentative and we should have a referendum on the basic human rights . 
  wow . 
  i was about to say `` but amending the constitution * is * , albeit maybe with a higher-than-majority bar , a process by which voters can act as if there 's a referendum on the constitution '' . 
  however , though i was not aware of it , there are [ elements of the german constitution that are apparently un-amendable ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_law_for_the_federal_republic_of_germany ) , and in fact this was imposed on germany by the allies after world war ii . 
  this differs from the us constitution , where even though there 's a very high bar to do so , ultimately , everything can be changed via an orderly , well-defined process -- even the constitution itself could be eliminated . 
  i guess i agree with that guy -- that * is * undemocratic , even if you agree with the principles there or feel that having them is simply a good practical idea . 
  hmm . 
  if the us is the great satan and israel is the little satan , i guess the uk is the just-about-right satan . 
  does the greek `` valid refugee classification '' system rely upon accent , though ? 
  i mean , obviously that 's going to have some degree of error , both positive and negative . 
   hungary has actually been quite diligent in dealing with the incoming migrants , unlike italy which was letting them go on purpose . 
  in italy 's defense , the scope of their problem was a whole lot bigger . 
  the point is that people would cross and once in the uk , claim asylum in the uk rather than in france ; they 'd much rather be in the uk . 
  sure , they 'd claim asylum from the guards ... but it 'd be on uk soil . 
  * i really do n't think that capital punishment is necessary to provide dissuasion from trespassing ( and i 'm vaguely pro-capital punishment ) . 
  i think that that 's just frustration talking .
