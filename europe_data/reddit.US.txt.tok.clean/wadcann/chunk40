  it 's possible to arrest people and then impose whatever punishment is deemed necessary . 
  * there are probably better ways to address this ( e.g. 
  improving the propagation of information in the area that the channel tunnel can not be successfully crossed on foot or better-securing the entrances ) . 
  if people do n't believe that it 's possible , they wo n't do it . 
  * hitting things with trains can derail them . 
  * it would create a legal mess . 
  * you 'd be potentially spreading human corpses around the channel tunnel , and you 'd probably have to shut the thing down to clean it up anyway . 
  * having the tunnel authorities have a simple policy of `` someone in the tunnel , trains do n't move '' is a lot more straightforward than asking them to make a call about the political consequences of running someone down . 
  * probably not very politically-acceptable . 
  even in countries where someone is seen as someone who must be killed ( not just via execution , but even having the police need to shoot someone ) , it 's not normally acceptable to just blow through them with a vehicle to avoid inconvenience . 
   by closing down the trains , they are in fact encouraging other illegal entries into the tunnel safe in the knowledge that the trains will be stopped . 
  they do n't * benefit * from the trains being stopped as long as they are still stopped from getting out the other end . 
  no problem of perverse incentive . 
   it 's not like the average german is any higher educated . 
  < dubious  so , some states are going to be better than others , but eritrea is one of the countries in question and it 's , by the un 's measurement , the [ second-worst educated country in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index ) , behind only niger . 
  germany is the seventh-best-educated country in the world . 
  what would confederation entail that the eu does n't already involve ? 
  even aside from the resources and assets that it would lose , it would dramatically-weaken its geopolitical position . 
  the us enjoys ( and planned to enjoy ) full control of the land in the `` good climate '' zone in north america . 
  that means two relatively-weak neighbors , mexico and canada , and hence no threats . 
  if the us split in two , that would change . 
  well ... a couple points * first , subsidizing unskilled labor requires money . 
  that comes from taxes . 
  businesses are taxed to provide some of this money . 
  it 's not really an obvious benefit ( unless you 're a business that has a particularly-heavy reliance on unskilled labor ) . 
  * second , wages are only one -- albeit the most-obvious -- slider that can be adjusted . 
  working conditions can be reduced and made cheaper , worse managers used , very high standards imposed on labor ( `` move one step out of line and you 're fired '' ) , etc. 
  constraining wages via minimum wage might prevent the most-efficient slider from being moved if that slider is the wage one ( the one that would benefit the employer the most relative to how much the employee is impacted ) , but it still lets the other factors be changed . 
  okay . 
  i was just objecting to this snippet in your earlier post :  so while ** they do n't have a unilateral ** approval / ** veto **, 
  i would be vaguely-positive towards a uk-us association , but i do n't see the driving need for it unless everyone is just dead-set on creating federal states that are as large as possible . 
  there 's already trade and military alliance , and that seems to cover both parties ' real concerns . 
  also , i really think that it would be easier for the uk to establish its stronger bonds with the commonwealth states -- just on a peer-to-peer basis rather than running the whole shebang , if that 's what the uk is interested in . 
  closer political environment , less-recent split , and the uk does n't wind up as overwhelmed by numbers . 
  canada , stop stepping all over europe . 
  you 're destabilizing it . 
  i think that of the anglosphere countries that the uk would want to establish a free movement union with , the us is probably near the bottom of the list ( free trade , maybe ) . 
  the split has been the longest between the two , and i suspect the cultural and governmental differences the greatest . 
  does the queen still have some forms of technical powers that could theoretically be exercised , though , to provide a great deal of pressure on parliament ? 
  i mean , yes , this is just a mind game , but assuming that exercising them did n't result in them being revoked or ignored ... 
  my point was that the us * does * have a unilateral veto , just as other nato members do . 
  that is what / u/ltburtreynolds was asking for . 
  it does not have a unlateral `` we want to add '' this country , though you 're right that it 's probably a lot easier for the us to buy off , say , greece on an addition than it would be for greece to buy off the us . 
  yes , but the point is that limiting freedom of movement ca n't be made a condition of asylum in a way compatible with the treaty : just saying `` if you * do n't * stay in one spot , i 'll jail you '' is n't going to fly unless germany will also do that for all guest workers . 
  judges also are not stupid and if they are doing their job will not permit germany to pass some law that would effectively apply only to said immigrants via some criteria that * happens * to only apply to those people . . 
   they are n't allowed to work in germany either . 
  the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) mandates permitting work :  chapter iii : gainful employment   article 17 . 
    wage-earning employment   1 . 
  the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the most favourable treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign country in the same circumstances , as regards the right to engage in wage-earning employment . 
  either the ( very favorable ) eu right to work would need to be revoked and all eu citizens blocked from working , the 1951 refugee convention withdrawn from , or , at least once the application is accepted , they must be permitted to work . 
   i 'm sorry , so you are saying there is n't diseases in africa that do n't currently run rampant in europe ? 
  hiv and malaria are not going to depopulate europe in the way that european human disease , being reintroduced to the americas after a 30k year isolation , depopulated the americas . 
  there might be risks , but it 's not realistic to believe that europe will see the bulk of its population die off due to suddenly being reconnected with the formerly-isolated population of africa . 
   jobs are not a finite resource you have to mine somewhere no , but demographically , immigrants do n't look much like the german profile : there 's less education and relevant knowledge . 
  that will create an increased supply of unskilled labor , which is already subsidized due to negative externalities associated with having unemployed people or very low wage labor . 
   into a fully-automated market in 5-10 years . 
  nitpick : not * all * labor is going to be fully-automated in 5-10 years , though i 'm sure that automation will advance . 
  screening based on disease is n't permitted to countries based on the 1951 refugee convention . 
   they do n't even pay for their disaster in calais i do n't think that the uk has a * responsibility * for calais . 
  it 's just that it is * in its interests * to pay for calais , because then it can ensure that as much effort is being made as it feels is justified paying for , whereas france has no incentive beyond keeping the channel tunnel functioning to block illegal immigrants from entering the uk . 
  if the uk does n't pay , you will wind up with france functioning just fine and people likely entering the uk that the uk would have chosen to pay to catch . 
     my personal opinion is that , as long as they are within the eu as refugees granted asylum , they should n't be allowed to move to a different country , period . 
  a country ca n't deport refugees to another country * if * they 've legitimately been granted asylum under the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , barring withdrawing from that treaty :  article 26 . 
    freedom of movement   each contracting state shall accord to refugees lawfully in its territory the right to choose their place of residence and to move freely within its territory subject to any regulations applicable to aliens generally in the same circumstances . 
   half of all refugees should be sent to the u.s. since the `` arab spring '' was u.s. policy . 
  first , the arab spring was n't us policy . 
  bombing saddam out was us policy ; that certainly might have been a bad idea , but it does n't extend to all unrest across the entire africa/middle eastern area . 
  second , if a refugee managed to make it directly to the us from africa , the us would be bound by the same legal requirements that germany is in to either withdraw from treaties or consider for asylum . 
  the us is n't under any obligation to take refugees from germany . 
  third , i personally think that the treaty is disadvantageous to germany and likely-abusable , and that it would probably be in germany 's interests to withdraw from it ; if any war in africa is a green light for anyone in the area to claim asylum in germany , that will sooner-or-later be exploited . 
  that does n't mean that i think that the us would pick up more people , but that germany should stop . 
  i ca n't require germany to do that , but then again , germany ca n't require the us to take up gobs of third world immigrants , either . 
  it was certainly a factor , but if the general principle of `` war in africa means a gateway for people in a number of countries to claim asylum in germany '' is going to be upheld , this was going to inevitably happen . 
  honestly , * if * germany truly is going to open borders and accept people , it probably would be less-disruptive to the intermediate countries , make it easier to register and process in an orderly fashion , and generate more goodwill to just set up ships and start shipping people in . 
  nobody would be selling their house , as happened above , human smuggling would be shut down , and if both ( 1 ) none of the efforts and controlling flow are actually effective and ( 2 ) germany is going to accept people that show up anyway , it 's silly not to do so . 
  article 10 :  ** the parties may by unanimous agreement ** , invite any other european state in a position to further the principles of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the north atlantic area to accede to this treaty . 
  as the us is a member of nato and a democracy , us voters do . 
  they do n't get to unilaterally-add a member nation , but just as with any other nato member , they have the ability to unilaterally block addition . 
  greece and turkey were both in nato in ' 74 . 
  which side was nato supposed to take ? 
  hmm . 
  if italy and greece are unable or unwilling to stop migrants who want to go to germany and the uk , what makes you think that poland will be able and willing ? 
  is this what people in russia claimed when the ussr collapsed ? 
  that , say , estonia and poland were all super-enthusiastic about russia , but that the cia or whoever went out and overthrew the legitimate authorities ? 
  `` non-spanish white guy calls non-spanish black guy named `` white '' in spanish `` black '' in spanish . '', 
  * scientific american * sure is n't the magazine that it once was -- this is a straight-up political article . 
  it is true , however , that the skillset of those claiming refugee status is not on par with the current population , which will mean that it will create pressure on low-skill labor in europe . 
  is it * actually * indentured servitude ? 
  that is , if an employee complained to a court , would the employer say `` this guy is contracted to work for five more years -- he can not leave or change employers until that time is up '' ? 
  was the personal attack necessary ? 
  / u/fortytwowilldo was pretty polite and straightforward about it , i think . 
  would be nice if everyone hewed to the same standard and kept the conversation civil . 
   redditor for 1 month username checks out . 
   france france -- a poll conducted by french daily newspaper le parisien found that 52 % of french voters were in favour of the uk withdrawing from the eu . 
   i do n't understand what the point of europe is so , let 's say that we asked each of the national leaders of the eu member countries to tell us what the point of europe -- i 'd have said `` the eu '' here , but fair enough -- is . 
  they are n't allowed to coordinate ahead of time . 
  do you think that * they 'd * give the same answer ? 
   black invasion you know , syrians are n't , by-and-large , black . 
  eritreans , yes , but ... 
  on the other hand , i 'll bet that those towns also are n't popular intended destinations for migrants .
