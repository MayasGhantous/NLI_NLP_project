  whatever mr. stiglitz 's economics background , i 'd point out that he 's making a * political * claim here about the franco-german relationship .

  europe is n't the only place in the world with nationalism . 
  is the eu willing to pay market rate for countries to take in asylum seekers ? 
  that may be quite expensive . 
  you mean because it 's inverted ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distress_signal#flags  for hundreds of years inverted national flags were commonly used as distress signals . 
  [ 3 ] i 've seen pictures of inverted american flags used in protests where someone is trying to claim that the country itself is at risk . 
  i 'd assume that this is what the protesters are doing . 
  edit : some examples of the practice in the us : * [ disabled veteran flies u.s. flag upside down to protest #shutdown ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/the-stream/the-stream-officialblog/2013/10/2/disabled-veteranfliesusflagupsidedowntoprotestshutdown.html ) .

  the danes were n't of a mind to sell . 
   there are ways to get rid of your fingerprints for few days ( hot metal ) to few months ( certain meds ) just winds up with [ national dna databases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_dna_database ) showing up and replacing fingerprints . 
  the above is based purely on the metric of `` entries under the invention category for that country listed on wikipedia '' . 
  that 's obviously a limited metric , but it 's hard to measure `` inventiveness '' . 
  you might well feel that there 's more material that is n't captured there ; for example , perhaps french-originating inventions are n't documented as well on wikipedia as those of other countries . 
  off-the-cuff , for example , i can think of one french invention that is n't listed under the `` category : french inventions '' category : the [ daguerreotype ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daguerreotype ) . 
  that 's correct -- the 1951 refugee convention does not permit for limiting how many people a country takes in , and germany is a signatory . 
  i 'm curious where the `` global initiative against transnational organized crime '' got the numbers . 
  it does n't seem like isis human smugglers would be filing properly-documented tax forms , after all .

  probably make sense to divide by population . 
  edit : eh , now i 'm curious ; going to look it up . 
  here we go , invention count divided by current population . 
  note that the size of these countries has not remained relatively-fixed over time , and i 'm using a somewhat-subjective approach to omit irrelevant categories ( e.g. 
  not including the list of `` german inventors '' ) : | country | inventions on wp | population ( millions ) | ratio | | - | - | - | - | | poland | 24 | 38.5 | 0.62 | | latvia | 6 | 2 | 2 | | lithuania | 4 | 3 | 1.33 | | ukraine | 19 | 44 | 0.43 | | azerbaijan | 12 | 9.6 | 1.25 | | belarus | 2 | 9.5 | 0.21 | | russia | 285 | 143 | 1.80 | | germany | 165 | 81 | 2.03 | | netherlands | 153 | 16 | 9.56 | | england | 185 | 53 | 3.49 | | france | 42 | 66 | 0.64 | i think that clears it up -- obviously the [ dutch are the most inventive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:dutch_inventions ) . 
  well , it 's poorer than western europe . 
  looking at the current european countries that appear to be well-regarded or high-status , they appear to be wealthy ( germany , uk , etc ) . 
   yes , it 's confusing . 
  i [ dug into this a while back ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1pib3j/what_is_the_stupidest_question_youve_ever_heard/cd2t1u4 ) and it gets even more twisted . 
  * the guardian * did an interesting article a while back [ comparing rations of armies around the world ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/18/eat-of-battle-worlds-armies-fed ) .

  it 'd be more-helpful if there were a baseline rate of drills to help determine how meaningful this is .

  sexually-assaulting .

  but ... yeah . 
  yeah ... i do n't know if there 's a name for it , but where something bad and high-profile happens and then nobody wants to be the politician who lets it happen a second time , so overreactions wind up happening . 
  the us does penalize this under the [ foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_corrupt_practices_act ) . 
  all right , i guess my above comment was wrong . 
   some argue that a new state should be created , and that all refugees should be sent there , and start a new life there . 
  i do n't think that is desirable , nor doable . 
  you do n't solve a problem by relocating it . 
  what problem is the author trying to solve ? 
  for a hypothetical war refugee , getting them out of the war zone does solve the problem , at least to the extent that the asylum process is intended to solve it : stopping the physical threat to the individuals involved . 
  now , maybe there are logistical problems with * that * . 
  maybe it 's the case that that state would have the same cultural/religious/racial / etc frictions that produced the * earlier * war simply produce a new conflict . 
  `` just creating '' a state out of a collection of poor , uneducated refugees is n't necessarily all that easy . 
  the closest equivalent is probably [ liberia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberia ) , which is clearly not a terribly-successful state . 
  or maybe the author has a broader goal of , oh , say , ending poverty around the world or something like that ; the later part of the article references this . 
  i 'm not convinced that this is the most-effective approach to that ( poverty * has * , globally , been decreasing for quite a few decades ) . 
  move to `` new '' , and you still do n't see much else . 
  people are n't submitting a lot of other content . 
  there 's a straightforward fix -- find interesting europe-related material and submit it . 
  this is n't something that is * that * hard to do , and any individual can pretty easily do it . 
  i think we 're talking about two different things -- when i refer to the schengen border i 'm talking about the uk becoming involved in , say , greece or italy , trying to secure the schengen area itself at the schengen border upon entry . 
  i agree with you that it makes sense for the uk to be involved in calais , where people are leaving schengen into the uk . 
  ah , okay , i 'm sympathetic to an argument that they should aid in calais , since it 's their own interests at stake . 
  it 's just that the interviewee was saying that the calais situation existed because of what happened to people in the uk , and i 'd think that he 'd have to make a pretty big stretch to make that argument , like `` well , the uk could just totally ignore illegal people coming in and then manage to pick them up internally via periodically searching people in a neighborhood and requiring identity documents '' or something like that . 
  i also agree that it makes sense for all schengen area countries to unify how they deal with the schengen borders ; on the other hand , i do n't personally think that , unless the uk joins schengen , it 's reasonable to blame the uk for not taking part in schengen border enforcement . 
  i 'm still not seeing the argument for what the uk has done internally being responsible for calais . 
  i 'm not saying that the link is n't interesting , but honestly ... if the author wants to argue that eastern europe should n't be concerned about russia , he really should be looking at the political and military situation in present-day russia . 
  i do n't think that anyone 's disputing that life was often less-than-great under the soviet union : it 's arguing an argument against the empty air . 
   france 's military has sharp uniforms , mystique ... they eat well , too ... i 'm pretty sure that if the author asked a high-ranking french officer to describe the important strengths of the french military , that really is n't what that officer would highlight . 
   * at the moment we are witnessing isolated breakdowns of state order - like calais , lampedusa , macedonia . 
  there , we have observed virtually anarchic conditions . 
  do the european states have enough creative power to control the situation , i.e. , to prevent the nascence of such situations ? 
  *   the problems are difficult to handle because the europeans have let the problems slide over years . 
  even britain and france have allowed unregulated immigration . 
  registration systems in britain are extraordinarily weak - people do n't even have to carry an i.d. 
  card with them . 
  the british have to learn their lessons and they will . 
  but they let the problems drag on for years . 
  whether-or-not requiring people to carry identification papers is a good idea , i have a hard time seeing blaming the situation in calais , france on internal uk policy . 
  on the other hand , when the la rodney king riot started , [ one factor blamed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkqiesq4fk4 ) was the decision of the lapd to back off rather than control the situation early-on ; that riot then snowballed to huge proportions . 
  i imagine that at one point in history , pretty much everyone 's ancestors were squatters . 
  [ google translate link ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fjyllands-posten.dk%2finternational%2feuropa%2fece7963933%2fsammenbrud-truer-flygtningesystem%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  also , i bet that the museum is n't air-conditioned . 
   the breakout came three days after police at the camp used tear gas on migrants protesting against having their fingerprints taken . 
  fingerprinting would have left them unable to claim refugee status in the uk or germany . 
  belgium does not need to exit the un to invalidate the treaty . 
  the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) explicitly details how a country may withdraw from the treaty :  article 44 . denunciation   1 . 
  any contracting state may denounce this convention at any time by a notification addressed to the secretary-general of the united nations . 
  such denunciation shall take effect for the contracting state concerned one year from the date upon which it is received by the secretary-general of the united nations . 
  any state which has made a declaration or notification under article 40 may , at any time thereafter , by a notification to the secretary-general of the united nations , declare that the convention shall cease to extend to such territory one year after the date of receipt of the notification by the secretary-general . 
  to conform to the treaty , it would require that one year of lag time , though . 
  * simply because of the country ? 
  syria has 18m people . 
  eritria has 6m . 
  that 's greenlighting some 34m people , or something over two netherlands . 
  * the reason for some of this is that would-be asylum seekers in other countries know that people are being granted refugee status ; as a result , it makes a lot of sense to present themselves as coming from that country . 
  there 's no way to disprove where they are coming from .
