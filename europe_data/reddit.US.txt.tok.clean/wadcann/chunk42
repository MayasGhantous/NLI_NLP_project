  that being said , it 's rare for someone legally in the country to not have some form of valid identification ; typically a driver 's license . 
   throwing id away . 
  this bs has been debunked . 
  i read an autobiography some time back ( this was done long before the whole north africa refugee crisis business ) from an iraqi who fled iraq to avoid the draft and successfully claimed refugee status in the uk . 
  he worked with human smugglers , and one of the first things he did on the path towards the uk was to ( 1 ) obtain false identification and then to ( 2 ) destroy it so that he could n't be deported . 
  i would guess that the `` destroy documentation to avoid deportation '' thing is pretty standard . 
  why would there be less sexual abuse if you put the same collection in a camp on the mainland ? 
  why is that ? 
  my understanding is that most illegal immigration is via the mediterranean today . 
  if expanses of water were such a big concern , presumably people would just be going via russia and through non-eu countries . 
  the detention point * could * be on an island . 
  well , the countries that are probably the most-popular migration targets . 
  the refugee thing appears to have raised the question of intra-eu immigration , though ... my understanding is that at least the uk overwhelmingly sees intra-eu immigration . 
  no , i mean `` shot down '' -- the helicopter had to land because of damage . 
   but the smugglers are becoming harder to combat as their operations become more agile , more international and more innovative in their use of new tools such as social media , wainwright said . 
  because if there 's one thing that 's hard to monitor , it 's social media ? 
  you had a [ comment this week saying ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i3geg/germany_shames_eu_partners_for_failure_to/cud2l2d ) saying :  germany needs to accept that for the eu to function it needs to take charge . 
  if it does n't want to take charge then it should just abandon the project or at the very least shrink the eu 's powers done dramatically . 
  pick one , do n't just dither and do nothing . 
  [ now this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3iv64o/swedens_farright_wants_referendum_on_immigration/cuk3p0i ) :  germany 's doing the rounds at the moment attacking individual countries for not doing enough . 
  who knows how far they 'll go in trying to push the idea if the crisis gets worse . 
  it seems smart for other countries to stockpile their political ammunition so that they can come on top . 
  make up your mind .

   `` every application takes a long time to be registered , '' said silvia kostner , a health and welfare spokeswoman . 
  `` we have 50 people in our staff , and we try to register about 100 to 150 people a day , so all the others have to wait until we have a solution for them . '' each person registers three people a day ? 
  you could probably kiosk that and have it make sense at some point . 
  i do n't think that those soldiers are being used to dominate in the `` using military force to make things happen '' sense . 
  certainly in the sense of numbers , the us has a more-powerful military force than european nato members currently do . 
  i think that if europe wants to not be militarily dominated in the sense of a force disparity , though , it 's not a hard issue to remedy -- simply build up european militaries . 
  the us has been the one pushing for this , not the eu , and certainly is not going to complain . 
  the eu * does * have the economic capacity to do such a buildup if need be . 
  i think that that 's independent of nato bases in eastern europe : in fact , the ukraine situation has probably tended to slow the rate of european military spending drop-off , and in some members , increase that spending . 
  some of these -- particularly the glass -- is to permit for air conditioning , since they 're trying to move from a historic , open , breezy building that relied on wind for cooling to a modern glass-enclosed building that has air conditioning available .

  plastic -- does n't need to be painted and can be solid color through , does n't rust , does n't dent , is lightweight , can be shaped rather than assembled from individual pieces , does n't rot ... and it 's the cheap , low-status stuff that 's available everywhere .

   in wwi , it was less apparent - german street names and businesses were changed to english and american names . 
  in wwii , the anti-german sentiment became more apparent and the us even interned some germans , though their treatment was not as bad as the japanese . 
  i would invert your take on wwi and wwii : i 'd say that world war i saw more hostility than ii .

  huzzah inadvertent us mass media influence . 
  i think that he was probably more collected after the third one than i would have been if you dropped me into the same situation . 
  it was a footnote compared to the japanese-american interment and affected a handful in relative terms . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internment_of_german_americans  at the time of wwii , the united states had a large population of ethnic germans . 
  in 1940 more than 1.2 million persons had been born in germany , 5 million had two native-german parents , and 6 million had one native-german parent . 
  many more had distant german ancestry . 
  during wwii , the united states detained a total of 11,507 ethnic germans , overwhelmingly german nationals . 
  there was a lot more anti-german feeling in the us in world war i than ii . 
  german-americans being harassed , anglicizing names , terminating use of the german language ( which was much-more-widely-used then ) . 
  i 'd guess that this was more driven by fear of whether german-americans might internally-support germany . 
  by the time world war ii rolled around , it was clear that that was n't going to happen , and i would guess ( i 've not read anything from any historian saying this ) that this was a major factor . 
  japanese , on the other hand , were different . 
  in propaganda , i 've seen them treated as objects of contempt or scorn . 
  the [ niihau incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niihau_incident ) happened right when the us entered the war , and might have helped set anti-japanese policy in motion . 
  to be fair , australia 's probably down a bit now , because some of that was driven by resource extraction for china . 
  well , you already had one response from an american , but i 'll give another . 
   try to answer the questions as close to ( your perception ) the national consensus . 
  i do n't think that average joe would have an answer for most of these . 
  i 'll give an answer , but ...  years which really matter ( e.g. 
  if the invasion of poland kicks it off , or czechoslovakia , or operation barbarossa to the surrender of japan or surrender of germany ) : ? 
  not something that people talk about , so i could n't provide real input as to consensus . 
  i 'm pretty certain that average joe has little knowledge of the timeline in world war ii . 
  i 'd be inclined to guess from my reading ( which did n't specifically focus on domestic opinion ) that if you went back far enough , probably the time after pearl harbor . 
  before that , it would have been a major international news item but not something that directly impacted most people in the us : this was just one of europe 's wars . 
  the end of the war was going to be more-or-less a foregone conclusion at some point ( again , average joe probably does n't have any sort of timeline here ) , but it 's hard to judge how people would have felt at the time , especially since when i read material , it 's from both sides and free of propaganda and wartime censorship . 
  if by `` really matter '' , the parts that average joe today would be able to identify , pearl harbor , d-day ( and specifically [ omaha beach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omaha_beach ) ) , and maybe concentration camp liberations . 
  that 's what gets covered the most in popular media . 
  edit : some other americans have mentioned the dropping of the atomic bomb , and i agree : i should n't have omitted that . 
   noun associated with the warfare period ( e.g. 
  shelter , fear , patriotism , survival ) : ? 
  i do n't know of a single noun that is really associated with it . 
  of the ones you listed , certainly patriotism would be the closest , at least today . 
  at the time , i 'd guess that there was more anger , [ particularly with the japanese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_propaganda_during_world_war_ii#themes ) . 
  the us probably suffered the least of all the combatants -- food and pay were good by the standards of the time , industry kept functioning , and while there was rationing and some limitations , they were quite minor compared to the bulk of countries involved in world war ii . 
  there were * relatively * few casualties compared to many countries who were involved in the war , and very few civilian casualties . 
   noun associated with the end of the war ( e.g. 
  victory , defeat , subjugation , happiness ) : ? 
  of those choices , victory . 
   the role of your country in the war ( e.g. 
  pulling power , battlefield , punching bag ) : ? 
  my own view of the us 's role in the war changed dramatically when i read about it , and i do n't think that i 'm representative of average joe any more . 
  i 'd guess that when it comes to fighting , people probably think about the war in europe and us infantry . 
  people would think of building weapons , particularly things like tanks . 
  my own view ... i do n't think that that 's the most-characteristic of the us . 
  the us was a major power , but in europe it was in air power ( with the uk ) , manufacturing ( and not even just of tanks and aircraft , but of trucks ) and logistics and supplies that it played a defining role : yes , there was certainly ground combat , but that pales compared to the germany-soviet fight . 
  the huge us/uk bombing raids , though , were unequaled . 
  and , of course , the us was the 800-pound gorilla in the pacific after a few months of war . 
   the perception of your country-men who fought within the wehrmacht or waffen-ss ( e.g. 
  was n't really applicable to the us in the way that it was for countries that were occupied . 
  i guess that the us probably dropped its negative view of germany quickly compared to much of europe -- germany had n't ever occupied the us , had no history of conflict with the us outside of world war i and ii , germany played more-or-less nicely with the us compared to how it interacted with some countries , and west germany was an ally starting promptly at the end of the war . 
  there was a substantial pool of german-americans in the us . 
   the role of national partisans within your country ( e.g.
