   co2 is closer to a 4 % limit . 
  wikipedia [ does not agree ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hypercapnia ) . 
  it says that exposure to 4 % co2 for a week would just cause `` moderate respiratory stimulation , exaggerated respiratory response to exercise '' . 
  ah , i see , thanks . 
  there is a constraint in that the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) requires a country to treat refugees as if they were nationals as welfare goes :  article 23 . public relief   the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals . 
  that means that it would not be possible for a wealthy country to lower benefits to a level equal to that of a poorer country without violating the treaty . 
  it would be possible for the poorer countries to give larger handouts , but that is the only legal way to harmonize welfare without first withdrawing from the treaty . 
   you have to distribute the refugees evenly and integrate them , not put them in ghettos where they only have contact to each other hmm . 
  `` diffuse poor people to solve their problems '' [ has n't always worked out well in the us ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/american-murder-mystery/306872/ ) . 
  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention  article 26 . freedom of movement   each contracting state shall accord to refugees lawfully in its territory the right to choose their place of residence and to move freely within its territory subject to any regulations applicable to aliens generally in the same circumstances . 
  because doing this would violate this treaty and countries do not yet want to withdraw from the treaty . 
  all of them do ? 
  ( a ) a video popping up a snippet of text now and then is a lousy way to convey information . 
  ( b ) a skim of the wikipedia article on this [ spengler guy 's writings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_decline_of_the_west ) ... looks to me like everything that infuriates me in bad , non-rigorous humanities writings -- vague , unsupported claims , references to past mythology and literature that reveal vast underlying truths about the world . 
  the only difference is that this happens to be politically far-right rather than left . 
   neither can say anything meaningful about controlling immigration with any credibility . 
  just for those of us who do n't follow uk politics as closely , is this because cameron apparently made a promise earlier this year that has been exceeded ? 
  [ david cameron wo n't ` cave in ' on migration target despite new figures ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32816454 )  but the pm said he would not `` cave in '' and abandon his target of reducing net migration below 100,000 . 
  followed a few months later by : [ net migration to the uk is at an all-time high , reaching 330,000 in the year to march , the office for national statistics has said . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34071492 ) or do the credibility concerns stem from something else ? 
  i thought it would violate the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , which has :  article 3 , non-discrimination   the contracting states shall apply the provisions of this convention to refugees without discrimination as to race , ** religion ** or country of origin . 
  ... but actually , i 'm not sure that that is the case , as long as slovakia is n't actually the initial country where someone has been granted refugee status , because it 's not clear that the people will be refugees in slovakia . 
  if someone 's asylum application is pending in country a , i suppose that they * could * permit another country b to house refugees , and country b could apply whatever restrictions it wants . 
  if that 's the case , under the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , the country of asylum a would still have to permit the asylum applicant freedom of movement in country a. 
  that also * might * not be what 's happening here , but i 'm trying to reconcile the treaty with what 's happening . 
  in all fairness , / r/russia had a glut of `` the ruble is the strongest-performing currency '' when it had a spike earlier in the year . 
  given that there 's no drastic change in borders , and the situation in ukraine is [ more or less maintaining a low level of ongoing conflict ] ( http://www.liveuamap.com/ ) , and that the eu and the us have stated that the way forward will be beating up russia 's economy , economic metrics seems like a reasonable thing to be watching . 
  the relative value of the ruble may or may not be the most-interesting number , but the effects of its change are easy to see and it 's a sort of scorecard to work with . 
  if you want to cheer for some form of progress or change , that 's pretty much what you 'd cheer about . 
  i do agree that often small changes get turned into `` russia a step from collapse '' , but that has n't happened here : there are ( currently ) no such comments , and the story does n't make claims like that . 
   germany 's overall wind power output in the first half of 2015 was 39 percent higher than a year ago , with a combined wind and solar portfolio now estimated above 80 gw , according to germany 's renewable lobby group , bee . 
  add in biomass and hydropower numbers , and on july 25 the country is said to have hit a new peak record -- an astounding 79 percent of domestic power consumption supplied by renewables . 
  it is politically-popular : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind_power_in_the_european_union  about 80 per cent of eu citizens support wind power . 
  [ 5 ] there is a cost to this , however : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind_power_in_germany#energy_transition  industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the energiewende have been passed on to consumers , who have had rising electricity bills . 
  germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in europe . 
  i read the `` new '' post category , and see most new posts . 
  there is n't currently a lot of other material ; the submission rate is n't all * that * high . 
  if you want other content , you 're going to have to identify and submit it : a border dispute with belgium , collapse of spanish dialects , maps of gender imbalance in europe , whatever else you like . 
  ... right , so what you 're saying is that it 's not a practical option from the standpoint of conforming to moral requirements and legal requirements . 
  i think that we 're perhaps not communicating well : i am not advocating that this be done . 
  i 'm saying that that is probably what would be required to reliably block people at a fence . 
  in the same sense , if someone said `` russian oil is sufficient to fuel south africa '' and i said `` that would require a seven-thousand-mile-long pipeline '' , i do n't expect to have greenpeace members show up upset that i 'm advocating for blocking migrating animals over a multi-thousand-mile stretch of land : i 'm simply describing the kind of thing that would be realistically necessary , not advocating for it . 
  i 'm not arguing that it 's practical , but rather that it 's the sort of thing that would be necessary if you want to to actually reliably block people . 
  i always thought that it was just in the us that people threaten to move to canada , and that it was an americanism due to geography , but then i see europeans occasionally doing so on / r/europe ... 
  the question of whether `` citizenship swapping programs '' should exist is kind of interesting . 
  i see a lot of random blog posts on it online , but not much serious debate . 
  thoughts : * it * would * solve issues with concerns about uncontrolled population increase , though i 'm not sure how-interesting that actually is . 
  it would still permit for demographic changes , like old swapping for young . 
  * it would severely-limit programs where the young are subsidized , like state-funded education , since a country that did this could expect its residents to them `` swap '' after their education is completed with an older person . 
  * i would guess that some of the rationale for a long path-to-citizenship in at least the us is that it permits use of deportation if the person does n't work out so well : this results in an extensive `` probation period '' . 
  once you 're a citizen in the us , it 's normally very difficult to lose your citizenship , and deportation is no longer an option . 
  i suspect that countries that have a long period before granting citizenship might be leery of allowing this ( unless a citizenship swap would itself take a while ) . 
  * during that evaluation period , what happens if any one person is rejected ? 
  does the other person 's citizenship `` snap back '' as well ? 
  that effectively gives both persons a veto over the exchange . 
  what if one citizenship is more-highly-valued than the other ? 
  it seems like it would make sense to receive cash , spend the cash , then veto the exchange , unless any money also lived in escrow . 
  * it would presumably open hard-to-prevent markets like borrowing against one 's citizenship ; this might be seen as undesirable . 
  [ `` happy birthday , rick !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xds6uqpsssg ), 
  some of that material is english-language . 
   than the us did in an actual war . 
  strictly speaking , we have n't declared war since the end of world war ii . 
  we [ authorized use of military force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/authorization_for_use_of_military_force_against_terrorists ) , effectively delegating authority to the executive branch , and then the president broadly did whatever he felt like with the authority . 
  there has been some debate about exactly how legitimate this sort of thing is as regards the us constitution . 
  do you support the existence of an inheritance/estate tax within your country ? 
  it has some similarities . 
  some people have a sort of rejection of the idea that someone should be permitted to pass wealth down through many generations . 
   the alexis tsipras who came back from brussels was a condescending , conforming , flexible prime minister who changed course and started talking about the necessity of a bailout deal -- a memorandum , alas -- as if forgetting that his political career and rise to power was based on fighting the hated `` memoranda . '' would greek interests be served by trying to play more hardball ? 
  maybe it 's all a very elaborate cloth being pulled over my eyes , but at least to me the eu seems pretty convincing that it 's willing to not budge further . 
  resistance merely for the sake of resistance does n't seem to make much sense . 
   `` they are not legitimate refugees but economic migrants '' , as if trying to escape poverty and make a better living for yourself and your family is basically terrorism . 
  i do n't see that as being a reasonable comparison : pointing out that people claiming refugee status are making use of the fact that it is hard to identify people who would meet the legitimate definition is not calling someone a terrorist . . 
  i do very much feel that it is an accurate and meaningful statement to make -- the reason that the treaties on refugees exist is not to enable economic migration . 
  if you want the refugee treaties in place to address * actual * refugees -- that is , because you are concerned that if you do not provide asylum , there 's a risk of a genocide , say -- it does not at all mean that you need to support economic migration and it does not mean that you need be in conflict with the intent of the people who passed the original treaties . 
  you may * also * want to permit legal economic migration . 
  fair enough . 
  but wanting to permit the former ( `` asylum to avoid genocide '' ) does not need to also require that you want to permit the latter ( `` taking in people who want a better life '' ) . 
  my own belief is that there are very good reasons for wanting to separate between the two . 
  for example , permitting people under the refugee system means that a destination country ca n't use its filters to try to pull in people that it would most want ; you may want that criteria to just be a monopoly ; fine . 
  it weakens the refugee system as a tool to accomplish its own goal , since people no longer view it as a real tool to rescue people from being killed off . 
  it rewards people who are willing to break the law , and punishes those who do not . 
  and let 's reverse the question : if you want to permit economic migration , what is so harmful about not explicitly separating the two categories ? 
  what grounds do you have for objecting to categorizing people ? 
  one possibility that seems likely to me would be that there is n't sufficient support for large-scale economic migration , but that there is for refugee asylum . 
  if that 's the case , it seems rather un-democratic ( which may or may not be a concern for you ! ), 
  to be selling the public a false bill of goods . 
  the only real ways that i can see to seriously control an area : * evacuate and ban entry into a * large * stretch of area . 
  mine it . 
  set up ( expensive ) guards all along it who are permitted to shoot people . 
  this is the `` korean dmz '' approach . 
  it means that you need to be willing to kill people and spend a lot of money in an ongoing process to man it . 
  note that we are getting increasingly-close to [ being able to automate the human labor side of this ] ( http://www.cnet.com/news/korean-machine-gun-robots-start-dmz-duty/ ) . 
  * evacuate and clear a smaller area between two walls to keep out non-human large objects . 
  set up motion sensors in the area . 
  evacuate ( but do not clear ) a substantial area on your side of it . 
  you need to have people who can respond when the motion sensors detect something . 
  this ( without the double fence ) is more or less what the [ us-mexico border fence ] ( http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a6012/holes-found-in-us-border-fence-technology/ ) efforts look like . 
  this does n't * stop * people , but if you can respond quickly , it may tell you when they cross and give you enough time to catch them . 
  this may not be viable if you do n't have a big desert on one side of the thing .
