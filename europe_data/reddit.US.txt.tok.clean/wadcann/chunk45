  technology is not here yet . 
  and there are still unsolved problems : if there 's enough money wanting to get someone across , you have to worry about tunnels . 
  the us has to worry about tunnels because of the drug and human smuggling trade . 
  [ these can become quite elaborate ] ( http://www.usborderpatrol.com/border_patrol725.htm ) . 
  there 's the `` just buy off the border officer '' approach , which has been around for a long time . 
  this might limit volume and mean that human smugglers have to first set up shop . 
  there 's the `` use force '' approach . 
  for example , last month a [ us border patrol helicopter was shot down on the mexican border ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/06/border-patrol-confirms-us-cbp-chopper-shot-down-at-texas-border/ ) . 
  how many people and how much weaponry are you going to put at each border outpost ? 
  i 'd say that stopping people at a coast is a lot easier , because then the problem is one of being able to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate boats , and that i could see as being a lot more-viable . 
  i still have a hard time seeing that being all that effective . 
  in fact , unless you 're going to put up two fences , clear the center area and keep it clear , and then have motion sensors or the like with people who can catch them on the other side , it 's just not going to work . 
  humans are capable critters . 
  they really do n't get stymied by a ten-foot-tall barrier . 
  a fence can slow people or clearly establish an `` illegitimate to be in '' area , but no fence , alone , can stop humans . 
   the position white europeans hold in the world was n't just handed to them , they worked and suffered for it . 
  i mean , i 'd assume that most people here personally started out with a certain edge in wealth and access to industry and so forth relative to some hypothetical average human resident of earth .

   us virgin islands http://www.ibtimes.com/us-virgin-islands-lures-businesses-tax-breaks-1561887  these generous tax breaks do n't render the virgin islands a corporate or offshore tax haven , like such well-known rivals as bermuda or the cayman islands , [ democratic us virgin islands governor ] de jongh asserted in an interview with ibtimes . 
  that 's because the virgin islands ' tax benefits are legally sanctioned by the u.s. government , ** unlike regimes at overseas havens under pressure from a global regulatory crackdown ** .

  belgium was unusual in the table in that it saw application rates decreasing . 
  you just do n't want to live up to the golden standard set by austria , croatia , estonia , luxembourg , the netherlands , romania , slovakia , and the united kingdom !, 
  well , to be fair , i 'm not sure that that 's a good argument if the concern is indeed serbia getting into the eu . 
  a large table of countries showing application rates increasing ... and also showing belgium . 
   * finland might think that eu membership provides sufficient security guarantees . 
  the eu has similar guarantees and nato `` only '' additionally pulls in canada , the us , and turkey . 
  if eu membership alone is sufficient , then why pay a price in russian actions for nato membership ? 
  of course , the real question is what * russia * views as viable ( since finland wants a russian attack to be dissuaded ) , and then i suppose that then there 's a question to be answered of why russia would punish nato membership but not eu membership she felt that eu would respond in the same way and be sufficient . 
   for the life of me i ca n't understand why finland and sweden would not join nato ... well : 1 . 
  russia would presumably try to punish them economically . 
  if finland is willing to bet on russia not attacking ( or simply views the cost of doing whatever it requires to avoid russia attacking as lower than the economic costs imposed by russia ) , then not joining nato would be a net benefit . 
  finland might not think that nato would follow through , in which case finland would have to pay any economic costs with russia but would n't buy anything in return . 
  finland might feel that getting dragged into a hypothetical nato-russia war triggered by some * other * nato member being attacked would be disadvantageous to herself , and that she might be able to just sit the war out otherwise . 
  finland might think that eu membership provides sufficient security guarantees . 
  the eu has similar guarantees and nato `` only '' additionally pulls in canada , the us , and turkey . 
  if eu membership alone is sufficient , then why pay a price in russian actions for nato membership ? 
  finland might feel that nato would involve themselves anyway for nato 's own reasons or might feel that finland could get some advance warning and manage to push membership through nato in that window of time . 
  this means that it would be advantageous from finland 's standpoint to freeload -- why pay a cost to get what it already has ? 
  i 'm dubious about the reasoning on this one . 
  nato has strong reason to not defend non-nato members , and in particular ones that politically had the option to join but avoided doing so , because it would create a strong incentive for other members to want to do the same thing , which tends to break up nato , since you wind up with just a few remaining members responsible for a large number of obligations . 
  i am not familiar with v4 , but is the idea to have another military alliance that would be more-reliable than nato in the event of a poland-russia conflict ? 
  i do n't see how this would work . 
  let 's say that ( a ) russia actually decides to gamble on managing to split both the eu and nato and ( b ) the eu and nato both defect and refuse to involve themselves . 
  looking at the member nations , v4 is , in isolation , significantly militarily-weaker than russia . 
  if a conflict actually began , that would either mean that it would be gambling on the additional damage it could cause being sufficient to dissuade russia ( and be asking the members to take an all-in gamble that russia , once in a conflict would choose to back down , since if russia went forward it would probably win ) . 
  additionally , poland is by far the militarily-strongest member in v4 and would appear to have more weight than the other members combined : it would be like asking south korea and japan to come save the us if the us got in over its head and otherwise would be in serious trouble . 
  the author is saying that the eu is paralyzed , so nato should be used . 
  you * can * politically-change the eu to make it easier -- like delegate authority to an `` immigration commission '' that does straight-up majority votes or something . 
  moving to nato just means that a bunch of military officials are now stuck being responsible for trying to figure out what the heck would be best . 
  and , seriously , do you think that moving from the eu to nato , which means pulling finland out of the mix and adding turkey , is going to make things more-favorable for blocking people at the border ? 
  and having foreign troops without police training , legal knowledge , or language or culture knowledge enforce law ... that seems like there 's a lot of potential for international incidents . 
  and i suspect that the us and canada want very little to do with this : it 's not asking them for military defense when they 're attacked , but rather to solve eu political problems for them and maybe to do domestic law enforcement . 
  if you have a democracy , theoretically some semblance of the public 's will shows up in policy : that is , it 's expected that an administrator should do more-or-less what the public want , ignoring for the moment how that administrator is chosen . 
  given that , is it valuable to force people to bind their career to a particular set of policies and boot them out if the public desires change ? 
  a minor nitpick : i do n't think [ that 's * quite * right ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/north_atlantic_treaty ) :  the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all i believe ( do n't quote me on this ; not sure ) that this would also cover overseas nato member territory in either region . 
  that would include , for example , [ gibraltar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar ) for the uk , [ saint pierre and miquelon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_pierre_and_miquelon ) for france , and [ hans island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_island ) for ... well , probably both canada and denmark . 
   ~ ~ nato ~ ~ us is based around force projection and protecting oversea 's assets to the extent that the us is a significant chunk of nato , yes , and the uk and to a lesser extent france . 
  i 'd say that a substantial chunk of european nato members * do n't * place a lot of emphasis on force projection . 
  they have no overseas possessions , are n't currently particularly interested in waging war at great distance ( if they * were * , they could expect support from other members who do provide that logistics capability ) and it does n't make sense to dump what military resources they have into force projection . 
  do keep in mind that you 're exclusively-focusing on air power . 
  that 's important , but it 's also an area which is absolutely-vital for the us and of comparatively-much-less concern for either russia or european nato members if russia * were * trying to engage in a limited conventional war in eastern europe of the sort that the polish users here are raising , where russia would be trying to split nato . 
  so if you just look at air logistics capability it might not be the most-interesting picture . 
  same deal for naval power . 
   the problem with using nuclear weapons as hostages , though , is that they also shorten russia 's response time if russia thinks that it is under nuclear attack , which places a lot of pressure on russia to act immediately , without spending time verifying what 's going on , if it thinks that they might be used . 
  that has a lot of risk to it . 
  in fact , assuming that the us is not interested in performing a nuclear first strike , arguably it would be in us interests to , if there were a technical way to guarantee russia that us ballistic missile submarines were a substantial distance from them * without * actually giving a precise location , to provide that guarantee , since it would ensure that russia would n't feel as if russia has to respond immediately in the event of thinking that it might actively be the victim of a first strike .

  yup , but as the article i linked to points out , it 's politically-awkward in the us to remove israel from the `` inner circle '' of military allies , even if arguably israel has crossed the line on us military technology and probably * should * be removed . 
  the only politically-viable way to exclude israel is to not to export to * anyone * . 
  i 'm sure that the defense contractors involved were upset over the restrictions as well . 
  he 's a good-russia , bad-us guy . 
  i 'd also point out that in the same vein , poland and the baltics are n't particularly concerned about , say , russia [ turning out a new tank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-14_armata ) . 
  this is n't a meaningful threat to nato . 
  what * is * extremely-concerning to poland and the baltics is [ polls like these ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/nato-publics-blame-russia-for-ukrainian-crisis-but-reluctant-to-provide-military-aid/ ) . 
  to be fair , it 's not clear to me that those polled * understand * the military obligations in place , but when you look at that chart and see that the us public is the most-willing-to-defend other nato members and that still over a third of the public in that country would not want to take military action , thereby violating nato military commitments , that is extremely-concerning to poland and the baltics -- and , i think , probably rightfully so . 
  germany is almost the mirror image of the us , where most germans would like to take no military action , and that 's even more alarming from the standpoint of poland and friends . 
  now , in practice , i suspect that attitudes would change drastically based on propaganda , media coverage , and the position of leaders , but poland is probably right to consider this the most-realistic concern -- the question is whether russia could view these polls as negating nato as a factor in the event of an invasion , and whether russia might try winning a propaganda war . 
  nato exercises , which have been ramped up , do n't * hurt * ( and to the extent that they get media coverage , they might produce a sense of solidarity ) , but they do n't provide the sort of guarantees that poland and the baltics would really like to see , which would be polls showing overwhelming support from nato publics willing to fight russia if poland or the baltics were attacked . 
  i 'm dubious that it provides all that much bang-for-the-buck , but afraid that [ israel screwing the us over on military technology in the past by sending it to china ] ( http://defensetech.org/2013/12/24/report-israel-passes-u-s-military-technology-to-china/ ) has [ led to the us not exporting the f-22 at all ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/imagine-f-22-raptors-for-export/ ) . 
   i am not so sure permanent military base is going to increase the safety of the region tbh . 
  the goal from poland presumably is n't to make nato more militarily-powerful . 
  it 's to place something in poland that nato would consider unacceptably-damaging to lose , so that other countries would n't just ignore an attack on poland . 
  poland 's concern is another `` france and the uk promise to attack into germany if poland is attacked but just make a token gesture instead '' a la world war ii and they want guarantees that that wo n't happen .
