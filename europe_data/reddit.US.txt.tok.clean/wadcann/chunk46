  poland and the baltic nations are n't worried about nato 's ability to win a conventional war , but about nato 's commitment to win that war . 
  same reason for interest in these countries in putting us nuclear weapons there : the idea is that the us would never accept having those nuclear weapons be captured in a war , so would act to protect them . 
  the problem with using nuclear weapons as hostages , though , is that they also shorten russia 's response time if russia thinks that it is under nuclear attack , which places a lot of pressure on russia to act * immediately * , without spending time verifying what 's going on , if it thinks that they might be used . 
  that has a lot of risk to it . 
  nato and the ussr agreed to , in the environment at the time it was created , not permanently station a lot of military right up at the border : this was to ensure that the other side was n't concerned about being rushed . 
  the thing is that having enough military force present that other nations would consider it unacceptable losses makes for a useful polish `` hostage '' : a multinational force there would mean that an attack on poland runs into immediate conflict with many other countries , and thus hopefully prevents that attack from ever occurring . 
  so poland ( and the baltics ) has an interest in encouraging nato to interpret the document ( and there 's some argument for doing so ) in such a way that substantial permanent troops * can * be stationed there : this gives them their hostage against attack . 
  the problem is that again , massing soldiers on russia 's border means that russia faces risk of having soldiers rush into russia quickly and so russia will probably put its own soldiers on the other side of the border . 
  that puts both sides closer to conflict . 
  the ideal would be to provide poland and the baltics with their `` hostage '' that convincingly guarantees russia that an attack on poland or the baltics would result in nato military action , but without threatening russia . 
  i 'm enthusiastic about the establishment of a '' [ tripwire ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/trip+wire ) '' force -- a small force that would n't be a serious threat to russia being placed there . 
  the problem is that from the standpoint of poland and the baltics , these might be viewed as acceptable losses , and ignored and their country simply sacrificed in the result of war : it might be `` too small '' . 
  another possibility would be the eu placing non-military infrastructure of some sort that it would consider unacceptable to lose in poland . 
  say , gobs of power generation capacity , or something like that . 
  this also has the nice perk that it does n't militarily-threaten russia . 
  one user here was saying that they wanted us celebrities stuck on the border to ensure that the us would act . 
  i 've yet to see something that would perfectly fill the role . 
  you do n't have to be coming from a war zone to ( potentially legitimately ) claim asylum . 
  russia is n't at war , but let 's say that some critical-of-the-leadership journalist shows up in the uk and says `` putin is planning to kill me for an article that i wrote '' -- it 's a pretty good bet that a claim like that would be taken seriously . 
  i 'm not saying that 's what 's happening here , but if you * are * trying to honor the terms of the 1951 refugee convention , you do n't have grounds to automatically turn someone away just because their country is not at war . 
  the criteria for being a legitimate refugee is simply :  `` a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . .

   is wikipedia even usefull at uni level education aside from book sources ? 
  i would have deeply regretted not having it available for all sorts of topics , ignoring the question of school entirely . 
  it 's a great source of overview information . 
  yeah , i understand that sweden was an influence in the development of the us 's own system . 
  i 'm not saying that you 're wrong , just adding detail . 
  iraq was really us , to be frank . 
   guess which country did not take part in the shitty `` liberation '' of libya ? 
  if you want to flag the us as being the driving force behind iraq , that 's completely legitimate ( and the uk was just along for the ride there ) but my understanding is that libya was primarily-driven by french-uk concerns where the us just got hauled in . 
  maybe , rather than establishing that it 's a non-issue for russia to ban wikipedia , it should be seen as an issue for the uk to ban imgur . 
  just saying ... 
   but the idea to kill them all did n't gain traction until ww2 itself . 
  [ wikipedia : madagascar plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) . 
  they still did have the aim of confiscating jewish property , though . 
  no idea . 
  also , i 'd point out that nazi eugenicists ' complaints with specific groups did n't line up with the groups that us eugenicists had beefs with ( and that , to be fair , various european nations , including people from scandinavia , also helped generate us views of the time -- eugenics did n't simply spring up in the us either ) . 
  just pointing out that , before the us in 1880-1930 is painted as some sort of paragon of idealized highly-accepting immigration views that europe today could perhaps stretch and maybe manage to live up to ... people in favor of using it as a justification for pro-immigration policy may want to make sure that they are n't using a whitewashed portrait of reality . 
  in many ways , people in the us then were quite unhappy with and unaccepting-of immigration by present standards . 
  that 's a century ago now , and i 'm not saying that the us was especially , uniquely opposed to immigration for the time . 
  also , the us today is a rather-different place , and the policies i listed were almost all reversed in the 1940s . 
  just that it probably makes sense to be aware that even opposed-to-immigration groups in europe today are typically proposing policies that are , in many respects , rather less-opposed to immigrants than the policies mainstream in the us at the time . 
  mmmhmm . 
  and some of those policies [ had substantial world repercussions when the ideas associated with them traveled over to germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugenics_in_the_united_states ) :  eugenics , the social movement claiming to improve the genetic features of human populations through selective breeding and sterilization , [ 1 ] based on the idea that it is possible to distinguish between superior and inferior elements of society , [ 2 ] played a significant role in the history and culture of the united states prior to its involvement in world war ii . 
  [ 3 ]   eugenics was practised in the united states many years before eugenics programs in nazi germany [ 4 ] and u.s. programs provided much of the inspiration for the latter . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] stefan k\u00fchl has documented the consensus between nazi race policies and those of eugenicists in other countries , including the united states , and points out that eugenicists understood nazi policies and measures as the realization of their goals and demands . 
  [ 5 ]   during the progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th century , eugenics was considered [ by whom ? ], 
  a method of preserving and improving the dominant groups in the population ; it is now generally associated with racist and nativist elements [ citation needed ] ( as the movement was to some extent a reaction to a change in emigration from europe ) rather than scientific genetics . 
  some adaptation and a holocaust later , and the rest is history ... 
  huh , had n't followed up on the sentencing . 
   castro pled guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape , kidnapping , and aggravated murder as part of a plea bargain . 
  he was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole plus 1,000 years .

  [ unhcr 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) : article 7 :  1 . 
  except where this convention contains more favourable provisions , a contracting state shall accord to refugees the same treatment as is accorded to aliens generally . 
  article 8 :  with regard to exceptional measures which may be taken against the person , property or interests of nationals of a foreign state , the contracting states shall not apply such measures to a refugee who is formally a national of the said state solely on account of such nationality . 
  article 17 :  1 . 
  the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the most favourable treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign country in the same circumstances , as regards the right to engage in wage-earning employment . 
  article 18 :  the contracting states shall accord to a refugee lawfully in their territory treatment as favourable as possible and , in any event , not less favourable than that accorded to aliens generally in the same circumstances , as regards the right to engage on his own account in agriculture , industry , handicrafts and commerce and to establish commercial and industrial companies . 
  article 24 :  the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment as is accorded to nationals in respect of the following matters ;   ( a ) in so far as such matters are governed by laws or regulations or are subject to the control of administrative authorities : remuneration , including family allowances where these form part of remuneration , hours of work , overtime arrangements , holidays with pay , restrictions on home work , minimum age of employment , apprenticeship and training , women 's work and the work of young persons , and the enjoyment of the benefits of collective bargaining ;   ( b ) social security ( legal provisions in respect of employment injury , occupational diseases , maternity , sickness , disability , old age , death , unemployment , family responsibilities and any other contingency which , according to national laws or regulations , is covered by a social security scheme ) granted , i * do n't * think that this actually applies to people whose status is simply under review , but rather to people who have been granted refugee status . 
  and to be fair , that was more about ensuring westward settlement to ensure solid us claims on it . 
  if you think of what the russians did ( admittedly in a much-more-coercive way ) with dumping people out in siberia to establish firm russian claims and ward off the chinese , it 's kind of along those lines . 
  the us just used market-based incentives as a carrot rather than making use of a state-based stick to ensure that people moved out there . 
  oh , come on .

  i * know * that was mentioned here . 
  the european commissioner for migration , home affairs and citizenship is a greek politician , and that would probably solve the issue from greece 's position . 
  i still think that he 'd do better to push for funds than quotas . 
  i do n't think that that 's actually the primary reason for the article focus . 
  i check new posts , and people are n't really submitting a lot else . 
  part of this is on you folks who want to see other things -- you need to submit articles about other interesting topics . 
  i * do * agree with some of the voting , but i also think that it 's gotten way , way better . 
  it was really bad at the beginning , where every time i posted something anti-immigration , i got voted way up ( as far as i could tell , more-or-less regardless of the depth of the comment ) and pro-immigration , way down ... and every post from the mods was being buried at -30 . 
  now it 's more that just that some unimpressive anti-immigration posts get more votes than i 'd probably give them ... but honestly , i have n't been very impressed at all with most pro-immigration posts either . 
  there are some decent ones in there on both sides .

  which obviously had no real chance of becoming real policy . 
   ignorant atempt surely the same point could be made just as well without the personal attack ? 
  no , i 'm sure that it happens there too , but it was a shift in us policy limiting people taking long-term unemployment that caused the move into disability in the us . 
  it 's not clear to me how the various policies of european countries compare . 
  i 'm not saying ignore disability in europe , but rather that perhaps it would be better to combine disability and unemployment for relative comparisons .
