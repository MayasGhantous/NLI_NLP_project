  i guess it 'd be fair to use that as an argument for `` how 's it feel to be on the other side of the coin '' , but perhaps is n't the best basis for arguing `` immigration should be freely allowed because the us did '' .

  that is true , but to be fair , in the 1970s [ there was real concern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_cooling#concern_in_the_1960s_and_1970s ) about human-induced global cooling . 
   it may be viable to use vertical farming , at which point the sky 's the limit really . 
  amount of sunlight is the limit . 
  build a block of 50-story-high vertical farms , and you have 49 stories in shadow . 
  ah , fair enough !,

  sex resulting in kids is expensive . 
  [ it 's been done already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uruguay ) . 
   uruguay remained largely uninhabited until the establishment of colonia del sacramento , one of the oldest european settlements in the country , by the portuguese in 1680 . 
  montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the spanish in the early 18th century , signifying the competing claims over the region . 
  uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828 , following a four-way struggle between spain , portugal , argentina and brazil . 
  it remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century , with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics until the late 20th century . 
  that 's a view [ limited in scope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virgin_cleansing_myth ) :  a survey by the university of south africa ( unisa ) in south africa found that ** 18 percent ** of laborers thought that having sex with a virgin cures hiv/aids . 
  an earlier study in 1999 by sexual health educators in gauteng reported that 32 percent of the survey participants believed the myth . 
  [ 5 ] that may be a problem for hiv prevention , but not in population control . 
  in an environment where you did n't have to put as much time and as many resources into raising a kid , having children was n't as big of a deal , and many societies did have large families . 
  the us was heavily agricultural 100 years ago , and also had large families . 
  nigeria , yes -- it [ currently has 182m people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nigeria ) . 
  but [ india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/india ) ? 
  india has 1,276 m people , and it 's only increasing by 394m . 
  that 's a large increase , but it is n't more-than-doubling . 
  what if the person who provided him with the weapons was a member of a terrorist organization that has publicly stated that its goal is to kill westerners ? 
  in that case , it would presumably be more-damning in terms of intent ( and would be totally incompatible with the rest of his ` robbery ' story ) to provide the information about where he actually got the weapons than to have an implausible story , at least for whatever standard of proof france has ( which i assume , given the severity of the charges , is high ) . 
  finding a boxcutter has to be more-plausible than an ak-47 . 
  also , honestly , guys , you should get the guy a non-crap lawyer . 
  if you did n't want a big family , the environment permits you to have a big family , and some have a genetic predilection to do so , you 'd be replaced over time by those with the gene to be predisposed to want a big family . 
  it does n't even need to be a predisposition to want a large family * per se * : you might be predisposed to be more religious , for example , and then since the religion of a parent is correlated with the religion of a child , you 'd expect things like catholicism ( or the more-limited but more-explicit [ quiverfull ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quiverfull ) ) to become more-common over time . 
   there 's plenty of educated people who argue that the current world population is unsustainable and harmful towards the long-term survivability of both the planet and of our species . 
  there were plenty of educated people who argued this in the past , and made testable predictions that did n't pan out -- [ this book ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_population_bomb ) is probably the most-famous of those . 
  it 's also possible that new technology will change things , whether via automation or making it less-expensive to provide the necessities of life .

  [ genghis khan a prolific lover , dna data implies ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0214_030214_genghis.html ) . 
  i think that a rich -  few children model might be a bit too-simple . 
  eh , hair grows out . 
  i would n't particularly want to live in one , but to be honest , i think that people over-rate how important your home 's architecture is for your life . 
  people living in [ sod houses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sod_house ) a century ago probably were n't miserable . 
  i also think that people over-value the type of home that they 're familiar with . 
  when i was in manhattan , everything seemed dirty and cramped and suffering from noise pollution . 
  i could n't imagine living there . 
  most housing in the us is substantially-larger per person , and because it is more suburban , quieter . 
  a german student working in the us with me commented on how all the housing in the us seemed flimsy , almost throwaway materials . 
  wood and drywall were apparently less-common in germany -- he associated `` proper housing '' with stone and brick and concrete . 
   i believe it 's right at 2.1 children or so . 
  i think that you 're thinking of a different number : ~ 2.1 is the replacement rate ( because some people naturally die before having children anyway ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sub-replacement_fertility#united_states  in developed countries sub-replacement fertility is any rate below approximately 2.1 children born per woman , but the threshold can be as high as 3.4 in some developing countries because of higher mortality rates . 
  [ 1 ] taken globally , the total fertility rate at replacement was 2.33 children per woman in 2003 . 
  [ 1 ] this can be `` translated '' as 2 children per woman to replace the parents , plus a `` third of a child '' to make up for the higher probability of boys being born , and early mortality prior to the end of their fertile life . 
  [ 2 ] [ snip ]  while much of the world has experienced declining fertility rates over the last twenty years , the total fertility rate in the united states has remained relatively stable . 
  [ 28 ] this is largely due to the high fertility rate among communities such as hispanics , but it is also because the fertility rate among non-hispanic whites in the us , after falling to about 1.6 in the 1970s and early 1980s , had increased and is now around 1.89 , or slightly below replacement level , rather than collapsing to the 1.3 -- 1.5 level common in europe . 
  it 's true that the us is n't as badly-off as europe is today , but it 's not maintaining its population internally ; it relies on immigration . 
  interesting , thanks for sharing . 
  this only increases my interest in having someone sum unemployment and disability across countries . 
  going a bit further south from mexico , i strongly suspect that this [ curious quirk of highway planning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dari%c3%a9n_gap ) has some political pressure ensuring that it remains . 
  that 's a dangerous road to walk down . 
  historically , the only way to deal with shipwrecks was to oblige all vessels to respond to a disaster . 
  i still believe that that is of value . 
  i 'd think that it would be much , much more viable to simply not permit people rescued in shipwrecks to claim asylum at that point , withdrawing from treaties if necessary . 
  it 's viable to not ferry people across the mediterranean without killing them to achieve this . 
  < thinks  is that the case ? 
  that is , is there hard data available showing that unemployment tends to make people more-enthusiastic about illegal immigration ? 
  i 'd actually kind of expect the opposite .

  `` ah , '' you might say , `` but wadcann ... that 's just a matter of distribution !,

  problem is , overpopulation and nearing the carrying capacity of land also tends to encourage political instability and war , and in turn , famine .

  everyone else on there is a third-world country with a high birthrate . 
  at least on this forum , i feel that austrians are more blunt than dutch users . 
  and it should happen for the market to function -- if supply is short , then increase prices , and that 's the mechanism that funds more supply .

  [ wikipedia : hydrogen cyanide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hydrogen_cyanide )  hcn is obtainable from fruits that have a pit , such as cherries , apricots , apples , and bitter almonds , from which almond oil and flavoring are made . 
  many of these pits contain small amounts of cyanohydrins such as mandelonitrile and amygdalin , which slowly release hydrogen cyanide . 
  [ 21 ] [ 22 ] one hundred grams of crushed apple seeds can yield about 70 mg of hcn . 
  [ 23 ] [ wikipedia : almond : culinary uses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almond#culinary_uses )  in italy , the bitter almonds from apricots are the base for amaretti [ 39 ] [ 40 ] ( almond macaroons ) , a common dessert . 
  traditionally , a low percentage of bitter almonds ( 10-20 % ) is added to the ingredients , which gives the cookies their bitter taste ( commercially , apricot kernels are used as a substitute for bitter almonds ) . 
  almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in torrone . 
  in apulia and sicily , pasta di mandorle ( almond paste ) is used to make small soft cakes , often decorated with jam , pistachio , or chocolate . 
  in sicily , almond milk is a popular refreshing beverage in summer . 
  in russia 's defense , almond macaroons * are * delicious . 
  i 'm sure that retention work has been done . 
  i 'm not an agricultural scientist , but my vague understanding is that the us ranks at or near the top of countries who have done work on arid-land agriculture work , since a lot of its agricultural land , even outside california , is semi-arid , [ unlike the wetter europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semi-arid_climate ) -- you * have * to minimize moisture loss anyway , for big chunks of the country . 
  lots of money and fertile ground , but without a lot of water means lots of work done trying to figure out how to grow things while using less water . 
  as you point out , desalination is pretty expensive . 
  it 'd be sufficient for individual drinking needs , without question , so it 's not as if individuals are going to go without . 
  i was reading about israeli work ( another arid-land agricultural environment ) , and my understanding is that israel has developed a functioning agricultural industry based on desalinated water : hard to make competitive , but by selling high-margin produce , ( and possibly with some degree of protectionist policy ; have n't looked into it ) it 's within the realm of viability . 
  i know that santa barbara , a city in southern california , built a desalination plant some decades back to have but then never used it beyond testing -- it simply was never worth the expense of operating if non-desalinated water could be obtained ( there was also some complex california water political finance stuff involved where santa barbara did n't want to commit to a minimum level of water purchases required to be guaranteed water , but wanted an emergency backstop if drought did happen and they could n't get water ) . 
  i 've seen news about that long-dormant plant [ being ordered to reactivate ] ( http://www.santabarbaraca.gov/gov/depts/pw/resources/system/sources/desalination.asp ) last month , so some degree of desalination will be happening . 
  that would be to address individual water needs , though -- it would n't do much for the existing farmers , who rely on inexpensive water being available .
