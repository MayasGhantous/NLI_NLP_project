  however , we 're substantially-warmer than we were 27,000 years ago , when [ the only places in europe that were n't tundra or colder were greece , italy , and spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:last_glacial_vegetation_map.png ) . 
  if humans vanished , human-driven global warming would stop , but not natural global warming . 
  not normally from silicon valley . 
  maybe if you 're hell-bent on having land with an artificially-produced waterfall or something like that that your municipality might prohibit . 
  southern california ( the desert that pulls water from silicon valley ) normally has much-more-onerous water restrictions . 
  the people who run into real pain over water availability are farmers , since they get absolutely boned if they run short ( if you spend years establishing almond groves and they do n't get any water for a year , they 're dead ) , and in practice in californian history , they 've been lower on the political totem poll than individual , residential water use when push comes to shove . 
  it has [ impacted some people in silicon valley that have large houses with that have historically had significant water use ] ( http://abc7news.com/news/water-restrictions-to-go-into-effect-for-california/759060/ ) :  they 're required to limit yard watering to twice a week and will not be allowed to water between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. those who do n't comply could face a fine . 
  `` it 's a $ 48 penalty on the billing cycle for customers who are using four times the amount of water than the average customer , '' ebmud spokesperson nelsy rodriguez said . 
  california could actually draw more water off oregon and other more-northerly water sources if it needed to do so , but it would be increasingly-expensive . 
  the big changing factors are mexican and central american immigration tremendously-increasing southern california 's population -- that was a big factor in the past , though it 's not generating further increase -- and ( in the long run ) farming practices that rely on use of aquifer water at much greater than recharge rates . 
  at some point , it wo n't be possible to draw more aquifer water , and there just wo n't be enough water for the existing farmers and the people . 
  yeah ... andrew huang ( the guy who did the hardware side of the xbox 1 's drm break ) [ did a writeup ] ( http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=157 ) on his thoughts on the situation , which i generally agree with . 
  just out of curiosity , if you do n't mind sharing , what about the h1-b program did you find in need of improvement ? 
  the bulk of users i 've seen here , when asked , do n't have a problem with legal , skilled immigration . 
  i have a hard time seeing how policy changes that attempt to deal with the current situation would impact regular immigration . 
  adding additional steps or documentation requirements would n't do anything to help with people who are just bypassing the system or making legal claims based on asylum claims . 
  i 'd imagine that the biggest risk from your standpoint would be groups that * do * have an issue with skilled immigration from india successfully politically-piggybacking the africa illegal immigration situation -- e.g. 
  white nationalists saying `` see , we were right all along -- this immigration stuff has got to end '' -- by selling themselves as the only realistic alternative to the * status quo * . 
  honestly , i wish my * own * country would expand h1-b skilled work visas and improve the path to citizenship . 
  i mean , countries do n't always get to enjoy an environment where highly-skilled people want to move to them and work there , and it seems like it would make a lot of sense to take advantage of that while it 's possible . 
  that 's not really what my understanding of `` sjw '' 's meaning is . 
  my understanding [ was that it referred to someone who publicly and noisily adopted social justice views that they may-or-may-not actually care about to get an image that they see as positive ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=social+justice+warrior ) . 
  spending someone else 's money to make changes that you would like is just a stock criticism of the left , not related to `` sjw '' . 
   which is something voters like . 
  well ... that 's kinda the driving mechanism behind representative democracy . 
  seems like bad soundproofing design -- i mean , you could just pull those carpets off . 
  you 'd want to have an outer soundproofing layer * beyond * the area that could be accessed . 
  if you subscribe to the `` any news is good news '' philosophy , maybe . 
  if you 're worried about people becoming intimidated , i think that jihadi john is pretty low on the threat scale compared to past threats . 
  it has the lowest unemployment on the seasonally-adjusted line chart shown . 
  the us 's unemployment rate ( which is usually significantly-lower than europe ) can be partly-explained by being artificially-depressed because of [ policies that cause people to fraudulently move off unemployment and onto long-term disability ] ( http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/ ) . 
  it might be more interesting to compare the sum of national unemployment and disability across countries than just unemployment . 
  by that standard , no national culture may exist , because it touches the whole nation . 
  i think that what you 're saying would be better put '' [ subcultures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subculture ) can be more-visible to a culture than the culture itself '' . 
  my problem is that it is the schengen area that benefits , rather than the eu . 
  when the uk and switzerland look at this , i expect that switzerland cares rather a lot about it , whereas the uk just thinks `` told you so -- i 'll stop them at the english channel '' . 
  in talking about having funding for border control come from the countries that benefit . 
  i 'm not advocating for just a convenient political associating that has money to be dropped in , but for an economic externality to be resolved -- the party that benefits does n't pay , the party that pays does n't benefit -- and in a case like that , you 've got incentives that does n't match up well with what you want to see . 
  that means that you 're liable to see half-hearted border control otherwise . 
   the event originated in 1992 in san francisco ; [ 1 ] by the end of 2003 , the event was being held in over 300 cities around the world . 
  [ 2 ] sorry , guys . 
  not one of our better exports . 
   right , but does greece have a pants culture ? 
  if most of the world went around without pants , yes , greece would have a pants culture . 
   august is when the kursk submarine suffered a catastrophic explosion , slowly suffocating 118 personnel at the bottom of the barents sea ; president vladimir putin did n't bat an eye telling larry king that `` it sank . '' i would n't bat an eye either . 
  it * did * sink , and that 's rather a more-tactful and less-emotionally-loaded way to put it than a sentence involving `` catastrophic '' and `` slowly suffocating '' . 
  it * could * be that the real rationales on each side do n't condense to soundbites very well . 
  given that stopping the transit is probably not in the interests of turkey ( they could unload refugees and the associated costs on europe ) but in the interests of greece and of europe , as with the uk and the calais situation , and thus it simply creates pressure on turkey to act out of the goodness of its heart , would it make sense for schengen area countries to assist turkey ? 
   ( with aid from the eu if necessary ) eu or schengen area ? 
  i take it that `` commieblock '' is equivalent to '' [ khrushchyovka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khrushchyovka ) '' ? 
   subs like / r/hiphopheads have managed to remain excellent communities that does n't look particularly good to me . 
  i mean , maybe it 's a cut above / r/funny , but it sure is n't better than / r/europe . 
  edit : actually , i was curious and looked ... i think that even / r/funny is better-off . 
  the current top `` hot '' article on / r/funny has [ discussion like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3i33vr/north_korea_lately/cucx04q ) . 
  that 's significantly-more-interesting , in my eyes , discussion than what 's on / r/hiphopheads . 
  honestly , i 'd actually call this thread more interesting ( if totally lacking in new content ) than the typical critical-of-immigration ones , which often have someone posting a news article and then a lot of people pretending to be shocked about it . 
  it gets old . 
  this brings up the point that there clearly * were * cases in history , comparable or not , where immigration did n't work out very well . 
   no-one talks to him . 
  i have the same issue , and i 'm from the uk . 
   train immams definitely not much separation of church and state there . 
  those are not tanks . 
  those are surplus armored personnel carriers . 
  [ this is what a modern-day tank looks like ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:leopard_2_a5_der_bundeswehr.jpg ) . 
  it is a big , extremely heavy block of armor , typically on the order of 60 tons . 
  it has a turret with a big gun on the thing . 
  it has treads . 
  its job is to shoot the big gun at things . 
  [ wikipedia : main battle tank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_battle_tank ) . 
  the things that you are showing pictures of are , aside from what appears to be some mock-ups , armored personnel carriers . 
  these are big armored busses for carrying people from point a to point b safely . 
  the us police ones there do n't have a big gun . 
  they almost all have wheels . 
  made-for-police-use armored personnel carriers look [ something like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenco_bearcat ) . 
  surplus military ones might have originally had some form of armament , but they wo n't when police use them . 
  they exist so that if police come into a place where shots are being fired , they do n't get shot . 
  without that armor , the only defense they have is to shoot first . 
  remember the disaster in mogadishu , * black hawk down * ? 
  a lot of unarmored vehicles with armed people starting to panic in a city . 
  does not work out well . 
  i bet that there is more human smuggling on boats across the english channel than via the channel tunnel . 
  while i agree on the comment voting being disappointing , frankly -- if you open with a partisan comment , it 's hard to complain about partisan voting . 
  technically we have n't declared war since world war ii . 
  politically-uncomfortable . 
  we just have `` policing actions '' and the like . 
  however , we have had a lot of armed conflicts since then , and if you look at [ wikipedia : list of wars involving the united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_the_united_states ) and [ wikipedia : list of countries with mcdonald 's restaurants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_with_mcdonald%27s_restaurants ) , which includes the date of initial franchise : * war against isil : iraq has had a mcdonalds since 2006 and has been the target of airstrikes . 
  * war in pakistan : okay , that 's a tough one , because really the government and the us are fighting against groups , but pakistan has had a mcdonalds since 1998 . 
  * kosovo war : yugoslavia has had mcdonalds since 1988 . 
  * invasion of panama : panama has had mcdonalds since 1971 . 
  i mean , those pages are both pretty long . 
  hard to avoid countries not showing up on both . 
  well ... honestly , that 's part of the point . 
  if you 're going to have a disaster , might-as-well have it under controlled circumstances . 
  in that case , yeah , some of the things were n't directly-relevant to the operation itself , but the people deciding on the training mission knew that there 's risk and feel that the cost is worth it . 
  if the live-fire error had occurred on d-day itself ( and that certainly * could * have happened ) , the cost could have been far , far higher . 
  sure , would have been great to never have errors made , but they were n't malicious , and any time people are coming up with new procedures involving gobs of explosives and running around near people who are trying to kill them , the cost can be high . 
  yeah ... do n't get me wrong . 
  finland in the winter war is something that i 'd rank among the most-lopsided performances in the recorded history of war . 
  it was really something . 
  some of it was russia really screwing up , and some of it was finland doing really well and some of it was circumstances and some of it was luck and some of it was diplomatic footwork that all came together .
