  but estonians beating themselves up because they did n't try to not just pull another miracle off under significantly-less-favorable circumstances just does n't make sense . 
  estonia might have done better from a diplomatic standpoint , say , but i 'd have a hard time realistically blaming estonia militarily . 
  also , the estonian military , even after estonia had fallen , * did * manage to spy on the soviet military from behind-the-lines and feed finland information about incoming attacks , and that might have been enough to have turned the oh-so-close tide in finland . 
   also , the rich could avoid being drafted by paying a sum of money . 
  lot of wars like that . 
  the american civil war was the same way in the north . 
   also , i 've been to san marino and it seemed like living in san marino would be the same like living in hollywood . 
  it 's simply a neighborhood .

  given the information available , it probably was n't such a crazy call for russia . 
  if i were going to pick an embarrassing military escapade for russia , i 'd go with either the [ russo-japanese war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-japanese_war ) 's [ dogger bank incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogger_bank_incident ) or world war i 's [ battle of tannenberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_tannenberg ) . 
  finland would have been in a pretty bad way if the road system in finland at the time had n't been so limited , the land not so far north ( and so cold ) , and there was n't a single critical bottleneck to fortify , though . 
  my understanding was that you were pretty boned there , anyway . 
  the issue was more that singapore surrendered so quickly than that they surrendered : the japanese had air supremacy , so it was just a matter of time .

  the iraq/wmd thing was n't great , but i think that it 's more recency making that stand out .

   i work as a automation engineer in germany automation has happened since the inclined plane , lever , wheel , and so forth were invented , and yet the demand for labor did not vanish and produce structural unemployment . 
   ... if they do n't want to fit in to european culture ... because they objected to something that they saw as blasphemous ? 
  do they not fit in ? 
  [ countries in europe with laws against blasphemy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law ) : * austria * denmark * finland * france * germany * greece * iceland * ireland * italy * turkey the netherlands had a law against blasphemy on the books up until early last year , so it looks like you had a narrow escape ( `` jesus if they do n't want to fit in ... '' ) ;-), 
  first , i think that the reason that people are in refugee camps because they do n't have passports . 
  second , / u/pengipeng did n't say that they were n't german , but that they would n't be valuable members of german society . 
  i personally do n't think that , say , a mugger is a valuable member of a society , regardless of where he was born , for example . 
   the spies are starting to forget who is spying on who and why . 
  no , i just think that spying is less ideological these days . 
  the question is just who is willing to pay for the information ... 
  hmm . 
  it would depend a lot on what the environment is where it would be used , and its implementation . 
  in the present environment , i 'd prefer the status quo . 
  part of the problem , i think , is that people advocating for `` basic income '' are often advocating for rather different things , so it 's difficult to describe what you 're talking about . 
  current transfer-money-to-some-chunk-of-society systems tend to be advantageous to the elderly , so one possibility would be a system that is more-disadvantageous to them . 
  some people on the left would like to see an increase in wealth redistribution , and would like to see it structured such that it produces this effect . 
  in their view , the interesting characteristic of income would be that it would give the poor more money on net . 
  from their standpoint , this is a way of melding socialism and capitalism -- they want to retain the benefits of capitalism in terms of organization , but scoop off more of the wealth generated . 
  i 'm not particularly enthused about more wealth redistribution , though i do think that if one * wanted * to do so , i 'd favor doing so via straight cash payments of this sort . 
  some people on the right ( there are right-libertarians along these lines ) are interested in the prospect of eliminating rent-seeking or unnecessary government distortions in the market . 
  this would be revenue-neutral , not redistributing society 's wealth -- a decrease in a welfare service would be matched by an equivalent increase in income ; an increase in taxation matched by an increase in basic income . 
  one does n't have to worry about agribusiness x getting * their * produce listed on the approved-for-food-stamps list if the beneficiary can buy whatever they want . 
  i guess that in some cases , it might make sense to replace existing welfare systems . 
  i 'm not yet convinced that it would n't exacerbate problems with gambling or drug addictions to make it easier and cheaper to get welfare payments in cash , though . 
  one of the things that i have heard basic income be described as potentially addressing would be a permanent structural unemployment . 
  some people see this as something likely to come up in the future as technology changes . 
  that might be a way to go about it ( and certainly i see it as preferable to creating busy-work ) , but people have also proposed imminent permanent structural unemployment [ for a long time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luddite ) , and my take is that this is an easy miscall to make that has yet to pan out . 
  if it happens , it happens , and then i 'd probably take it more-seriously . 
  i 'd probably be more-interested in what could be done to re-skill society . 
  summary : to me , it looks something like a solution in search of a problem . 
  it describes a class of approaches with one name that 's vague enough that many groups can fit their own favored policy changes under its aegis . 
  < goes looking  all right , i thought that they did a bigger reduction than the us ; guess i 'm wrong .

  [ estimated 2015 nuclear weapon stockpiles ] ( http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/nuclearweaponswhohaswhat ) | country | warhead count | | - | - | | russia | 7,700 | | us | 7,100 | | france | 300 | | china | 250 | | uk | 225 | | pakistan | 110 | | india | 100 | | israel | 80 | | north korea | 10 | also , as you point out , yield on some of these is different , different countries have different delivery systems ( though russia 's no slouch there ) , and only some of these have submarines to protect the launchers ( us , russia , france , uk , china ) . 
  last i looked , they had slightly-fewer warheads , but i suppose that they might have more total mass .

  alexander graham bell was a scottish-canadian ( though he had moved to the us before inventing the lightbulb ) . 
  i do n't think that basic income is a good model , and i would n't support switching to it in the us . 
  however , i am quite interested in seeing someone do the experiment and how it works out , in the same sense that i think that socialism needed to be tried out . 
  it 's not impossible that i 'm wrong , and the only real way to find out is for someone to take the plunge . 
  yes . 
  we used to have people who claimed that the germans had some sort of character flaws to cause the 1940s too .

  same goes for russians . 
   litterally more than 30 countries invaded the poorest country on earth to look for one guy , who was n't even there . 
  that 's not really an accurate summation . 
  it was `` you have camps , are training people to do this , and refuse to turn the guy behind this over '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if someone ran a program that did something similar in the netherlands , the netherlands would be pretty irked with regimes that might protect and support the perpetrators . 
  i would just like to give ourselves in the us a pat on the back for including per-capita numbers instead of just the usual `` us big ! '',

  first-rate idea , fellow producer-of-coal !, 
   across russia , the crisis has prompted a collapse in consumption . 
  international airline travel has fallen almost a fifth since last year , and car sales are down 36 percent in the first half of this year . 
  ehhhh ... okay , but how much of that was a fall from an artificially-inflated level of consumption due to trying to get out of the ruble ? 
  i 'll certainly believe that consumption is down , but vehicles in particular are things where purchases can be accelerated or deferred , and the author chose a very small window of time . 
  heck , i bet that there 's significant fluctuation within a year . 
  how about `` down from levels four years ago '' , or something like that ? 
   russia will become a mix between zimbabwe and argentina . 
  and be unable to keep unruly provinces . 
  taking parts of ukraina may cost them more than money ; it may cost them land . 
  i 'd still be twitchy about a country without outside allies , which has been running gobs of hostility-inducing propaganda , with the second-largest nuclear arsenal in the world , and with a great deal of money abruptly drained from other areas of the government and massively dumped into military spending . 
  yeah , maybe everything will work out smoothly , but ...

   to give european e-commerce startups a boost , the european commission has proposed a plan to update and unify commercial regulations across the e.u. , so that a startup in one of its member nations can more easily operate in all of europe . 
  that sounds vaguely like a good idea , at least in the abstract , though i 'm not sure how specific it is to high tech .
