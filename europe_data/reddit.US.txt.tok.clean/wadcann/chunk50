  months later , the e.u. 
  proposed even stricter rules that , among other changes , would require companies to delete users ' data upon request . 
  ( european startups would be exempt from many of these laws . ), 
  privacy regulation may or may not be a good thing , but i 'm dubious that it 's a good idea to tie it to attempts to generate more startups . 
  i 'd think that it would make a lot more sense to primarily attempt to serve the interests of consumers here , rather than to establish barriers to competition . 
   e.u. 
  regulators are probing the tax arrangements of starbucks , apple , and amazon to determine whether the companies ' low-tax deals in some e.u. 
  nations are legal . 
  seems reasonable . 
   it wants to unify copyright laws across its 28 member nations to spur more digital content businesses ( currently only powerhouses like netflix can afford separate rights in every territory ) sounds reasonable , albeit one that determines a lot of money moving around , and thus probably not a process that is going to happen overnight . 
   we 're generations if not centuries removed from developing a `` european '' identity you 've got a flag ( gold stars on a blue background ) . 
  you 've got a symbol animal ( [ a bull ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:european_union_residence_permit_emblem.svg ) ) . 
  you 've got a [ situation room ] ( http://www.eeas.europa.eu/crisis-response/images/eu_situation_room_2013.jpg ) , albeit one with way less cool decor than [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_house_situation_room ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabinet_office_briefing_room ) basement `` watch the world end '' room , but still , workable . 
  estonia is a member of the eu . 
  last i looked , the eu had a larger economy than the us and a larger population . 
   he was absolutely a spy . 
  he was a senior official at our internal security service . 
  he was involved with counter-intelligence ( catching russian spies in estonia ) ... 
  in the us , the fbi handles domestic , civilian counterintelligence . 
  members of the fbi would n't be described as `` spies '' . 
  i do not know whether this is a standard convention , and really , it 's quibbling over a name , nothing of great interest , but ... 
  nope , was not aware of that . 
  i wonder what they call the border in north korea ? 
   maybe europian countries should start to play dirty with russia as well . 
  i disagree ; i think that that 's frustration talking . 
  first , remember that this is based on speculation . 
  right now , there is plausible reason to believe that the guy was indeed kidnapped from estonia , but it is far from certain . 
  i 'd be skeptical of setting national policy based on this . 
  in the past , countries have done things based on their current view of the situation , which was n't always correct . 
  the united states might have still kicked off the vietnam war , but the grounds on which the us actually did so turned out to have [ been incorrect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_of_tonkin_incident ) . 
  it 's hard to take back a misunderstanding after the fact . 
  russia has done many very unpleasant things to estonia and other countries in the past . 
  this is a very , very small thing compared to those other things , in the grand scheme of things . 
  even if the abduction was from estonia , it is quite plausible to me that russia believes , based on the evidence * it * had ( maybe people trying to cover their own asses and lying upstream about it ) , that russia was acting within their own borders . 
  second , what 's your * overall * goal ? 
  i 'd imagine that you 'd like to have russia not abducting people from estonia and other border countries . 
  going out and grabbing someone from russia is not at all the best way to ensure that this does n't happen in the future ; in fact , it is very likely to ensure that this * does * happen . 
  it 's doubtful that russia will back down after that ; it will probably * increase * frequency of what estonia does not want to have happen . 
  russia has , in the past , occasionally broken the `` rules '' that the us and the uk and some other countries observe on russian soil -- the cia and mi6 do not assassinate people on russian soil ( like snowden ) , though they certainly have the ability to do so . 
  russia has executed and attempted to assassinate defectors ( like [ alexander litvinenko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko ) and [ boris korczak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_korczak#assassination_attempt ) ) on us , uk , and other foreign soil . 
  [ this cia analysis ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol19no3/html/v19i3a01p_0001.htm ) dating to the 1960s was that russia has been willing to make use of kidnapping and assassination on western soil under extreme conditions . 
  if the us knew that this was a possibility since the 1960s , but chose not to make use of the same tactics , does it not make sense to consider whether the leadership of those countries had good reason to avoid responding in such a way ? 
  third , what 's your goal with respect to eston kohver as an individual ? 
  i 'd imagine that you want him returned to estonia in less than fifteen years . 
  are there better ways to accomplish this ? 
  would it be possible for the eu to swap for someone they hold that russia would like to have , even if you do n't feel that you * should * need to do this ? 
  remember that a great many people have died and suffered imprisonment or been maimed in wars and for intelligence agencies over the years , far more than one lone intelligence officer . 
  injustice and tragedy is not something that has never been seen by countries before . 
  no doubt russia swallowed many things that it felt was unfair and unreasonable . 
  i have no doubt that there are officers in the us who , in the [ hainan island incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hainan_island_incident ) , would have liked to have sent in paratroopers , destroyed the captured plane , extracted the crew by force from the chinese base , and withdrawn via aircraft . 
  that almost certainly would have wound up killing a number of people and producing a conflict between china and the us . 
  the result of doing so just would n't have made sense . 
  russia chose to adopt a dubious interpretation of mh17 and to not compensate the families in question . 
  the netherlands did n't decide to go blow up a russian airliner in response . 
  the question now is how does estonia best move forward ? 
  what best resolves the situation ? 
  how can kohver 's release be effected ? 
  fourth , keep the actual change in perspective . 
  kohver has been in jail for a while . 
  he is going back to jail . 
  no surprise has happened . 
  the only thing that has happened is that the russian judicial system has made a statement that it does not view russian law as justifying his release . 
  it was , frankly , probably a bit doubtful that it * would * have done so . 
  he will not be executed tomorrow . 
  nothing has changed but a formal legal statement being placed on paper , a bit more information added to the mix . 
  fifth , thus far , there 's no real reason to believe that this is a * trend * or an intentional policy . 
  russia has not abruptly started to lug people * en masse * across the russian border . 
  adopting doing so as a formal policy of estonia is not a proportionate response to russia potentially having done so once and probably on a local level rather than via russian national leadership having made a decision of national policy . 
  sixth , remember that it is not estonia in a position of weakness . 
  russia is in a position of weakness , and the eu in a position of strength . 
  it is russia that is isolated , and russia who faces long-term , serious economic problems . 
  estonia does not need to panic . 
  there are levers that the eu can pull that will put russia in a great deal of pain . 
  there 's no need to resort to dirty tricks . 
  a kidnapping/dirty tricks war is not an area which is especially favorable to the eu . 
  the eu has and nato have conventional military superiority . 
  the eu has overwhelming economic superiority . 
  the eu enjoys superiority in a great many fields . 
  why start a fight on a battlefield in which the eu does n't enjoy those positions of strength ? 
  seventh , discouraging a precedent of russian kidnappings is a separate goal from achieving kohver 's release , and there are perhaps different `` aggressive '' responses that would be more effective to accomplish this . 
  my strong suspicion is that even if the goal is to make a `` strong '' response , a counter-kidnapping is not the best approach . 
  there are times when countries have made shows of force . 
  after the korean dmz [ ax murder incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axe_murder_incident ) , the us was concerned that north korea might feel that it was just fine to go off murdering its border officers intentionally . 
  it did not in turn murder a korean officer : this was not at all a path that it wanted to start walking down . 
  it made a show of overwhelming force to make it clear that it was capable and willing to dramatically escalate the situation if this recurred and became accepted as national policy on the other side . 
  if this was a good idea then ( and perhaps it was n't !, 
  ) , i would suggest that if a `` strong response '' is desired , something like this would make a lot more sense : it alone does not need to provoke a response , but it makes clear that another such incident would have very costly consequences , and may make russian leadership send down a message to ensure that its agents do not violate the rules . 
  on the other hand , a kidnapping of a russian intelligence officer on russian soil seems much-more-likely to lead to an undesired response and russia being unwilling to then say `` make sure that you do n't nab people on the wrong side of the border '' to its people . 
  in sum : i 'd say try to build the world that you want to live in . 
  if you want to avoid assassinations and kidnappings between russia and the eu , my view is that intentionally kidnapping russians from russia is a good way to ensure that that continues , not a good way to discourage it . 
  if you want kohver released , kidnapping a russian officer very likely will not accomplish that . 
  how does the eu best get from where it is now to where it wants to be ? 
  thats an anecdote rather than a overall statistic . 
  not a lot of useful data there . 
  i 'm getting mixed claims about the possibility of absorbing it through the skin here : * [ not possible , just a danish myth ] ( https://thechronicleflask.wordpress.com/tag/absorption-through-skin/ ) * [ yes , confirmed via probe ] ( http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=431520 ) ( albeit in unknown quantity ) * [ only through the genitals ] ( http://www.thenakedscientists.com/html/questions/question/2252/ ) that seems to pretty much run the gamut . 
  nah , they 're just including male data and did n't label it as such . 
  russia has a big gender disparity . 
  ( also looks like the data is from a few years back . ), 
   in 2004 , an unidentified taiwanese woman died of alcohol intoxication after immersion for twelve hours in a bathtub filled with 40 % ethanol . 
  her blood alcohol content was 1.35 % .
