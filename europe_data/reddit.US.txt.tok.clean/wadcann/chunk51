  or in english : `` lion-eating poet in the stone den '' in a stone den was a poet with the family name shi , who was a lion addict , and had resolved to eat ten lions . 
  he often went to the market to look for lions . 
  at ten o'clock , ten lions had just arrived at the market . 
  at that time , shi had just arrived at the market . 
  he saw those ten lions , and using his trusty arrows , caused the ten lions to die . 
  he brought the corpses of the ten lions to the stone den . 
  the stone den was damp . 
  he asked his servants to wipe it . 
  after the stone den was wiped , he tried to eat those ten lions . 
  when he ate , he realized that these ten lions were in fact ten stone lion corpses . 
  try to explain this matter . 
  yeah , but that 's also a soldier ( by the way , sorry about that ) . 
  if you 're a diplomat , even if you 're also a spy or whatever else you 're up to , supposedly some of your job is to understand and interact with other cultures . 
  this guy , whose job description is to interoperate between cultures , successfully managed to turn himself into an internationally-known incident . 
   the landmass is hardly going to move due to our politics . 
  says the people living right next to the netherlands . 
  and `` america '' can only refer to a chunk of land involving the complete landmass of two continents . 
  the meaning of the word can never change . 
  ... i also suppose the question could be turned around -- if you have diplomatic immunity , why * would n't * you do a hit-and-run ... 
   regarding the refugee convention , it was first drafted shortly after ww2 , and i assume in light of it . 
  i expect so too . 
  that being said , i also think that it was done with something like the situation of the holocaust in mind , rather than simply countries which have rotten policies in place . 
   the fact of the matter is that there 's still millions of people fleeing from wars , civil wars , and terrorism around the world . 
  i do n't consider letting them all die on our doorsteps an acceptable course of action . 
  well , one point is that i ( and i think many other people ) view accepting refugees given an abusable refugee policy as accepting economic migrants . 
  first , i think that it would be a better idea to explicitly accept economic immigration if that is the goal , but even aside from that ... i 'm certainly not convinced that an open border policy is impossible ( after all , at one point fiat currency , democracy , freedom of speech , and a lot of other things that we consider pretty commonplace would have been seen as extremely impractical ; things * can * work out ) . 
  however , i do think that just as people who want to stop or limit immigration have some real questions to answer that can not be ignored , so do advocates of permitting people in : * how are present social welfare programs to be maintained ? 
  will germany accept a lower minimum standard of living ? 
  will germany instead accept having a less-competitive economy , and take money from german companies to ensure an equality of outcome ? 
  * there have been many hundreds of years of christian-muslim conflict . 
  secularism ( mostly on the christian side ) may have reduced the pressures here , but is europe comfortable with addressing this ? 
  other countries , like egypt , have seen christian-muslim conflicts ongoing to this day . 
  yes , living in harmony may be an ideal , but this is a path that is hard to back up on , and holding ideals is different from blocking a view of reality with them . 
  i do not think that it is impossible to have poly-religious countries , and there are some examples of same . 
  i also think that there are a significant-enough number of cases where countries have seen serious religious conflict that this is a legitimate concern . 
  * on a related note , what are the views on secularism ? 
  i think that many people in europe , at least on / r/europe , aspire to heading steadily towards a increasingly-secular state , even if they would n't * ban * religion . 
  if a great many religious people immigrate and collectively create pressure for a more-religious society , is europe comfortable heading down the path of more religion ? 
  my belief is that even if the us and the uk merged , the uk would be uncomfortable about some of the role that religion plays in the us , and this is a much smaller gap to bridge . 
  * some of the countries in question are very poor , and have limited education : eritria is particularly badly-off . 
  we 've yet to devise a way to simply convert random unskilled adults to highly-productive workers ( if we * could * do that , a lot of those countries probably would n't be nearly so badly-off ) . 
  the first generation , no matter what , is going to cost something if germany wants to maintain the sort of standards of living that many people would like to keep as a minimum . 
  there 's also typically correlation between wealth of parents and wealth of children , so unless germany plans to reverse this , this is probably not going to be a single-generation effort . 
  * the us has a substantial black-white economic gap ( presently a household net wealth difference of about 13-to-1 ) which has stubbornly persisted , even after other groups have tended to close the gap . 
  this is [ approximately the ratio that the united kingdom sees as well ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/04/08/the-racial-wealth-gap-not-just-an-american-problem/ ) . 
  a substantial chunk of immigration ( somalia , eritrea ) , would be sub-saharan african sources of immigration ; were europe to permit the even broader anyone-from-africa-who-wants-to-come-can-come policy that you 've proposed , this would obviously be an overwhelming factor . 
  if this gap similarly persists in europe , how will this be addressed ? 
  if economic equality is a goal , will equality of opportunity or will equality of outcome be guaranteed ? 
  are the people of europe comfortable with potentially providing an ongoing subsidy if need be to provide equality of outcome ? 
  if so , how will this be paid for ? 
  if you believe that the gap will not arise in germany , what are the grounds for this ? 
  * finally , is this a precedent that germany would like to maintain , not just as a result of this one-off conflict , but for the world as a whole ? 
  this is not typically a policy that most nations have adopted -- not that it did n't happen , as the early us was effectively open-border -- but that today , it is quite uncommon . 
  they tend to restrict immigration , and tend to have policies that encourage immigration of the wealthy . 
  if germany would like to adopt these policies , how does germany differ from these other countries in such a way that this is a desirable policy , or in what way are these other countries adopting a sub-par policy ? 
  those questions may all have legitimate answers , but all of them , i think , are serious ones ; they deal with issues that could be pretty severe if things go south . 
   why should the uk share the burden . 
  because the uk is primarily the one with the concerns over having illegal immigrants try to sneak through the channel tunnel into the uk . 
  france does n't really have any national interests along those lines other than maybe not wanting unauthorized people in the channel tunnel in general . 
  because it 's a uk interest being served , it makes sense for the uk to pay for it -- else it 's in france 's interest to try to do as little and as cheaply as possible to try to block illegal immigration into the uk . 
  in the united states , surprisingly-enough , immigrants are actually less-likely to commit crimes than the native-born . 
  i did see some numbers being cited in a discussion about finland that showed that at least some immigrants ( iirc this was somalians and rape ) had an elevated rate of crime commission , but it really does require pulling up what statistics exist : it 's not an automatic guarantee that immigrants , even illegal immigrants , commit crimes at a higher rate . 
   fun fact : immigrants make this country billions more than the costs of immigration each year . 
  the uk articles i 've seen tend to split between immigrants from the eu and immigrants from outside the eu . 
  immigrants overall were , from the articles i 've seen , estimated to be a net benefit , from immigrants from outside the eu ( heavily from poorer areas ) a net cost . 
   ( 2 ) is facing a declining population and the lowest birth rates in europe i do agree here . 
  if someone is going to propose limiting immigration , it 's also incumbent upon them to explain how they plan to fund things that today depend upon wealth transfers from the young to the old in the future . 
   by the way , refugees have a legal right to stay in safe countries . 
  this is not about opinion , it 's international law . 
  i think that asking whether it makes sense to be a signatory to such a treaty is a valid question , though .

   between january and march of this year , foreign diplomats racked up $ 77,165 worth of fines , in 4,823 incidents . 
  eight of these were accidents , including six hit and runs , the bild newspaper said . 
  if you have * diplomatic immunity * , why in the hell would you do a hit-and-run ? 
  given that the whole point of drunken diplomat 's job is to establish relations in the interests of his country and that currently , the only thing people around the world know about him ( and probably his country 's entire diplomatic mission there ) is that he 's that guy who was a drunken asshole to ukranians , he 's probably not going to be getting a fantastic evaluation from his superior . 
  i 'm saying that counting `` n developed countries out of m developed countries permit capital punishment '' , where n is a relatively-small number , may be a misleading statistic . 
  that number is being cited above . 
  also taiwan . 
  israel as well . 
  depending upon your definition of `` developed economy '' , some other countries might show up . 
  given that eu member nations were required to ban it as a condition of membership , but eu member nations count for a large chunk of those developed countries since the eu is not presently federalized , i 'm not sure how interesting that sample is . 
  if european countries were permitted to allow or disallow capital punishment freely , as they saw fit , they might choose to do so .
