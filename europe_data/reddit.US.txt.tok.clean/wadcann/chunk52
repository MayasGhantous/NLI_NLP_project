  grow a pair of balls , germany . 
  how can we be assured that you will otherwise bring your military into poland when required ? 
  i thought that we were part of one union !, 
  you have a responsibility !, 
  germany : i 'm not really into all that fighting sort of stuff . 
  besides , i need to have that money to spend on all the african and asian immigrants that i 'm bringing in . 
  that costs something . 
  besides , this union means that i keep having to send you money . 
  sikorski : what the hell ? 
  poland : yeah , about the immigration thing , you need to slow down with that ... germany : besides , a larger military might be seen as threatening to russia . 
  poland : i 'm comfortable with that . 
  germany : no , conflict with russia would be a terrible prospect . 
  sikorski : what the fuck ? 
  poland : look , we 're not asking for * that * much of a build-up . 
  we 're just pointing out that you have fewer tanks than greece . 
  you need to build at least a * few * more tanks and station them in poland . 
  germany : nahhhh ... poland : it 's not just me . 
  the us has been complaining constantly about you not having enough of a military too . 
  poland : ... besides , you had broomsticks in the place of machine guns on your armor . 
  is n't that embarrassing ? 
  germany : not really . 
  poland : all right , forget the tanks , if you 're that dead-set against it . 
  how about attack submarines ? 
  you build those . 
  sikorski : at least * one * thing sounds familiar . 
  germany : well , we already gave the ones we recently-built to the jews . 
  sikorski : what the * actual * fuck ? 
  is this the future or bizarro dimension ? 
   they should be allowed at least to work for this time if they don \u00b4 t manage it faster that creates something of a mis-incentive to abuse the asylum review system as a work visa . 
  now , i 'm not going to claim that germany should n't grant work visas -- that 's a whole different question -- but i think that there 's a very compelling argument that it should n't simply have asylum policy that 's abusable . 
  i do n't live in wisconsin , so that might be it ... 
  [ i am not an economist ] nope . 
  here 's why -- let 's say that belgium establishes policies to force a trade surplus with the rest of the world . 
  that means that belgium says something like `` i 'll establish really high tariffs on anything imported , to make it really expensive to bring them in . 
  now belgians will buy belgian-made goods ! '', 
  so , this happens . 
  now all foreign-made goods become really expensive in belgium . 
  sure , a little bit will still be imported , because someone is willing to throw lots of money at getting french cheese , say , but on the whole , imports decrease . 
  belgians now do n't get french cheese and simply have to do without , which means that their standard-of-living falls off somewhat . 
  jan janssen 's pay has * effectively * fallen off in real terms , since what he wanted to do was to get his pay and then buy french cheese with it -- this was the thing he most-wanted , and would maximize the [ utility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/utility ) he would have gotten for his pay . 
  now he 's having to settle for less-good belgian cheese . 
  secondly , belgium is n't getting finnish lumber any more , which means that it becomes more-expensive to construct things out of wood . 
  some buildings that would have been built go un-constructed ; piet pietersen 's factory , which might have constructed an expansion ca n't afford to do so any more . 
  well ... belgium has some sort of `` money '' -- let 's say belgium is using gold for this -- that it is stockpiling , because it 's accruing more and more of that gold . 
  but the gold does n't inherently do anything for belgium . 
  it sits in a vault somewhere . 
  all that gives it worth is the fact that it * could * be used to buy something . 
  assuming that agents in the market are [ efficient ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_efficiency ) , which is a rough approximation that we make , we * already * expected them to be purchasing the most-desirable thing . 
  belgium always * could * have purchased and accrued gold if it wanted to do so . 
  piet peterson * could * have simply hung onto gold if he thought that his factory expansion would have been a bad investment . 
  he would n't have done so -- in his judgment , having a factory expansion made more sense than having gold . 
  jan janssen could have accrued gold , but in * his * eyes , the best way to spend his wages , the greatest utility he would get is to purchase french cheese . 
  so , belgium stockpiles a lot of gold , and jan lives a less-happy life , and piet ca n't expand belgium 's productive capacity . 
  true , at some point , belgium can spend that gold and buy something with it ( it should , otherwise it 's just working for nothing ) . 
  piet and jan are basically forced to make a spending decision that requires them to accrue gold and not invest it or spend it on the things that they actually judge to be their best purchases at the time that they judge it to be most in their interests . 
  that makes belgium worse off . 
  belgium * should * export goods , but only because it can get things that can be more-efficiently-produced abroad via [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) : this means that it can get * more * stuff by permitting trade . 
  that is the basic summary of why you want to permit free trade rather than imposing import tariffs . 
  and broadly-speaking , this is viewed as the right thing to do . 
  agreement with this general approach today dominates exceptions to it . 
  so why the common approach of thinking `` ah , it makes sense to not buy anything and instead stockpile wealth '' ? 
  why is that sometimes seen as responsible , or why is it seen as advantageous ? 
  well , one answer is that one of the assumptions i listed above might be wrong . 
  maybe humans do n't make efficient purchasing decisions . 
  maybe they make decisions that provide them with utility in the short term , but in the long term , they regret having made . 
  we know that this * does * happen to some limited degree : one example that we know happens would be [ hyperbolic discounting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperbolic_discounting ) . 
  maybe jan janssen thinks one week later `` oh , why did i ever buy that french cheese -- that was so foolish of me !, 
  i should have waited and purchased something else thirty years down the road , given up some utility now for utility in my old age ! '', 
  if * that * is the case -- and to some degree , it is -- maybe the state can make purchasing decisions that are more-in-the-interest of humans than they themselves can in the long term . 
  i think that many people would say something like `` well , what piet is doing is sensible -- he 's buying a factory expansion , which is the right thing to do , whereas what jan is doing , with the french cheese , is n't a good idea -- he should save and wait ! '', 
  if that 's the case , then they 're making their own judgment call on jan 's purchasing decisions , saying that jan-in-the-future will rather have french cheese thirty years later than memories of eating french cheese with his friends today . 
  they might be right or might be wrong , but i 'd guess that this is some of where the intuitive sense of `` selling without buying is good ! '', 
  comes from . 
  another possibility is that markets deviate from being efficient markets , and there 's also some degree of truth to this . 
  when i sit down and work with a simple model of a market , i assume that companies just spring up and vanish at the drop of a hat -- if there 's profit to be made , a company will arise . 
  now , this is a simplifying assumption , and it 's broadly-considered to be a reasonably-accurate one , but it 's also obviously not * perfectly * true . 
  people * do n't * immediately set up companies wherever they could actually make money from doing so . 
  maybe legal fees attached to starting a company make it expensive to do so , or maybe would-be entrepreneurs are just scared of venturing out into the unknown and so prefer to be employed at an established company , which in turn is scared about expanding into new areas . 
  one rationale that advocates of protectionism use for establishing import tariffs is the [ infant industry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infant_industry ) argument . 
  here , the concern is that it is * really difficult * to actually get a company to start up , so it makes sense for a country to establish tariffs to `` let a company get off the ground '' , and that once it is established , it will be able to stand on its own two feet without aid . 
  there have been concerns that this phenomenon is actively-exploited by companies , that whenever it looks like a competitor might enter a market , they will willingly burn through their savings and lose money until the competitor leaves the market , then go back to making money . 
  because of concern about the potential for this practice , called [ dumping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dumping_%28pricing_policy%29 ) , some countries have established `` anti-dumping laws '' , which fines companies that they believe to be selling below price , and may establish import tariffs in response * if * a company can be shown to be doing this . 
  there is some evidence that in some cases , it could make sense to do so . 
  my own suspicion ( remember , i 'm not an economist ! ), 
  and [ the opinion of a number of rather well-known economists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em ) is that industries tend to overwhelmingly over-sell the prospect of dumping . 
  if they can * claim * that a competing company in another country is actually engaging in dumping when it is n't and have import tariffs applied in response , they can force people who buy their goods in their own country to pay a higher price for them than would normally be the case ( `` if you want * any * cheese , it 's going to be * belgian * cheese ! ) . 
  this means that they can effectively extract wealth from the population of their own country and give it to themselves . 
  my suspicion is that this abuse , claiming dumping when dumping is n't actually happening , is much more common than dumping actually showing up in the real world . 
  however , dumping is one real example where it might be advantageous to establish import quotas in response . 
  summary : you want free trade because it maximizes your own real wealth in an efficient market due to taking advantage of [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) , and broadly-speaking , the mainstream has agreed that this is the most-important factor . 
  there are some limited cases where it might be argued that restricting trade makes sense . 
   import africa and the middle east into europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa, 
  germany has n't been occupied [ since 1955 ] ( http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/allies-end-occupation-of-west-germany ) . 
  if germany wants to leave nato , all that 's required is twelve months of notice . 
  i 'm not sure what other relationships you 're upset about . 
  i really do n't think that the us is trying to kill off people of a german ethnicity , and insofar as the us was involved in europe after the war , it tended to push for european trade and integration , which was probably beneficial to europe . 
  finally , whatever the flaws that the us may have , i do n't really think that it could be well-described by '' [ fascist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism ) '' . 
  i do n't think that justification will work -- broadly-speaking , countries do n't accept liability for secondary effects of their foreign policies . 
  honestly , it might not even be logistically-possible to deal with that . 
  and i 'd have a hard time seeing countries accept that .
