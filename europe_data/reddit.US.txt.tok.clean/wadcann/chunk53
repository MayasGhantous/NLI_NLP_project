  would germany accept responsibility for not just primary , but secondary effects of the second world war in europe ? 
  i do n't even know how that would be measured . 
  what about the uk , france , and the effects of colonialism ? 
  i do agree that it makes a lot of sense for schengen area countries to involve themselves in any border control costs on the periphery of the schengen area , since the whole point of the area is that once you 're in , you 're in -- there are no borders inside of the area . 
  but the uk has not , thus far , joined schengen . 
  i do think that it makes sense for the uk to fund efforts on the french side trying to block people illegally sneaking into the uk . 
  even if it 's french soil , it 's addressing a primarily-british concern . 
  however , the uk * is * doing this . 
  i could understand schengen , non-eu countries taking part in spending that involves border control on the periphery of schengen . 
  but asking non-schengen , eu countries like the uk to contribute to border control elsewhere in the eu seems less-convincing . 
  these countries are n't directly-benefiting from the border control in , say , italy or greece in the way that switzerland does . 
   technically , we were never at direct war , proxy war , or covert operations inside of russia ( that i know of ) .

  [ most places in the us ] ( http://recreation-law.com/2014/05/28/good-samaritan-laws-by-state/ ) have what 's called a [ good samaritan law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_samaritan_law ) that blocks victims from suing rescuers who , in good faith , try to assist the victims . 
  the us does * not * generally have a [ duty to rescue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty_to_rescue ) , which * requires * rescuers to aid victims . 
   the deal with china is desperation as they are quickly destroying their main marker . 
  i do n't think that countries would * stop * buying from russia , barring sanctions , as long as russia is selling cheaply . 
  it just means that russia wo n't be able to charge more than whatever the import price from elsewhere is . 
  other parts of the country do n't have trains going to the uk , which is presumably the reason for setting up camp in calais . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_iceland  the icelandic winter is relatively mild for its latitude . 
  the southerly lowlands of the island average around 0 \u00b0 c ( 32 \u00b0 f ) in winter , while the highlands tend to average around \u2212 10 \u00b0 c ( 14 \u00b0 f ) . 
  i 've never heard a single joke about the polish . 
  numerous other nationalities , yes ... 
  i think that there might be a tendency to think `` economic policy matters and politics do n't '' , which i do n't think is accurate -- it 's necessary to structure all this in such a way that a majority in each country will support the desired goals . 
  that could have been put more-politely . 
  that being said , i agree with the general point -- it 's not in a country 's interests to try to maintain a trade surplus . 
  every time this comes up , i [ leave this link here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) : it 's been hundreds of years since european economists thought `` it 'd be a great idea to try and force persistent trade surpluses and stockpile money '' . 
  i 'm probably one of the worse people here to ask ( i had n't heard of them myself until today , and given that i live in the us , my knowledge of pan-european vendors will be poor compared to that of many other people here ) . 
  if i can order them on amazon from an importer , i would n't be surprised if you can as well ( apparently some little company in sweden registered the amazon.se domain and is in a fight with amazon , but they do sell in sweden ) , if you do n't have a better online vendor . 
  i do know that reddit has had , for some years , a subreddit , / r/snackexchange , which is devoted to people exchanging snacks that are n't available where they live . 
  basically , you live in sweden . 
  so you send out a request saying `` swedish redditor here , interested in exchanging for dutch double salt drops '' and maybe put some suggestions up of snacks that are available in sweden . 
  someone responds saying `` i can get those , and i 'm interested in swedish snack x '' -- i do n't know , maybe candied fermented herring or chocolate-dunked moose liver or whatever it is that people in sweden are really into . 
  then you buy your swedish snacks and the dutch guy buys his dutch snacks and you each ship them to each other . 
  a lot of people apparently like just requesting surprise packages of snacks from the country in question . 
  from at least the us , my view is that importers already do a lot of this -- it may be pricy , but i can * usually * buy darn near anything from around the world from an importer . 
  also , sweden is really near the netherlands , so my guess is that someone already imports the stuff . 
  however , if you ca n't find an importer who does , / r/snackexchange might do what you want . 
  edit : in fact , the top `` hot '' post up there as of this writing is a three-hour-old request for dutch snacks from a briton . 
  oh , this is kinda interesting -- someone finally did some investigation on globalresearch.ca . 
  they banned the product . 
  someone imports it illegally . 
  they enforce their ban . 
  regardless of the reasons for russia reaching this point ( and i think that there are plenty of bad decisions russia made to reach this point ) , i have a very difficult time blaming a country for enforcing its customs rules . 
  maybe it would be a better policy to impose a fine and simply seize the goods . 
  i do n't know what the rationale is for the destruction versus something else . 
  but i just do n't consider this particular action of russia 's particularly unreasonable . 
  if africa could become highly-productive , and produce something else , it could also simply import food . 
  africa does n't * have * to produce all its own food . 
  well , that was probably due to the british flag . 
  red , white , and blue also show up for new zealand and australia . 
  there are two different british / r/europe users who did ones for the uk -- the netherlands could probably stand to have a second , additional one done if you 've different views . 
  i just [ looked up `` dubbelzout '' on amazon ] ( http://www.amazon.com/venco-double-salt-licorice-dubbelzout/dp/b00n15j1jc/ ) , thinking `` hey , what the heck , might as well try it once . '', 
  the first customer review began with `` this is the saltiest thing i 've ever eaten , and i once ate a heaping bowl of salt . '', 
   ** drop **   you ca n't really be dutch until you can appreciate drop . 
  we love it .

  not so much . 
  hmm . 
  never heard of this . 
  < goes investigating  http://www.invadingholland.com/guides-to-holland/the-horrors-of-dutch-drop-liquorice  ... when you encounter it for the first time it 's probably because you 've just been offered one of the more ` popular ' flavours by a dutch person . 
    for a brief moment , just before the flavour hits you , you might notice the slightly odd way the dutch person seems to be ` observing ' you , the way they seem to be studying your every expression as if they are planning to take scientific notes . 
  by the time you realize this means something is wrong it is already too late . 
    suddenly the taste takes hold ...   everything in your being tells you that this taste is wrong . 
  that it should not be . 
  what mad man would have created such a thing ? 
  your taste buds cry out in objection or fear ( or both ) as the taste spreads father around your mouth . 
  suddenly you just want it to end , for the flavour to go away . 
  but even when you spit out the dutch drop the flavour still remains . 
  it wo n't go away . 
  will it ever go away ? 
  why is this happening ? 
  why ? 
  oh god why ? 
    suddenly you realize with horror that this was done to you on purpose . 
  you were offered this god forsaken taste for the amusement of the dutch person sitting across from you . 
  they wanted to see your reaction to it . 
  they knew you would not be able to handle it . 
  no foreigner can . 
  perhaps the fact that they started filming you with their phone should have been a warning . 
  the dutch can be sadistic sometimes too . 
  hmm . 
  just to be clear , it is not presently approaching this point -- this is just one guy predicting that this will wind up being the case . 
  a russian friend of mine told me that there 's ukranian borscht and russian borscht . 
  one is eaten with sour cream , as i recall . 
  outsourcing is great -- means that less-efficiently-used resources in economy a get used in economy b.
