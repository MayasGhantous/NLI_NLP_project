  the impression this title gives ( me , at least ) is that he was using the drawing itself as a threat . 
   usa and russia might have equal footing in terms of resources to wage war the us [ spends 8.3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) times as much as russia on its military . 
  the us military has an active-duty strength of 1.36 m ; russia 's military of 771k . 
  the us has a population of 321m to draw from ; russia of 144m . 
  and as you point out , that 's before a single other nato member has even bothered to lift a finger .

  of humanity 's [ ten operational space stations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_space_stations#past_stations ) to date , seven were soviet/russian , one was us , one was chinese , and one is the iss ( many countries , including russia ) .

  incidentally , pretty much everyone that i know who uses an [ orthodox file manager ] ( http://softpanorama.org/ofm/index.shtml ) -- aka a `` two pane '' file manager -- is from eastern europe . 
  i use emacs 's [ dired ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dired ) , which is not the same thing , but similar in some ways . 
  while emacs does have add-in file managers , dired is built-in . 
  i 'd think it 's more the us taking the eu 's side than visa versa .

  or a [ hasidic jew ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hasidic_judaism ) . 
   in france , the former centre-right president , nicolas sarkozy , has called for the accords to be revised as migrants fleeing war and political repression in the middle east and africa continue to stream into europe . 
    `` schengen must be suspended immediately and replaced by a schengen ii which member-countries could only join if they first agree to the same immigration policy , '' mr sarkozy said recently . 
  `` europe is not meant to organise social and migratory dumping . '' standardizing immigration policy would actually be a move towards federalization . 
  russia exports oil and natural gas . 
   so you 're going to fly people to europe in planes that hold what ... 100 people ? 
  200 maybe ? 
  against a country that up until recently had an active army of over 1 million people ? 
  well , if you just take the c-5 , c-17 , and c-130 aircraft and ignore the others , that 's still 650 large-body cargo aircraft . 
  assume that those get used to haul supplies and equipment , and that commercial passenger aircraft are commandeered and used to haul people over at somewhere between 200-850 soldiers per flight and yeah , you could probably move a pretty substantial chunk of soldiers in a short period of time if you needed to do so . 
  presumably because the german public had a relatively-low score in terms of public opinion in commitment to fighting to defend other nato members ; it was posted in several surveys recently . 
  placing a base there means that an invasion probably necessarily involves germany 's military .

   those a lot of decisions actioned by him seem baffling or childish because he 's literally got no other idea of how to react . 
  but national leaders have advisors who are experts in particular areas . 
  those leaders do n't need to go into office and know every element of every important thing going on in their country , or you 'd never find a suitable leader . 
  well , all right -- let 's be more realistic . 
  i do n't know what-all a nuclear war 's first hour would involve , but you 're proposing that russia would be launching nuclear weapons at the us navy to wipe it out . 
  in return , it 's a pretty safe bet that the us and western europe are also launching nukes at russia , unless you think that the us is just going to sit and watch itself be nuked . 
  so russia does n't have any cities any more . 
  if it has large military concentrations , those probably do n't exist either . 
  it does n't have any military bases left . 
  anything nuclear that did n't launch in the first hour probably is n't getting off , since it 's been counter-attacked already . 
  russia might still scrape together enough of a military to move into europe . 
  let 's say that major airports in the us have also been nuked . 
  i suppose that russia would be able to move into europe . 
  probably europe 's also been nuked too , so it 's not clear what is still intact , though life wo n't be normal . 
  what 's left of european functioning government and military and police is probably trying to put up a fight , and europe has substantially-more manpower than russia does . 
  if there is any remaining serviceable airports in the us , they 're probably being used by the us to launch strategic bombers first , then military transport planes . 
  based on world war ii , the us is probably requisitioning remaining ships , including civilian ships , for transports . 
  russia , europe , and the us are probably conscripting what remains out of the population and trying to put together emergency governance structure to handle disaster relief and military coordination . 
  if there is shipping in the world under control of europe or us , military or not , it 's probably now going to be seized by the relevant governments . 
  i dunno , i just do n't see troop transport being the biggest concern in the event of a nuclear war . 
  china is probably still intact and is likely a wild card -- suddenly , it and india are more-or-less intact and their relative population have suddenly shot up . 
  they might have a pretty big role in whatever happens next . 
  if instead it was a non-nuclear war , then we do n't have nuclear weapons being dropped on the us navy , and we go back to military shipping , i suppose . 
   if russia engaged in a war with nato , how would the us get their buts over here anyway ?

   claim : russia has the right to oppose nato-supported infrastructure on the territory of member states in central and eastern europe   fact : the relationship between nato and russia is governed by the founding act on mutual relations , cooperation and security , agreed by nato allies and russia in 1997 and reaffirmed at nato-russia summits in rome in 2002 , and in lisbon in 2010 . 
  ( the founding act can be read here . ), 
    in the founding act , the two sides agreed that : `` in the current and foreseeable security environment , the alliance will carry out its collective defence and other missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability , integration , and capability for reinforcement rather than by additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces . 
  accordingly , it will have to rely on adequate infrastructure commensurate with the above tasks . 
  in this context , reinforcement may take place , when necessary , in the event of defence against a threat of aggression and missions in support of peace consistent with the united nations charter and the osce governing principles , as well as for exercises consistent with the adapted cfe treaty , the provisions of the vienna document 1994 and mutually agreed transparency measures . 
  russia will exercise similar restraint in its conventional force deployments in europe . '', 
    therefore , both infrastructure and reinforcements are explicitly permitted by the founding act and therefore by russia . 
   and as much as i like the us , i 'm pretty sure the russians will wipe the floor with nato if it ever came to a conventional war . 
  nato has far more of everything -- budget , hardware , manpower . 
  a russian politician who was in office -- one of the religious guys , really anti-homosexual , and i remember thinking that if he was american and baptist instead of russian orthodox , most of his positions would have worked really well here in the 1950s -- a while back had some bio written on him . 
  his favorite video game was * call of duty 2 : modern warfare * , and i remember thinking `` oh , great '' . 
  while it 's obviously not real , what shows that it 's russians doing this ? 
  '' [ deport illegal immigrants to new guinea ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-28189608 ) '' , apparently . 
  that 's nonsense and i demand that you take it back !, 
   do n't expect putin to destroy his luxury car , according to [ this article ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/autos/bp/vladimir-putin-s-future-all-russian-limousine-revealed-183721733.html ) , he was considering moving from his current mercedes-benz fleet to russian-made limousines .

  the fact that they apparently blocked github is kind of a strong argument in favor of incompetence rather than malice . 
  no , i 'm not saying that / u/langeweile was serious , but rather that i do n't understand the point of russia imposing the sanctions in the first place . 
  i do n't understand your math . 
  the car had a new value of 240k . 
  it was valued at 190k , so he 's out 50k due to depreciation . 
  he would pay a total of 45k to his accomplices . 
  if it was fully-insured ( and the article does n't say what portion it was insured ) , he should receive 145k ( 190k-45k ) , not 5k ( 50k-45k ) . 
   he also owned several properties totalling 27 million francs and 15 cars including a lamborghini , all paid for by his father . 
  i mean , surely it would n't be * that * hard for the guy to sell a couple of the cars than to try to bilk the public paying into the insurance pool . 
  you can only drive one of the cars at a time , after all . 
  hmm . 
  but he says that he 's left-wing ... 
  while i can understand mr. duda 's concerns , i 'd also guess ( without any real idea of what the weighting of the actual nato concerns are ) that there is some potential value in having a longer response time until , for example , an airbase can be attacked . 
  crossing the border in the event of an attack is when hostilities actually start ; without some degree of time to respond , it gives russia the first strike and ability to knock out as much military hardware as possible in that strike . 
  that being said , regardless of any such concerns , i 'm very sympathetic to the idea of a [ tripwire force ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/trip+wire ) present in the area to help ensure that any conflict immediately involves the military forces of other nato members -- that would seem to add credibility to any statement of willingness to provide defense . 
  such an approach also has the benefit that it ca n't be seen as threatening russia with a preemptive attack from nato . 
  in fact , it might even make sense for nato to agree on a new article , where members can require , upon request , other members send some number of soldiers to be based in their own country to provide exactly this sort of guarantee in future situations .
