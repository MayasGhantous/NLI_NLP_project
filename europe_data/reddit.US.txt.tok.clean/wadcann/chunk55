  what would you prefer poland 's relationship to be with russia , assuming that you hypothetically had the ability to set it yourself ? 
  i was actually surprised about singapore -- i mean , sure , interest in naval stuff , but who is singapore going to be invading in amphibious operations ? 
  but apparently , the [ republic of singapore navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_singapore_navy ) actually already has [ four landing platform docks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/endurance-class_landing_platform_dock ) , which is a pretty impressive amphibious warfare capacity for a country with 71k people total in all branches of its active-duty military combined . 
  first , i did n't think that liechtenstein was a net food exporter , and [ this seems to support that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_liechtenstein ) : the first import good is agricultural products , and export goods are mostly manufactured products ( though prepared food does show up ) . 
  second , according to this , the top trading partners of liechtenstein in order are the us , germany , switzerland , france , italy , taiwan , japan , austria , and the uk . 
  russia is n't going to have * that * much impact , and if you are n't going to apply significant pressure , it seems that it 'd just be antagonizing people to little end . 
  given that eu sanctions only require one country to veto extension , i 'd think that russia would be better off trying to split up european countries . 
  identify * one * country , and try and flip it . 
  if pressure is to be applied , make the case that this is just an eastern european affair -- hit the countries that are major russian trading partners that can be hit hard . 
  applying pinpricks to a lot of countries just gets you in the news , annoys the public of many countries , and seems unlikely to change national opinion in favor of russia . 
  yeah , but it 's not just the leak of classified military information that matters either . 
  i mean ... okay , let 's take ttip negotiations . 
  i assume that much or all of the material there is n't classified . 
  but it * is * sensitive and has economic value -- knowing , for example , how much negotiators on the other side are thinking about trading is of value . 
  even getting , say , a month 's advance notice of material that will become public might well be advantageous . 
  i wonder if there are national security implications of simultaneously : 1 . 
  hiring international relations interns for positions that have access to a country 's diplomatic concerns . 
  squeezing them financially enough that they wind up living in what amounts to shanty towns . 
  i mean , to an unpaid man , a packet of ramen has got to look pretty tempting . 
  let 's analyze this honestly -- what agency would be more-likely to establish sleeper cells in the united states capable of acting * as if * they were actually ukranian agents than the russian svr ? 
  remember [ anna chapman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:anna_chapman_mug_shot.jpg ) ? 
  yeah , [ some reports have her being born in ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegals_program#anna_chapman ) , and [ totally a russian sleeper agent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_chapman ) . 
  i think that this is a pretty clear case of russian sleeper cells acting under a false-flag as sleeper cell ukranian agents groomed to become american agents who were impersonating ruskies appearing to badly impersonate two cia agents to make us * believe * that it was the russians who did it . 
  edit : in all fairness , i understand that chapman 's fashion and modeling career took off after the publicity from this , so it might just all just be a savvy hollywood agency with actors trying to build their reputation by pretending to be the above . 
  no , because it includes straight at a t-junction and because there is n't a halting requirement . 
   there 's one limit : you must sell it in such a way that all europeans can adhere to it .

  hmm .

  is that an efficient way to produce tourism , though ? 
  would it be possible to provide that in a limited region and still meet demand ? 
  [ right on red in cars is legal in every state in the us these days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_turn_on_red ) -- though it took a few adventurous states to try it out , it worked well in practice . 
  there are a very few localities that prohibit it , like new york city . 
  running red lights on a bicycle is not ( though a bicycle , as any other vehicle , can make a right-on-red ) .

  the prosecution rests . 
  almost any form of restriction can be bypassed by a sufficiently-determined person with sufficient expertise willing to put enough resources into it . 
  you can break into a building or a safe or steal information from a computer or whatever . 
  however , for things like limiting access ( or * monitoring * access ) for the general public , generally-speaking , anything that affects 99 % of the population is sufficient . 
   if you want people to be safe more information is never bad . 
  while i agree with the overall point , i would disagree on this minor bit -- for example , i do n't think that publishing the process for creating a nuclear bomb and the files necessary to machine the parts involved would improve safety .

  things like [ operation big buzz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_big_buzz ) make them sound more plausible ... 
  could you be more-specific as to which bit you disagree with ? 
   most people just do n't really think about it at all in australia . 
  will more-or-less second this take , but for the us . 
  people would n't talk much about it . 
  european countries tend to come up more in the context of culture or tourism , and that 's still national . 
  a number of folks in / r/europe see the eu as potentially being a useful tool for establishing stronger bargaining positions , including with the us , but i do n't see any public objection or concern about the eu in the us . 
  people over here are still working on whether ireland is in the uk still ; they definitely do n't know what countries in europe are in the eu or schengen or exactly what the eurozone covers or what any of the institutions actually do . 
  i 'd pretty much support this [ guy 's summary ] ( http://www.opinioncorner.eu/en/17-how-europe-is-viewed-in-the-united-states.html ) :  public support for the eu has shot up in the united states over the last five years as the divisions over the iraq war have dissipated . 
  in 2004 only 39 % of respondents in a pew survey said they had a favourable view of the eu . 
  by 2009 this figure has risen to 56 % - the biggest jump of all the countries polled . 
    but before eu public relations types crack open the champagne , american political commentators from across the political spectrum are quick to point out that that :   most americans know and care very little about the eu . 
  `` the impact of the eu on the country at large is nil , '' says christopher caldwell , a senior editor at the weekly standard magazine . 
  admits craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund of the united states : `` the eu is a big , complicated institution american people do n't understand very well . ''   while the u.s. public view the eu favourably , most washington d.c.-based policy experts see the union as a fine idea in theory but weak , divided and self-obsessed . 
  the all-conquering legions of iberia pouring up through france ? 
  in the us , powers pretty-much-steadily became more-centralized over time . 
  i would n't be too concerned about the eu doing this . 
  in fact , i have a hard time thinking of major peaceful decentralization of power anywhere . 
  the uk , i suppose . 
  ( very ) early on in the us , it was the southwest ( the south , in the later american civil war ) that was wealthier , and the northeast ( the north , in the war ) that was poorer . 
  the south had very productive agricultural land with a good growing climate , and felt pretty miffed that consistently the north took its money to subsidize northern attempts at establishing manufacturing and other industry . 
  after the industrial era really got going and manufacturing in the us became more important , and then the civil war came and really trashed the south , the relative wealth positions inverted themselves -- industry became dominant , and the american civil war had the north destroying enough of the south 's infrastructure during the war ( armies crossing land loot things even when they 're not actively attempting to destroy infrastructure ) to seriously handicap it for some time to come . 
  now i 'm kind of curious to see a word cloud showing , by country , the most-characteristic names ( where `` characteristic '' is some statistical mix of both being frequently seen in that country and being unique to that country ) . 
  edit : [ wiktionary : appendix : estonian given names ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:estonian_given_names ) gives an idea of estonian names . 
  another american user ( whose name i will omit ) put a comment in that was deleted that i want to re-add , since i had a response :  a lot of americans ca n't wrap their head around the idea of a predominant ethnicity defining the nation anymore and assume everyone else 's immigrants do as our immigrants do even if they do keep some heritage differences . 
  i do n't agree with his response . 
  there 's still substantial ethnicity/first name correlation . 
  if someone 's first name is `` xinping '' , they almost certainly have a chinese background . 
  if it 's `` shaunikka '' , they 've almost certainly an african background . 
  if someone 's first name is `` john '' , yeah , it 'd be a toss-up . 
  but in this case , / u/wideawakenotsleeping is saying that it 's unlikely for a non-russian-background estonian to have chosen the name `` vladimir '' . 
  that seems pretty comparable to the us . 
  and farmers complain that the uk is n't enthusiastic about subsidizing them ? 
  there is no legend on this , and i have a hard time believing that the colors on the chart represent eye color , unless there are a lot of gray-eyed portuguese . 
  okay . 
  it looks like / u/unclesneakyfingers was concerned about the latter -- he did n't want the us to eat a substantial amount of the pain -- and you 're concerned about both , but from both of your standpoints , the idea is that ukraine is n't a us responsibility , and if it gets into trouble , if aiding it is something that would involve substantial cost to the us , it should n't happen . 
   migrants are exploited for cheap labour , which hurts the migrants why would someone migrate if they 're paid less at their destination ? 
  no , i 'm not proposing any specific action . 
  / u/unclesneakyfinger said `` this should be driven by the europeans primarily '' . 
  does that mean that the europeans should be the ones to primarily make the decision about how to act as regards ukraine , or the ones who should be be performing the bulk of that action ? 
  so of the things i listed above , which is the case ? 
  that you think that the us should take a second-place role to europe in deciding what should be done , or that the us should n't participate substantially in whatever is decided upon ? 
  not if you do n't think that this would turn into nuclear war , and you do believe that widespread possession of nuclear weapons would facilitate more-plausible nuclear scenarios , like nuclear terrorism . 
   but i still believe this should be driven by the europeans primarily . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  do you mean that the us should n't take as full a part ( e.g. 
  make half the russian trade reduction that the eu does ) , or that the us should n't push for specific actions and instead have europe predominately decide what should be done ?
