   we have fptp as well . 
  well ... maybe i did n't speak very well . 
  i mean that you can have a viable third party in your system , because the executive is n't controlled by a single , nationwide fptp vote -- i just mean that it 's actually possible to have a center party splitting a left and a right party . 
   the lib dems are deeply unpopular with the traditional liberal voters for rolling over and letting the conservatives get away with so much during their last term in office , aside from the fact that no one votes for the lib dems simply because no one thinks they have a chance of winning and they 're generally regarded as lightweight and ineffectual . 
  but is n't / u/stuarts _ fs 's argument that the conservatives will take moderate voters who would have voted for labour ? 
  if the issue these voters have with the liberal democrats is that they do n't oppose the conservatives , surely that would n't extend to preferring the conservatives to the liberal democrats ? 
  yeah , fair enough ... still , that 's more of a common forum . 
  membership does n't really imply much by way of affinity . 
  seventy-five years ago , could you have envisioned an organization in which france and germany stood side-by-side ? 
  could you explain this a bit to me ? 
  the uk has , as i understand it , more-or-less proportional legislative representation ... i 'm not sure that i understand the factors here . 
  in the us , when one party wins a state , it takes the whole state , and for the election of any positions , there are no points for second place ; this fptp system means that it is extremely advantageous for any one party to have the other party moving away from the center , since it will immediately scoop up moderates . 
  my understanding in the uk was that the conservative party picks up the right ( other than what the bnp/ukip can carve away from them on the right end ) , and the labour party picks up the left ( other than what the snp can carve away from them on the left end ) . 
  so far , that 's compatible with a `` move left and surrender the moderates '' on par with what i see . 
  but the [ liberal democrats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_democrats ) , are , as i understand it , a center party . 
  and the uk is a parliamentary system , so coalitions are viable . 
  if that 's the case , why would n't a labour move away from the center simply surrender the center to the liberal democrats ? 
  and if so , would n't a labour-liberal democrat coalition still be viable ? 
  a lot of the things that were easier to explore have been explored . 
  the world 's islands are discovered and mapped . 
  i guess you could poke around the bottom of the sea or space , but you 're not going to find anything immensely-valuable , like a new plant species . 
  i think that getting something further up in earth 's gravity well capable of constructing spacecraft and finding at least * some * sort of commercially-viable exploration would go a long ways to helping that , but today , it requires immense investment , high risk , and many people working together . 
  sounds like a mutually-beneficial relationship !, 
  asian in the uk -- indian and pakistani . 
  asian in the us -- vietnamese , korean , chinese , japanese . 
  indians are definitely not asians . 
  i recall seeing something about how new zealand and australia include indonesia and some other areas in southeast asia as being asian . 
  russia in at least the us -- not asian , despite taking up more land in asia than any other country in asia . 
  i 'm guessing that it 's something like how the dutch got their name in english -- the english called the * deutsch * who were closest to them and which they interacted with the most the dutch . 
  all of the countries i listed probably primarily see immigration from asia from the region of asia that they 'd call `` asian '' . 
  well , students pay for teaching , and honestly , the point of an internship is to gain experience in the field . 
  the separation between paid education ( have some expert provide some limited degree of instruction , do schoolwork and then throw it away ) and an internship ( have some expert provide some limited degree of instruction , do actual work and have it potentially be meaningful ) seems a bit artificial . 
  arguably , maybe that means that we just overemphasize the value to the student of formal education ... < shrug , 
  i was wondering who started the whole [ tricolor/republicanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tricolour_%28flag%29 ) thing that spread across europe . 
  according to wikipedia , it was the dutch who kicked it off , back in 1579 . 
   stricter i think that you 're proposing a new rule , rather than proposing increased strictness in enforcement of rules . 
  there 's no present restriction on , for example , someone from argentina comparing and contrasting argentina to europe . 
  the [ first us national flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_union_flag ) was effectively-identical to the [ company flag of the british east india company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_india_company#flags ) . 
   callousness and complacency ... draconian ... america 's criminal justice system was constructed in slavery 's long shadow and is sustained today by the persistent forces of racism ... the holocaust surely this will be an objective , data-supported article . 
   in may , magnus ranstorp from the swedish defence university told the local that while some women and teenagers were persuaded or forced to travel to the middle east by friends and family members , others `` look up to the fighters like pop stars '' and leave home of their own accord . 
    `` for a lot of the girls this is a form of emancipation in a perverse way . 
  they think they are ** getting away from the leash of patriarchal structures ** in their families or the areas where they live , '' he said . 
  i 'm not entirely-sure whether the girls are just kind of out-of-whack in trying to fit their view of patriarchy onto the situation or whether mr. ranstorp is in his application of an oppressive patriarchy to explaining the drive for this . 
  for success in life , set realistically-achievable goals . 
  not just the french .

  my understanding , a few years back , was that australia was seeing enormous sums of money coming into australian mining from china needing raw resources . 
  recently , i 've been reading articles about how china has been [ reducing this ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2a865df6-e31d-11e4-bf4b-00144feab7de.html ) and it 's been impacting australia . 
  not sure how much contribution that has . 
   60 years castrating themselves frankly , a lot of of the demilitarization or at least the pressures to demilitarize society were forced on germany by the victors of world war ii , including the uk . 
  it seems horribly unfair to criticize germany for that . 
   dpr has bigger things to worry about then some drug subreddit i think that the concern is that the rationale is to block out opposing political speech , rather than drugs , and that drugs make for a more-acceptable justification for blocking media . 
   crimea is russian anyway well , that 's certainly russia 's official take on the matter . 
   i used to joke with a professor i studied with at case western university , stanton court , that us fighter aircraft look like swiss watches , but russian fighters look like tanks . 
  would you prefer to fight with a tank or a swiss watch ? 
  this is a joke , but there is some rationale to it . 
  russian equipment , be it indigenous or adopted form the west , is made in a way that less sophisticated machines could build them and less skilled and educated people could operate them . 
    we always joked that certain western equipment is great , but you should graduate from harvard to operate it . 
  today , most people recruited into armies across the world come from relatively modest backgrounds , and from this point of view russian equipment is very user-friendly . 
  kind of a left-handed compliment and i 'm suspicious of not-invented-here bias : i think that some soviet military hardware deserves better . 
  obviously , the us had different goals in crafting its military hardware than did the ussr -- despite the us 's reputation for valuing an armed populace , the ak-47 was * intended * to arm populaces around the world and thus shift the political balance of power : cheap and easy to make , reliable without much maintenance . 
  however , at the end of the day , the [ ak-47 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-47 ) became a whole lot more common ( 100m units , including derivatives ) than the [ m-14 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m14_rifle ) ( 1.5 m units ) and [ m-16 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m16_rifle ) ( 8m ) did . 
  that 's a pretty strong endorsement . 
   plus there is a russian perception that there is potential for a future war in the arctic . 
  unless russia is going to take on nato , there 's a pretty limited set of arctic nations remaining : just sweden or finland as possibilities for adversaries . 
  the russians expats that i know in real life are pretty cool people . 
  also , i 'd say that echo chambers are rarely advantageous for anyone . 
  back in the cold war , radio was a more-widely-used means of communication , so it was possible to broadcast in more-easily , but the current forms of media rely on hardlines , and are much-more-subject to state control . 
  going to be interesting to see what people come up with . 
  the us navy has been funding [ tor development ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tor_%28anonymity_network%29 ) since its beginning , for example . 
  with apologies to churchill : `` from [ reddit ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/08/10/rkn/ ) to [ facebook ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/22/russia-will-block-google-twitter-and-facebook-if-they-withhold-blogger-data ) , an iron curtain has descended across the internet . '', 
  well , that 's the public rationale . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's not true , but realistically , if russia wanted to block reddit for political reasons , i assume that it 's not going to explicitly say this . 
  publicly , the reason that the us tends to want to monitor internet stuff is to `` stop terrorists and pedophiles '' . 
  sells better with the public . 
  i 'm curious to see whether the dpr and crimea will suddenly develop a dire concern over marijuana use on / r/trees as well . 
  if for no other reason , nato probably would n't even * exist * if it were an offensive pact that required attacking russia if russia did things to non-nato members -- most nato members simply would n't have signed on for such a deal . 
  the uk did not have atomic bombs ( though i suppose that it did have heavy bombers capable of delivering them ) . 
  the us had a very few bombs . 
  there were some people who did want to do pretty much this : patton , say . 
  but it was n't quite as simple as it might look : * firstly , as i said above : you can not blame the uk alone . 
  the uk simply had no military ability to single-handedly throw russia out of europe . 
  whether they had an obligation or not is kind of meaningless in that they could not have pulled this off without us involvement . 
  * secondly , europe was literally starving : a war had been raging across it , and the us and the uk had been blockading it for some time . 
  in some places , [ like the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_famine_of_1944 ) , this was still in an early state , and in other places , like greece , [ it was more advanced ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_%28greece%29 ) . 
  getting europe back up-and-running rather than starting a new war , which would have prevented reintroduction of supplies , was high on the list of priorities . 
  doing otherwise would have had grim realities for europe 's population . 
  * third , even in the uk , there was significant pro-communist support at the time ; i 've read about how worker support for world war ii in the uk was significantly-more limited than after the ussr became allied . 
  remember , this predated the visible failure of communist economies to make good on the hopes of its advocates . 
  there were ongoing insurgencies across europe , a number of which had substantial or dominant pro-communist elements ( france , greece , yugoslavia ) . 
  these would now become hostile . 
  * fourth , the us had agreed to `` europe first '' ( though it kept fighting what it thought of as `` its own '' war in the pacific , the attacks on the us and the taking of us territory had happened on behalf of japan ) . 
  the us had to pull its forces in europe over there to finish up the war in the pacific -- for the us , the end of the war in europe was when it could finally get the green light to finally go finish up its own real concerns . 
  fighting the ussr before this would have meant the ussr supporting japan and restarting the japanese war . 
  after this point , it would have meant declaring war in multiple countries on behalf of two very war-weary publics , then shipping everything back over to europe and reopening a new war . 
  remember , nato did n't exist then , and the us public had n't wanted anything to do with european spats in the * first * place -- it was only japan attacking the us and then germany declaring war on the us that changed public opinion . 
  the us had no military obligation to do this -- remember , this predated nato -- though it arguably would have preferred to have the ussr out of eastern europe . 
  * fifth , there 's probably a fair argument that , yes , while the ussr * had * been initially cutting deals with hitler to carve up eastern europe , it had also been a wartime ally that the us and the uk had been fighting alongside for some time . 
  there had been massive wartime propaganda out for years now selling the image of the russians as friendly and germany as an enemy : this would mean scraping up what was left of nazi germany 's military , allying with it , and going up against the ussr territory .
