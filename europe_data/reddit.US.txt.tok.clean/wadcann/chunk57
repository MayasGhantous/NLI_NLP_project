  national policy could pivot quickly , but war really requires some significant degree of public support , and that was going to be a difficult sell . 
  i 've [ commented on this before in more detail ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/34t672/on_this_day_latvia_celebrates_25_years_freedom/cqygn48 ) . 
  yup . 
  also , use of the more-familiar-to-cold-war-era-folks russian spellings versus ukranian spellings for things in ukraine , like the russian `` kiev '' versus the ukranian `` kyiv '' , or the possibly-more-significant-given-the-current-situation russian `` donbass '' versus ukranian `` donbas '' . 
  you 'll notice that the bulk of the recent us state department documents have been [ using the ukranian form ] ( https://startpage.com/do/search?q=site:state.gov%20%22donbas%22%202015 ) , probably with very intentional meaning , versus [ the russian form ] ( https://startpage.com/do/search?q=site:state.gov%20%22donbass%22%202015 ) . 
  i 'm * assuming * that pretty much everyone said `` english '' as the * first * most useful foreign language , and the uk ( for whom english is n't a foreign language ) simply put french there . 
  that first-place foreign language ranking was n't visible on the map , so instead second-place spanish showed up on the map . 
   mr hammond said the continent could not absorb `` millions '' of africans well , technically it * could * . 
  europe might not like the * effects * of it , but it would be well-within europe 's capabilities . 
  that 's just an assertion of an ethical system -- it 's on par with saying `` letting someone avoid an unpleasant punishment is immoral '' . 
  well , i do n't set us policy , but i would point out that the us did do korea and vietnam . 
  i do n't know the georgian history ; i 'm assuming that any us military presence would have been part of the [ nato partnership for peace program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partnership_for_peace ) . 
  that 's a training program , not a defense pact . 
  any us soldiers who had independently gone out and attacked russian forces in georgia would have been ( rightly ) court-martialed -- they do n't have authority to open hostilities with russia , and i 'd be pretty confident that the same would be true of soldiers pretty much anywhere : they are n't allowed to just randomly make war on countries that they do n't agree with . 
  i think that there is a legitimate point that it is in the interests of nuclear powers , if they want to seriously promote nonproliferation , to one-way-or-another ensure the security of countries that would otherwise require nuclear weapons . 
  i doubt that i 'd agree with his general position , but i can only assume that he 's reason to believe that the same negative bits would n't come up again . 
  i 'm curious whether mr. farage is intentionally saying `` the ukraine '' instead of `` ukraine '' as a political point or if it 's just on par with the occasional spent-a-lot-of-time-during-the-cold-war us politician letting `` czechoslovakia '' slip . 
  i 'd say that it was more the end-of-world-war-ii uk 's inability to do anything than because churchill simply sold poland . 
  yeah , the initial uk-and-france-don ` t-immediately-become-involved thing was a legitimate complaint , but later on , when churchill was in office ? 
  if you want to blame someone , it 'd make more sense to blame the us -- fdr was a lot less-interested in poland than churchill , fdr had a higher opinion of stalin 's willingness to play nice than churchill , churchill was the one pushing hard for something to be done about poland , and realistically , at the time , the us would have to be driving any serious attempt to get the ussr out of poland . 
  honestly , gibraltar is a lot more strategically-important than land 's end . 
  well , or at least it was . 
  i do n't know how important it is to controlling the mediterranean 's mouth these days . 
  right last name , but it was the other president roosevelt . 
  * [ teddy roosevelt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theodore_roosevelt ) was president at the turn of the century , and was famous for kicking off the park/conservation movement . 
  he 's the one with the round glasses . 
  * [ franklin d. roosevelt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franklin_d._roosevelt ) was president during part of the depression and most of world war ii . 
  he was famous for leading the us in world war ii and adopting a higher degree of government influence on the economy . 
  he 's the one with the wheelchair . 
  i do n't see how diplomats sitting in a room with no intent to make meaningful treaties on either side would resolve issues over the frustrated claims of either , to be honest . 
  france and the uk together amount to nearly 20 % of the us 's military budget . 
  that 's a [ substantial amount of clout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) . 
  and remember that the us has n't started moving military into ukraine , if this is specifically over `` should nato members be militarily-engaging russia over the russian invasion of ukraine ? '', 
  i do think that someone saying `` we want some degree of stronger assurances that nato will stand behind its members in an article 5 invocation in eastern europe '' is reasonable , though . 
  i do n't know what would count as a convincing guarantee , but if we are to agree to a treaty , ensuring that it 's clear that we 'd follow up on the commitments seems to be a sensible principle . 
   admitting poland ... might have been a mistake i do n't think that mr. corbyn and mr. churchill would have gotten along very well . 
  http://livelyrun.com/from-the-farmer/encountering-american-culture-cheese-foreigner/  i would like to introduce myself : my name is aur\u00e9liane and i am a french student from lyon . 
  i am 22 years old and am currently studying for a master 's degree in agronomy and food at the ensat ( a french graduate school ) and for an oenology degree in toulouse .

   `` i am satisfied , '' donnelly said , `` that prolonged exposure to involuntary solitary confinement exacts a significant physiological toll , is damaging to the integrity of the mind and personality , and is damaging to the bodily integrity of the person . '', 
  ca n't dispute that . 
  still do n't have a problem with it . 
  i still think some countries get criticized more than others . 
  i 'd say that generally : * the baltics and scandinavia get it relatively-easily ( though dickrhino is a mod and popular artist and gives his own sweden a hard time ) . 
  in fact , i 'm pretty sure that polandball introduced a number of people on this side of the atlantic on that forum to at least a basic background of estonia 's concerns , since for some reason , estonia comes up quite a bit and the polandball artists seem to have some degree of affection for estonia . 
  * greece * tends * to be negative ( unless a cartoon is about germany torturing greece in some way , in which case i guess greece is at least possible to sympathize with ) . 
  * poland is pretty much always a `` good '' character ( i do n't recall ever seeing an `` evil poland '' comic ) , but also is usually presented as ineffective , maybe not always that bright , and the `` just a plumber for the uk '' bit is driven in constantly and with a sledgehammer . 
  * russia usually gets portrayed as a thug and a drunkard , though at least basically-competent outside of that . 
  * canada ( except a month that was specifically-devoted to bashing canada ) nearly always is portrayed more-or-less positively . 
  * * modern * germany is normally portrayed more-or-less positively , albeit perhaps in a kind-of-flat way ( `` germans work a lot ! '' ), 
  * the us * usually * gets portrayed in a positive light , aside from being fat . 
  * romania tends to be portrayed as incompetent or at least always having bad things happen to him . 
  http://time.com/22011/europes-war-on-american-cheese/  it 's going to be a hard fight , but i do n't see the u.s. relenting on this topic .

  good job , romania !, 
  you 're a model for other countries re : attacking corruption !, 
  if you 'll note the bit i 'm quoting :  a strong dollar has seen commodities lose value and the price of corn drop by about 15 percent ... 
  it 's possible that they 're talking about the australian dollar or the canadian dollar , but given that it 's an unqualified `` dollar '' and the publication in question is an american one , i 'm assuming that the article is saying that the us dollar being strong made life difficult for ukranian corn exports . 
  i 'm not a corn expert , but that seems fairly counter-intuitive to me . 
  i smell a profit opportunity -- towel spot reservation ahead-of-time . 
  establish a company that takes reservations and sends out their workers to do it at scale -- fewer trips , since they do n't need to do a pass per towel . 
  even better -- there 's no reason to have that company charge a flat rate for the beach slots reservations . 
  you could auction them and provide a more-efficient market for the limited resource !, 
  and if you added a temporal aspect to the slots being bid upon , say , bidding on a slot from 9:00 am to 11:00 am you would n't even need to worry about the `` slot being tied up due to having a reservation system '' wastage . 
  provide an app or a website and provide cancellation services as well , so that you do n't wind up forcing someone to pay for a slot if they wound up somewhere else . 
  as a value-add , bundle pre-shipping goods to the spot when you show up , like chilled beer or whatever it is that people like on the beach over there . 
  i bet that the consumers in the eu would love a more-competitive market . 
   but some factors are well outside verzhykhovskiy 's control . 
  a strong dollar has seen commodities lose value and the price of corn drop by about 15 percent since the start of the year . 
    `` prices are not good , '' the young farm boss conceded . 
  `` we operate without a profit on most of our cereals . '', 
    this has cut off foreign investments and left ukrainian farmers reliant on local banks for loans loaded with exorbitant interest rates few can afford . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  first , the us is [ easily the largest corn exporter in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_maize_exports ) . 
  i 'd think that a strong dollar should make the us less-competitive . 
  if you 're the fourth-largest corn exporter , i 'd think that the leading one becoming less-competitive would be great from your standpoint . 
  second , i would think that a strong dollar ( relative to the hryvnia ) would tend to * increase * foreign investments in ukraine . 
  it would mean both that capital in the us would have an incentive to invest in ukraine and that people elsewhere in the world who might have invested in us agriculture would have an incentive to instead invest in ukranian agriculture . 
   almost nobody here belives in real support in case of some war against russia really ? 
  hmm . 
  [ clearly , what we need is a doomsday machine !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmckji3ckge ), 
  realistically , given the small amount of military funding ukraine has actually gotten , they could probably kickstarterize things like `` bulletproof vests for our soldiers '' and actually get meaningful money .
