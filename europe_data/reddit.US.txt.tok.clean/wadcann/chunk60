  also , i was not expecting canada to be at the bottom of the anglosphere or slovenia to be showing up most of europe . 
  also , re : the illegal immigration question , libya is a whole lot more educated than eritrea . 
  i omitted countries without sufficient data to rank ( e.g. 
  north korea ) . 
  well , here 's a [ non-phonetic transcript of * the big lebowski * in polish ] ( http://www.yifysubtitles.com/subtitle/the-big-lebowski-polish-yify-48086.zip ) , and the [ corresponding english text ] ( http://www.yifysubtitles.com/subtitle/the-big-lebowski-english-yify-23717.zip ) , which is a first step . 
  `` kurwa '' is used eight times . 
  he can do pretty much whatever he wants for four years , unless he [ violates certain laws that relate to his office ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_crimes_and_misdemeanors#united_states ) and becomes [ impeached ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impeachment_in_the_united_states ) and potentially then could be removed from office in such a case . 
  even then , the option of the `` nixon '' route out -- to preempt this and hand off office to a successor in exchange for a pardon from them and thus effective legal immunity -- makes them , for most intents-and-purposes , not strongly-constrained by law . 
  he * does * run the risk of having a hostile legislature ( unlike a parliamentary system , where the legislature and the head of the executive are necessarily-aligned ) , but on the other hand , he is n't really subject to any immediate political demands of the public other than in his first term re-election . 
  a [ us president today also tends to hold a more-powerful position than his predecessors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_the_united_states#critics_of_presidency.27s_evolution ) . 
  poland abides . 
  in the long term , hiv resistant mutations start showing up and spreading , though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiv_immunity so if it * did * lead to non-condom-use in russia , russian health officials * could * be said to be curing aids , albeit in a rather expensive way . 
  i like privacy , but i 'm not yet convinced that right-to-be-forgotten is a good idea . 
  i think that there are serious enforceability questions about it , and you do n't want to just penalize the good guys and reward the bad guys . 
  i could see radical legislation to protect privacy , but i think that it would have to do something like requiring a sandbox on the local machine and not allowing information to leave the * sandbox * . 
  also , i 'd assume that it adds legislative overhead to a number of common tasks ( like dealing with backup processing ) . 
  i 've been underwhelmed by practical implementations of things like [ hippa compliance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/health_insurance_portability_and_accountability_act#privacy_rule ) , which is probably the closest us privacy legislation equivalent . 
  it adds a lot of cost , and it is not clear to me that it gains much by way of privacy . 
  i do n't know ... it opens a lot of interesting questions , though . 
  * first , questions of jurisdiction . 
  what about a law intended to protect citizens of a country where operators may be in other states and normally have no interaction with citizens in that country ? 
  i 'd be inclined to say `` no jurisdiction ; you need something like international ip agreements '' ... but maybe in the future , we adopt some sort of * general * jurisdiction over information across borders . 
  * second , questions of how a state can improve privacy . 
  i personally think that privacy has real value * and * i think that it 's hard for joe blow to evaluate the costs of data-mining or what might be mined * and * i personally would like a more-private world than is generally available for myself ... and certainly better for joe blow , who has it even worse . 
  i 'd * like * real improvements here , but there are hard technical questions , and there are certain conflicts . 
  states want to be able to spy on people and want to be able to track financial transactions . 
  companies have consumers that are unwilling to pay much money for services , who are willing to surrender some of their information instead for a `` free '' service , but either place a low premium on privacy or do n't understand what information is being taken or the implications of it being mined . 
  i also think that as laws were made to address social norms in a different technological environment , we have not really updated the laws -- instead , we 've simply expected social norms to change . 
  in 1850 , not having an expectation of privacy in a public place meant that someone who saw you could report what you did . 
  for a few people ( suspected criminals or spies ) , it was possible to hire plainclothes policemen to follow them around and report on them , at least for short periods of time . 
  in 2020 , not having an expectation of privacy in a public place means that cheap cameras around a city can record what you 're doing , where your car 's license plate goes , and integrating cameras with some image-processing and - recognition software can permit widespread monitoring of an entire society by a small number of people . 
  that 's a huge change in the reality on the ground , even though the laws have n't changed . 
  heck , go back to 1850 , and if you had a bad reputation in one area in some frontier place , you could simply drift off to somewhere else and get a clean slate . 
  today , there 's no reason for facebook or twitter or a million other companies not to record every statement or misstep you make for the rest of your life . 
  i act differently in front of my parents , in front of my friends , and in front of my co-workers , and it 's not clear to me that i want everything i do to be forcibly-merged and placed on a billboard for the world to see . 
  maybe that world would be all right , and maybe it would n't , but i 'm not enthusiastic about being forced into it . 
  * third , questions of the relative importance of rights . 
  i * like * the ability to speak freely about someone . 
  at least in the us , the core of free speech since the beginning is * political * free speech -- being able to talk about a politician 's or a policy 's history and critique it . 
  letting someone block their background from being spread around conflicts with this . 
  [ or this b-52 strategic bomber not quite pulling off extremely low-altitude aerobatics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjfib1l3bpu&amp;t=1m23s ) . 
  [ accidentally dunking your helicopter into a lake ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqepxbygckw ) comes about as close to disaster as you can get and actually save the aircraft . 
  i know that sometimes people duck when an aircraft comes at them because it 's hard not to flinch , but that guy actually would have been hit in the head without ducking . 
  some military aircraft have [ terrain-following radar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrain-following_radar ) to permit computer-driven lower-altitude flight than can reasonably be done manually . 
  wikipedia says that some of these systems can `` even '' go below 100 feet ( ~ 33m ) . 
  i think that that thing spent at least some time cruising at maybe 6 feet ( ~ 2m ) . 
  for a complete world list , [ wikipedia : list of countries by nobel laureats per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_nobel_laureates_per_capita ) . 
   if the us would try to counter china they 'd just park their navy in the pacific there is an ongoing increase in the us military in the area . 
  it 's not presently huge , but [ looking at one summary ] ( http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/the-pacific-pivot/pacific-pivot-makes-modest-gains-in-early-years-1.355216 ) : * 10 % increase in men : `` the number of troops in the region rose by 22,000 , from 244,000 to 266,000 , based on data obtained from pacom , pacific fleet , pacific air forces and army pacific . '', 
  * a few more warships were moved out : `` the navy forward-deployed additional forces west of the international date line , with two more destroyers stationed in japan and a second littoral combat ship in singapore '' * more us soldiers added to australia : `` the marine corps created a marine rotational force-darwin in northern australia , deploying 1,150 marines and increasing bilateral training . '', 
  * increased spending on multi-nation pacific exercises : `` under its pacific pathways concept , the army deployed highly trained units for multiple sequential exercises with nations throughout the region , providing a presence without permanent bases -- and their inherent costs . 
  usarpac doubled the amount it spent on security cooperation since 2011 to $ 30.5 million . '', 
  * air power buildup : `` the number of marine corps aircraft rose from 416 to 630 , while the navy 's increased from 1,056 to 1,111 . '', 
  now , none of this sounds like much , but keep in mind that this is during a time when the us military has seen substantial budget losses . 
  ahhh , okay , gotcha !, 
  maybe i 'm not getting your point . 
  the immunity ? 
  no , because the spy was permitted to leave rather than to go to jail -- the diplomatic immunity let him go to the border without fear of prison , not simply stay even if the country he 's staying in wants him expelled . 
  okay , so if i understand correctly , you 're aiming for basically adopting socialism in russia without world revolution , and saying that that could be successful if not for the resources expended internationally . 
  assuming that the socialist order imposes a more-egalitarian order than would otherwise be the case , how do you prevent professional classes from leaving the country ? 
  or if you permit this , how do you keep the economy functioning sufficiently ? 
   the idea would be to allow users to submit `` tweet '' - style posts with potential solutions and receive upvotes from other users . 
  complex solutions in 140 characters ? 
   80 percent relative to what percentage of a global average ? 
   they 're not coming here because of some idle urge , like picking up a fiver dropped in the road . 
  they 're coming because what 's behind them is utterly awful . 
  will the british press * ever * stop sniping at france ? 
   `` when we have so little to go on , we have to turn to dna profiling to find the answer . 
  and we ca n't get that kind of thing done here , '' he says . 
  hmm . 
  http://dnapolicyinitiative.org/resources/dna-databases-and-human-rights/  in 2010 , putting someone 's dna profile on the database in england and wales was estimated to cost # 30 to # 40 ( usd 46-62 ) that really does n't seem as if it would be that far out-of-reach . 
  a year ago : [ the baltics acquire $ 55m in anti-tank javelins and $ 63m in anti-tank carl gustavs ] ( http://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2014/10/29/to_beat_russian_tanks_the_baltic_states_are_studying_the_georgia_war_107518.html ) and now the stingers . 
  that 's a lot more anti-armor and anti-air oomph to infantry . 
  [ link to the actual thread in question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/3fm0sv/latvia_to_study_material_and_moral_damage/ctqeetb ) . 
  i do n't think that chewbacca81 is representative of / r/russia as a whole : i 've read a lot of his comments before , and he 's on the neo-imperialist edge . 
   ~ ~ based on oil ~ ~ based on a single , volatile industry of any sort . 
  i think that the article makes more out of this than it really is . 
  some russian spy with diplomatic immunity gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar in sweden ; my guess is that russia regularly does spy in sweden , and that this is n't new . 
  sweden boots him out : that 's also not unsurprising for someone with diplomatic immunity caught spying . 
  russia makes some sort of vague political gesture . 
  that , sir , is a good point . 
  i do n't know whether the project * does * move illegal immigrants , but i read through the article , and i do n't see anywhere that it actually explicitly * claims * that the program transfers illegal immigrants . 
  it just happens to talk about illegal immigrants and have pictures of illegal immigrants in close juxtaposition with discussion about the program . 
  i remember bush doing that in his speeches with saddam and 9/11 : never explicitly making claims , but alwaaays juxtaposing the two . 
  a [ while later ] ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-poll-iraq_x.htm ) , shazam , the bulk of the population believes that saddam pulled off 9/11 , and there 's support for an invasion . 
   ** excessive greed is always a key factor in corruption ** , but experts are suggesting another explanation in this case . 
  it 's the economy . 
  i 'm not even sure what that would mean , much less whether it 's a falsifiable statement . 
   taken individually , the issues of possible greek exit from the eurozone ( grexit ) , conflict with russia in ukraine , and uncontrolled migration from africa and the middle east would be formidable but manageable . 
  ... today , leaders are having to deal with the eu 's crises all at the same time , while being aware that none of these issues is likely to be resolved any time soon . 
  okay , but of those three , surely at * least * two were substantially-worse in the past : economic problems in europe , and conflict with the ussr ? 
  eleventh century : christianity 's expansion into scandinavia causes economic pressures ending the viking era : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vikings#end_of_the_viking_age  the assimilation of the nascent scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of european christendom altered the aspirations of scandinavian rulers and of scandinavians able to travel overseas , and changed their relations with their neighbours . 
  one of the primary sources of profit for the vikings had been slave-taking . 
  the medieval church held that christians should not own fellow christians as slaves , so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern europe . 
  this took much of the economic incentive out of raiding , though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century . 
  scandinavian predation in christian lands around the north and irish seas diminished markedly . 
  the vikings have been asleep for a long time , but ... the door opens once again !,
