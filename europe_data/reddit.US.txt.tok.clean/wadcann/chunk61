  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_norway  in modern times , norway -- like many european countries -- has seen a great decline in religiosity , at least among non-immigrant norwegian endemics , [ citation needed ] and most norwegians are irreligious : atheism and agnosticism are the most common metaphysical views according to zuckerman . 
  an end to a long era of irrational religiosity , and back to the good stuff : burning , looting , sex slaves , dragon-headed boats , and all the fun things in life !, 
  hmm . 
  so , what would you have rather seen done ? 
  russia of 1923 or so establish socialism at the national level and try to avoid interaction with the outside world ? 
  paying a bit extra for gluten-free meat is worth it imo . 
  i realize that you were trying to joke , [ but i 'm afraid that marketers have outmanuvered you ] ( http://www.healthychoice.com/assets/img/prod-pack-large/2309-gluten-free-beef-merlot.png ) . 
   if you recall , a lot of chinese were admiring/envious ( in a good way ) of how americans came together in the aftermath of the boston bombing without anyone telling them to do so . 
  i was n't really following the boston bombing aftermath , but in what was was this the case ? 
  i mean , i was n't aware of anything phenomenally-altruistic that was done there . 
   the real issue is the russian middle class , upper middle class , and moneyed classes which have lost so much in their investments ' value and currency liquidity because of sanctions and the devaluing of russia 's ruble and bond market . 
    destroying the economic prospects of :   1 ) people aged 15-35 for the long term why is this ? 
  i 'd think that the younger someone is , the more of their wealth is stored in the form of future labor . 
  sure , if investment falls off , it 's going to hit you , but intuitively , i 'd expect someone whose money is in real estate or investments to get hit worse . 
  i 'm not an expert on pension funds , but i 'd guess that state pension systems tend to rely upon wealth transfer from future generations to previous ones , so i 'd think that the elderly would have it at least as bad as the young in the long term when downturn occurs . 
   in my opinion , the soviets crashed mostly due to a lack of willing to continue with building the world 's communism . 
  you mean that [ socialism in one country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism_in_one_country ) was the cause of the ussr 's fall ? 
   even the us has acknowledged it already given obama 's `` pivot to asia ' in an attempt to appease china rather than go on a confrontation course which would be the only reasonable solution if the us were really convinced that they 're going to determine the global order in the 21st . 
  century . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  appeasement ? 
  the [ pivot to east asia is generally viewed as a counter to china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_asian_foreign_policy_of_the_barack_obama_administration ) . 
  my understanding ( and this is not an area of expertise ) is that russia is weaker than it was , the countries in europe are stronger than it was ; ergo , europe is less-at-risk than it was some decades back . 
  china , on the other hand , is significantly-stronger than it was some decades back , is steadily building up its military , and is starting to contest borders with some other countries ( which , unlike the eu , ca n't do much about china without the us being involved ) . 
  i 'd imagine that north korea is also a factor , but surely china is the most-interesting concern . 
   the answer is obvious , the united states . 
  america is china 's most important trade partner ( russia is tenth ) as well as its most important foreign relation ; china 's other top trade partners are japan , taiwan , and south korea - all of which are major american allies . 
  do n't forget that if you combine the eu member nations and treat them as one , they 're either near or above the us , and the russia spat is even-more-directly-involved with the eu . 
  taiwan probably cares a limited amount about what russia is doing in crimea , but eu members care a very great deal . 
  china might want to counter us influence in the pacific , where there 's conflict between at least some interests , but right now china 's star is rising relative to most of the rest of the world , and russia 's is n't doing all that well . 
  i doubt that china would want to break the current , favorable-in-the-long-term situation . 
  i also doubt that china has interest in creating problems with the eu at all , and supporting russia in a land-grab against the eu does n't sound like such a fantastic idea . 
  i think that you mean `` russophilia '' , if it 's `` love of russia '' ? 
  i do n't even know `` russophrenia '' would be ... maybe [ `` russian thought '' ] ( http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/-phrenia ) ? 
  i also think that it 's a bad idea for the eu as a whole to play hardball with the uk population on `` federalize or we 're taking the ball and going home '' . 
  i think that there 's plenty of room for a multi-tier eu . 
  if it turns out that federalization is clearly beneficial to member nations , then if you can make it work successfully , the uk will have a strong reason to join . 
   the eu strength comes from having many different point of views and ideas < turkey looks up with interest ,

   i 'm sure 4000 $ / mo or even 10-20k rent like in manhattan would be a lot better manhattan is actually subject both to rent control and heavy restrictions on housing construction compared to most us cities . 
   unless you think the average french can spend like the average russian mafiosi oligarch . 
  i think that there are going to be some `` status symbol '' rare housing slots in paris : say , a building that 's a very old one -- and that those are going to be full of the well-to-do : that 's probably already the case to significant degree . 
  i do , however , think that both the average frenchman could be housed , as well as some wealthy russian who wants an apartment . 
   everything is available . 
  there is a pricing problem , however . 
  i 'm just trying to drive home ( `` for what is available '' ) that they 're presently fighting over existing scraps rather than creating more . 
   well why expropriate people out of the town to build more when you can expropriate people in the town and recover something already built ? 
  well , i gave you a bullet list in the prior comment . 
  let me add some more : * because it 's probably desirable to have those wealthy people in terms of paris 's cash flow ; most cities around the world would like to have this . 
  * cities generally change . 
  paris grew to its present size , and did every other city , by building and taking in more people . 
  it 's dubious to me that this , here , and now is the one size that is optimal . 
    paris is desirable   not really anymore . 
  everybody country wide knows it 's not possible for millenials and similar to afford a living there anymore . 
  if you do n't already live in paris or find some trick for housing , you ca n't really come there anymore . 
  to clarify , when i say `` paris is desirable '' , i mean `` excluding price '' -- that is , i 'm saying that the price is high * because * people are willing to pay a lot * because * it is seen as appealing . 
   reality check ; that one is never going to happen . 
  the appearance of the town is the very reason it 's so popular ; and it litterally bring half the tourism in france . 
  i 'm dubious that permitting construction would eliminate tourism in paris ( though any reduction would * also * go towards alleviating the housing pressure ) . 
  it 's also not clear to me that this is quite as vital as you 're making out -- according to [ wikipedia : tourism in paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_paris ) , `` in 2014 visitors to paris spent 17 billion dollars ( 13.58 billion euros ) , the third highest sum globally after london and new york . '', 
  compare that to [ `` in 2012 , the gdp of the paris region as calculated by insee was $ 624 billion in 2012 and could have increased to $ 650 billion by 2014 . '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_paris ) . 
   from google image ; since it 's going to be faster than explaining it with words : http://jenjordi.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/dsc_2474.jpg all right , do i understand you correct to be saying that you like the view in paris ? 
  let 's say that i restated your argument to be `` i would like to have a subsidized view . '', 
  would that be accurate ? 
   there is already room . 
  even if somehow you expropriated all the farmers around the town and built mass housing ; rich foreigners would start buying or renting it all there too and it 'd just replicate the identical problem a year later there . 
  if you do n't fix the prices , it 's not going to be affordable . 
  well , you would n't need to * expropriate * anyone anywhere , i 'd think -- just buy out whoever is there and start building up . 
  as long as the new construction is of higher-value than whatever previously resided on the spot , it does n't seem that hard . 
  the price is set by the supply of parisian housing and the demand for it . 
  if you start increasing the supply , you lower the price . 
   i do n't . 
  i 'd ban foreign unused ownership . 
  if they use it , no issue . 
  why is that ? 
  if a great many russians lived in paris full-time , it would be acceptable to you , but if they only vacation there , it 's unacceptable ? 
   which is still many time largers than the real demand + homelessness + urban immigration + foreign real demand with use of it . 
  well , i 'd call any demand `` real demand '' , but okay -- my point is that there 's still a limit to your approach of `` redistribute what already exists '' , if there 's only so much to redistribute . 
  what happens when a lot more people immigrate , say ? 
    you have to deal with people trying to figure out legal loopholes to obtain housing   yeah just like the greeks or ukrainians have to close all the million giant fraud loopholes one after another . 
  maybe , but you 're going to be facing an ongoing battle , with lots of clever people trying to figure out ways around it , and that 's always going to be the case if you 're having to separating people from something that they want . 
  my point is that constructing more is n't a gameable solution solution . 
   and where ? 
  higher ? 
  i 'm advocating higher , yes . 
   once again : there is enough housing . 
  there are just a few greedy fucks that have it all and refuse to share . 
  < shrug  and then there 's the size of housing available , and the quality , and the status of a particular location , and so on . 
  unless you 're going to simply seize the property of everyone in the country , you 're not going to produce a level set of wealth equality . 
   no , we are not going to play the speculation and wallstreet games with millions of housing units , sorry . 
  the speculators are the ones buying paris housing if the actions i describe are taken . 
  why not permit them to do so ? 
   how about i start selling your house on wallstreet and asks you a rent then twice it every year and if you do n't agree i just answer `` build another one elsewhere '' ? 
  how 's that going to be ? 
  i happen to rent , so that is what happens -- if a lot of people do want to come in and rent at a higher rate than i 'm willing to pay , and my city is simultaneously unwilling to permit more construction , then i would indeed move . 
   except when they do n't and actually destroy your capital , then take the money away from it by speculating 10 ' 000 % on it like hedge funds then just sending it all back with interests in china . 
  then you have no house , no money , and an empty city falling in disrepair . 
  if someone does speculate on housing and you expect them to convert that speculation into a return , two things are going to have to happen : * first , paris ca n't permit enough new construction to block the rise in prices . 
  i 'd already advocate for more permitted construction ; that should n't be an issue in my case .
