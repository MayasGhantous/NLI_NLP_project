  * second , if they take all this money back , they have to sell that housing that they purchased . 
  simply sitting on the house does n't do anything but bleed them in property taxes . 
   if you are going that road , head to the province and leave paris entirely , it 'll be easier . 
  well , i 'm guessing here ... i do n't know what drives companies to locate in paris , but my guess is that it 's access to a large population of potential employees , easier access to the paris food and other services , and maybe status of the address . 
  i do n't think that any of those would be as achieved as well in smaller cities . 
   in fact you generally ca n't build an new building due to regulations about everything . 
  that 's the point : if you * could * go put in a new building , the problem would n't exist : everyone could have somewhere to live . 
  some other parisian in this thread was complaining that he was n't willing to commute in to the center , though , from new construction on the fringe . 
   but in reality , qatari and wealthy chinese people buy property and do n't rent it , because renting it out would imply renovation and they do n't want to do so . 
  if you 're right , that speculation is the driving force , then permitting more housing construction is the best way to deal with that -- now the speculators will come out behind , because more housing construction will drive down housing values . 
   our citizens ca n't outcompete them on the prices . 
  not at present supply , perhaps , but if there 's not enough housing , people are going to compete for what is available . 
   and how did that succeeded in making housing affordable in nyc ? 
  the article was complaining that nyc was an example of a city that had a lot of restrictions on construction of new housing , which drove up prices . 
  it was being compared to chicago , which did n't impose the same restrictions . 
  it was advocating for building more housing . 
   or in preventing detroit from collapsing ? 
  detroit certainly has issues , but i do n't think that they were due to a lack of housing or high housing prices . 
  for decades , people have on the net wanted to leave detroit , rather than to come in ; it was undesirable , not desirable . 
  paris * is * desirable , which is why people are wanting to move in . 
  my point is that it 's just a question of how paris handles it . 
   look , the us have a lot of place , and a lot of money to invest in buildings . 
  the author is n't claiming that the state should subsidize the construction of housing , but that it should eliminate restrictions that would prevent developers from creating more . 
   and the skyline is regulated as hell in middle paris . 
  right -- that 's the issue that the author is raising . 
   if you tell people they can just commute 6h , they 'll simply pick their stuff and all leave like they currently do since 20 years i agree with you there . 
   we have currently 20-30 % of the town empty , and in a couple years if the trend continue it 's going to be 50 % . 
  could be . 
  let 's say that foreign wealthy people are willing to pay the french to own and willing to pay the french government taxes to sit on empty apartments so that they can say `` ah , yes , my apartment in * paris * '' to their friends . 
  what 's wrong with building more tall buildings to that they * can * do that , charge them for it , and then have enough room for everyone ? 
   and if the answer is `` you ca n't because it 'll fuck up the free market and the landlords bank account '' , it 'll just encourage me twice as much . 
  my objection is n't on ideological grounds . 
  * if you ban foreign ownership , you 're trying to redistribute from a still-limited supply of housing . 
  you still have a limited-size pool to work with . 
  * you have to deal with people trying to figure out legal loopholes to obtain housing . 
  if you just permit more housing construction , there is n't a way to `` game '' this in a way that defeats your concerns -- you wind up with enough housing for everyone . 
  * if the concern is speculation , speculators believe that the pool * ca n't * be expanded , and that they can make money from the increasingly-desperate-for-a-slot-in-the-limited-supply-of-housing pool of people . 
  if the pool is expanded , that concern is ended . 
  * most countries and cities would prefer to have wealthy people showing up , because they inject money into the city -- even if it 's via no route other than paying taxes on expensive apartments . 
  * it 's not just housing , but also commercial space . 
  skimming articles talking about the issue , i see several articles mentioning that companies have been relocating their offices from the ( now very expensive ) core of paris to the outer limits . 
  my understanding is that [ after this building was constructed in the 1970s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tour_montparnasse ) , paris clamped down hard on construction with height restrictions ( `` as a result , two years after its completion the construction of buildings over seven stories high in the city center was banned . [ 8 ] '' ) . 
  if that happens , the only thing that you can do is either leave ( as you mentioned ) , create sprawl with longer commutes ( though i guess it would be * possible * to improve transportation logistics to some degree ) , try to have people fight over what little construction has happened , or again permit high-rise construction . 
  if i understand your post correctly , it could be summarized as `` land costs are the constraining factor , rather than construction costs/regulation blocking new construction '' . 
  it 's true that cities are more-constrained by that , but this is not a problem unique to france/europe -- [ * the atlantic * had a good article on keeping cities affordable ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-skyscrapers-can-save-the-city/308387/ ) a while back that compared chicago ( relatively-reasonable housing costs ) with new york city ( very expensive housing costs ) . 
  there are a number of artificial factors that constrained new construction in new york city : this results in very expensive housing in new york city . 
  looking at this , [ rent prices in new york city are over double that in paris ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=france&amp;city1=paris&amp;country2=united+states&amp;city2=new+york%2c+ny ) , so i do n't think that city housing price issues are unique to france . 
  their proposal was simply to build further up . 
  i do n't think that / r/europe * is * particularly anti-american . 
  there are people who get ticked off when the us does something objectionable to europe ( spying , etc ) , which does n't seem surprising . 
  there are a few serbians here who really do n't like the us -- that seems unsurprising after past military intervention . 
  there are a few people who like russia who also are n't enthusiastic about the us . 
  and there are a couple nationalities that are kinda dubious ( i get the impression that austrians and a couple other peoples fall into this camp , though i 've no poll numbers ) . 
  there are also a couple nationalities where i most-often see some people being downright enthusiastic , like poland or estonia . 
  you are n't going to have a universally-enthusiastic-about-the-us population any more than you will about any other country . 
  heck , the mods here are fairly enthusiastic about the eu , and you can find some strong opponents of the eu here . 
  if people in / r/europe are n't all raving about the eu , how likely is it that they will all rave about the us ? 
  the us is big and if it does something that someone overseas personally objects to , they have even less remedy than do people in the us who get ticked off about some government action . 
  think about how annoyed republicans get about a democratic president or visa versa . 
  i think that there 's some * cultural * conflict , but i 'm actually surprised at how little there is on / r/europe . 
  for example , i 've seen people in the us get really upset about what they see as spanish invading in the southwest ( in reality , people there are moving to english on the net in large numbers ) . 
  you see a couple comments from the french mods about english , for example . 
  i 'm actually surprised ( maybe because i 'm on an english-language message board ) that there * is n't * more cultural friction over anglo culture . 
  that 's not incompatible with a shortage of flats . 
  let 's say that someone speculates , buys a paris house for way above cost of new construction . 
  the right way to break that is to go build more houses : that keeps market costs connected to the actual price of housing . 
  edit : sorry , initially linked to a lesser situation ; apparently ltre does n't imply that the tail rotor is actually dead . 
  [ wikipedia : autorotation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autorotation )  the most common reason for autorotation is an engine malfunction or failure , but autorotation can also be performed in the event of a complete tail rotor failure , or following loss of tail-rotor effectiveness , [ 7 ] since there is virtually no torque produced in an autorotation, 
  if you ignore the brain and ability to manipulate tools with those fingers , throwing objects and endurance running are still areas where humans physically-dominate all and almost all the rest of the animal world , respectively . 
  way back when , our ancestors had to claw a lot of their way up ( without any claws ! ), 
  in the food chain with those . 
  even stuff like baseball is showcasing things that let humans get there . 
  well , if everything is nature or nurture , both of which are a hand dealt to you , then your system does n't really permit much for pride . 
  if pride is used as a neurological mechanism to associate good emotions with good things , then , hey , seems like there 's as much justification for pride in country as there is for anything else .

  the average british prime minister tenure is actually surprisingly similar to the average us president tenure . 
  the us has had 43 presidents between 1789 and 2009 , so that 's averaging 5.116 years . 
  the uk has had 52 prime ministers between 1721 and 2010 , so that 's averaging 5.558 years . 
  from a population and economic standpoint , it 's not-far-off the eu . 
  estonia was the only baltic state that anyone had heard of . 
  i 'd think that that should be a positive for estonia , not a negative . 
  heck , how well do you think europeans would do on `` fill in the us state '' ? 
   the fact that bankruptcy is nearly impossible to get in russia is exactly why the banks lent so recklessly , they know that no matter how indebted someone gets they will always be forced to pay . 
  i 'd be kind of curious to see a study comparing ease of obtaining personal bankruptcy with economic growth . 
  it seems like it would touch a lot of things , but i do n't know what the effect would be . 
  ah , gotcha , thanks . 
  in other breaking / r/europe news , [ russia ` was involved in litvinenko poisoning in london ' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fakyb/russia_was_involved_in_litvinenko_poisoning_in/ ) . 
  no , i agree : i 'm just giving context , not claiming that op is incorrect . 
  i 've occasionally seen mention that the house of lords has been the source of a pro-free-speech position when the house of commons did not , like [ this one ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/12/peers-law-banning-insulting-language ) or [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11380402/former-spy-chief-says-new-terror-measures-jeopardise-free-speech.html ) or [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/oct/25/house-of-lords-libel-laws ) , the last one in particular resolving a notable british oddity by international standards and certainly us standards . 
  british legislature does n't have * that * much visibility over here , so i assume that this happens a fair amount of time . 
  i get the impression that i 'd rather have the house of lords or some similar structure than not if i were british . 
  `` child porn '' and/or `` terrorism '' has been the typical justification used over here for monitoring tools . 
  what is the impact of `` a contract '' in portugal ? 
  does this mean that someone is salaried versus paid hourly , or does this mean that labor law restrictions apply to them that would block an employer from simply laying them off or firing them ? 
  according to [ this chart ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/unemployment-rate ) , euro-area unemployment has been falling since early 2013 . 
  today , cursive has an `` informal '' or `` friendly '' feeling to it , because it 's associated with informal documents .
