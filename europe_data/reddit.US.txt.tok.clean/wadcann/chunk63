  my guess is that not long down the road , it will look antique or old to people ( if it does n't already to today 's children ) . 
  usually it 'd be tucked away ** in their carry-on ** or ` luggage ' ( i.e. 
  i do n't think that that 's correct , unless you 're working with law enforcement with special access to carry on the plane , like a sky marshal : http://www.ok.gov/cleet/documents/airplane%20faq.pdf  q. 
  what about carry-on baggage ? 
  the baggage must be checked . 
  firearms , ammunition , and firearm parts are prohibited from carry-on baggage . 
  having a concealed carry permit does not permit you to take the firearm in carry-on baggage . 
  if you were flying on a military transport of some sort , not just an ordinary old commercial flight , that might be different . 
  outside of the security checkpoint , people can do whatever they want . 
  i think that there 's some argument that at least the option of anonymity is necessary for truly free speech ; i 'd be interested in having constitutions and the like reflect that . 
   which is clearly what the imf is heavily hinting at here . 
  huh . 
  that 's a good point , though it went over my head . 
  oh , sure , but then i 'd assume that it 's a business account or something like that . 
  i was trying to think of a company mandating that you associate your personal account with work , which sounded strange . 
   on the other hands , i hear many more democrats willing to criticize wall street than i do republicans . 
  agreed . 
   i would say the democratic party includes socialists . 
  although american socialism is more conservative by european standards . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism  socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] `` social ownership '' may refer to cooperative enterprises , common ownership , state ownership , citizen ownership of equity , or any combination of these . 
  [ 5 ] the democratic party advocates slightly-more redistribution , but it clearly adopts policies in which industry is privately-owned . 
   i left them out because the smaller parties , with the exception of the tea party , have had little impact at the federal level . 
  it 's not my choice , but most voters only hear of these parties when they see them listed on a ballot . 
  the tea party is a political movement , not a political party ; the name alludes to the [ boston tea party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boston_tea_party ) . 
   i will disagree with you here . 
  well , resolving this one probably opens up a pretty big political argument , so let 's agree to disagree on this one . 
  ah , gotcha , sorry -- i 've never used facebook , and i imagine that they 've got engineers that have been doing this full-time for years rather than just making off-the-cuff suggestions . 
   i know people who work in places where you are required ( or very heavily recommend ) to have facebook account . 
  can you give at least a general idea of what this sort of thing is ? 
  i 'm having a really hard time thinking of a job that would mandate that . 
  some sort of sales/negotiation job , where you 're supposed to pretend to be personal friends with people you 're doing work with ? 
  such a glorious source of mineable data -- let your friends leak your personal information . 
  bonus points for having facebook auto-suggest aliases based on information that other people have leaked ... 
  send email , include friends on cc : list ? 
   what reforms would you like to see ? 
  i 'm not the imf : i 'm just saying that i do n't think that the article provides primacy to one issue or the other . 
   did greece not just commit itself to all the forms required of it , without any actual commitment to debt relief ? 
  my understanding , given this tidbit :  according to the summary , imf staff concluded greece no longer clears two of the four requirements in the imf 's `` exceptional access criteria '' -- the fund framework that allows it to grant bailouts of larger-than-normal size . 
  under the criteria , a bailout recipient must be able to prove it has the `` institutional and political capacity '' to implement economic reforms ... ... is that the imf does n't believe that greece is actually going to go through with what it said it would do . 
   i do n't read this as predominantly a blow toward greece . 
  i read it as a message to germany instead . 
  i do n't see where you or / u/halk get which is the primary concern from the article :  but they `` can not reach staff level agreement at this stage '' . 
  the fund will only decide whether to participate during a `` stage two '' after greece has `` agreed on a comprehensive set of reforms '' and , crucially , after eurozone bailout lenders have `` agreed on debt relief '' . 
  that sounds like they 're requiring both that the ez commit to debt relief and that greece commit to reforms : * both * would be necessary . 
  maybe there 's information elsewhere about concerns , but i do n't see how one could extract , from the article alone , which is the greater concern . 
   nice write-up . 
  that 's just musing -- i 'm not an international relations guy . 
  your point on image is fair . 
  on the other hand , what did soviet propaganda look like in the aftermath of the korean war ? 
  i assume that it was n't painting a very favorable picture of the west . 
   as you increase the number of people you employ ( and thus increase output ) , you 're experiencing a diminishing rate of return on your unit economics . 
  this will actually push wages down : each incremental hire produces less profit than the last . 
  this does n't make sense . 
  first , i 'm saying that there will be wage pressure upwards relative to the initial state . 
  starting state : i have 100 workers . 
  they can produce 1 widget per worker per day . 
  they cost me $ 1/day , and this is my only cost . 
  the market price for my goods dictates that i could profitably produce 100 units/day . 
  a technological improvement happens that increases productivity . 
  i have 100 workers . 
  they can produce 2 widgets per day . 
  this halves my labor costs . 
  if i could sell at cost , i could sell . . let 's use an even larger multiplier , to make the situation more obvious , say 100m units/day . 
  however , i do n't have the 50m workers required to produce those 100m units/day . 
  so i offer more money . 
  i offer $ 1.01 / day . 
  at this price , i can find 30m workers willing to work for me . 
  now i have 30m workers , and i can sell ~ ~ 30m ~ ~ edit : sorry , thinko , 60m units . 
  now a worker in the field is making more than he did in the original scenario , and his productivity is higher . 
  true , i 'm not making as much per worker as i did with the 100 workers , but i have more workers . 
  that does n't require that wages be pushed down ; it 's perfectly-compatible with wages rising . 
  if that 's the case , what 's the purpose behind rt.com [ putting out english-language articles dubious of the mh-17 crash cause ] ( http://www.rt.com/search/?q=mh-17 ) ? 
  less than that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fgm-148_javelin  also , javelin launchers and missiles are rather expensive . 
  in 2002 , a single javelin command launch unit cost $ 126,000 , and each missile cost around $ 78,000 . 
  so , here 's what i 'm getting at . 
  the us could just fly a couple planes in and blow up the artillery or tanks and whatnot . 
  the javelins might be more-economical . 
  i would be pretty comfortable in the us winning in a russia-us proxy war , much less a russia-us + eu proxy war . 
  but russia , in turn , is not going to like this , and it 's not a static entity that just sits there like a lump and watches what is happening to it . 
  russia can be expected to respond , and the russian public to react . 
  if the united states had a country fund attacks on * it * , it would probably respond in some way . 
  my guess is that pretty much any country would do the same . 
  there are a lot of reactions that might happen . 
  i do n't claim that any of these * will * happen , but i can think of a couple drawbacks . 
  the ideal from a us standpoint would ( i assume ; i 've no special insight into what the us government wants ) be to have russia withdraw support for separatism in ukraine , the separatist regime to relatively-peacefully fall apart , and for the country to re-knit under kiev . 
  certainly , at the end of the day , having a relatively-stable environment would be good . 
  that means that russia backing down more-or-less peacefully would be the best outcome . 
  if you 've just killed off a lot of russia 's soldiers , now you 've got an upset russian public , and the russian leadership in a position where backing down -- what the us would like to have happen -- may be more politically-damaging to the russian leadership . 
  they 've now got an incentive to do things that visibly-to-their-public harm you . 
  that 's not a situation that 's advantageous to you . 
  military failure and humiliation in the [ russo-japanese war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-japanese_war ) and [ world war i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i ) helped destroy the tsars , and it probably would n't be very healthy for another leadership either . 
  so now you 've created an incentive for the russian government to do the opposite of what you want . 
  russia may feel the need to try and demonstrate that killing its soldiers has costs , and itself escalate . 
  yeah , it is n't going to win a straight-up conventional war . 
  maybe it decides that it needs to make * sure * that ukraine stays trashed and starts throwing money at destabilizing ukraine -- kiev , not just the eastern and southern bits . 
  maybe it decides to engage in any of the other myriad of other things that it might do to make life more-difficult for the west . 
  it might be that russia will simply start feeding weapons back in , does airstrikes , and the war turns hotter : ukraine gets trashed , a lot more refugees get produced . 
  one other possibility : it could be that the us state department is comfortable with the prospect of a russia-created partition in terms of opposing russia as a long-term project .
