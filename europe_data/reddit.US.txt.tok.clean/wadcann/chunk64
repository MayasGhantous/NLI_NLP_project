  russia is the aggressor , chops up the country , threatens the rest , further advance is blocked , side that is n't under russia does a lot better economically and acts as a really-compelling reason to split away from russia for everyone else under russia . 
  it happened before with east/west germany and the north/south korea splits , and less-directly with places like finland and estonia . 
  that is n't very satisfying in terms of immediate return of the land , though if you 've got it in for russia , that might be one of the most-meaningful long term political actions against russia . 
  a hot war that ukraine wins might actually be disadvantageous . 
  the us started off early with economic and civil actions , like funding police reform in ukraine and sanctioning crimea , and in making military demands of russia that would simply render the situation static , which i suppose would be compatible with this sort of thing . 
  no , i do n't know what all will happen . 
  and i 'm not saying that it would be a * bad * idea to send over the weapons or even that the political costs * would * dominante . 
  i 'm not saying that i 'm opposed to sending in weapons . 
  i 'm just saying that , at least in theory , the political costs of an military escalation could greatly-exceed the costs of the weapons themselves : it might be worth considering that cost . 
  for poroshenko , i assume that the goal here is not merely a $ 100m handout , but drawing other governments into military alignment with ukraine : once there 's a commitment , it 's easier to rely on ongoing to support , and it becomes increasingly-politically-difficult for the us or eu leadership to simply stand back . 
  ah , i see ... i had n't considered the possibility of a substantial difference between the scottish and the uk ukip party ; thanks . 
  i 'm sure that the us could turn the tide . 
  i do suspect , though , that the costs of the political effects would quite potentially dramatically-dominate the cost of the missiles . 
    that 's actually not that strange : in fact , increasing productivity can cause wages to decrease . 
    in the short term , but it should actually raise the equilibrium price of labor as automation / etc. 
  incentivizes people to pursue education and go into higher-paying , knowledge-based jobs . 
  i agree that in the long run , there will be a tendency to return , because part of what depresses wages in the scenario i described is inertia from existing workers in the field that just underwent automation . 
  if there are no other factors preventing people from going into those higher-paying knowledge-based jobs , yes , i 'd expect the average of all wages across the board to increase . 
  that being said ... if we can only successfully impart the skills to do those jobs to a portion of society , that wo n't happen . 
  the fact that the [ pay gap between a college graduate and a high school graduate in the us is widening ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/upshot/is-college-worth-it-clearly-new-data-say.html?_r=0 ) ( i apologize for using the us as an example , but i know this one off the top of my head ) would be consistent with an inability to move more labor into those more-skilled fields , however . 
    increasing productivity can cause wages to increase . 
  if i double someone 's productivity and keep them doing the same thing , i halve labor costs to produce what they 're making , all else held equal . 
  given sufficient price elasticity of demand , there may be more people who want the good that i produce , so on the net , demand for my field of labor might increase . 
  for example , maybe there is triple the demand at the new , lower labor cost . 
  that will cause upward pressure on my wages . 
    whoops , this is wrong . 
  you 're saying you halved your labor costs and , in doing so , tripled demand ; this increases your revenue by 50 % ( i guess you have some sort of a logarithmic demand curve ) . 
  how do you think this might put upward pressure on your wages ? 
  because i can now profitably employ more workers than i did before . 
  wages will tend to rise until it 's no longer profitable for more workers to be employed in this position . 
    not necessarily , because immigration also increases demand for existing labor . 
    it can , but unfortunately 1 ) that demand is being captured by business owners , not practitioners in the west right now and i do n't see why owners of business in particular would need benefit . 
  heck , let 's imagine that hypothetically , every immigrant is dead-set on operating their own small business -- maybe it 's a status symbol to do so back home . 
  that would tend to hurt other business owners . 
  as for workers seeing benefits , let 's say that none of the people coming in are qualified to be dentists , and a disproportionately-small chunk of them become dentists . 
  wages for dentists will then tend to rise . 
   2 ) it 's also offset by higher crime rates , lower overall performance in schools , higher intensity usage of public services and infrastructure that ca n't easily be enlarged / strengthened , etc. 
  surprisingly-enough , at least in the us , [ the foreign-born ] ( http://openborders.info/hispanic-crime-and-illegal-immigration-in-the-united-states/ ) commit crime at a substantially lower rate than the native born . 
  you 're right that i was n't trying to take into account additional welfare costs ( though i 'm not sure what infrastructure you 're thinking of that ca n't easily be enlarged ) , and i suppose that that could be important . 
    additionally , placing limits on trade ( as preventing outsourcing would do ) means that you 've a less-efficient market , and that tends to decrease the overall wealth of the society ; it means that people are getting a share of a pie that is smaller overall . 
    i said people in the west . 
  i may have been unclear -- the `` pie '' that i was referring to was in the society that was outsourcing , not the union of the two . 
  each individual society will benefit due to [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) . 
  fwiw , based on [ price information here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fgm-148_javelin ) , that would be $ 96m ( this is excluding launchers ; each launcher costs about what two missiles do ) . 
  it 's not actually a huge chunk of money , if you look at just the financial and not the political side of this . 
  well , russia has the nuclear weapons now . 
  i 'm almost certain that russia is n't going to return them to ukraine . 
  just to be clear , in case people are n't familiar with the us political scene , the `` tea party '' is not a party in the us -- it refers to a political movement and alludes to the [ boston tea party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boston_tea_party ) . 
  communist party usa is , for all intents and purposes , dead . 
  the libertarian party has been something of a catch-all of colorful characters like [ russell means ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russell_means ) who are willing to sacrifice probable electoral success for being able to promote ideological concerns ; ditto for the green party . 
  neither of these have real political power . 
  there 's the constitution party , which is the hard social conservatives , and similarly does n't have political clout . 
  i 'm a little suspicious , though i do n't have data on this , that ngos ( greenpeace , national rifle association , etc ) play a larger role in the us political process than in parliamentary democracies . 
  the big two parties themselves need to remain relatively-centrist , and the small parties do n't have a realistic chance of acquiring any political power . 
  that means that if someone has an interest in some sort of organized advocacy , doing so via an ngo is really the only practical route . 
  bernie sanders is actually a ( very rare ) successful independent , not a democrat , though he 's running for the democratic presidential primaries . 
  the republican party was the party that initiated abolition of slavery under lincoln and was more-or-less the party of the north and cities at that time . 
  the democratic party was the party of the south and rural areas . 
  that remained more-or-less the case for the next hundred years subsequent to the american civil war . 
  in the 1960s , lyndon b. johnson , a democratic president , passed the civil rights act . 
  this had the federal government adopt policies that tended to promote racial equality . 
  this damaged the democratic party 's support in the southern us , but gained it support in the north . 
  at the same time , the republican party adopted a [ strategy to try to pull in southern white voters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_strategy ) . 
  the two parties effectively swapped a significant chunk of their voter bases starting at this time . 
  [ here 's a list of historical us election maps ] ( http://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/ ) -- you can see the inversion . 
  i disagree with / u/harpyson11 that the republican party is n't minority-friendly -- i do n't think that there 's substantial difference in policies at the level that you might see in some of the described european parties ; however , there is a significant difference in how they market themselves . 
  i do agree with him about the difference in voter demographics . 
  a few points : * your description flags the gop as being associated with finance . 
  last i looked , the democratic party had substantial links to finance , and a larger chunk of major contributors were from the finance world . 
  the republican party has adopted more policies , like tax breaks , that would be advantageous to the well-to-do , but it 's not clear to me that they 'd be affiliated with the finance industry . 
  rather , i 'd say that the main industry associated with the republican party be the oil industry . 
  * the democratic party really is n't [ socialist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism ) by any stretch of the imagination . 
  * this leaves out the small parties . 
  these are very weak , due to the structure of the political system , but they have occasionally gotten influence at a local level . 
  that includes the [ libertarian party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarian_party_%28united_states%29 ) , the [ green party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_party_of_the_united_states ) and the even-smaller [ constitution party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_party_%28united_states%29 ) ; below that level , the parties pretty much [ fade into the background noise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_parties_in_the_united_states ) . 
  * in practice , the policies of the two major parties do n't differ very much -- that is , there are only small policy changes as control switches . 
   ukip ukip support british withdrawal from the european union . 
  they are led by david coburn mep , their sole elected representative in scotland . 
  they are a right wing libertarian party ... 
  the us meaning of the term `` libertarian '' normally means not having the government trying to set social values . 
  my understanding is that ukip is a socially-conservative party . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_independence_party  in its constitution , ukip describes itself as a `` democratic , libertarian party '' . 
  [ 96 ] similarly , ukip supporter james delingpole characterised the party as `` patriotic , fiscally conservative , socially libertarian '' . 
  [ 97 ] conversely , commentators writing in the spectator , the independent , and new statesman have all challenged the description of ukip as libertarian , highlighting its socially conservative and economically protectionist policies as being contrary to a libertarian ethos . 
  this post is working out surprisingly-well . 
  good idea . 
  all 143m of them ? 
   but in mr varoufakis 's employment history , there is a clue as to why he thought this was a good idea . 
  because it would make tracking transactions and enforcing taxation viable ? 
   give them all a financial and lifestyle out here in the west , in exchange for their knowledge . 
  ( a ) probably going to be expensive to buy them out . 
  ( b ) what do they know that you really want to know ? 
  can that not be obtained through other routes ? 
  how about just auctioning them off ? 
   wages in the west have actually stayed flat when correcting for inflation for the past decade while productivity has risen that 's actually not that strange : in fact , increasing productivity can cause wages to decrease . 
  what 's interesting is demand relative to supply . 
  let 's say that society needs exactly 300 bricklayers , and i invent a machine that lets a man lay twice as many bricks . 
  now i only need 150 bricklayers . 
  i now have 150 bricklayers that need to exit the market . 
  wages will fall until a total of 150 bricklayers say `` the heck with this '' and leave that market .
