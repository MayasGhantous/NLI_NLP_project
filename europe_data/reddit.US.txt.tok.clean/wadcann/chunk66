   from what i understand , it goes to sea once a year well , from poking at articles , * constitution * went to sea five times in 2014 , but i agree with the broader point -- it sounds like the point is for ceremonial events rather than for training , a museum piece that simply still happens to take to the waves . 
  that article suffers badly from use of [ weasel words ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_word ) :  if you believe all the talk out there lately ... if you believe the rumors ... there have long been suspicions out there ... speculation has intensified ... the suspicion only increased two days later ... and the speculation reached a fever pitch ... 
  http://london.usembassy.gov/gb176.html  q : why is it so much easier to extradite someone from the uk to the u.s. than in the other direction ? 
    a : it is n't . 
  the united states has not denied a single extradition request from the uk under the treaty ; the uk has denied 10 requests from the u.s. since the treaty took effect . 
  < shrug  ` course , i guess you could say that the us embassy in london would have a reason for bias , and i suppose that it 's possible that it 's standard practice for requests to just never be sent if they would n't be fulfilled ; i 've no idea how this works . 
   it 's definitely not just active personnel . 
  got ta be more-complicated than that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_armed_forces russia is listed as having 1,200,000 active military personnel as of 2015 in wikipedia . 
  op 's post lists 766,000 . 
  it 's [ not just access through the bosphorus for nato members ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosphorus#strategic_importance ) . 
  in fact , i 'm not even sure how interesting that is . 
  turkey also knows ( and legally , must be notified by russia ) when russian vessels , including submarines , pass through the bosphorus . 
   how come that the users with contra-immigration posts and arguments are always irrationally attacked i have n't seen that to be the case . 
   there are never real arguments defending a pro-immigration position . 
  fair enough . 
  i agree that i think that it would be interesting to see someone lay out broadly why they would like to , say , increase a particular category of immigration , or why they take a permissive stance on refugee acceptance . 
  i do think that most explanations that i 've seen for being willing to provide a benefit-of-the-doubt refugee status amount to either `` there 's a signed treaty in place , and there would be inertia against changing this '' or `` it would be ethically-distasteful to me to not permit our current degree of safe harbor '' . 
  neither of those seems all that convincing to me : in both cases , it does n't seem to show a real , pragmatic , national interest . 
  i 'm pretty sure that there * could * be some solid , pragmatic arguments . 
  for example , maybe `` the current framework encourages registration as a refugee application ; if that were not the case , we believe that we 'd still have people slipping in , but then working against the system , and that this would create worse problems '' . 
   it keeps wages down for the government 's buddies in big business . 
  hmm . 
  increasing the supply of unskilled labor might drive down wages for some fields , but i would expect it to drive up wages for , say , dentists : there 's now a larger group of people who want their services . 
  [ looks like you 're right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_constitution#present_day ) . 
   turkey is too valuable for the usa surely to the eu too ? 
  the med is the eu 's back yard , after all , and that 's the most-immediate thing that turkey controls russia 's access to . 
  turkey doing something that some nato members are n't happy with does n't change the fact that turkey has substantial value as a military ally . 
  nato does n't mandate that member nations seek approval before going off and doing some sort of covert operations that the others might not like . 
  read the article you linked to -- it does n't explicitly-authorize an * invasion * . 
  someone is just taking an extreme interpretation of `` aspa authorizes the u.s. president to use `` all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any u.s. or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by , on behalf of , or at the request of the international criminal court . '' '' . 
  there 's probably substantial of legislation out there that authorizes people to use what amounts to `` all means necessary and appropriate to x '' . 
   european protectionism is hurting the us economically . 
  because there 's a trade imbalance ? 
  country a has net exports to b , b to c , and c to a. 
  no problem there , though a might maintain a trade imbalance with b. 
  if there 's a trade imbalance just between those two , they 're eventually even out -- us buying power relative to eu buying power will decrease until they ca n't convince the eu to sell goods to them . 
  sure , the us would like to see less protectionism , but the goal is n't to try to export as much as you can and prevent any other countries from exporting to you -- that 's a long-dead economic theory called [ mercantilism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) . 
  hmm . 
  though i do n't feel that i 'm sufficiently-informed to make a real answer , i 'll also give my best response both from the standpoint of what i think would be in the eu 's interests , and what i think would be the us 's interests . 
  ** the eu ** : no . 
  nato provides a couple of substantial benefits : * a large nuclear arsenal that is resistant to preemptive attack . 
  the eu presently ( though it could build its own up ) currently has member states with a total an arsenal that i suspect is vulnerable to a preemptive attack . 
  * easier access to substantial transport capability . 
  the us has the ability to lift a lot of military up and put them anywhere , and that 's a useful card to have available . 
  nato makes that more-available . 
  * defense-in-depth . 
  if russia ever does get into a spat with europe , it would be extremely difficult to also spat with the us . 
  * the us has a very large naval capacity , and that 's a nice thing to have in the military toolbox . 
  * the us has a great deal of air power , and that 's also a nice thing to have in the military toolbox . 
  furthermore , i do n't think that nato has any large drawbacks for the eu . 
  also , currently i do n't think that the eu is currently geared up for leaving nato : if there 's a plan to do so , i would think that establishing an eu military , or at least an independent eu operating infrastructure would be worthwhile . 
  the eu always has the ability , without leaving nato , to spend more on its military and restructure itself to be able to operate more-independently ; if it leaves nato , it * must * do this . 
  it has not done so , so my guess is that eu member militaries currently view the current position as preferable . 
  in terms of vulnerability to us influence : my guess would be that nato membership does n't add a lot of practical us influence to things that the eu cares about . 
  control over trade/finance is a much more usable lever -- in the suez crisis , * that * was the lever that was used , and if the eu is concerned about us influence , that 's the sort of thing that i 'd see wanting to limit . 
  it 's possible that it exposes information about eu member militaries to the us , but on the other hand , it also exposes information about the us military to the eu ; in the event of some theoretical future military spat between the us and the eu , this would seem to be something of a wash . 
  it does force a one-year lag on leaving nato , but unless the eu sees itself wanting to do something where nato membership would be a big problem within a year , it has the option to always leave . 
  re-establishing nato might be harder ; ergo , the present stance maximizes the number of options . 
  it encourages us military alignment with the eu , which i believe is in eu interests . 
  it would be disadvantageous to the eu if the us went looking to find other major military partners that might conflict with eu interests , like in india and china ( or , worst case for the eu , russia ) . 
  my suspicion is that nato is part of the glue helping keep turkey militarily-aligned with the eu . 
  if turkey were to come to an understanding with with russia , this would be disadvantageous to eu interests . 
  one disadvantage would be if the eu were seeking a military partnership within the next year with russia ; the us would probably tend to object . 
  i doubt that this is an immediate goal : russia seems to be independently pulling away from , say , the eu . 
  i would assume that russian interests in an eu alliance would be mostly around limiting china , but china is a major eu trade partner , and that would put the eu in a politically-difficult situation . 
  it * would * tend to weaken the us , but if there 's one thing that 's more-annoying than having someone militarily-powerful aligned with you , it 's having someone militarily-powerful potentially at odds with you . 
  i do n't think that nato does much that conflicts with the eu 's interests . 
  the real thing that i can think of would have been the us article 5 invocation on afghanistan : had that not happened , eu members could potentially have avoided any of their costs attached to afghanistan . 
  if the eu did leave nato , it 's possible that the us would seek individual military partnerships with eu members , like the uk . 
  that would tend to conflict with the interests of eu federalists : having * some * members in a military partnership with someone that the rest of your members are in opposition to would be awkward . 
  in any event , the us and canada would very likely be militarily-aligned , since canada being part of a hostile alliance would be a significant concern for the us , and it would be something of a split for the uk to militarily-break with both canada and the us . 
  in practice , if the eu wants to end nato , my guess is that the best route out would be to let it simply wither on the vine : not take part in any exercises , for example . 
  nato does n't place much by way of hard requirements on members that i 'm aware of . 
  ** the us ** : this is a harder one for me . 
  i 'd say `` no '' again . 
  from the us standpoint , a hostile russia/eu military bloc would be one of the larger risks . 
  eu members control islands in the atlantic , could potentially exert substantial economic pressure on the us , and have the ability to block most us access to western eurasia . 
  being militarily-aligned with the eu helps avoid that risk . 
  as with the eu , i do n't believe that nato imposes terrible costs on the us -- exercises can be scaled up or down as desired . 
  my belief is that a worst-case scenario is worst for the us for the eu -- that is , being lugged into a war with a nuclear power due to article 5 invocation from an eu member is more likely for the us than for the eu to be lugged into a war with a nuclear power due to a us article 5 invocation . 
  however , i 'd think that for economic and military reasons , the us would n't want the eu to be fighting a war with russia anyway ( eu surrenders , there 's a risk of a hostile bloc , eu gets damaged and the us loses a huge trade partner ) , so it has an interest in discouraging war there . 
  the us controls the bulk of the islands in the pacific , and eu members control the bulk of the islands in the atlantic . 
  having the eu aligned with the us helps keep the vast moats that protect the us intact . 
  the main existential military threat to the us is of a nuclear war . 
  that might be an unlikely-possibility , but the more allies , the greater the cost to an enemy trying to pull off a preemptive strike , so it does something to address the us 's largest concerns . 
  i do n't believe that nato membership renders the us terribly vulnerable to eu influence . 
  it might disrupt , say , deployment of equipment in eu members for a while if the us were asked to remove that equipment , but nothing severe . 
  it forces a one-year lag on leaving nato , which might be a significant cost in the event of an eu-russia war , but that does seem unlikely . 
  the uk is an eu member , and the uk and canada have something of a military history ; while i 'm not sure how strong that is today , it * is * important to the us not to have canada or mexico joining a hostile alliance . 
  it would be very much preferable to have a friendly relationship with canada . 
  alternate powerful countries or coalitions , like china , india , or russia , all seem like less-preferable partners to the eu . 
  that seems like a pretty unimpressive deal . 
  http://rbth.com/articles/2012/12/07/russias_farmland_-_cheapest_in_the_world_20907.html  the highest prices for farmland in the russian regions were found to be in the krasnodar ( $ 1,700 per hectare ) , rostov ( $ 1,300 ) , and stavropol ( $ 1,200 ) regions . 
  so , let 's take krasnodar . 
  this is in the warm , far southwestern portion of russia , far away from the cold wilderness that we 're talking about . 
  even if you got the land there , that would be russia paying you ( something well under ) $ 1,700 to live somewhere for five years . 
  you 're telling me that there are many people in finland , where the [ median household income ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_di04&amp;lang=en ) is 23,702 eur , who would go to russia 's far east and live in the wilderness for five years in exchange for something probably on the order of a few hundred dollars , certainly less than two thousand ? 
  well , i guess you could initially-cut the timer on the land . 
  i do n't know the economics of timber , but i 'd assume , given that generally-speaking , traditional farms are a lot more common than tree farms , that after the first cut , your amortized return would be lower .
