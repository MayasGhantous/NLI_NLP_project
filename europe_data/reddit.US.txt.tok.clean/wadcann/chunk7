  the simplest form of the argument is that the whole point of copyright is to fund content creation , and that nobody cares about the value of something 150 years in the future when trying to evaluate the worth of a particular work ( and thus in deciding how to fund it ) . 
  thirty years is probably overkill . 
  let 's say that the ministers knew . 
  * they had no obligation to relay it to us regulators . 
  from their standpoint , it would probably be advantageous if the us never noticed it . 
  * given how widely-deployed it has been , what would knowing a few months ago do ? 
  many cars were already out there . 
  * i do n't really understand why this is so exciting . 
  it 's going to be a spat between regulators and vw , not something that should have a huge impact on the public . 
   media in the uk is incredibly right wing ... or the guardian/bbc to be representative of uk media . 
  the guardian is definitely not `` incredibly right wing '' -- it 's center-left , and that 's [ not just my us glasses looking at it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_guardian ) :  the paper 's readership is generally on the mainstream left of british political opinion : a mori poll taken between april and june 2000 showed that 80 % of guardian readers were labour party voters ; [ 112 ] according to another mori poll taken in 2005 , 48 % of guardian readers were labour voters and 34 % liberal democrat voters . 
  [ 113 ] the newspaper 's reputation as a platform for liberal and left-wing opinions has led to the use of the epithets `` guardian reader '' and `` guardianista '' for people holding such views , [ 114 ] [ 115 ] or as a negative stereotype of such people as middle class , earnest and politically correct . 
  when i think of a british center-right publication , i 'd pull up * the economist * -- which is n't right on social issues ( not that it cares much about social issues ) , but is on fiscal issues . 
   america gets to choose who comes that 's true for much of the world , though obviously not for central american and mexican illegal immigrants . 
   and they are also not as tolerant of hate preachers . 
  the us does n't have a `` hate speech '' crime and most ( all ? ), 
  of europe does . 
  just mentioning this because i 've seen the spelling a lot on recent stories ( probably the spelling is different in a common non-english language , like with `` bloc '' and `` block '' ) : * [ crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis ) : any event that is , or is expected to lead to , an unstable and dangerous situation affecting an individual , group , community , or whole society . 
  * [ * crysis * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crysis ) : a first-person shooter video game developed by crytek and published by electronic arts for microsoft windows and released in november 2007 . 
  oh , the `` you did n't come directly '' criticism is totally legitimate -- not shooting that down . 
  i 'm just saying that such a legal responsibility does exist , and if people traveled correctly , there 'd be an obligation to let them in . 
  clearly , some countries are relying on the difficulty of applying for refugee status under the terms of the convention . 
  note that i read somewhere ( do n't have a reference handy ) that the structure of the refugee convention existed because the us did n't want to be responsible for all the displaced people in europe after world war ii , and because of the requirements on travel , it would be hard for them to make it to the us . 
  also , the original treaty was intended by its drafters to be temporary , just to deal with fixing up the world war ii situation ... it 's just that it was later repurposed as a general solution to refugees -- a follow-up treaty made it permanent , and the time limits on it removed . 
  hence , a lot of decisions that were intended to just deal with europeans in europe became world-wide rules . 
  germany has the legal ability to disallow them from entering or working . 
  freedom of movement is only within the country in question . 
  they * could * grant citizenship ( and then eu freedom of movement , which germany has agreed to , would force germany to accept them or leave the eu ) , but that obviously has its own risks . 
   because it is not our responsibility to take in all refugees from all countries in the world . 
  there is actually a legal responsibility : the 1951 refugee convention requires accepting refugees and granting them freedom of movement and labor and access to welfare and so forth in your country . 
  that could be withdrawn from ( and i do think that in its present form , the convention is badly-flawed ) , but currently you 're a signatory . 
  there may additionally be eu or dutch legal restrictions . 
  everyone would go to latvia ? 
  fair enough , though it does raise the question `` why would you be against migration quotas ? '', 
   6 ) every country should have its own refugee policy , but personally i think that europe should n't take ( almost ) any refugees in first place . 
  highly-skilled workers , widows and orphans should be welcome . 
  europe might want a skilled worker program , but it still has signed off on some agreements , like the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , that obligate it to take in refugees . 
  that treaty does not permit a country to determine whether to take someone in based on their skills . 
  it would be possible to withdraw from the treaty -- and i think that there is good argument to do so , as it lacks major elements like the ability to place some kind of caps in place , which i think are pretty much essential to be realistic . 
  currently , switzerland would be bound by that treaty to take in the entire population of china if civil war broke out there . 
  that ca n't happen ; ergo , the current treaty is broken . 
  i think the bigger factors are what your chance is of getting refugee status granted and how hard it is to convert that into permanent residency/citizenship . 
   since syria is arguably the country worst hit by war , we can assume that 20 % is around the max percentage of refugees we might expect from these countries . 
  that seems a bit conservative . 
  if the first world started doling out permanent residencies , i 'd think that you 'd * definitely * want to apply , even if you had n't been in a turkish refugee camp before . 
  nato is not going to support croatia in attacking serbia to punish it for blocking cargo vehicles from entering . 
  not sufficient for an article 5 invocation -- in closing the borders to good transit , serbia is not attacking croatia . 
  hell , croatia is n't going to attack serbia anyway . 
  it 's just closing a border . 
  it 's a pain in the rear end , and creates problems for a bunch of companies , not some sort of existential threat to croatia . 
  that being said , seriously , the eu had better put out some announcements or policies soon that can be expected to at least short-term slow down the rate of illegal immigration through the balkans , because this is getting increasingly-harmful . 
  i looked it up recently . 
  30-90 days of housing/medical assistance , plus some form of initial screening for disease . 
  for a maximum of something like eight months there may be some form of cash assistance ( not sure what all is actually covered ) . 
  [ wikipedia : list of sexually active popes : popes accused of being sexually active during pontificate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sexually_active_popes#popes_accused_of_being_sexually_active_during_pontificate ), 
  i 'd expect that german-style masonry and bricklaying is more labor-intensive than us-style drywall and wood . 
  `` i only recently moved to syria before the outbreak of war . 
  before that , i lived in pakistan . 
  i had received my citizenship , but was barely beginning to learn the language . '', 
  between the late glacial maximum and now in * our * timeline there was a [ wet period ] ( http://www.livescience.com/4180-sahara-desert-lush-populated.html ) ; as i understand it , this was a temporary phenomenon from moisture from melting glaciers . 
  but it was dry then and dry now . 
  he [ did n't say that ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/talk:benjamin_franklin#born_ignorant ) . 
  `` i fled a war zone . 
  i did not have time to obtain my documents . 
  the regime in syria is my enemy , wants to persecute me , and i can not request new documents from them . '', 
  how do you prove that this story is false ? 
   decadent west [ no idea what they 're talking about ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/article/31488/25-deep-fried-foods-texas-state-fair ) . 
   what a giant waist of a great people . 
  american history in eight words . 
  sort of like estonia ? 
  or russia would have to give up its claims . 
  we 're going to see how badly russia really wants crimea . 
  in the autobiography i read of someone who illegally-immigrated to the uk from iraq under a false passport , much of his family savings went into getting him to the uk ( human smugglers , false documentation , etc ) : once there , he was expected to earn money and bring over the rest of his family . 
  i 've seen a number of interviewed migrants here talking about family savings being used as well . 
  that 's not a poll -- for all i know , news stories have a selection bias -- but it does support that model . 
  going to europe is n't intended to be a casual purchase , but an all-in move to shift you and your descendants to a richer world . 
  also makes me suspicious that a lot of migrants are going to be really , really , really unhappy if they wind up in a situation where they 're going to be deported , since a lot of their resources have been committed to the attempt . 
  there was substantial guerrilla warfare in history -- i 'm currently reading asprey 's * war in the shadows : the guerrilla in history : two thousand years of the guerrilla at war from ancient persia to the present * , and it certainly details rome having problems with guerrilla warfare . 
   hills made of rice i 'll be darned . 
  i had n't been aware that rice was a staple food in syria and iran , but apparently [ it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iranian_cuisine ) [ is ] ( http://www.ehow.com/list_6592786_staple-foods-syria_.html ) . 
  i vaguely thought that it was too dry . 
  not sure what you 're asking . 
  the constraint is n't low light year-round : further north , vitamin d deficiency [ became severe enough to be a significant selector of survival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_skin_color#evolution_of_skin_color ) , and having a light skin means that your body can produce more of it with less light . 
  but humans would n't have been living at latitudes far enough north to have evolved a light skin in this reality : [ spain and latitude cousins are n't far-enough north to have been at the latitude where that selection occurred . 
  ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/heres-how-europeans-quickly-evolved-lighter-skin-180954874/?no-ist ) it 'd also be an interesting question as to whether europe 's population would have ever evolved [ the ability to drink milk as an adult ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/archaeology-the-milk-revolution-1.13471 ) , or whether , [ like most of the world ] ( http://www.foodbeast.com/news/map-of-milk-consumption-lactose-intolerance-around-the-world/ ) , europe 's population would be adult lactose intolerant : i do n't know whether milk consumption was something associated with low light limiting crop growth or with cold limiting crop growth . 
  that 's a different question from what orban was talking about . 
  i agree that permanent residency in germany/sweden has value . 
  but that does n't conflict with the orban statement . 
  he 's not comparing permanent residency plus work in a wealthy place to just work in a wealthy place . 
  he 's comparing staying in a non-wealthy place without lucrative work to doing illegal work in a wealthy place . 
  in his situation , a migrant does n't have the option of getting that permanent residency in germany or sweden -- he 's been placed in , say , romania . 
  so , given that , does he try illegally working in germany or does he just set up camp in romania ? 
  orban thinks that people are going to generally go work illegally in germany . 
  that seems at least plausible to me . 
  on the flip side , a lot of ukranians took a pretty big risk in glomming onto the west , and putting them in a situation where they might be attacked at any point by russia probably is pretty disappointing to them ( to say nothing of maybe discouraging investment , which would make it harder for ukraine to start the climb to prosperity ) . 
  i do n't think that this is a question of values so much as straightforward `` i 'd really rather not be attacked '' . 
  nato explicitly does n't allow admitting a new member in an ongoing war ; that 's to keep the thing a defense agreement . 
  that seems kind of predicated on the idea that illegal immigrants from the middle east and africa are different from illegal immigrants from mexico . 
  you wo n't make as much working illegally , but many millions of people do exactly that in the us . 
   who will hire them ?
