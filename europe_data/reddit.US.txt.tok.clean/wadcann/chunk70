  the poorest is mississippi , at $ 28,944 per capita . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita the poorest member state in the eu is bulgaria , at $ 6,300 per capita . 
  arguably , luxembourg is something of a special case , but the wealthiest eu `` regular country '' is ireland , at $ 68,574 per capita . 
  well , in practice you could call guantanamo bay a * de facto * annexation , since the us has been maintaining a hostile occupation there , and that dates to 1898 . 
  also , the phillipines became part of the us between 1898 and 1946 , until the us granted independence : they are no longer part of the us , but while the fillipino rebels were enthusiastic about having the us kick the spanish out ( and later , the japanese ) , they also definitely did not want the us to go taking the phillipines themselves either , which the us did for almost 50 years . 
  set that up and we do [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bering_strait_crossing ) and fix [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dari%c3%a9n_gap ) and outside of australia and some islands , you 'll be able to drive pretty much anywhere in the world . 
  you 're talking to / u/ltburtreynolds . 
  while he does n't have a flair , he 's a highly-anti-nato american who wants to withdraw from the world to some degree . 
  you and him probably agree quite a bit . 
  http://www.rferl.org/ is n't what i 'd call `` jingoistic , '' but it has a substantially-more-visible bias than http://www.voanews.com/, 
  well , if this is to be read as him wanting europe to build up its military , that 's now russia and the us both encouraging a european military build-up . 
  the united states applauds putin in taking this position . 
   * de-clutter our tax code ( it 's one of the most complicated in the world ) . 
  move to either a flat tax or a simple linear tax with fewer exemptions . 
  lower vat to 18 % or even 15 % if possible to stimulate domestic demand . 
  [ ditto here ; tax complexity is bonkers ] ( http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/24/zakaria-america-needs-a-2-page-tax-code/ ) . 
   america has what is arguably the world 's most complex tax code . 
  the federal code plus irs rulings is now 70,000 pages long . 
  the code itself is 16,000 pages . 
  the statist french , for example , have a tax code of only 1,909 pages - only 12 % as long as ours . 
  and then there are countries like russia , the czech republic , estonia that have innovated and moved to a flat tax , with considerable success . 
  note that moving to a flat tax would move away from the us 's current structure that tends to move a lot of money from the well-to-do . 
  if this were to be revenue-neutral in terms of groups , it would also entail shifting state funding around a lot . 
   stronger separation between church and state . 
  remove special legislation for companies held by the churches ( like they can fire employees if they divorce ) . 
  we 've got pretty strong separation ; it 's not something that i worry about . 
   enforce fully digitized bureaucracy to cut down on the times required to found a business or resolve an insolvency . 
  that seems abusable as a criteria ( since you * can * wind up spending more ) . 
  generally-speaking , i 've been comfortable with the rate of move to automation here . 
  providing back some of the savings on tax filing might make sense . 
   allow otc medication to be sold in the supermarket already happens here . 
  additionally , i do n't really understand the purpose of licensing pharmacists : anything that they do seems like something that a computer could do better . 
  i 'd rather simply automate that and move to unlicensed workers with access to a computer system . 
   formulate a point-based immigration policy and make it easier to repatriate illegal immigrants . 
  hmm . 
  the us has had a habit of looking the other way at illegal immigration , letting people work illegally , and then just letting the next generation become us citizens . 
  our circumstances are not the same , but as a * de facto * standard , that wound up being less-catastrophic than one might think . 
  certainly it tends to encourage lawbreaking . 
  it does make immigration enforcement cheaper and more-practical , i suppose , but i also wonder how many people could have legally-immigrated and thus could have had criteria applied to them to try and choose the most-desirable . 
  i know software engineers that did n't make it in ...  tighten lobbying laws and enforce a public registry of accredited lobbyists . 
  not sure what the benefit here would be ; would need to be more-specific . 
   make party donations and income of mp 's totally transparent . 
  party donations are available in the us ( and limited ) , though it 's possible to contribute to private organizations that promote some politician . 
  i 'm actually not completely enthusiastic about the practices of releasing income from politicians -- that seems a bit invasive , though i agree that if it 's not done , having some form of oversight is important . 
   disallow some kind of jobs for ex-mps ( eg . 
  they move into lobbying like ex-chancellor schr\u00f6der did ) i have a hard time thinking of criteria that would catch every way of providing compensation . 
  what about someone 's kids getting jobs , for example ? 
   legalize cannabis and make lsd available to research and therapy our current situation , with federal law and state law conflicting , is really bad . 
  i 'd actually prefer less use of both , but it 's a really terrible situation that 's open to selective enforcement . 
  i 'd rather simply end federal control of restricted substances and try letting the states handle it and see what happens . 
  this means that border checkpoints and searches become less-viable , but it does n't seem to me that they do much in the us today anyway -- that it 's possession restrictions , if anything , that have effect . 
   open marriage to gays i 'd prefer to have this done , albeit at a state level here . 
   remove bans on incest and zoophilia ( both seem unnecessary to me ) very much agree on [ zoophilia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zoophilia_and_the_law_in_the_united_states ) : this is perfectly compatible with society functioning . 
  incest ... i think that i 'd be fine with that if the age involved was specially-elevated to 21 . 
  i think that in practice , some of incest law also deals with the fact that family may have a role of special authority over other members , and that this is open to abuse , where people are in a position of authority and can demand sex . 
  that still runs certain risks of abuse-of-position in closed communities like the amish , but i 'd be open to seeing how that would work out . 
  i * would * prefer to unify law here with whatever is done for female genital cutting . 
  there 's an annoyingly-substantial pro-israel segment that uses female genital cutting laws to try to generate social splits between the us and islam , and i 'd like to see that political effort neutralized : it 's not advantageous to the united states to permit israel to do this . 
  i do think that female genital cutting and male genital cutting should be acceptable for adults , just as body piercing or other modifications are . 
  there 's a freedom-of-religion issue in that both islam and judaism mandate early genital cutting , so placing restrictions here will cause clash with religious practices . 
  having religious exemptions might be okay with me . 
  i think that from a practical standpoint , genital cutting of both males and females is pretty stupid , and i 'm personally doubtful that adults would choose to have this done themselves . 
   remove bans on embryo selection in case parents have a hereditary disease the us already lets people do whatever they want with embryo selection , and i 'm fine with this . 
   allow assisted suicide and euthanasia agreed . 
  might run into some similar `` authority '' issues . 
   allow anonymous semen donations already exists in the us , and i 'm happy with that . 
   tighten weapons control laws completely disagree here for the us : i want to see an end to an ffl being required for automatic weapons , and for certain other restrictions to be dropped . 
   we actually invaded liechtenstein like three times by now . 
  [ ah , yes ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liechtenstein%e2%80%93switzerland_relations#incidents_involving_the_swiss_military )  * on 5 december 1985 , rockets fired by the swiss army landed in liechtenstein , causing a forest fire . 
  compensation was paid . 
    * on 13 october 1992 , following written orders , swiss army cadets unknowingly crossed the border and went to triesenberg to set up an observation post . 
  swiss commanders had overlooked the fact that triesenberg was not on swiss territory . 
  switzerland apologized to liechtenstein for the incident . 
    * in march 2007 , a company of 171 swiss soldiers mistakenly entered liechtenstein , after taking a wrong turn in the darkness . 
  the troops returned to swiss territory before they had travelled more than 2 km into the country . 
  the liechtenstein authorities did not discover the `` invaders '' , and were informed by the swiss after the incident . 
  the incident was disregarded by both sides . 
  a liechtenstein spokesman said `` it 's not like they invaded with attack helicopters '' . 
  1985 , 1992 , 2007 never forget . 
   lithuania wants to erase its ugly history of nazi collaboration good . 
  nice to leave what everyone 's dead grandparents did in the past and move on . 
  gotcha ; that second lithuanian officer who was being passed at about 1:00 looked like he was in a pretty good spot to spike-strip the car , though -- they 'd had a truck block the road , and the officer was only a couple feet from a gap that the car had to pass through . 
  i think that in car chases here , the police try to call ahead and have an officer throw out a spike strips right before the suspect 's car comes through to blow out its tires . 
  there [ have been times when it 's not safe to do that , though , and then tires do get shot out ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxb-d25vji8 ) . 
  should n't be an issue , since turkey is already a nato member . 
  the megathreads helped a lot with the greek crisis , i think . 
  it meant that you could rapidly drop in and get a timeline of events up to the current point ( though some of it was the mods also maintaining a summary ) . 
  ... i 'd say that things have dramatically-improved in this sense since the colonial era . 
  you mean that there was a delayed effect from some decades back that 's just kicking in now ? 
  [ switzerland already beat you to the punch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_switzerland ) . 
  there was another submission with many references [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ev8f8/blast_damages_proimmigrant_german_councilors_car/ ) : `` blast damages pro-immigrant german councilor 's car '' . 
  yeah ... but the agricultural industry has changed a lot since the us did the [ homestead acts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homestead_acts ) . 
  even * if * there was demand for food , it 's not clear to me that small-scale farms would be a viable way of putting food onto the world market . 
  [ there 's been , globally , an urbanization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization ) as farms have become a lot less labor-intensive and people have moved to cities . 
  also , note that , to top this off , the us handed out 65 hectares per homestead , rather than one hectare . 
  i 'd think that if russia wants to establish a firm foundation out towards its eastern border , then it should relocate its capital to yakutsk or somewhere else there , or do something else that will ensure long-term demand for many people : for example , fund all possible projects out in the far east rather than near its western border . 
  looking at [ wikipedia 's article on the sakha republic 's economy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sakha_republic ) , it looks like it 's mostly mining , government administrative spending , and cattle-breeding . 
  if it 's not government spending , it 's not clear that any other successful industry is going to show up there . 
  there 's no problem created by bombing that ca n't be solved by sufficient additional bombing . 
  thanks !,
