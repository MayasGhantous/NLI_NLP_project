  just in case you do n't see the response , / u/brainlaag just found it and responded with it . 
  while i realize that this is heading away from the actual point , serbia does appear to have a navy , the [ serbian river flotilla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_river_flotilla ) . 
  theoretically , it would be possible to sail down the danube to the black sea , then around europe 's coast , though almost all of these are boats , not ships . 
  * command ship [ rpb-30 * kozara * ] ( http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=669390 ) * [ rsrb-39 \u0160abac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_river_flotilla#/media/file:rsrb-39_%c5%a0abac.jpg ) * [ four ne\u0161tin-class river minesweepers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ne%c5%a1tin-class_river_minesweepers ) * [ four 441-class assault ships ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:dj%c4%8c-412.jpg ) * [ seven patrol boats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:dj%c4%8c_412.jpg ) note that this is not attempting to argue that serbia has a secret submarine program . 
  i 'm not familiar with john deere 's business model , but if john deere truly ca n't meet the needs of french farmers , it seems like a pretty big opening for any other tractor and agricultural equipment manufacturers to step in . 
  this is now the second time i 've seen a comment like this . 
  where did the `` finland does n't actually exist '' thing come from ? 
   i question why it 's in nato because it has common military interests with other nato members . 
  why would free speech be related to nato membership ? 
  i mean , i think that free speech is a good idea , but ... 
  in the us , the auto that immediately comes to my mind when someone says `` volkswagen '' is the original [ vw bug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkswagen_beetle ) , which was cheap and widely-used by college students and other young adults in the hippie era . 
  so at least to me , vm has a low-end image ( though not a negative one ) . 
  is the typical turk aware of the situation ? 
  do they not object ? 
  or is it that they support erdogan and view the costs of damping down opposition to him as worth the costs of squashing journalists ? 
  last i looked , the reddit api had a cap of a request about every second or so . 
  is the frequency of posts on / r/europe not high enough to crash into that ? 
  i have a search engine that i 've set up to run against reddit , because reddit 's search engine absolutely sucks , but i 'd only been having it index my comments ( since i always have a hard time finding my old comments ) . 
  however , i might consider expanding the scope of the thing if it 's viable to pull down more text . 
  if i were sweden , i 'd probably sit back and wait a decade or two and watch us statistics and see what happens . 
  personally , i wish that fewer people in the us used marijuana , though i 'm not very happy with the idea of jailing people who do so and are caught doing it . 
  ditto with tobacco and alcohol ... heck , i think that we 'd probably be better with less * caffine * consumption . 
  * the uk , greece , estonia , and cyprus are the only countries there with a non-european dominant auto brand . 
  * i was surprised by how much `` loyalty '' to a region consumers had . 
  that is , it tended to be people near germany who bought volkswagen , people near france who bought renault , and so forth . 
  i know that some us auto manufacturer ad campaigns try to appeal to nationalism , and i guess that the same is true elsewhere . 
  * i 'd never even heard of some of these before : they must not export overseas . 
  i 'd vaguely-heard of zaz before , though only in the context of the soviet union . 
  i 'd never heard of seat . 
  * i was surprised by the fact that the only place where asian automobiles were dominant was toyota in greece and honda in estonia . 
  while i 'll grant that models vary by country , * consumer reports * has consistently had data for us sales supporting asian auto manufacturers managing to get the highest levels of reliability . 
  edit : it looks like [ the uk sees similar results ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32332210 ) . 
  * i 'm assuming , though it 's not clear to me , that this refers to sales of * new * cars rather than used cars . 
  just out of curiosity , how did you gather that data ? 
  start investing in south american gold-mining companies , since [ china is the lead producer of gold , and the us is the fourth-largest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gold_production ) , and one or both are n't going to be there in short order . 
   the title makes it sound like some crazy orwellian measure when even in the video they clearly state that it is legal to have it in your house but not outside . 
  i do n't think that that normally the legality or non-legality of something determines whether it 's orwellian or not , given that this is typically used to criticize the current state of laws or government . 
   do we really wish to , at large , cling to ` legality ' as the arbitrary and deciding factor of any given thing 's , though laws in particular rightness , necessity , or justification for being ? 
  yes , because otherwise , you have a selectively-enforced law , and that is a truly-frightening thing . 
  then the police are in a position of being able to let off those that they like and able to jail those who they do not like . 
  there is a legitimate way to address drug law , and that is to change the law . 
   what are they hoping to achieve , or prove , with holding an international celebrity for smoking weed ? 
  i approve of going after him . 
  not going after him * because * he 's an international celebrity ( though the visibility of his drug use might be a good reason to know about probable drug use ) , but because an international celebrity should n't be above the law . 
  strauss-kahn did n't get a pass . 
  neither should snoop dogg . 
  visit a sovereign country , and while you 're there , you need to follow its laws . 
  if that 's not acceptable , do n't visit the country . 
  how is it censoring it ? 
  you 've got a stickied post in a unique color up top . 
  it 's available to anyone who wants to read all the material they want . 
  it just means that a single topic does n't drown out everything else , while still keeping that topic available to everyone . 
  well , a human could disable the thing , but my understanding is that normally at sea they simply turn it on and leave it on , and if it judges that anything within a couple of miles meets its criteria for being destroyed ... < shrug  it 's true that humans do drive the ship . 
  well , actually a computer probably does that too , but it 's not one unified with the weapons system , and it 's one that probably operates with less autonomy than the phalanx does . 
  yes , both of the irish potato famines . 
  but i do n't believe -- and i think that most people do n't believe -- that another great famine would be permitted to happen in the near future in europe . 
  it 's true that i have no data to support this , and i suppose you could say `` i do n't find your argument very convincing '' . 
   you say it like it 's a good thing . 
  well , it 's attached to efficiency gains . 
  you can certainly say that there are some sort of positive benefits that outweigh this , some positive externality that the market is n't current taking into account . 
  i do n't see it , but you might be right , and if so , perhaps the french government will permanently subsidize agriculture . 
  that is , there might be value in having lots of little farms scattered around the landscape : if the french people benefit from this , then it is certainly reasonable to ask them to pay more for this . 
   nobody in france and even europe want their country 's farms to end up like america 's with giant polluting farm / factories in this case , i do n't think that it was us goods in question , but certainly pollution is a valid concern . 
  the french people are free to determine how much harm various types of pollution cause them and in what form , and to place regulations prohibiting that . 
  if it is the negative externalities of the farms themselves , and it is true that both ( a ) other countries are producing more appealing-to-the-public produce , and ( b ) the negative externalities of the farms are so great , then france will simply tend to move away from farming in its rural land . 
  it will move towards producing other things , and trade for agricultural output . 
  i personally am doubtful of a number of assumptions there , but it is an option . 
   : - products of less quality this should n't be a concern , then . 
  if the french public greatly values some sort of quality in agricultural goods that are only present in foods grown in france , if they have no interest in the german or spanish ( or us , as you 're mentioning ) or whatnot goods , then it is easy enough for them to only purchase products made in france ; the common market in europe is compatible with that . 
  if it 's not the case that the french public values this , then french farms will tend to be priced out of the market . 
  thus far , i 've seen a few articles about price pressures on french farmers . 
  while that 's not at all the same thing as statistics describing what 's going on , it does give me the vague impression that the past purchasing habits of the french public probably was n't determined entirely by their preferences , and somewhat by limited trade between france and other countries . 
   - more uses of chemicals , hormones , fertilizers this would seem to fit into either the `` negative externalities of the farms '' or `` products of less quality '' argument above . 
   - more pollution same thing as the `` negative externality of farms '' argument above . 
   - less diversity hmm . 
  i 'm not sure about the specific concern here . 
  it 's not clear to me that there * is * less diversity in the goods presently coming in , but i 'd think that one could split this into two cases . 
  one would be that less diversity is simply * boring * in food . 
  that is , one type of apple becomes dominant . 
  i do n't know about france , but in the us , there are perhaps three types of tomatoes , all red , that are overwhelmingly available at supermarkets . 
  yes , one * can * get purple-and-green striped tomatoes , but not everywhere . 
  my belief is that this reflects the desire of the consumers -- and it 's not clear to me that there 's a benefit in forcing them to buy a type of tomato that they would prefer less . 
  another would be that less diversity increases certain risks to the food chain . 
  again , i do n't know about in france , but at least in the us , the dominant type of apple is the british-developed [ cavendish banana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavendish_bananas ) . 
  because this is something of a monoculture , it means that pests that affect this can spread more easily and cause more volatility in availability -- there might be a gap until some other type of banana could replace it . 
  that 's an externality , but thus far , it 's not been one that seems to have caused a great deal of problems . 
  if a disease damages one type of banana , farmers will switch to a new type . 
   - the end of `` peasants '' culture ( food traditions , local distribution , regions specialties disappearing ) well , local distribution * does * exist in places other than france . 
  i went to a farmer 's market in the us yesterday . 
  but it is true that it is not the predominant way that either i or most people in the us purchase their farm produce . 
  so the question then becomes whether , if consumers choose not to take part in this structure , they should be required to do so . 
   - in the long run less regulations to lower prices and compete with our neighbors if france has real reasons for those restrictions ( for example , you mentioned above the possibility of pollution concerns ) , there 'd be no reason to adjust regulations : it would be preferable for france to import their fish or celery or whatnot from somewhere else and simply let french farms go out of business . 
   what i find funnier is that some young french are trying to appeal to their anglo-saxons counterparts by insulting our farmers . 
  well , i ca n't speak as to that . 
  i will say that i do n't have any particular bond to farmers in the us . 
  my motivations for my position are simply trying to apply what economics familiarity i have . 
   farms are dying , some villages are dying because of that , and so are traditions ( yes i know , most people do n't give a shit about that ) . 
  a lot of rural towns in the us also [ shrank down to just about nothing ] ( http://www.geographictravels.com/2010/02/ghosts-of-north-dakota-photoalbum-of.html ) when the us urbanized and increased farm size : there was less requirement for farm laborers out in the country . 
  is that bad ? 
  well , it led to an increased standard of living for the country as a whole .
