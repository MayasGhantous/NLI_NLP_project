  it was disruptive in terms of a generation splitting with the traditions of its parents . 
  but it did n't do what i 'd call long-term harm . 
  go back four generations , and most of my family was doing small-scale farming in rural areas ; today i produce software in a built-up area . 
  am i worse-off for it ? 
  well , i would n't choose to switch to small-scale , manual-labor-intensive farming . 
  obviously , it 's short-term disruptive for people with an investment in small-scale farming , but i do n't think that it 's clearly a negative . 
   in order to do that , we must have more regulations on an european level regarding food and labour laws , have the agro-industry and giant distributors cooperate and finally promote french food by ( for example ) showing that we have products of the best quality world-wide and european-wide . 
  well , i 'd agree with you that this is appropriate if the social structure you 're describing has positive externalities . 
  i am dubious that this is the case , but i would agree with you that if it were , this would be the appropriate sort of remedy . 
   your other argument is that trucks should n't be attacked and what i will say to you is that peaceful protests if they are not followed by a huge majority do n't achieve anything . 
  that 's possibly true , but there are many cases where a protest will not take effect . 
  i think that you 'd agree that that is not , generally-speaking , a justification for simply violating law . 
  for example , i see a number of people upset about immigration here , and people who feel that their protests are not being heart . 
  surely you 'd agree that people killing or beating immigrants would not be a good way to deal with this , even though their other approach is not as effective as they 'd like ? 
   supermarkets have already been targeted , i do n't really see how supermarkets could be seen to be at fault : all they do is try to figure out what the consumer wants and obtain it . 
  i at least in theory agree with your above complaint that there are positive externalities that require regulation , but it is the job of the supermarket to obtain whatever it is that their customers want to buy . 
  if their customers do n't want to buy expensive output from small-scale farms ... < shrug   and employ illegal immigrants ; well , let 's say that this is the case , that some spanish food is produced by illegal immigrants to spain ( and i do believe you -- certainly the same thing happens in the us with illegal immigrants from mexico and central america ) . 
  that would be advantageous to the french people as a whole , as they 'd be obtaining food obtained from labor that otherwise would have gone untapped , would have been wasted elsewhere producing something less desirable . 
   well , for once , considering france is the single biggest receiver of cap funding in the entire eu to be fair , would n't * per-capita * or some weighted metric like that be more interesting ? 
  i mean , france is also one of the larger countries in the eu . 
  hmm . 
  i 'd think that it would be substantially-easier to make a continental accurate map than a smaller accurate map . 
  i do n't know of all the technologies used , but [ astrolabes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astrolabe ) have been in use for navigation for two thousand years , and [ it looks like they could give a `` 5 or 10 mile fix '' by the sun given sixteenth century knowledge of corrections ] ( http://www.longcamp.com/drake.html ) . 
  that 's a rather-smaller error than some of the discrepancies here . 
  well , i 'd also bet that the the `` unanimity required '' thing is also what made some member nations willing to * join * -- they were n't afraid of other members ganging up and passing things that they did n't like , because they could always veto it . 
  it 's a high bar to get things done , but it also might have been necessary to set the bar that high to get anyone to sign onto the project in the first place . 
  we 've had offensive autonomous weapons in use [ since the beginning of the 1980s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phalanx_ciws ) ( yes , this thing is * primarily * used against missiles , but can and has also been used against aircraft ) . 
  in the past , has the political background of the french president truly had a substantial impact on how protests are dealt with ? 
  '' [ businessweek : in france , kidnapping the boss usually pays off ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-01-07/in-france-kidnapping-the-boss-usually-pays-off ) '' '' [ wall street journal : in france , the bosses can become hostages ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb123871251471484469 ) '' the existence of the articles demonstrates how shocking this is to some of the rest of us . 
  the `` die '' here refers to the businesses being treated as organisms , rather than to the individuals . 
  obviously , nobody is expected to starve . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  it does n't seem to correspond to actual features much . 
   levine , a former microsoft employee and democratic party ** fund raiser ** who took i 'm assuming this is just one of the `` political payoff '' ambassadorships ; i.e. 
  the diplomat might perhaps not be diplomatic . 
  apparently [ it 's the other way around ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/time/us/arizona-no-dst.html ) -- arizona mostly ignores it , but the navajo nation follows it . 
  i was actually thinking of [ indiana ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/time/us/indiana-time.html ) , where parts of the state ignored daylight savings time , but it looks like that was unified in 2006 . 
  it 's also not clear that the businessman 's prior contracts were above-board . 
  if it were shown that the dna were prosecuting bad cases , that would be one thing , but if you 're keeping your nose clean and the dna is choosing good cases or the judicial system is filtering out any bad ones , i would n't think that a politician would have anything to worry about . 
  why worry about scrutiny if there 's nothing to scrutinize ? 
   the agency 's zeal has also drawn criticism , with opponents warning 90 per cent conviction rates belong in pyongyang not bucharest . 
  `` in romania the 10 per cent acquittal rate in dna cases is often criticised . 
  in other countries the failure rates [ are ] much higher -- around 25 per cent , '' says ms stefan . 
  that 's not necessarily a sign of a flaw in the romanian judicial system . 
  the dna may simply be only prosecuting solid cases . 
  just to be clear , this is for people seeking asylum status , not just people who have actually been granted it already . 
  you have monaco flair . 
  are you from the us ? 
  seattle does have that reputation in the us . 
  it does n't rain heavily , though -- it just [ frequently drizzles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seattle#climate ) . 
  wikipedia says that it only has 71 sunny days a year . 
  also , like much of the pacific coast of the us , it has a mediterranean climate -- the summers are dry . 
  i did n't know the history , but [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daylight_saving_time ) the kiwis and the brits proposed it , but it was n't actually adopted until the central powers did it during world war i , the allies responded by doing the same , and when the us later entered the war , it also adopted the scheme . 
  it came back in the us in world war ii , and became permanent in the 1960s . 
  that being said , the us does have a few areas that do n't follow it , so ... < shrug , 
  ah , gotcha , thanks for the clarification . 
  okay , thanks -- it sounded like they were often used as some sort of specialized riot-control force . 
  maybe go with cold-due-to-altitude at a more-equatorial latitude ? 
  in california , the [ hottest place in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_valley ) and the very-cold [ highest point in the contiguous united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_whitney ) are only about 132km apart . 
  italy , for example , is further south in europe , but appears to have some very cold , high-altitude climates , like [ aosta valley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aosta_valley ) . 
  hmm . 
  the snippet not behind a paywall , when passed through google translate to english , does n't clearly seem to say that the gendarme was present and just watching : the impression i got was that the victimized owner simply felt that the gendarme had not taken action in response to his complaint . 
  why is it that something like 20 % of the british political commentary i see lugs in accusing people of being pedophiles ? 
  i mean , it 's like the red scare , but today . 
  they 're going to go out of business and be merged into larger farms , but france will wind up with a more-efficient and more-powerful agricultural industry in the long run . 
  the french people are the ones who were being hit with higher-than-market-price-in-a-common-european-market pricing by these farmers in the past , and the french people who benefit from increased cross-border trade . 
  obviously , i could understand a concern that france is n't enforcing violations of eu trade agreements , but saying that you hate the french people for this seems like adding insult to injury to them . 
   besides , gigantic farms are either impossible in europe 's diverse landscape why is that ? 
  also , i could at least understand that being a theoretically-possible explanation if it were talking about food from argentina or the us or something like that , but is n't it talking about french farmers being unable to compete with german and spanish farmers ? 
  well , i 'd think that the citizenry as a whole has an interest in not letting a particular industry try to use violence and destruction to extract money from them , and i 'd think that the citizenry as a whole also has an interest in jailing people who are doing this . 
  it could be mafia members shaking down businesses , muggers robbing pedestrians , members of one company burning down a rival company 's establishment , or farmers destroying any competing imports . 
   who are the ones producing the actual products of value . 
  well , the supermarket is feeding the people . 
  the farmers are just a mechanism to get there . 
  the supermarkets might accomplish that by buying food from elsewhere . 
  ymmv in determining what is actually of value . 
   while the gendarme looked on my knee-jerk reaction is that this * sounds * pretty crazy , but i also do n't totally understand the role of the [ gendarme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gendarmerie ) in france . 
  the us has no equivalent of the gendarme , and in fact the [ us explicitly bans any such standard-military-operating-as-police thing from existing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/posse_comitatus_act ) . 
  is the [ national gendarme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_gendarmerie ) actually even responsible for dealing with this type of issue at all ? 
  eh ... i think that you could find interesting things in this field , but i 'd be more-interested in overall statistical analysis of word use or something . 
  i mean , i can make almost any point i want by cherry-picking examples . 
  if i want to put out the message `` putin is like stalin '' , i 'm sure that i can find similarities between communication in the two eras , just because i 've got a huge body of examples to dig through . 
  for comparison , a [ 16th century flemish map of europe ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:1572_europa_ortelius.a.jpg ) done by [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abraham_ortelius ) . 
  the artificially-added `` detail '' to make the map look like it contains more data than was actually available is a little sketchy . 
  also , i dunno if it 's so much skipping the netherlands as displacing it by a significant amount . 
  but if you 're trying to live in a neighboring country and work in switzerland ( lower housing costs , higher wages ) , presumably that would n't count towards switzerland 's immigration rate ? 
  it 's not whataboutism in that the failure was somewhat comparable in nature . 
  the issue with whataboutism is that someone raises an objection to entity 1 about issue a , and another person responds with a completely-unrelated objection to entity 2 about issue b. 
  it would be reasonable to say `` a is n't unique to entity 1 -- entity 2 also has that same issue '' -- that 's not whataboutism . 
  the problem is when issue b is raised and does n't meaningfully demonstrate that issue a is n't unique to entity 1 . 
  that being said , i 'd still give the us navy the edge on this one in that the russian situation was intended to be a display -- it 's somewhere where you 'd expect something that is as rehearsed and reliable as possible to be used , for the best foot to be put forward in front of the public . 
  the us navy situation was off doing exercises , which exist to try to identify crew and equipment issues . 
  obviously , still not good to have the failure , but ... < shrug , 
  i vaguely-assume that ez spending would tend to transfer money from wealthy member states to poorer states . 
  if so , this would be advantageous to bulgarians , given that bulgaria is one of the poorer member states . 
  well , to be fair , it 's just a plan . 
  see if it works first . 
  you can complain about it if it fails horribly , ya ? 
  that narrator is relentlessly cheerful . 
  props to [ swedish software developers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ea_dice ) for originally creating the modified texture .
