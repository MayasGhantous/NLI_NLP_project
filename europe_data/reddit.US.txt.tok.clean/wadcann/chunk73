  now i guess you can claim copyright infringement . 
  i wonder why switzerland has such a high rate . 
  not an eu member . 
  apparently not only does [ the uk love its cocaine ] ( http://chartsbin.com/view/fvl ) , but the same seems to extend to its old colonies . 
  according to google translate , [ that 's one meaning ] ( https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/ladny ) , but it 's not russian . 
  it 's polish , and the * ladny * dates from the seventies in the soviet era . 
    dutchman : i actually do like my autonomy and with me most other dutchmen . 
    bulgarian : have fun finding any political relevance in the midst of the big dogs in the near future then . 
  [ confused , checks eurozone map , confirms that the netherlands is on the euro and bulgaria is off the euro ], 
  initially i thought that you were saying that op 's article was mislabeled . 
  to clarify , in case anyone else reads the thing the same way , note that this is a different failure , aboard a us navy destroyer , the * uss the sullivans * : [ here 's an article on it ] ( http://news.usni.org/2015/07/22/destroyer-uss-the-sullivans-damaged-after-missile-explodes-after-launch-no-injuries-reported ) . 
  that missile was a [ rim-156 anti-aircraft/anti-missile missile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rim-67_standard#rim-67_and_rim-156_sm-2_extended_range ) ; the one in op 's article was the russian [ * ladny * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_frigate_ladny ) mis-firing an anti-submarine [ ss-n-14 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ss-n-14 ) missile . 
  i had n't realized that europe , on the whole , was so far north . 
  you guys must have some short winter days . 
  i do n't understand the relevance in uk culture , but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geordie, 
  honestly , what 's the point ? 
  you get your degree , great . 
  now you have a piece of paper , and you do n't know any of the material . 
  you go to get a job . 
  how do you expect this to work out ? 
  wealth is also an input . 
  north korea and africa have population , but little lighting at night . 
  for those who have n't seen it before , a composite nasa [ global picture of the earth at night ] ( http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/55000/55167/earth_lights_lrg.jpg ) , removing things like clouds . 
  why was australia in eurovision ? 
  [ poland did ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/31/us-ukraine-crisis-poland-iduskbn0mr0ku20150331 ) . 
   they could n't effectively use . 
  i imagine that use of such a thing would require training . 
   a [ mexican standoff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican_standoff ) is a confrontation between at least three parties in which neither party can proceed nor retreat without being exposed to danger . 
  as a result , all participants need to maintain the strategic tension , which remains unresolved until some outside event makes it possible to resolve it . 
  the us and turkey are already engaged in the conflict , and the us and turkey are n't off threatening each other . 
  if this is a mexican standoff , what are the three members ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that the eu would prefer to have somewhere in north africa to resettle refugees than not . 
   britain relevant . 
  globally , the uk [ has the fifth-highest gdp in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29 ) . 
   you have no idea how bad they have it . 
  part of opening up the markets in europe to other europeaan countries * will * drive some farmers out of business . 
  it 's not like the markets open up and suddenly everyone there becomes more efficient -- it means that the less-efficient producers will go out of business . 
  that 's expected . 
  the flip side is that it also opens up room for other industries that previous had to fund the inefficient ones to operate . 
   you 're willing to pay these prices for these products currently already , right ? 
  why lower the prices ? 
  well , if some other provider can take my business by undercutting the first provider now ... 
   hitler 's birthday , on 20 april , can be coded as 420 . 
  ah , culture clash . 
    first they came for the communists   then maybe you should not have started murdering everyone else . 
  well , to be fair , i do n't think that at that point the communists were as big a deal ; the nazi arrests of communists apparently dated to 1933 , and stalin 's [ great purge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_purge ) started in 1936 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_rapprochement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom%e2%80%93united_states_relations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes, 
  my impression of us influence on schengen area policy is a lot lower than yours . 
  i mean , i imagine that if the us * absolutely * wanted a change there and damn the costs , it could manage to buy off the country in question , but ... 
   with america ... think that trying to deport illegal migrants is racist . 
  one day , as it once was in ancient greek times , everyone will again speak english !, 
  well , '' [ perfect is the enemy of good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good ) '' . 
  it 's a good bet that it would have been harder , perhaps paralyzing , to resolve * all * of the issues across all members before taking any action , so i am assuming that the politicians who wanted to set up the schengen area just passed what they saw as viable at the time . 
  i 'm more-surprised that there is n't a large-scale human smuggling industry via boat across the channel . 
  the channel * is n't * that wide , and if you can make it across the mediterranean , you 'd think that the channel would n't be so bad . 
  i 'm pretty sure that just about the best way to energize voters is to make them feel like they 're being oppressed in some way . 
  that 's just one of many routes . 
  it * does * look like [ sweden is far from being the first country to do this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cordon_sanitaire#in_politics ) , though -- it appears to be a named process , * cordon sanitaire * , and that award appears to go to belgium . 
   who would n't want that ? 
  well ... 
  i would n't call that threatening , no . 
  [ i 'd call this an example of a threatening protest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross_burning ) . 
   it is eu open door policy that made it happen and sentenced those people to be assaulted . 
  i 'd say that an open-door policy would be providing for large-scale * legal * immigration rather than just having an asylum system that 's abusable . 
  i would n't think of protesting in front of abortion clinics or politicians ' homes as a * threat * . 
  rather , it 's to try to make the process of getting an abortion as emotionally-painful as possible ( pictures of fetuses , etc ) or and to try to ensure that a politician ca n't escape shouts of upset citizens no matter where they go . 
  i mean , i suppose that you could make such a protest threatening , but i do n't think that it 's * inherently * threatening . 
   that makes as much sense as counting an election as a coup . 
  this has only a tangential relevance to your comment , but it 's common in parliamentary systems to describe a `` government falling '' when a coalition breaks up . 
  that terminology would never be used in the us -- it would refer to something far more dramatic , like a a revolution or something . 
  the first few times i read headlines like `` the british government has fallen '' , i was pretty wide-eyed . 
  it 's mostly just public employees left . 
  by-and-large , the big private employers of unionized employees shuttered buildings and left . 
   the unions know that pressuring the state with strikes is n't as risky for public workers as it is for private eployees . 
  huh . 
  i would n't want to be playing hardball with the state over my employment right now in greece . 
  true , but on the other hand , england is n't particularly prone to earthquakes . 
  stone or concrete is better in the event of hurricanes ( and i understand that hurricane-prone places in the us often use concrete instead of wood ) . 
   those cheap matchsticks houses wo n't last more than a few decades . 
  a good built stone house will last for centuries . 
  i 'd go for more than a `` few '' ; the median age from the [ us census in 2009 ] ( http://www.oldhouseweb.com/how-to-advice/how-old-are-americas-houses.shtml ) was 34 years , so they definitely are n't going away after 30 years . 
  the population has also expanded , so some of that will be new construction . 
  people tend to have substantially-larger houses in the us . 
  here 's a [ graph of per capita floor space by country ] ( http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/percapita.gif ) . 
  people in canada and australia and the us have significantly-larger houses than europe , which in turn have significantly-larger houses than china or hong kong . 
  i suspect that this is because the average land price in the us is probably lower ( at least relative to income ) than in the more-densely-populated europe . 
  i 'd guess that a good chunk of this is probably people choosing to put more money into land and less into construction material than visa versa . 
  as the footage increases , the material selected also plays a more-significant role in limiting the size : you can get a larger house in wood than you can in , say , stone . 
  another factor is that there may be good reason to produce a new house . 
  home styles have changed significantly over time . 
  in the 1750s , a typical house was a single room , with * possibly * an upstairs loft to sleep in . 
  the construction that goes into houses has radically-changed since that time . 
  people tend to spend less time cooking or doing crafts . 
  artificial lighting has made for rooms away from windows to be reasonable . 
  gas and electricity came and then were radically changed in standards , with grounded outlets , gfci , and larger capacity becoming standard . 
  fire and earthquake standards improved . 
  large appliances became common in kitchens . 
  fireplaces died as a heating and cooking mechanism . 
  refrigeration was introduced , obsoleting root cellars . 
  indoors plumbing became standard .
