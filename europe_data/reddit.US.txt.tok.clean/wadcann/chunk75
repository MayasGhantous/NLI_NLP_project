  i just linked to an entire article with graphs above . 
  ehh . 
  i 'm not gon na try to advise the finns on debt . 
  they 've done a pretty good job of handling debt relative to ... pretty much everyone else out there . 
  because , even if their privacy policy prohibits selling their database to third parties , they * do * retain genetic information . 
  i do n't really want to have my genetic data in some database that can : * be swiped when someone breaks into the database . 
  * may be subpoenaed by law enforcement . 
  [ this is increasingly-popular now ] ( http://www.thehastingscenter.org/publications/briefingbook/detail.aspx?id=2168 ) -- even if you do n't have the dna if someone you 're looking for , we can identify relatives of the person . 
  it 's probably just as well that germany did n't have a genetic database when the nazis came to power ... * potentially have the privacy policy [ held to be not legally binding ] ( http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/contractsprof_blog/2010/08/is-a-websites-privacy-policy-a-binding-contract.html ) . 
  * can be purchased by a third party by buying the 23andme company . 
  [ 23andme . com ] ( https://www.23andme.com/ ) apparently provides/provided that ... though i think that it 's a little creepy to put your genome into some company 's database . 
  perhaps it would be possible to say the same thing about some of the other commentators , swapping economics and geopolitics ? 
   there 's nothing but selfishness if you lived in africa , would n't you do the same thing in their shoes , though ? 
  of all of the countries in the eu , would n't spain have already had more long-term north african influence than any other country anyway , due to the islamic conquest era ? 
  i really do n't understand strikes in some countries in europe . 
  okay , fine -- a bunch of people want to stop working , that 's certainly within their legal rights . 
  but then i read about things like : * people destroying machinery or buildings that they do n't own . 
  * people blockading roads . 
  * people kidnapping managers . 
  ... in countries like france or spain . 
  these are definitely illegal . 
  those things seem like something that i 'd expect law enforcement to become involved with . 
  i can only imagine that the only reason that this sort of thing would be permitted would be because people sympathize with left political aims and this could be seen as in line with those . 
  i just really have a difficult time wrapping my head around the idea of wanting people to do this and get away with it . 
   to fix it in such a situation you want to bring those people in the system , not `` crack down '' on them . 
  that 's what the `` cracking down '' bit is , i 'd rather think -- normally , there are penalties for not paying whatever fee is required , and if that previously was n't enforced , the `` cracking down '' bit will increase compliance by increasing the rate of enforcement . 
  the us has federal highway subsidies : the existence of a highway in state b between states a and c benefits a and c , and to do otherwise means an externality . 
  i thought that employers just effectively dodged all those laws by moving to part-time/contract/short-term jobs for a big chunk of the population in places like france . 
  it 's [ very probable that a large chunk of us unemployment is actually accounted for by disability ] ( http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/ ) . 
  under clinton , there was some crackdown on people just going on long-term unemployment , so a very large chunk of people fraudulently moved over to claiming disability instead . 
  it might be better to compare the sum of unemployment and disability with your european country of choice against the us . 
  that 's particularly high if you take into account the fact that [ ethnic russians are only 24 % of estonia 's population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_the_baltic_states ) . 
  welll ... actually , europe owns the top the civilian in nato , and the us the top military official in nato ... though it 's a little more complicated now , and now there is apparently a french guy with the same title in nato doing something else ... < shrug , 
  theoretically , [ could also be russian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diomede_islands ) . 
  hmm . 
  fair enough -- i had n't read that article for some time . 
   i do n't think the moscow times is western media . 
  it 's owned [ by a finnish company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_moscow_times ) and is very critical of the kremlin . 
  back during world war ii , estonia did n't have any realistic military ability to resist the soviet union , and was occupied , but one of the ( risky ) things the estonian military did was to [ hand off the soviet military information that they could obtain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish%e2%80%93estonian_defence_cooperation ) to finland when finland was being invaded in the winter war :  during the winter war , estonia was formally neutral , even though it had to allow the soviet union to establish military bases and station troops on its soil . 
  from those military bases , the soviet union carried out bombing raids on finland . 
  as part of the coastal artillery cooperation , the countries had a common fire management system linked by an undersea radio cable . 
  the estonians had earlier managed to decipher the soviet secret radio code , and they had access to military radio communications . 
  during the winter war , estonian military staff gave the finns top secret information on soviet troop movements . 
  i am dubious . 
  i * really * do n't think that the iss is a real card in russia 's hand ( despite occasionally having western media present it this way , saying `` we need to go re-create iss transport capability immediately '' ) . 
  the us/european/japanese half of the iss contains , for example , the current iss power generation system . 
  the whole iss project is structured around cooperation , and non-cooperation just is n't a realistic option for either side -- nobody is going to return the iss to being two crummy small space stations instead of one nice large one . 
  so far , this is all based on what some anonymous russian official has said . 
  no official announcement . 
  well , if nothing else , i guess we 've clearly demonstrated the degree of conflict probably seen at the various trade negotiations related to gi . 
  :-) edit : also , the us fda does [ establish definitions for cheese names in the us ] ( http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=133 ) that often do define permissable content , but the fda does n't define a geographic region as part of one of those requirements . 
  also , the restrictions are normally on content ( e.g. 
  must contain at least 20 % substance x ) rather than on process ( must be hand-aged for 20 days in a cave ) . 
  it 'd be kind of nice to terminate anti-dumping laws . 
  make the whole market more competitive . 
  i thought that one was going to be the `` norway sells lots of oil , buys lots of expensive ` clean ' technology , like windmills and electric cars '' one . 
  i can never find that one , though ... 
  wow . 
  i was * sure * that it was going to be [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1wop4p/the_beach/ ) . 
  feta is not a generic in the eu , but in the united states , it would be used to simply refer to a variety of white , soft cheese , and it has been for many years . 
  when i was growing up in the us , i was n't even aware that feta cheese was particularly popular in greece : the word simply meant that type of cheese . 
  furthermore , it 's likely that `` feta '' would n't have been used in many products containing feta cheese in the first place if those restaurants and food manufacturers had thought that it could potentially become de-genericized : they would have put their marketing money into producing a new generic . 
  there 's some concern about granting control of a generic back again -- [ concern over submarine patents permitting control over an `` industrywide standard '' to revert to a single company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/submarine_patent ) or [ trademark genericization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generic_trademark ) are both cases where there 's been policy set up to avoid this sort of thing . 
  i do agree that , in the long run , it would be possible to rebuild new industry-generic names ( or even create new brand names ) . 
  however , the long run could be very long indeed -- people have grandma 's recipe that references `` feta '' cheese , and so forth , all of whom would have to be re-educated , and there are books and movies that reference things -- it could be generations . 
  controlling the brand thus means a lot of money : if the us adopts gi , its manufacturers will be forced to start rebuilding a number of brands from ground zero again . 
  i do agree that there 's no `` make everyone happy '' obvious solution , and in practice , from what little i know of the situation , i also tend to favor just giving in on the existing geographic indicators , if need be negotiate the terms on which new ones are registered , and try and find something that the us wants . 
  however , this particular fight has now been stretching on for several years -- i was referencing trade negotiators deadlocked on this particular point ... i believe two years ago . 
  there 's plenty of lobbying on each side . 
   i can see the headlines `` europe sets out to establish official market for trading refuges - human trafficking eu style '' < shrug  i suppose that they could write that , but there 's no restriction on movement that would n't already be imposed by the existence of the existing refugee system ; unless it was described as human trafficking , it seems that this definition would n't be any more accurate . 
   that would also ` solve ' only the allocation of the migrants not the problem of them coming at unsustainable rates . 
  agreed , but that 's the problem that is currently up for debate ... and unless the answer is going to be just `` boot every single person claiming refugee status out * immediately * '' -- which i suspect is neither practical nor the best approach -- it 's going to be have to be resolved anyway . 
  it does n't help anyone to just have the member nations in deadlock . 
  it 's one perspective . 
  the sticking point is primarily terms that had been treated as generics for a very long time in the us -- feta is a good example . 
  there are a number of rules that normally prohibit taking a generic term private . 
  from the standpoint of a us business , adopting gi means taking generics private after many companies have all acted to treat the generics as generic . 
  from the standpoint of a european business , adopting gi simply means that european gis that were previously ignored finally become respected . 
  it 's not infeasible economically or physically . 
  it might well be contemptible via your moral system . 
  `` not a very well thought out plan '' seems kind of vague . 
  the real issue , i 'd say , is that it would violate in-place treaties without changes to those treaties . 
  if the eu truly wants to take the approach of doling out migrants within eu members , this does n't seem like it ca n't be resolved . 
  there is * some * price at which member countries will accept refugees . 
  every eu member writes down a number of migrants and a `` bid '' price at which they will accept that number . 
  it 's entirely-legitimate for a member to state a very high price . 
  then the bids are read off , from low to high , until the desired number of refugees have had a target country selected . 
  whatever mechanism the eu already uses to determine how much members should pay for shared problems ( e.g. 
  contributions are a fraction of their gdp in the eu , or population , or whatever ) is used to identify the source of contributions . 
  no country is forced to accept refugees at a cost that is unacceptable to it . 
  the eu gets the ( present ) refugee issue resolved . 
  other member nations sacrifice at worst no more utility than they would , were a fixed number simply assigned to them . 
  this process will complete in a fixed time , when the bidding completes -- negotiations wo n't drag on . 
  in theory , a member could even submit multiple bids , at different prices , if they had multiple regions willing to accept refugees . 
  assuming that the terms of the refugee acceptance are clear and agreed-upon in advance and the leaders submitting the bids are honestly acting in their country 's best interests and are informed , this should be economically-efficient . 
   news of previous generations had a clearer wall of separation from the factual news section and the opinion sections . 
  that would be nice if it were the case , but i 'm skeptical -- i remember reading some articles about how a large chunk of journalism in revolutionary war era america was funded by political factions . 
  do you have some sort of numbers or source on news having more bias today than it did in past years ? 
  i am somewhat depressed that the united states is being used as the go-to example for political dynasties . 
  / r/europe does n't have a lot of puns , and i 've not seen memes .
