  i do n't like the `` far '' loading of the word , since it implies that one thing is mainstream and one extremist , and thus simply making use of theoretically-objective political terms becomes condemnatory . 
  on the * other * hand , there is a real difference in policies between parties that are described as being `` left '' or `` far left '' and those that are `` center-left '' . 
  same thing on the right . 
  i do n't think that you can just lump them into one mass without losing useful descriptive ability . 
  iceland does n't have a military , but it is nevertheless a nato member . 
   military officials always want to carry out their projects quickly , cheaply and so as to line their pockets in the process . 
  they therefore hire whichever contractor most easily makes that possible . 
  and that is why they have a constant problem with individual parts and components of complex military equipment malfunctioning . 
  some of that might be because a lot of military material is low-volume and unique , and that makes it hard to do r&d on it in the way that happens with mass-market production . 
  i thought that an early and ongoing focus of nato exercises and procedures was to ensure interoperation despite language differences . 
  and iceland . 
  and turkey . 
  * in the uk , i bet that you eat curries . 
  india showed up in there . 
  * i do n't know about in the uk , but ( admittedly american-influenced ) chinese food is a big deal in the us , as well as chopsticks . 
  * i can rattle off well-known musicians from a bunch of european countries , and i do n't follow music much . 
  * mexican food is also a big deal in the us . 
  * probably a ton more , just throwing those out off-the-cuff . 
  not once the us unveils the new nato dance extravaganza competition . 
  i strongly suspect that i get a biased view of isil from organizations opposed to it . 
  in the past , when an organization seems to suffer from character flaws * en masse * , there 's propaganda involved . 
  isil may not be something that i 'd want in power , but i am dubious that the reason for it getting attention is due to a sudden interest around the world in atrocities committed in africa . 
  perhaps knowledge of the results here would affect the referendum ? 
  i would n't do it for the sake of doing it . 
  there are some things which are probably easiest-done with large companies , rather than individual small companies all contracting with each other -- one example might be oil companies , which are probably the closest thing to the voc today . 
  but there , these already exist -- nothing really blocks a company from growing . 
  i do n't think that it makes sense to try to artificially-create large companies , because doing so tends to reduce competition in a market . 
  to be totally blunt -- i think that both sides are at fault here . 
  i think that there is a horde of anti-immigration folks who `` brigade '' particular articles and downvote criticism -- not because of comment quality , but because they disagree with it . 
  it only seems to happen on an article-by-article basis , and it seems to be correlated with a lot of somewhat-similar comments , which makes me suspect brigading . 
  on the other hand , i think that europe has tried to explicitly-suppress anti-immigration voices -- for example , reading about parties collaborating in sweden to explicitly keep anti-immigration advocates from having a place in government was kind of shocking . 
  and i do n't think that `` do n't let someone have input '' is ever a good idea -- it just builds resentment and starts a convention of trying to see who can silence political opponents . 
  i wonder if that might drive some of the desire to try to squash debate going the other way . 
  i think that there are good reasons to be critical of mass immigration on refugee grounds from africa in europe . 
  on the other hand , i think that many of the criticisms that have been made are poorly-founded and emotionally-loaded . 
  for example , we 've seen elevated rape statistics from refugees in finland listed . 
  i 'm not going to say that that 's not a concern , but it 's far-from-clear to me that addressing rape by refugees is necessarily best-addressed by simply blocking immigration . 
  i also think that it 's often the case that people blow the harm caused by an individual group of immigrants out-of-proportion . 
  yes , maybe you 've an uneducated group of people , and maybe there are some real problems . 
  but i 've seen a lot of people saying that the end of europe is nigh , which seems very unlikely . 
  on the other hand , on the pro-immigration side , i 've seen a few people here taking moral stands that seem impractical , or trying to guilt-trip people into policy , which seems like a bad idea . 
  just as i 've seen anti-immigration arguments have a lot of emotional load , i 've seen pro-immigration sorts simply attacking the character of anti-immigration types ( `` you 're a disgusting person '' and the like ) . 
  finally , i 've seen comments on both sides that fail to be very clear about what , exactly , someone is upset about . 
  i 've seen people consistently accuse anti-immigration folks of being racist , presumably just because that 's the most-socially-taboo of the things they might be objecting to . 
  i 've seen anti-immigration people fail clarify why exactly they 're so upset about someone saying `` allahu akbar '' -- that 's no more than a common islamic saying , and it does not seem as if it is harmful to me , other than maybe not belonging to one 's own religion . 
  there are a lot of potential concerns -- crime , issues from the demographics ( young , male ) , issues from lack of education , objection to people abusing refugee status , concerns about friction from different religions , not wanting cultural shift being imposed , etc -- and it seems rare for people to try to really get at the * meat * of what 's upsetting them . 
  yeah , but / u/vilefrog was rejecting * causation * . 
   basically many , many redditors were saying that there is a direct causality between building a mosque and the emergence of terrorism . 
  i mean , let 's hypothetically say that one-in-one-hundred-thousand people who would join a mosque in europe will be a terrorist . 
  say that you ban mosque-building . 
  would that just mean that people would fly under the radar and then continue to engage in terrorism ? 
  if so , that 's compatible with both your point that correlation exists and compatible with / u/vilefrog 's point that causation does not exist . 
  the last 150 years or so in the balkans is something that i kind of wish i had a history of . 
  i feel like every time i poke my head in to try to understand what 's going on , i 'm not seeing the forest for the trees . 
  what exactly are all the reasons that faction x disagrees with faction y ? 
  well , technically it 's conforming to the text of already-signed treaties ( [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , since that only affects people actually claiming refugee status ) , though you 're right that it would obviously create long-term issues to conform to these at large scale . 
  if you do that , then you start needing to add a time dimension to the venn diagram :  the term britain , as opposed to great britain , has been used to mean the united kingdom formally , for example in official government yearbooks between 1975 and 2001 . 
  [ 29 ] since 2002 , however , the yearbooks have only used the term `` united kingdom '' . 
  [ 30 ] i 'm suspicious that the uk ( or ... whoever ) has been engaging in a long-scale troll of the rest of the world . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_east_india_company  it was a powerful company , possessing quasi-governmental powers , including the ability to wage war , imprison and execute convicts , [ 4 ] negotiate treaties , strike its own coins , and establish colonies . 
  [ 5 ] ... by 1669 , the voc was the richest private company the world had ever seen , with over 150 merchant ships , 40 warships , 50,000 employees , a private army of 10,000 soldiers , and a dividend payment of 40 % on the original investment . 
  [ 27 ] to bring cyberpunk 's [ megacorps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megacorporation ) to reality , apparently . 
   constantly cutting themselves sweetheart deals because they have their own local party . 
  good catch ... i thought that it was just rounding ( the original scores were rounded to the nearest point ) , but you 're right ... they really are different . 
  i think that the original russia score was just in error . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  the germans do n't seem to have forgiven the germans . 
  pew is a us polling company and does far more us polls than any other sort . 
   but as usual , here 's a venn diagram to help anyone who 's confused : i [ think that thing needs multiple circles for `` great britain '' for different definitions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_britain#modern_use_of_the_term_great_britain ) :  great britain refers geographically to the island of great britain , politically to england , scotland and wales in combination . 
  [ 27 ] however , it is sometimes used loosely to refer to the whole of the united kingdom . 
  [ 28 ] note that the last use is what , for example , your . gb tld is for . 
  that 's an interesting point . 
  average points per country , excluding own rating : * us : +26 * russia : -29.17 * england : +33.8 * greece : -35.6 * france : +33.2 * italy : +38.2 * germany : +35.8 * spain : +48.2, 
  oh , you 're right . 
  obviously i ca n't read a chart . 
  this was two or three years ago . 
  i do n't know what was going on in the news then , and i suspect that opinions change quickly . 
  or ... it could just be that it 's hard to judge via anecdotal evidence versus polls . 
  i mean , you probably only know , say , 100 people well-enough to have some idea of their views , and they almost assuredly are not a random sampling from the population . 
  not only that , france likes you more than anyone else , including themselves , and germany likes france more than anyone else , including themselves . 
  well , i do n't see a franco-german war anywhere on the horizon , that 's for sure . 
  okay . 
  i 'll put down what i 'm saying one more time . 
  a flowchart shows that certain things must happen , given a prior state . 
  this is how a flowchart works . 
  for a flowchart to be correct , if there is only one edge between two nodes , this transition * must * be the only transition that can be taken . 
  a flowchart 's visible edges do not indicate simply `` possible '' or `` plausible '' transitions . 
  i disagree with some of those inevitable , `` single edge '' transitions on the chart . 
  i have listed two of these -- one is the transition from `` nato urges calm '' to `` little green men appear '' , and the other the transition from `` moscow occupied '' leading to `` russia 's perimeter / ` dead hand ' system is triggered '' . 
  you argued that these were possible transitions . 
  i do n't dispute that . 
  however , that does n't have any bearing on my statement . 
  you could be right or wrong , and it still would not be an argument against what i said above . 
  proximity to the equator seems to induce political instability . 
    i 'm not saying that it 's an impossible but rather objecting to it invariably leading to this outcome . 
    to which i have provided you with evidence to the contrary , both scenarios and results are more than plausible ,, 
  i described two cases where a state a on the chart invariably leads to state b , and stated that i disagreed with this invariable transition in both cases ( and there are other instances , but i thought that two examples would suffice ) . 
  open it up and look : they 're clear as day .
