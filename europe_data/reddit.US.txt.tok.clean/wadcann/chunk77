  i 'm not saying that it 's an * impossible * but rather objecting to it invariably leading to this outcome . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_switzerland  after a failed attempt of vorarlberg to join switzerland in 1919 , the idea of resuming swiss enlargement was revived in 2010 by a parliamentary motion of 28 right-wing members of the swiss federal parliament . 
  their proposal would change swiss law to allow french , german , austrian or italian border regions to join the confederation , should the majority of the population in these regions request this . 
  and a new tld , . ef , i imagine . 
  this has been posted before . 
  i objected to some of its assumptions , such as : * `` moscow warns of genocide . 
  protestor clashes lead to some violence . '', 
  -  `` nato urges calm '' then invariably leads to `` far-right volunteers or ` little green men ' appear . '', 
  * `` moscow occupied '' invariably leads to russia setting off a last-ditch all-out nuclear strike against the west . 
  well , i do n't want to get bogged down in semantics . 
  people intended [ something like this ] ( http://www.crf-usa.org/election-central/bringing-democracy-to-japan.html ) , i believe . 
  thanks . 
  that being said , i think that it would be interesting to have someone set up a service that can perform google searches from vpses located around the world to see how google or other geo-located recommendations differ around the world . 
  would still need translations , but ... 
  outside of tiny countries , that looks suspiciously like it correlates with wealth . 
  the soviet countries became [ not-western because of the cold war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_world#introduction ) . 
  that 's a pretty flexible term too . 
  depends on how much the rulers adapted to the culture versus the culture to the rulers , i imagine . 
  the mongols conquered and assimilated . 
  my understanding is that alexander and his hellenic successors drastically changed their ruling style in persia and egypt to fit the local structures and religions . 
  it 's the first sentence of the article ( though perhaps the title would have been better ) . 
  as for whether it should be in the article ... i 'll bet that if i asked a random guy on the street whether he knows who paul krugman is and whether he knows what the nobel prize is , the latter would have far higher recognition . 
  well , to be fair , he 's really only admitting fault in that he 's saying that the greek government did n't have the competence to have properly planned and implemented the policy that he wanted . 
   in the case of iraq , what was the point of invading a country for nonexistent weapons and overthrowing a dictator if you 're going to leave it in a worse/just as bad state . 
  completely pointless . 
  it was expected to go a bit more-smoothly , kind of like post-war japan or germany , be a secular democratic beacon to the rest of the middle east demonstrating how great it was to be secular and democratic . 
  did n't work out quite as well as planned . 
  the meaning / u/stvbnsn was using was : * [ bamf ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bamf ) - * acronym * of bad-ass motherfucker ; one who is not to be trifled with ; one who excels in a certain activity , often a competitive or violent activity . 
  well , you guys gave him his global political clout via the nobel . 
  actually , assigning high-profile academic and political awards seems to be an inexpensive , yet rather-useful sort of soft power . 
  i wish that the us would create a similar sort of prestigious institution . 
  an irreverent aside -- if the good lord took forty days just to handle the diplomacy involved in * conveying * ten commandments , then the almighty must be weighed down with more bureaucracy than the best of our mere human institutions . 
  there are countries other than the us that do have a president . 
  the nobel prize , as [ alfred nobel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_nobel ) established it , did not include a category for economics . 
  later on , his family opposed the creation of such a category ( for political reasons -- they saw it as being a way to give right-wing economic theories a podium ) , but sweden 's central bank [ chose to fund the creation of an award ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nobel_memorial_prize_in_economic_sciences ) , with a similar name , wanting to share in the prestige that had become attached to the other nobel prizes . 
  in practice , people refer to the award today as the `` nobel prize in economics '' and most are n't familiar with its status . 
  i kind of wish that economics had did what other fields did and just established their own high-prestige award , the way mathematics did with the [ fields medal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fields_medal ) or computer science did with the [ turing award ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turing_award ) and avoided the whole controversy . 
  still , i suppose it makes sense in terms of granting prestige in the eyes of the public , since the general public knows what a nobel is , but far fewer people outside the academic field in question know what a fields medal or turing award is . 
   i 've been wondering for a while who made krugman the highest economic authority in the universe * the swedes gave him the nobel . 
  * the new york times gave him a column . 
  * he likes getting involved in politics . 
   2s19 fires a shell at the supersonic speed . 
  i 'll certainly buy that , but that does n't mean that it lands at supersonic speed -- the muzzle velocity of any gun will be higher than the velocity when the thing lands . 
  if you 're firing at greater than a 45 degree arc ( not saying that that was the case here , just that the gun can ) , because the shell 's path is described by a parabola , that also means that the shell will land at a greater than 45 degree arc . 
  the falling `` downward '' vector is bounded by the terminal velocity of the shell if it were simply dropped from a sufficient height , and order to land while travelling at a greater than 45 degree arc , any horizontal motion must be less than that of the downward vector . 
  the downward vector can not possibly exceed the terminal velocity of the shell , so that means that the speed of the shell can not be greater than double the terminal velocity of the shell . 
  that 's actually pretty conservative in favor of a high speed , but just pointing out that it 's not unreasonable to expect this behavior . 
  [ here 's a set of firing tables ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-40/ch7.htm ) for the [ us m109 howitzer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m109_howitzer ) . 
  the speed of sound is ~ 343m/s . 
  `` terminal velocity '' here appears to be the speed at which the shell impacts the ground , not the speed at which it would have impacted had it flown with no horizontal vector . 
  column 10 of table g has every velocity being subsonic . 
  i believe that most artillery can fire at either a high arc or a low arc , which means that you * could * have supersonic fire , but that does n't mean that you ca n't get subsonic fire . 
  * my understanding is that ukraine has the [ 2s19 msta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2s19_msta ) , which is a howitzer that appears to have a 30km range . 
  * [ liveuamap ] ( http://liveuamap.com/en/2015/19-july-during-the-last-24-hours-1-ukrainian-soldier-was?ll=48.07028;37.65564&amp;zoom=11 ) shows a ukranian military casualty recorded one hour ago on the donetsk bypass , about halfway between pervomais ` ke and pisky , just on the outskirts of donetsk . 
  eyeballing it , it looks like ~ 6km away . 
  edit : 5.6 km by road , not as the crow flies . 
  edit2 : i also wanted to confirm that howitzers could have a shell being subsonic before landing at their destination , since while i thought that was the case -- they normally fire at a greater-than-45-degree arc -- i was n't absolutely-certain . 
  here 's a recording , on the receiving end , of the [ us m102 howitzer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfasvv6b4_w ) . 
  it 's definitely possible to hear the shell before impact . 
  the first picture on the image has a black sign , a house with white walls , and under the awning , something that looks to me like particleboard . 
  you 're saying that the sorta tan-colored stuff is insulation ? 
   buffet still lives in the first home he ever bought 50 years ago [ it is a nice house by median us standards -- worth about $ 700k ] ( http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mmk45fgld/warren-buffett-house-omaha-nebraska/ ) , but nothing more than that -- not a mansion . 
  he did also apparently [ buy a second house in laguna beach for $ 1.1 m ] ( http://www.bornrich.com/laguna-beach-home-billionaire-warren-buffett-sale.html ) and sold it near the top of the us real estate bubble for $ 5.4 m. 
  the ez does n't require a unanimous vote of existing members to increase ez membership ? 
    if they see the camera all hell will break loose   jesus , those rednecks , when will america ban guns , uhh ... ? 
  that picture looks like there 's exposed particle board . 
  i 'm no construction expert , but surely that sort of thing would n't last long outside of an arid climate ? 
  i mean , not putting color on the side of something that 's waterproof is one thing , but ... 
   we are spending almost 3 times more in pensions this year . 
  is that abnormal for a country with a pension system ? 
   except when they go nuts . 
  [ non-gif youtube version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewhnyovup9q&amp;t=13s ), 
   romania can not even into transport [ the cia world factbook says ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ro.html ) that romania has 10,777 km of rail , almost-entirely standard-gauge . 
   worked for colorado tho ' . 
  no , that 's a great example of what was annoying me . 
  when colorado ( and california ) were talking about it , people constantly brought up budget issues and presented marijuana legalization as the answer to financial issues . 
  colorado has state tax revenues of $ 10,251 m , and marijuana was $ 76m of that . 
  there may be other benefits , agreed , but the `` i know , we can solve our tax collection issues via taxing marijuana '' crowd was vocal and annoying . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  * at least some of the tax collection problems are associated with small companies . 
  a lot of small companies might not be the best option . 
  * most of the startups that i 've seen ( admittedly just in tech ) are relatively-young . 
  greece has a relatively-old populace . 
  * startups are fine if you have a high risk tolerance . 
  europe already has a somewhat-lower tolerance for unemployment risk , and i 'm assuming ( from the number of people on government payrolls in greece ) , that greece is lower . 
  sure , where this happens , it 's great , but i do n't think that the answer to greece 's economic woes are moving the bulk of the population to internet startups . 
  seems like kind of a clickbait title . 
  < shrug  lacking them seems like more a sign of international non-involvement than having them . 
  i admit that it 's hard to get some sort of metric ( treaty count signed ? 
  amount of government spending on diplomatic corps ? 
  ) , but this seems like a starting point . 
  i bet that politicians get tired of going on public forums and just getting people proposing implausibly optimistic tax revenue increases via drug legalization ... 
   russia is far more open about the possibility of using strategic nuclear attacks in response to conventional attacks and not necessarily to defend russian territory . 
  no meaningful ability to stand up to nato in conventional terms means that the only real option is nuclear weapons . 
  i do n't think that it 's so much new aggressiveness as that the choices available to russia have become more limited . 
  also , you mention explicitly strategic weapons ... just out of curiosity , what threats of nuclear weapon use are you referring to , specifically ? 
   we recognize , unlike you brits , that international political cooperation is essential and in our interest . 
  the british people would rather isolate themselves in terms of politics . 
  huh ? 
  i 'd think that the brits are one of the more internationally-involved governments out there .
