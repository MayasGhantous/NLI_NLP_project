  on [ the spreadsheet linked from this page ] ( https://www.princeton.edu/~ina/politics/ ) , in 2000 , the uk had the third-highest number of embassies , after the us and france . 
   there 's quite a clear vision : 76 % of the participants see nothing in the creation of one central european government en a majority ( 56 % ) wants member states to have less power given up to the eu than this is currently happening . 
  64 % also likes to see no new member states . 
  ` their has to be cooperation , not fusions ' is one of the many responses . 
  i wonder how much of this depends on how the question is framed ? 
  that is , are polls done by pro-federalization organizations seeing substantially-different numbers ? 
  well , isil filled a power vacuum . 
  the attempt the us made to fill it before , with iraq 's post-war government , was n't very successful . 
  it 's not clear to me ( though i 'm no expert on isil ) that isil as an organization is all that interesting -- if you kill enough of its leaders , would any replacement look more-or-less the same ? 
  because , if so , either it 'd be better to figure out how to do business , a la iran , or wage a psychological war . 
  there were a lot of bombs dumped on vietnam , but it still did n't result in a populace doing what the military power wanted ... 
  that 's not the impression that the translation gives , but perhaps it 's a bad translation ? 
   to make these maps of foreign territory , the soviets started with official , publicly available maps from sources like the ordnance survey or the us geological survey . 
  john davies has found , for example , that elevation markers on maps of britain often appear at exactly the same points and work out to be exact metric equivalents of the british units . 
  ( because of such similarities , the ordnance survey has long maintained that the soviet maps violate their copyright . ), 
  well , yeah , but it looks like these are violating the soviet copyright ( to be fair , i 'm not sure who exactly `` inherits '' the copyright if the soviet government broke up , but i doubt that the soviet union would have given , say , estonia ownership ... and i suspect that estonians are n't getting copyright royalties from companies like the one in the article , anyway ) . 
  comparing the detail , the soviets had better maps in 1980 of san diego military facilities than [ openstreetmap does today ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/32.7028/-117.2066 ) . 
  speaking of bias , redditor for 1 hour at time of post , all comments anti-eu ? 
  rt is n't blocked ; it seems hard to complain about nato . 
  honestly , if you 're going to grouse about anything with an anti-russian bias that shows up here , i 'd say complain about * moscow times * , not ( rare ) official nato releases . 
  well , i listed the major us media outlets above . 
  here 's them publishing the cartoon itself : * [cbsnews.com ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/next-charlie-hebdo-cover-unveiled/ ) * [wsj.com ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/charlie-hebdo-cover-to-feature-muhammad-on-post-attack-issue-1421076776 ) * [foxnews.com ] ( http://nation.foxnews.com/2015/01/12/new-charlie-hebdo-cover-released ) * cnn.com -- i do n't see one with google image search * msnbc.com -- i do n't see one with google image search * [npr.org ] ( http://www.npr.org/2015/01/08/375662732/charlie-hebdo-laughed-in-the-face-of-violence-will-future-satirists ) * i see what * looks * like it was previously up on nbcnews.com , but they may have pulled it ( and some of their video coverage does appear to have been censored ) . 
  * i do n't see any instances on pbs.org, 
  to be totally honest , i think that there are a great many publications far , far ahead of charlie hebdo in terms of potentially being open to claims of intimidation . 
  i do n't know whether there 's a name for the phenomenon , but if you have a situation where people who disapprove are more vocal than people who approve , even if you have , say , a 40 % / 60 % split , you 're going to see a lot of noise from people unhappy with the individual events . 
  the different impression is given because your sample is n't representative of the population -- the people complaining the first time arguably are n't those complaining the second time . 
   by totally ignoring the cartoons ? 
  a quick google site search shows some 4,020 pages on cnn.com referencing `` hebdo '' , 3,130 on foxnews.com , 5,750 on msnbc.com , 3,110 on pbs.org , 748 on npr.org , 164 on cbs.com , 7,790 on nytimes.com , 11,500 on wsj.com , and 1,070 pages on nbcnews.com . 
   sourisseau survived though his soldier was shattered in the attack fine editing . 
   the only reason those links get up voted is because the title agrees with their opinion . 
  so all the people who want a grexit up vote opinion pieces which say `` there should be a grexit '' and all the people who disagree up vote things which say `` there should not be a grexit '' . 
  hardly anybody is actually reading these submissions . 
  hardly anybody is learning anything from them . 
  hardly anybody is being informed . 
  nothing is being gained . 
  this is what killed / r/politics and advocacy groups in general . 
  instead of voting up what people wanted to read , they voted up what they wanted other people to read . 
  fine . 
  i 'm not saying `` hide immigration issues under the rug '' . 
  i 'm just saying `` be upset about things that matter '' . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  general civilian firearm ownership in romania [ apparently is banned , though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation#romania ) , so unless you 're going to be throwing bullets ... 
   a delay is the same as a write-off because all the time a country is not paying its debts , its economy is getting bigger and stronger and better able to pay the debt . 
  that 's ... not why a delay is a write-off . 
   inflation also means the debt is worth less and easier to afford . 
  that is , however , especially when combined with the fact that one can expect real wealth to be used to generate some degree of return over time . 
   at every point in history , law enforcement and state protection agencies were able to snoop on people ( with due process ) , by watching physically who they meet with , screening their mail or listening on the phone line . 
  and every complex endeavor , be it organized crime or terrorism , left a paper trail . 
  you can still physically snoop on people . 
  it 's just as expensive and limited as it was 150 years ago . 
  you know what i do n't understand ? 
  why every time someone posts a badly-recorded cell phone video of some group of irate immigrants , people here completely lose their minds and get upset about it , but when someone posts immigration numbers or something like that , it does n't even register . 
  you 're seeing , what , maybe on the order of a hundred , maybe a couple hundred people here yelling ? 
  no idea what the context is , but this outrages you ? 
  this seems to happen every time someone posts a video from some immigration camp or of some issue . 
  who cares ? 
  it could be a total non-issue . 
  the thing i 'd be interested in is counts ( or , heck , even estimates ) of total numbers entering , or crime data , or anything like that . 
  my point is that the response of people a generation or two or three down the line is something that i expect to differ from that of the current generation . 
  policies ( schengen , freedom to work , the erasmus program that frequently comes up , use of english , etc ) have been adopted that tend to facilitate mixing between the peoples of europe , and i 'd expect the barriers to slowly come down . 
  the united states had the same situation , where people identified as members of their * state * and there were major cultural differences from state-to-state when things started out . 
  i would n't have a problem with aggressiveness , but some of the questions were like ... oh , i do n't know . 
  i 'd call them `` television questions '' . 
  they are n't interesting so much as likely to get a rise out of people . 
  things like :  spiegel : germany took on a leadership role in the negotiations with greece -- and adopted a `` very patronizing tone , '' as european parliament president martin schulz lamented . 
  does it worry you that people across europe are talking about a `` new german dominance ? '', 
    sch\u00e4uble : there is no german dominance . 
  germany is in a good position economically , that is undeniable . 
  but in contrast to france and great britain , germany is not a member of the united nations security council . 
  for that reason alone , you can not talk about being in a position of political supremacy . 
  still , the balance in europe has shifted since the fall of the iron curtain . 
  baltic countries , slovakia and slovenia also now speak up when they do n't like the positions taken by others . 
  this is a [ loaded question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loaded_question ) , a `` have you stopped beating your wife '' . 
  if your response is obviously going to be not to answer the question , but rather to address incorrect presuppositions in the question , it 's ... eh . 
    spiegel : you mean , there is a new division in the euro zone -- between the north and the south . 
    sch\u00e4uble : that is inaccurate . 
  what is important is the fact that many euro countries have now left the emergency aid program and have experienced a positive economic development : portugal , ireland , spain , even cyprus . 
  even greece had gained traction by the end of last year , such that we can accurately say today : we have successfully stabilized the euro zone . 
  obviously , sch\u00e4uble is n't going to say `` yes , there is a division in the euro zone '' , even though there is some degree of general difference in performance between the overall north and overall south , so all we 're seeing is how he 's going to be diplomatic in response to the question . 
   spiegel : could it be that you do n't actually believe that the reforms will be implemented ? 
    sch\u00e4uble : no , otherwise we would n't have had to travel to brussels . 
  but that is exactly the reason why we need those controls of which you earlier said they would patronize the greek people . 
  obviously , not only did sch\u00e4uble not believe this , but even if he did , he would n't be saying so , since it would be incredibly undiplomatic . 
  now , okay , maybe spiegel is a friendly interviewer and their goal is to ask questions that they feel are unreasonable and being asked elsewhere to let sch\u00e4uble highlight their unreasonableness and respond to them , but the way it comes off to me is the interviewer kind of being a dick , and not asking questions that are going to have interesting or reasonable answers . 
   the area is colloquially known as `` mordor '' , named after the lord of the rings wasteland around sauron 's tower and mount doom , mainly due to it 's congestion and traffic jams actually , that sounds like poland has done a particularly accurate job of reproducing silicon valley . 
   because whatever feelings they have they know that is not what the majority wants , not greece , not germany , france or italy , nor any country . 
  what happens after current policies facilitate sufficient : * intermarriage * population movement * common language usage, 
     so , when considering european issues , it is important to take into account the emotional and idealistic foundation of the project , because it affects developments in a way that a purely rational and numerical analysis can never accurately reflect . 
  while i understand your point , i 'd point out that it * is * theoretically possible to model that kind of interaction as well -- you 're just saying that it ca n't be derived from a simple model of `` money goes here , problem x happens '' . 
   i wo n't deny that it 's strange that americans somehow developed a culture of circumcising all boys [ effort to try to reduce the spread of veneral disease via discouraging masturbation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circumcision#modern_times ) . 
   but why always call out americans for a practice that 's no longer as prevalent ? 
  in most regions of the us , it 's still over 50 % . 
   should i be ashamed for being circumcised ? 
  i do n't see any reason why . 
  on the other hand , i do n't think that those girls should be ashamed for having their own genital cutting done . 
   do people really expect weapon ( and spyware ... ) dealers to give a flying fuck about embargoes ? 
  yes , because otherwise they get penalized . 
  that interview left me irritated with the spiegel interviewer . 
   no , it would n't . 
  your taxes are what they are .
