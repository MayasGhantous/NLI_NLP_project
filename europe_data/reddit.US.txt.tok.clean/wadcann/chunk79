  sure they would . 
  it might not be `` vat goes up n % this year '' , since it 's possible for debt to act as a buffer . 
  it could be that , oh , the government needs to impose some tariff , or cut back on research subsidies for electricity , so you might not directly see the cost . 
  maybe your children wind up paying a lot more instead of you paying a little more ... but one way or another , in the long term , germany is going to have to balance its budget . 
   frankly , i could n't care less about the debt its self ; its the principal of the matter . 
  * [ principal ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/principal ) - ( finance , uncountable ) the money originally invested or loaned , on which basis interest and returns are calculated . 
  * [ principle ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/principle ) - a fundamental assumption or guiding belief . 
  in this context , curiously enough , both words produce a valid sentence ... 
   and why do n't you call it `` perfidious eu '' while you 're at it , as they were built with the same principles . 
  hmm . 
  could you expand on that ? 
  you mean that the goal of the eu was to maintain the existing balance of power in europe at the time of the eu 's founding ? 
  fair enough . 
  i do agree that complaints about flaws in the greek character or culture or whatever -- and insert nation of your choice , including russia or whoever people are pissed off about at the moment -- are typically ill-supported , inflammatory , and most-likely wrong . 
  < shrug  could be , but that immigrant might be comfortable informing on the other person for reduced punishment themselves . 
  walking down the first link of the chain is the first step ... 
  that 's effectively the same thing as the portugal example above , which also uses job-creation as a criteria . 
  all of these involve some form of money being transferred to the state , via taxation or real-estate purchases or job creation :  since the end of 2012 , portugal has been granting the special visas to foreigners who are ready to shell out at least $ 500,000 for a house or apartment , make a capital transfer of one million euros , or create 10 jobs . 
  the us and canadian criteria are similar ; i do n't know about the nz one . 
  in practice , the filter is to try to permit in the wealthy , which countries want , without letting in the poor , which countries are less-enthusiastic about , and then have money from those people be a source of income for the country . 
   does this paper prove that the average greek is tax evading ? 
  does it prove that tax-evading is `` part of greek identity '' ? 
  no ; first , there 's no such thing as an `` average greek '' , and second , it 's an economics and finance paper , so it rightfully does n't try to make such claims . 
  nor am * i * interested in making such a claim , because i find cultural arguments or arguments about the nature of the state uninteresting . 
   the majority of tax evaders ( by mean value of tax evasion ) i agree with you that the paper indicates that the non-self-employed are less-likely to evade than self-employed . 
  i agree on # 2 to the extent that mean value of tax evasion is higher in professional fields , but i do not agree that this means that the majority of tax evaders are in those fields ; in fact , i suspect that this is unlikely . 
  would probably do better to submit without the editorialized bit and just put that in a comment ... 
   alternatively , russia could buy a greek oil refinery or another natural state monopoly , although these assets are hard to come by . 
  hmm . 
  i can understand oil * distribution * being a natural monopoly , but why would a * refinery * be a natural monopoly ? 
  is n't a great deal of oil already shipped elsewhere to be refined , all around the world ? 
   ciudad real is one of a handful of ghost airports built during spain 's construction boom that has been abandoned apparently it was a money-losing venture , and while i do n't know that this is the case , if spain has tax liens against it for back taxes , whoever purchases the thing may be on the hook for that . 
  i 'd want to make sure that there was an announced , open bidding process , but if that was the case , that 's probably the market value of the thing . 
  also , while i agree that the article title is `` british investors '' , not sure how to reconcile this with this tidbit :  the purchaser is china 's tzaneen international , a group of investors , who were the only group to have made an offer in an auction . 
  eh , i do n't think that 's fair . 
  cotton production was and is a major us agricultural area , whether slave labor was involved or not . 
  fair enough . 
  the article has an embassy official saying that the difference is due to the population difference , which at least is roughly in line ( something like a 5x population difference , 7x extradition rate difference ) , though i admit i do n't totally understand the mechanism there , since i do n't understand how it would affect a bidirectional rate . 
  that article does also note , though , that the us has not refused any british requests for extradition ( whereas the uk has refused a few us requests ) :  `` it should also be noted that our courts have refused to extradite nine people requested by the us since 2004 , while us courts have not refused any of our extradition requests . '', 
  that being said , that * also * seems like it would be open to major influences , since it could simply be that the judicial system has a higher bar for actually issuing a request in the uk , or it could relate to the fact that many us states permit capital punishment and the uk does not . 
  and it might be that extradition requests are normally cleared via some sort of informal diplomatic channels before hitting the courts , and that they are being rejected informally somehow , in which case they would n't show up on extradition refusal statistics . 
  do n't laugh . 
  the us has more [ would-be silicon valleys with `` silicon '' names than anywhere else in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_places_with_%22silicon%22_names ) . 
  you could shackle them in a boring room , sort of like a jail cell . 
  nothing interesting , and they 'd eventually go to sleep . 
  honestly , the previous generation somehow survived adolescence and made it to the present day , even with caffinated beverages . 
   500x as many people extradited to them as the other way aorund hmm . 
  do you have a citation on this ? 
  i 'd kinda like to see the denial rates and what the crimes were for , because i 'm thinking that there might be plausible reasons for criminals in the us to tend to flee to the uk more-frequently than the uk to flee to the us ( e.g. 
  it might be preferable to , from the uk , flee to somewhere with sketchy law enforcement in europe ) . 
  i assume that that 's going to happen anyway , because nobody else in europe has a significant blue-water naval capability or significant overseas interests . 
  well , you 're right that professionals are high on the list , and that farmers are actually probably pretty good , but it does n't look like large corporations are the problem : they 're some of the best actors . 
  here 's a recent research paper that has driven some of the articles . 
  [ tax evasion across industries : soft credit evidence from greece ] ( https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2109500 ) : based on the table on page 41 , people working in medicine are probably the worst , followed by accounting , retail , law , and then law and lodging/tourism . 
  farmers are mostly on the up-and-up . 
  to be fair , the paper also says that tax evasion from the self-employed is on par with that of self-employed in other countries ( much lower than russia , and somewhat lower than the us , so there 's a quote that you can use ) but that greece has a very high level of people working self-employed , so it represents very large losses . 
  security camera footage from nearby businesses ? 
  huh . 
  okay , thanks . 
  i was oblivious to that . 
   trying to put the blame of the $ 320bn debt to the poor guy for not charging vat when selling tomatoes is ridiculous . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/22/greece-bailout-tax-collection-rates  greece , says theoharis , loses around 6 % more of gdp to evasion than the average country in the oecd club of rich nations . 
  but , he adds , `` much of the problem is structural '' . 
  doing a [ quick eyeball of greece 's historic gdp ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp ) ( and ignoring inflation ) , greece averaged something like $ 150b in gdp since 1980 . 
  so , also ignoring interest , that 's a disparity of $ 9b/year , or $ 342b in total . 
  of course , reducing tax evasion to the average level of other oecd countries ) would probably have some secondary effects ( the might gdp would shrink a bit ) , but if that gap had stayed closed , greece probably would be doing just fine today . 
  now , true , that 's not the * only * factor -- if greece 's government had been reporting legitimate figures , the problem also would have been stopped , since the brakes would have been put on before the problem became so large . 
  if the government spending had been tracking actual revenue , same thing . 
  but it is true that eliminating the high level of tax evasion and holding all else equal * also * would have probably resolved the issue . 
  canada , [ the us , australia , and new zealand ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424127887323665504579032922966616830 ) also have these . 
  apparently the us 's [ dates to 1991 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/us/foreign-millionaires-in-no-rush-to-apply-for-visas-us-finds.html ) . 
  the article does explain why -- because armenia took over a region of azerbaijan . 
  if [ russia heads in ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/world_azerbaijan-says-will-face-russian-soldiers-in-karabakh-in-case-of-war_308523.html ) , that will be conflicts with three neighbors . 
  i 'd like to note that columbus [ completely screwed up his calculation of the world 's diameter ] ( http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/scolumb.htm ) , which is the only reason that he thought that he could make it to east asia , and that the size had been computed long , long before , reasonably-correctly , by the ancient greeks . 
  and now , because of his ineptitude at navigation , he 's probably the most-famous navigator in history , with the most stuff named after him . 
   more like the us under reagan and the uk under thatcher . 
  huh . 
  so it 's that the french center-left/left sees english as a route by which right-wing ideology flows in from uk and the us in the period subsequent to the 1970s ? 
  i would be * extraordinarily * surprised to find that russia knowingly shot down a passenger airliner . 
  accident , sure , but there 's absolutely no reason for russia to want to do so . 
  and i 'm more than happy to criticize russia where it deserves it , but i 'd have to have extremely strong evidence to buy into that , because it would buy russia nothing . 
  does russia deserve blame ? 
  sure . 
  for attacking ukraine , you bet . 
  for intentionally shooting down the plane ? 
  for accidentally doing so and/or perhaps creating an environment where that was a risk ? 
  yup . 
  the us ? 
  you mean the us in world war i and ii and the axis members of the eu ? 
  i expect that he 's concerned about the greece situation scaring off the ez members from introducing another country that might do the same thing , but at a larger scale . 
  wow , vox.com is really opening up the flamethrowers on germany . 
  paywall . 
  right !, 
   maybe the benefit of a little less air pollution is deemed worth it ? 
  make lots of money by selling fossil fuels . 
  use some of this money to purchase expensive electric automobiles .

   i 'm sick and tired of traveling halfway across the world , just to see the same glass monstrosities dominating the skyline .
