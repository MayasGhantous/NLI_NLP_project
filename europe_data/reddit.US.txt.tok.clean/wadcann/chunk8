  they do not speak the language and have no documentation and limited education . 
  i think that it 's easier than you think , once figuring out how to beat the system becomes someone 's full-time preoccupation and people start institutionalizing facilitating others beating the system . 
  after all , the is true of the us , and yet we 've got the equivalent of the population of belgium illegally in the us . 
  [ this article from 2005 says that germany had about a million illegal immigrants at that point in time ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/a-german-amnesty-for-illegal-immigrants/a-1513837 ) . 
  well , if you were willing to let some of the glacial melt happen and move a bit towards the baltics , you could have freshwater poldering in the now-baltic-sea , which was apparently at first the [ freshwater baltic ice lake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_ice_lake ) 12k years ago and then the [ freshwater ancylus lake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancylus_lake ) 9k years ago . 
  well , the germans tried blocking people at the waterline with the [ atlantic wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantic_wall ) once . 
  but ... yeah , seems more-viable in that case to track and intercept boats on the ocean . 
   they should be held in a detention area till we can prove who they are . 
  i believe that * is * possible , at least with respect to the 1951 refugee convention -- the duration of the evaluation period before someone is granted refugee status is n't bounded , and conditions are not placed on how they are restricted before that time . 
  that being said , there 's * still * the question of : ( a ) whether you want to accept potentially the full population of syria even with these terms -- it seems likely that syrians are going to find a way , come hell or high water , to reach somewhere in the eu handing out permanent residence , if it 's an option , and that 's a lot of people . 
  ( b ) whether your false-positive rate on your test is too high and would exclude and awful lot of people that you do n't want to detain . 
  one of the first things that the nazis did was to [ seize the passports of jews ] ( http://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1933-1938/reich-ministry-of-the-interior-invalidates-all-german-passports-held-by-jew ) : in that case , new ones were issued , but if you look at something like saudi arabia , my understanding is that it 's common to seize the passports of guest workers to keep them from leaving . 
  in something like an eritrean situation , it would be entirely-viable for the government to hold passports of soldiers to try to prevent them leaving . 
  that fence covers only part of the border :  the 1,954-mile ( 3,145 km ) border between the united states and mexico ... a total of 344.3 miles ( 554.1 km ) of fence and ... well , frankly , illegal immigrants just do n't have a lot of trouble making it across the border . 
  the [ tunnel construction to smuggle stuff into the us ] ( http://www.cbp.gov/frontline/2014/07/what-lies-beneath ) can get pretty impressive . 
  well , the alternative is that instead of staying in an icy europe world , global warming heats things up . 
  and [ clearly , that 's much worse ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/sj7oo/great_now_everyone_at_my_school_knows_my_fear_of/c4eho5y?context=2 ) . 
  i do n't think that nuclear weapons are relevant here , though , as this is n't very likely to turn nuclear . 
  difficult to make a credible threat of use . 
  as / u/azog points out -- the economy is a weapon that can actually be used . 
  russia has a large nuclear arsenal , but ca n't use it in a way that is advantageous to russia here . 
   in short - fuck the `` ordinary russian '' , he deserves the shortages they get for his support for putin and his actions . 
  < thinks  i have a hard time with questions of who `` deserves '' what , morality and whatnot . 
  by and large , i think that people are more-or-less people . 
  if you put me in their shoes and i had their upbringing and all that , i imagine that i 'd [ do more-or-less the same thing , even if it sounds like something that i would n't do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milgram_experiment ) . 
  now , that does n't mean that penalizing the ordinary russian is a bad idea . 
  you want to establish disincentives for lopping off bits of countries , and if that 's the best way to do that , then that is the best way to do it . 
  i am a little skeptical that russia will see a revolution soon . 
  china has a certain popular aversion to revolution that was hard for me to understand at first , but ... well , revolutions just have n't done very well for them . 
  it was chinese civil war that let europe and later the us and russia and japan move in on china . 
  the communist revolution did n't work out terribly-well . 
  it was the reforms , the revolution-from-within that [ deng xiaopeng ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deng_xiaoping ) kicked off in the late 1970s after mao finally croaked that worked fairly well . 
  [ pro-democracy revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiananmen_square_protests_of_1989 ) , even aside from state propaganda against it , was seen as a risk by the public . 
  in the last hundred years , russia 's had revolution to get out from under the tsars , followed by bloody civil war , followed by a non-violent revolution that opened things up to an awful lot of corruption . 
  no single revolution suddenly made everything fantastic ( though perhaps they * did * open up the door for things to get better ) . 
  i do n't know the russian public or russian domestic politics , but i would n't be surprised if there was more preference for incremental , internal reforms rather than revolution . 
   past and present , the goal of their leaders has been to remain in power . 
  that 's too pat an answer . 
  how many leaders really would n't want to stay in power , regardless of their position ? 
  i 've wondered before if perhaps countries with the economy dominated by resource extraction are at risk of this sort of thing . 
  in such a situation , the government often takes over control of the resource ( e.g. 
  gold/diamond mines , oil , etc ) . 
  at that point , the primary flow of wealth is under control of the government , and so the primary way to make it at all in society becomes trying to get into government and then tap some of that wealth one way or another . 
  african countries that do resource extraction , middle eastern countries , russia ... if this is real , it would be similar to but not the same thing as [ dutch disease ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_disease ) , because the mechanism in dutch disease is increased labor costs , and a lot of the places i 've listed have pretty large wealth disparity -- the guy on the bottom still has pretty cheap labor . 
  you 're right , sorry -- i was eyeballing a map ( i wo n't post a link -- the automoderator deletes posts containing links to blogspot for some reason -- but it 's on linearpopulationmodel dot blogspot dot com ) and the person made the same error initially ; i was reading discussion from him and did n't read his follow-up . 
  gibraltar would still be split , but narrow .

   the six-person vehicle has a maximum speed of 25 kilometres per hour . 
  well , they went underwater because the ice caps retreated back towards the poles and the meltwater raised the height of the oceans . 
  this is [ what vegetation looked like ~ 18k years ago ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/last_glacial_vegetation_map.png ) . 
  if that land had n't gone underwater , the ice caps would still be intact , so taking that as a starting point ... basically , the bulk of europe would be an ice sheet . 
  probably look kinda like glaciers in greenland , something like [ this ] ( https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4916659572_6acb36cffc_b.jpg ) . 
  nobody would really live here . 
  almost all of the rest of europe , other than the iberian , italian , and balkan peninsulas , would have been very cold [ steppe-tundra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammoth_steppe ) . 
  you might have some people . 
  looking at what steppe-tundra was like , `` humans colonised the environment west of the urals , hunting reindeer especially , [ 3 ] but were faced with adaptive challenges ; winter temperatures averaged from \u2212 20 to \u2212 30 \u00b0 c ( \u2212 4 to \u2212 22 \u00b0 f ) while fuel and shelter were scarce . 
  they travelled on foot and relied on hunting highly mobile herds for food . 
  these challenges were overcome through technological innovations : production of tailored clothing from the pelts of fur-bearing animals ; construction of shelters with hearths using bones as fuel ; and digging of `` ice cellars '' into the permafrost for storing meat and bones . '', 
  maybe think of the way eskimo or aleut culture and society and technology evolved . 
  part of spain would have been [ tundra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tundra ) , the biome that today is the cold , northern bits of russia . 
  finally , the warmest bits of spain and italy and greece would have been [ forest-steppe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_steppe ) , so a bit like the southern parts of russia . 
  europe would be of marginal importance to the world , as few people would live there . 
  southern asia , southern africa , and south america would presumably contain the majority of humanity , and they 'd be more-or-less the world powers . 
  with europe being a relatively-inhospitable area north of the mediterranean , it might be that [ viking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vikings ) - like people would be a significant chunk of peoples of europe , living in spain and greece and italy , maybe raiding across the mediterranean into africa or down the peninsulas , with some agriculture down along the peninsulas themselves . 
  the pale skins of the scandinavians developed as an adaptation to little sunlight . 
  however , that 's a property of latitude , not of temperature , so these vikings of the mediterranean would probably be dark-skinned . 
  the mediterranean would separate cold lands to the north and mostly desert land to the south . 
  the mediterranean would probably not ever reach the importance in trade and interchange that it did in our reality . 
  it was the retreat of the glaciers that both took habitat from the [ mammoths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammoth ) and let humans move north and hunt them to the point of extinction . 
  that did n't happen in our icy europe timeline , so europe would probably have mammoth tusks and furs floating around , and mammoth hunts would be a thing . 
  in our reality , we did n't find the new world until about 1500 . 
  given the constraints that the people of the icy europe universe would need to deal with , i doubt that they 'd do better . 
  if south america and africa never linked up , it would be travel around the coasts of the indian ocean that would be the center of human civilization . 
  that 's what empires and kingdoms would try to dominate the way that they did the mediterranean in european history . 
  the inhabitants of the americas [ made it there from east asia during about the late glacial maximum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/settlement_of_the_americas ) , so they probably would have not only made it , but presumably east asia and the americas would never have become disconnected , even if it would have just been via limited trade up and down the cold coast of north america . 
  not only would they never have been colonized by europe , but without the separation from the bulk of the world 's population letting disease vulnerability show up , they might have been a substantial force moving in on the poor , sparsely-populated europe . 
  the [ world 's coal deposits ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/business/industries/coal-energy/world-coal-deposits.html ) , set down [ 300 million years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carboniferous ) , would be much less-accessible , so even aside from the implications of a much-smaller human population perhaps slowing development ... not having a lot of fossil fuel to produce the [ industrial revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution ) , once the equivalent of the [ great divergence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) arrived , might be profound . 
  edit : one error on my part . 
  the mediterranean was also much lower during that time . 
  so you 'd have an [ atlantropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ) but even more so -- the mediterranean would no longer be a contiguous sea , as gibraltar would be a land bridge to africa , as would italy via sicily , so presumably there would be more population flow between north africa and europe . 
  the overland path from the mediterranean to the indian ocean would be even longer and harder than it was , isolating the mediterranean world from the indian ocean center of civilization still further . 
  in short , i 'd say that europe would mostly look like either the ice sheets up in greenland or the colder bits of russia , and its inhabitants would wind up something of a relatively-poor backwater in terms of role in the world . 
  that world would have developed more-slowly than did ours . 
  if you 're right that us agriculture has too little diversity , then you can cleverly retain three different strains of < common-plant  and profit via extortionate prices when the us screws up and has to go to seed banks to start rebuilding after a blight . 
  saudi arabia [ exports 8.4 times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_oil_exports ) the oil that azerbaijan does . 
  heck , saudi arabia exports more oil than russia does . 
  i disagree . 
  even if you are n't actually christian , simply the act of publicly-stating that you are would potentially put you at risk of religious persecution from then on . 
  the 1951 refugee convention does not prohibit you from burning your bridges to establish a legitimate refugee claim * after * leaving the country . 
  okay , let me put it this way -- is there any action here that violates criminal law ? 
  you ca n't just say `` i 'd like someone to be put in jail for n years '' -- they have to have [ actually violated something in here ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-i ) . 
  the epa can not establish a crime . 
  they can set rules , and those rules can have fines attached , but they ca n't imprison people for it .
