  of course , if you have a mix , then people do n't need to travel halfway around the world to see something else . 
  ehhh ... we did sponsor afghanistan-area guerrilla warfare against russia . 
  hmm . 
  `` what if the tsars did n't fall to the bolsheviks in world war i '' would be a hell of a what-if . 
  i 've got no idea what the impact on europe 's security would be . 
  the us took the phillippines because naval control at the time required coaling stations -- same reason the uk was big on setting up coaling stations around the world . 
  acquiring the pacific islands means that anyone attacking has thousands of miles of ocean to cross with no friendly bases nearby . 
   because it wants to control its frontiers and preferably extend them . 
  that 's a non-argument . 
  now you have more land and want to extend them further . 
  see also israel claiming that for national security reasons it needs a `` buffer zone '' , seizing it , and then promptly settling people in it . 
  why ? 
  they 're soldiers . 
  they screwed up . 
  russia should n't have sent them into ukraine -- okay , fine , blame russia the country . 
  they should n't have fired -- all right , but mistaken incidents do happen in war all the time . 
  no country that 's been in a war is innocent here . 
  if they were capturing people and raping them and executing them or something like that , then there 's direct fault . 
  but right now , it 's just anger at russia being taken out on some schmuck soldiers . 
  heck , it 's possible that their orders even included firing on anything with some characteristics , and that they received information that they were shooting a military target . 
  it looks like honeywell is still around , which was the one i was thinking of . 
  but ... still , kinda exceptions that prove the rule . 
  also , hp has been busily imploding for some years now . 
  do n't get me wrong , there 's still a lot to implode , but ... 
  i guess maybe [ siemens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siemens ) , though they are n't really what i 'd think of as a `` tech '' company , though they certainly work with technology . 
   so if they changed the rule to ensure that at least one official language ( but not necessarily the national language ) of each country is covered , it would be easier . 
  are n't there some european countries where there 's no overwhelmingly-dominant language of the official languages ? 
  i 'm assuming that [ belgium would have problems without both french and dutch translations ] ( http://languageknowledge.eu/countries/belgium ) . 
  honestly , how many bad associations are there in europe with english ? 
  of the powerful countries in europe , the uk is one of the few that never really had a go at taking everything over , yes ? 
  the * rest * of the world , outside europe , yes . 
  and ireland ... okay , but i 'm assuming that the irish are n't upset about use of english . 
   none have come close to the destructive power of syriza in terms of destroying the economy ( capital controls ) , destroying trust ( surprise referendum ) , dividing a nation ( nai vs oxi ) and eroding sympathy for the greeks across europe . 
  i am no expert on greece , but i have to disagree . 
  when nd/pasok left the wheel , greece was in serious , broken shape . 
  at that point , syriza was going to have to put pieces back together again . 
  they did n't do a great job of that , in that whether grexit happens or not , they pushed the troika far enough to harm greece , but they also did n't trash the country in the first place . 
  decades of mismanagement and a few months of not fixing the earlier problems -- i 'm going to blame the former more than the latter . 
  nd/pasok also had more time and resources to work with . 
  maybe syriza * would * have done worse if they had the country for those decades , but the point is ... well , they did n't . 
  and then those bigger companies screw up , burn a lot of people , blow up , a newcomer comes in , and buys their remaining assets . 
  for crying out loud , facebook was some college student 's pet project a decade ago , and today it 's worth more than greece 's national debt . 
  yeah , i 'm about to say , the tech industry probably has more churn than just about any other industry , ever . 
  hell , i have a really hard time thinking of a company that is around today that was around fifty years ago -- there 's always ibm , but ... 
  i 'm pretty sure that a lot of people know and care about him . 
  that does n't necessarily that they 're going to cut business deals based on linux if they think that they 're better off with microsoft ( which i 'm dubious about , but ... ), 
  at one point , [ `` silly '' meant `` holy '' in english ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=silly ) . 
  in the end , the usage of the dirty masses determines the dictionary , rather than the other way around . 
  give it a few decades . 
   communist block ... eastern block minor nit : * [ block ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/block ) - 29 . 
  misspelling of bloc . 
  * [ bloc ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bloc ) - 2 . a group of countries acting together for political or economic goals , an alliance : e.g. , the eastern bloc , the western bloc , a trading bloc there are a couple nationalities that frequently use `` block '' on here , and someone explained to me that in some language in europe , they 're the same , but thought i 'd mention it when i see it . 
  wow . 
  according to your link , by one metric , estonia is the center of europe . 
  the degree to which people in europe place importance on which region their country is in was one of the shockers to me when i started reading european forums . 
   the best oohhh , that brings in a lot of meaning . 
  the problem is that : * people may be interested in political/cultural regions more than geographical . 
  * some barriers , like mountains , might be more-interesting dividing lines than a flat plain . 
  * voronoi requires a set of input points , and then divides a region based on how close it is to those points . 
  but that seems to me like a pointless addition here . 
  you 're treating the center of mass of europe as being the deciding factor . 
  if that 's your deciding factor , why not just use the center of mass of each country directly ? 
  poland was n't on the fun side , and it 's in central europe , at least according to that map . 
  i see that australia has annexed kaliningrad , removing it from europe entirely . 
  good point !, 
  he 'd probably be pretty happy to just step aside if italy were willing to fund germany 's portion of the bailout . 
  for all i know , some of the claims are legitimate , but one caught my eye . 
  banning russians from going abroad because there 's an increased rate of them getting * alcohol poisoning * on holiday ? 
  really ? 
  are n't * all * border fences kinda anti-immigration ? 
  were the greek railroads ever privatized and wages brought in line with the greek private sector , or did the government avoid doing that ? 
  there 's a number of people in the world who just like rioting and will travel remarkable distances to riot if potential opportunities arise . 
  i 'm pretty far from a left-winger , but i do n't think that `` deserve '' is a particularly interesting question . 
  i do n't see how injecting questions of morality helps produce a better outcome . 
  of course , the flip side is that just as it does n't make sense to slap greece for moral reasons , it does n't make sense to keep dumping money on greece for moral reasons . 
  i do n't know whether debt forgiveness is a good idea , but i guarantee that saying `` it 's not an option because of fairness '' is n't a good rationale for avoiding it . 
  i guess it 's easier for me to say , because greece has n't been draining my tax money , as it has that of a lot of people in europe , but ... 
   greeks voted syrizia , and they destroyed the economy i 'd tend to blame nd and pasok 's prior activity and permitting tax avoidance and other actions more than the few months of syriza . 
  what syriza did that was probably not a good idea was to anger the creditors and run the risk that greece just might get completely dropped . 
  but i think that the blame for the bulk of greece 's economic problems probably is best-laid elsewhere . 
   ca n't every country just get itself into an `` unavoidable situation '' . 
  yeah , and moral hazard is a risk . 
  but i bet that most greeks ( not all !, 
  certainly some people grabbed a lot of money and vanished ... ) would n't intentionally-choose to re-create the current situation in greece again . 
  i do n't think that anyone would claim that the nokia closure is the greek 's fault . 
  loss of revenue * is * , however , going to mean that finland is going to look harder at what it 's spending on . 
  it 's not my grocery store 's fault if i lose my job , but i might not be buying steak all the time if that happens . 
  just as a follow-up , the story appears [ to have hit the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33549462 ) and there 's [ an ongoing reddit discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dhqvt/eu_warning_over_russia_land_grab_in_south_ossetia/ ) . 
  not saying that your earlier caution was n't a good idea , mind , but it looks like there 's meat to the story . 
  * [ rampart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rampart_%28fortification%29 ) - a defensive wall or bank around a castle , fort or settlement * [ rampant ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rampant ) - unrestrained or unchecked , usually in a negative manner . 
   tax requirements are huge , salaries are small and unemployment is big . 
  well ... to be fair , that seems kind of like a feedback loop , if the reason that greece is in its current state is because of austerity triggered by evasion in the first place . 
  i 'm pretty sure that russia would have given him a medal * and * asylum . 
   just consider the fact that they went from a -15 % deficit to a 0.5 % primary surplus within 3 years , while suffering from a huge depression . 
  while i think that people would agree that greece improved ( albeit not completing all the agreed-upon-changes ) , i 've also seen commenters stating that actually hitting the primary surplus was due to accounting games . 
  i 've not dug into it myself . 
  an awful lot of these are a good starting point for discussion , though . 
  there are reasons for some of these , but it 's incumbent upon the person defending a value being out-of-whack to explain why it 's legitimate that it be the case . 
   basically the company you work pays your taxes for you out of your salary that does n't work with self-employed people that do business in cash . 
  * [ i 'm seeing about 37 % of greece 's population being self-employed ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/self-employed-total-percent-of-total-employed-wb-data.html ) .
