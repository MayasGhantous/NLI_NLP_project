  is that relevant ? 
  i mean , let 's say greece screwed up and the ez screwed up . 
  all right , fine . 
  you 've still got a mess to be fixed , and it 's not clear that just saying `` no '' is the least-costly way to discourage things like this happening again in the future . 
  i think that / u/recallrethuglicans might be trolling ... though if so , i guess he 's a good one , because [ despite this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3chbx3/greek_crisis_eurozone_summit_megathread_part_i/csvmpoh ) , i still ca n't tell for sure . 
  i said that i have no knowledge , not that i believe that germany would like to do so . 
  certainly there have been some quotes in the last few days that would at least imply that at least there is resignation to the fact . 
  the plan for a temporary departure from the euro , at least to my cynical ears , sounds like diplomatically-preparing a path to exit ; ious could also take the same role . 
  a prosperous greece , all else held equal , is certainly in germany 's interest . 
  but that 's also not what 's on offer -- there are no guarantees of success and it 's not the case that everything else is held equal . 
  it might be that germany 's assessment is that `` even if we pump another $ 100b in , we are unlikely to cause greece to be self-sustaining '' , or perhaps `` the precedent being set here of non-good-faith borrowing is more-harmful than greece leaving '' , or perhaps `` the return simply is n't worth the cost '' and if that 's the case , sure , germany would have an interest in writing greece off . 
  i * do n't * think that germany is trying to secretly somehow screw over greece , and doubly so not from the beginning . 
  but i am not at all certain that germany or other ez members have n't hit the point of cutting losses . 
  the us did n't want to give up in vietnam , either , but sometimes you recognize that digging yourself deeper wo n't actually obtain what you want . 
  the ez union will probably only become tighter , so if someone leaves , it will be easier for it to happen now rather than later . 
  wow , estonia and lithuania sure differ . 
  it might be that germany would indeed like a grexit ( i have no knowledge of what the goals of the german government are ) and that this would be a way of easing greece over to policies that would carry them out of the euro -- if a bailout did * not * happen , then the ious would simply begin inflating . 
  however , i think that it 's pretty clear that germany is not going to openly propose something and then proceed to go after greece for doing precisely that . 
  i do n't believe -- though i 've not had to do the process myself -- that you need to pay taxes on them , however , unless you 're making a substantial total income ( $ 100k was cited below , which i believe is in-line with what i 've heard before ) . 
  however , it * does * mean that the irs has data to help establish tax fraud if they are aware of those accounts and if someone is expressly making false claims about their contents . 
  or use google translate . 
  hell , it can even do french -  albanian ( though i 'll bet less-commonly-used languages like albanian have worse translations than to english ) . 
  honestly , i do n't get worked up all that much about it , but i suspect that the main goal is going after very well-to-do people with substantial capital gains income who would otherwise simply move somewhere that did n't tax capital gains . 
  if i recall correctly ( and i 'm not an expert , but there 's been discussion about it before ) , ( a ) there 's only liability if you make more than a certain amount and ( b ) income taxes paid to the country that you are earning the money in come first , and you only pay the difference between the two if you paid less than the us tax rate , so it 's mostly-interesting if you 're moving to a tax haven . 
  also , as long as you have citizenship , you * do * have the option of collecting from social security and having embassy services ( which are interesting because there 's a big military backing them ) , so you are getting at least some benefit , even if you 're not currently living in the us . 
  in the event of trouble overseas , the us has a long history of evacuating us nationals , and if need be ( e.g. 
  china , iirc ottoman empire ... ) sending in military forces to extract them . 
  you * also * , in some cases , are liable for taxes even * after * giving up your citizenship -- some people have said `` oh , i 'm about to sell off my stock from a massive ipo of a us business i founded . 
  [ i 'll just drop my us citizenship and go somewhere else and then sell off a couple hundred millions or billions of dollars in stock and then live there . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduardo_saverin ) '' the us will still hit you up for taxes in at least some of these cases . 
  now , maybe you should argue that those should n't happen , but a lot if it is structured so that someone does n't make a huge amount of money in the us and then have an enormous incentive to promptly emigrate before that income is recognized , or for someone to work abroad without paying for social services , but then return and take advantage of them . 
  both of those are really externalities that would otherwise go unaddressed . 
   police have blocked access to the linked site which is critique of the filter . 
  i 've enjoyed when commercial filtering service companies have been caught blocking websites of competitors in the past . 
  always an auspicious way to start out ... 
   huge , unyielding bureaucracy necessary which inevitably , especially with the cultural differences , will lead to corruption and favoritism . 
  i dunno about that bit . 
  are large countries inherently more-corrupt than smaller countries ? 
     i also do not believe `` family reunification '' or whatever moral arguments i often hear should be justification for accepting large numbers of uneducated people . 
  you may have a hard time attracting your skilled immigrants if that means that their spouse and kids ca n't come in . 
  well , i suppose that you probably have more insight than i into how much impact either approach will have on the uk public in a referendum ( which i 'd have guessed is a real risk ) , and what the risk is of ez pool contributors taking legal or other action against the eu versus the uk doing the same thing ( i 'd have thought that chances of either of the two happening would be rather low ) . 
  what 's the issue ? 
  am i misunderstanding the problem somehow ? 
  i do n't know anything about the efsm , but there 's a pool of money . 
  the uk does n't want its money at risk and wants the pool closed . 
  there 's no time to go through regular ez member legislative procedures to get additional funds . 
  formally-close the pool , give the uk its contributions , and do whatever the ez wants to be done with the remainder . 
  are the uk 's contributions so large that without them , the pool would be insufficient ? 
   mr cameron has trumpeted securing a `` black and white '' promise in 2011 that the fund would be mothballed so british taxpayers would not be part of eurozone bailouts . 
  mothball the fund * now * , return their contributions to all participants , and * immediately * set up an ez fund with the same assets from all ez members . 
  that 's arguably a bit dubious , but less-so than grabbing the uk 's money , and it simply gives the uk exactly what it wanted .

  substitute your own government 's historic boogeymen as required . 
   that would not be a strategy aimed at winning , but with the aim that the other side loses . 
  well , i agree that it probably would n't provoke a military conflict ... but then russia does n't gain anything . 
  it antagonizes a lot of people around the world , probably gets caught a couple of times ... for what ? 
  a poorer estonia/latvia/lithuania that dislikes it more-strongly ? 
  i can understand russia wanting land and the property on it and the assets that the people there produce . 
  i can understand russia wanting strategically-valuable land or water . 
  i can understand russia wanting natural resources . 
  i can understand russia wanting to neutralize potential future threats . 
  i can even understand russia wanting to try to establish a `` do something that i do n't like and i will hurt you '' reputation . 
  there 's at least some sort of plausible rationale for all of those things . 
  but i ca n't see how trying to make the baltics miserable buys russia anything that would be useful to russia . 
  besides , what the article is discussing is whether there is a military threat to the baltics from russia . 
   also : finland , seriously ? 
  sure . 
  finland 's obvious major military concern is russia ; whether it 's [ running hypothetical military scenarios ] ( https://disciplescientist.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/what-if-russia-demands-a-naval-base-in-finland/ ) or [ responding to russian exercises ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/european-war-games-responses-russian-military-drills-314410 ) . 
  i 'm no an ir expert , but i 'd say wars happen when a country believes that it is better-off attacking now than later , when a window of opportunity is shutting -- whether it is world war i countries with closing windows of mobilization , or japan wanting to move in world war ii before its military fuel supplies were exhausted or european powers stopped being tied up with germany . 
  in ukraine , if ukraine were to do a baltics and join nato , the window would shut ; any russian attack needed to happen soon , and so russia moved . 
  if an eu military shows up -- commenters here enjoy linking to various officials talking about further military integration -- that will increase the chance of european intervention in finland in the event of any future conflict . 
  if finland joins nato , it will pretty much shut the window entirely for russia to do anything with hard power . 
  russia is already spending a great deal of its money on its military , and has committed to further building its military . 
  it has no real reason to do that unless it is worried that something will threaten it or if it wants to threaten something else : otherwise , it would be more sensible to , for example , build up russia 's very-limited road infrastructure or do something else that would be likely to provide a return . 
  what realistic conflicts does russia face ? 
  well , it 's already established conflict or frozen conflict in two of its neighbors -- georgia and ukraine , and can already comfortably handle them . 
  mongolia , as i understand it , has traditionally been russia-affiliated , and has no meaningful military . 
  the remainder are russian allies or nato members , other than finland , azerbaijan ( [ maybe ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/world_azerbaijan-says-will-face-russian-soldiers-in-karabakh-in-case-of-war_308523.html ) !, 
  ) , north korea , and china . 
  i do n't understand the moscow-chechnya relationship , so maybe civil war is a concern . 
  russia [ has been running very large-scale military exercises ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/russia-and-nato-war-games-gap-310178 ) for the past two years , much larger than anything that nato has done . 
  russia just ran [ one large exercise in the arctic ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/russias-massive-military-exercise-in-the-arctic-is-utterly-baffling ) , but all arctic nations other than sweden , finland , and russia are nato members : either you 're assuming that russia is willing to scrap with nato -- which seems unlikely -- or that it has an interest in demonstrating or ensuring ability to fight one of sweden or finland . 
  should this be read as `` i think russia is going to attack finland ? '', 
  no , but then , i also would n't have said that russia was going to attack ukraine , either . 
  i am saying that russia has attacked two of its neighbors , is building up its military again , and there are a limited set of realistic opponents ... and i do n't think that the baltics are plausible targets , as the author seems to think . 
  maybe that 's the answer ( not even monthly , but * income * versus net worth ) , because a mistranslation there would make a lot more sense . 
  the way the english article phrases it , it sounds like they 're talking about net worth . 
  a `` millionaire '' is not someone who makes a million dollars a year , but someone who has a net worth of a million dollars :  the majority of russians believe it is impossible to become a ruble millionaire without bending the rules , a poll conducted by independent levada center revealed tuesday . 
  that sounded interesting , so i [ pulled up recordings of different german dialects ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctse_touaps ) and discovered that if you do n't know a language , it 's pretty much impossible to distinguish between dialects . 
  i also discovered that german-dubbed darth vader sounds significantly cooler than the original english . 
  that 's not really what / u/itomes said . 
  there was a set of mandated reforms over the last few years that were not completed ( particularly privatization ) , and some of which syriza reversed . 
  that does n't mean that some reforms did n't happen . 
  `` nothing accomplished '' might be a bit over the top . 
  `` less accomplished than was promised or needs to happen '' might be better . 
  my understanding was that greece did cut government payrolls . 
  there was privatization , albeit something like 10 % of the promised amount . 
  there were pension cuts , though syriza rolled back ( some ? ), 
  of these . 
  puerto rico is n't going to cause rupture of the eu .
