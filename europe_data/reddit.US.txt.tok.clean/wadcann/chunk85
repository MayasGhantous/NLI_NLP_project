  take reddit and tweak as follows : * restructure things so that it 's more prone to knee-jerk emotional reactions . 
  * add a `` follower '' score , so that an ongoing popularity game is integral to the system . 
  * reduce the amount of reading and text involved , so that the only concepts that show up are those that can be expressed in one very short sentence . 
  this gets rid of the riff-raff who might otherwise muck things up with extended thoughts or supporting points or anything like that . 
  * add some data analysis tools so that marketing people can monitor it like no other system that they 've ever had access to , so that it draws in lots of marketers . 
  * mix it all up , and add some slacktivism to the mix . 
  [ disclaimer : not a physicist ] it helps understand some of how matter functions at a very basic level . 
  it does n't have immediate applications in the sense of `` oh , now i can go make a longer-life battery next year '' , if that 's what you 're thinking of . 
  think of it on par with , say , confirming that the big bang happened . 
  it 's a particle , not an element . 
  you would n't need the whole stretch -- just the cut portion . 
  yes . 
  would probably try to avoid it getting to that point and resolve it via different mechanisms first , though . 
   first of all prove seeing turks having to explain english to americans is a little embarrassing . 
  i 'm not so sure that i agree with the urban-is-a-euphemism-for-black claim that / u/jjfo made , though ; that 's not a usage that i 've heard . 
  however , i do n't know whether `` projects '' is right either . 
  that implies not just a poor area , as a slum would be , but a government-planned construction of subsidized housing for the poor . 
  in your case , the linked item may well be a project , but the term is n't quite the same thing as a slum . 
  or possibly [ * barrio * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barrio ) for latin american slums . 
  if he really wanted a yes vote , why did he not present the vote as being over euro membership ? 
   some other commenter said this , but i think it 's relevant : all the other anti-austerity parties in europe just learned a lesson . 
  should they gain power , as is still probable , they wo n't negotiate . 
  they wo n't enter into talks for a better outcome . 
  they 'll simply move directly to exit and they will plan to protect their banks from the ecb before they do it , so as not to end up illiquid during the transition . 
  i disagree . 
  that assumes that they * want * to exit , rather than just transfer some losses on debt to their creditors , which seems to me to be a dubious assumption : greeks did n't want to exit the euro even in their much-more-severe situation . 
  captain [ francesco schettino ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francesco_schettino ) . 
  [ philippe legrain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippe_legrain ) is british , not american . 
   seems like the economy and whole situation would be much better now if the greeks did not put the syriza party into power ? 
  which major greek party would you have preferred to have entered into power ? 
  you 've got the two parties associated with the corruption that led to the current problem -- re-electing them probably would n't go over well with ez members . 
  you 've got a communist party , a neo-fascist party , and the far-left party that made it in . 
  that being said , it might be a good idea to have the un establish a status like that , for the same reason that individuals have such a status . 
  obviously , creditors would price this risk into their loans , but if realistically every borrower has a breaking point , not formally-recognizing the fact does n't seem to buy much . 
  eh , he tends to make a lot of political proclamations that are a bit left-of-center ... but i also think that he might just be what the catholic church needs as a leader . 
  the church has been in decline : it evolved as an institution for a very different society : agricultural , spread-out , uneducated . 
  it has arguably not adapted well to changes in society . 
  pope benedict xvi might have been a good theologian , but he was horrible from a pr standpoint . 
  pope francis is at least trying to re-establish the church as something of a popular moral authority . 
  if the church sees a resurgence in popularity and influence and membership , i believe that pope francis is probably something closer to what will do this than pope benedict xvi . 
   he 's a priest . 
  here we 're talking politics . 
  the vatican probably wields more political clout than some eu member nations , and the pope was playing politics since before any of the nations in europe existed ( and that includes even san marino ) . 
   by the way internationnal times is using the moscow times ( wich in turn use as a source , a dubious no name georgian source . ), 
    by the way the moscow times is extremly biased even among liberal russians who prefer to use russia direct or russia beyong the headlines . 
  that 's fair-enough ; i 've no disputes there . 
   as for democracy ad freedon watch i already adress those points see further below it doesnt help that the date and the description of the pcture they use in their article does not match at all when i do a simple reverse search i did a tineye search and did n't find any results . 
  what search engine did you use ? 
   get over it , it is obvious kindergarden propaganda it 's certainly being highlighted by sources critical of the kremlin , but i do n't see how that indicates that it would be false . 
  it * is * true that waiting for major western sources to look into it and verify it would make sense . 
   s ** cking it was good  that sub is hilarious err ... what ? 
  well , the euro has been around for fifteen years , and it would only need to do another fifteen . 
  i have n't seen anything that would make me think that it will vanish in the immediate future . 
   tl ; dr greek products could n't only compete with german products on quality so they use to compete on price . 
  with the euro the price advantage is gone you can still compete on price . 
  you just have to fire someone and then re-hire them at a lower wage . 
  fair point . 
  let 's see what google news turns up . 
  * [ international business times : georgia accuses russia of border violations in south ossetia after soldiers claim part of oil pipeline ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/georgia-accuses-russia-border-violations-south-ossetia-after-soldiers-claim-part-oil-2006308 ) . 
  note that this sources * moscow times * , a critical-of-putin journal . 
  * [ democracy & freedom watch ] ( http://dfwatch.net/russian-troops-pushed-border-over-trans-caucasian-pipeline-few-hundred-meters-off-main-road-37187 ) is english-language and focuses on georgia , but cites statements and actions of specific officials involved ; i 'd assume that this would n't be desirable if the goal is simply to make false claims , since this could be easily-refuted . 
  it does n't look like there is any geographical barrier preventing relocating the highway , though ; it 's not quite the same as , say , capturing a mountain pass . 
  are you talking about the [ lavon affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lavon_affair ) , which i had n't heard of before , or something else ? 
  first , i would be very skeptical that these involved false flag tactics . 
  the nations that demonstrably did engage in false-flag operations above to provoke response did n't actually cause substantial harm to themselves in the operations , and maine was definitely not a small cost . 
  * maine * and tonkin both were certainly used as * causus belli * by people who did want war , but jumping from `` people were ready to seize upon a reason for war '' to `` it was staged '' is a big stretch . 
  [ the confusion over the second attack at tonkin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_of_tonkin_incident#second_attack ) has been pretty well-discussed . 
  it 's pretty likely that the hair that broke the camel 's back was n't real , but also very unlikely that it was * intentionally * staged . 
  second , the phrase `` salami tactics '' refers to seizing and annexing a bit of territory , then seizing a bit more , and a bit more . 
  that 's not what the us did in either cuba or vietnam . 
  i [ mentioned something like this last week ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bw9ce/why_the_eu_is_fed_up_with_greece/csqaz7r ) , but other commenters felt that eu member governments would strongly resist . 
  just giving context to understand where the article is coming from . 
  there have been some commenters saying that the us media as a whole has been critical of the euro and/or germany . 
  if you look at authors on the site , for example , the top one with a greece article is [ the alternet writer lynn parramore ] ( http://www.alternet.org/authors/lynn-stuart-parramore ) . 
  this seems weak on statistics and long on anecdote . 
  go a couple years further back in the us , and it would have been [ anti-miscegenation laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-miscegenation_laws ) . 
  to be fair , it is worth noting that [ the statistics i linked to ] ( http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/02/sdt-2013-02-07-immigrant-gen-1-03.png ) that compare generations do not control for race/ethnicity across generations , and the demographic makeup of first-gen immigrants to third-gen immigrations is substantially-different . 
   i do n't see the point of new loans , though . 
  well , greece probably needs money , at the very least in the immediate term . 
  how politically-viable are grants , as opposed to loans , going to be in germany and in other ez members ? 
  if this is an eu issue rather than an ez issue , then why was n't the uk involved in the recent decision-making process ? 
  '' [ godwin 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law ) '' rather than `` goodwin 's law '' . 
  1000 people is , as i understand it , very common for use in nationwide polls . 
  the sample size has no real connection with the population size in determining accuracy : you just need to ensure that the sample is randomly-selected . 
  if you 're polling a country of 100m or a country of 500k , it is equally-acceptable to use a sample size of 1000 people . 
  the narrow margin should n't have anything to do with whether-or-not the results were representative . 
  it just means that it 's around 52 % . 
  it could be around 87 % or around 23 % , and it 'd still be as representative . 
  i assume that you 're saying that it 's more-likely that there 's actually currently more germans in opposed to the deal than there would be if the number is 87 % . 
  that 's true , but those numbers will shift based on marketing and politics anyway , and unless there 's a majority vote in greece , the 50 % line is n't all that exciting . 
  edit : sorry , i meant a majority vote in * germany * . 
  the author bio states that he is the president of [ the institute for new economic thinking ] ( http://ineteconomics.org ) , a left-wing think tank . 
  yes , but as long as there 's a procedure for democratic constitutional amendment ... 
  well , i do n't know of anything in the us that can not be changed via democracy , albeit perhaps through the clouded glass of elected representatives or the time delay induced by certain procedures ( constitutional amendments , treaty withdrawals , etc ) . 
  certain rules have a high bar to be changed , but nothing * can not * be changed by the public . 
   a massive group came here against the will of the country and now you all have to pay for their kids ? 
  [ shrug ] if their kids were born in the us , they have grown up with a us education and in a us environment , with more-or-less the same ideals and goals that anyone else in the us would haven . 
  it 's not a burden in the way that that some twenty-five-year-old dirt-poor guy walking in with no education , not knowing the language , and requiring support would pose . 
  i suppose that there might still be cultural influence from parents , and whatever genetics might contribute , and maybe you could go looking for and identify some statistical weakness there , but generally-speaking , [ second generation immigrants in the us are on par with the average us citizen ] ( http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/02/07/second-generation-americans/ ) : it 's first-gen immigrants that are worse-off . 
  we also do n't have the islam-christianity split that you are looking at -- mexicans and central americans are catholic , and the us has n't had protestant-catholic friction for quite a while .
