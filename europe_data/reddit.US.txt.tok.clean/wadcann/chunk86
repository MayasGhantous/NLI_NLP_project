  if you wanted to identify poor ethnic or racial groups in the us , and cut out first-gen immigrants , they 'd be african-americans or ( native to the us ) native americans , and these were about the only groups in the us that mostly * did n't * descend from voluntary immigrants : the native americans got invaded and the african-americans got imported as slaves . 
  i do n't know whether the us policy is the best one , and certainly `` immigrate illegally '' is n't a legal , endorsed policy by the us ( even if it 's something of a * de facto * standard ) , but it has n't been catastrophic for the us . 
  i believe that the article is complaining about said muslims rather than eastern europeans , given that it 's talking about large numbers of people being routed through italy . 
  to be fair , the net number has been on the decrease for the last couple of years . 
  people who immigrated illegally are aging out and dying , and their children are american citizens . 
  `` illegal '' is a common short form of `` illegal immigrant '' in the us . 
  that being said , it * does * seem to be more-prevalent among the anti-immigration side , and the pro-immigration side seems to have shifted to `` undocumented immigrant '' at some point . 
  i think that the schengen members would do better to pool money to pay for border control and addressing border problems at the edges of the schengen zone than to reinstitute internal borders . 
  but presumably neutralizing some of the eu 's most vocal opposition ? 
  < headscratch  you 're saying that greece has moved away from agriculture . 
  okay , i do n't know what the history there is is , but what i mean is ... why is that an issue ? 
  that is , is there some reason to believe that greece should shift people from other fields to agriculture ? 
  you can have an absolute democracy , but it still does n't mean that your votes set policy for people outside of your democracy . 
  well , i 'd guess that the current deal is more-plausibly going to result in reforms , which in the long run should result in a stronger greece . 
   it 's painful to hear that greece has to import a lot of its own food rather than producing it . 
  why is that painful ? 
  okay , so there are a couple of points here to address . 
  [ disclaimer : i 'm not an economist . ], 
  first , i 'm talking about state-run industry versus privately-run industry -- not the question of whether-or-not industries ( be they state or private ) should be protected or not . 
  the state can protect industries or not , and they do n't need to be owned by the state for the protection to exist ; their protected status is independent of their state-owned status . 
  you 're saying that some industries need to be protected ; that 's really a different question . 
  and that 's an interesting question too , so let 's look at it . 
  while i understand that you can find some economists who would [ advocate for protecting particular industries temporarily , and under certain circumstances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infant_industry_argument ) , i do n't believe that there is anything like a consensus for permanent protection . 
  when a country chooses to protect a particular industry via tariffs or other barriers to competition , it is transferring economic strength and competitiveness from other industries in that country to this one . 
  for example , let 's say that a country produces inexpensive or unreliable power tools . 
  the country establishes a high barrier to competition -- this means that for consumers in the country , the locally-produced product is preferable . 
  and certainly , that power-tools company is now stronger than it would be . 
  but however much it gained , the user of those power tools has to also suffer by as much -- if the customer pays $ 20 more for a drill than he would otherwise have done , then the tools company is $ 20 better off ... but the customer is also $ 20 worse-off . 
  that makes them worse-off and less competitive than they would be . 
  it 's also economically-inefficient , so you 'd wind up slightly-worse-off than even that , but my point is that permanently subsidizing industries via protectionism is no better than being zero-sum . 
  but what about the trade imbalance that you described ? 
  surely there 's a risk that spain wo n't produce something that the us will buy ? 
  well , first of all , the [ trade imbalance in recent years has favored spanish exports to the us , not us exports to spain ] ( https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4700.html ) . 
  apparently [ spain is the second-largest olive oil exporter to the us ] ( http://worldtradedaily.com/2012/07/23/united-states-olive-oil-imports-from-spain-and-downloadable-list-of-u-s-importers/ ) , for example . 
  second of all , there 's no way that a country can maintain a persistent trade imbalance . 
  here 's a [ nice video clip from milton friedman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em ) where mr. friedman is talking to someone in the us concerned about a trade imbalance between japan and the us . 
  part of which ( `` exporting green pieces of paper ... '' ) describes why persistent trade imbalances do n't happen better than i could , but in summary : the reason that spain will never be stuck unable to export anything to the us is because the us is n't going to export things to spain without getting * something * in return , and whatever spain is exporting in return is its export . 
  it may not be an export directly from spain to the us -- it might be that the us , on the net , exports more to spain , and spain on the net exports more to the uk , and the uk on the net exports more to the us . 
  but one way or another , net trade will maintain a balance . 
  you mentioned that you were concerned about the us producing goods more-cheaply than spain , and that this meaning that free us-spanish trade might be harmful to spain . 
  let 's even take the extreme hypothetical that the us can produce every single possible good or service more-efficiently than spain could . 
  that 's perfectly-compatible with both spain and the us engaging in and benefiting from trade , due to [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) :  david ricardo developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in international trade even when one country 's workers are more efficient at producing every single good than workers in other countries . 
  he demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the free market , then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good , provided that there exist differences in labor productivity between both countries . 
  in such a scenario , it will mean that real wages will be lower in spain relative to real wages in the us ( i.e. 
  it would still be a good idea for spain to figure out how to produce something more-efficiently ) , but it will also mean that spain will wind up wealthier in real terms that it would be if it * was n't * taking part in that trade . 
   obama : ... more than we ever wanted to . 
  the closest current parallel to greece is arguably the [ current puerto rico debt crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rican_debt_crisis ) , and the us is n't jumping in there . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yanis_varoufakis  varoufakis says he set up one of pasok 's first youth-wings . 
  i do n't know anything about it personally , but i have seen a few people discussing past political ties to pasok . 
  not that that should be * that * exciting -- i mean , i 'm sure that there are decent people in pasok . 
  countries with state-run industry have n't had a very successful history when compared to countries with privately-run industry . 
  [ ca n't handcuff the invisible hand ] ( http://glossynews.com/entertainment/internet/201308310222/established-high-karma-reddit-accounts-being-sold/ ) !, 
  hmm . 
  i 'm not going to claim that syriza is innocent , but does n't that seem kind of defeatist ? 
  i mean , by that standard , there 'd be no way of ever migrating away from corruption once it was in place . 
     in short , greece has no way of balancing the great trade deficits it has incurred due to the euro . 
  normally the drachma would depreciate , and german products would be more expensive compared to theirs ; thus giving greek ones a competitive edge abroad over german ones . 
  you 're wanting to decrease real wages . 
  it might be disruptive to do that via currency adjustments , but that can also happen via , for example , people being laid off and re-hired at a lower wage rate . 
  if you 're engaged in armed robbery , you probably have n't made the best career moves . 
  http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/06/11/what-you-should-know-before-robbing-a-bank  pick a target -- in 2006 , the average bank robbery netted about $ 4,330 , compared to an average of $ 1,589 for all commercial robberies . 
  avoid convenience stores -- the average take there is just $ 769 . 
  [ snip ]  do n't do it -- overall , it 's probably not worth it to attempt a bank robbery , the researchers conclude . 
  `` the return on an average bank robber is , frankly , rubbish , '' they write . 
  `` it 's so low that it is not worth the banks ' while to spend as little as [ $ 7,000 ] per cashier position at every branch on rising screens to deter them . '', 
  satire is fair use , at least in the us . 
   to the ( mainly american ) newspaper articles ehhh ... it 's a subset . 
  fox news ( mainstream center-right ) seems to be talking about how this will affect their readers ' investments and [ how this shows that socialism does n't work ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/06/as-greece-collapses-big-loser-is-socialism.html ) , not saying `` germany is a big meanie '' . 
  msnbc is mainstream center-left , and does n't appear to be putting a whole lot of coverage into it ( and what coverage is there is not particularly politicized ) . 
  the us sources i 've seen thus far that are really critical of germany include some of the people associated with mr. krugman ( * vox * , and klein 's old publication , the * washington post * ) . 
  the * huffington post * has been extremely critical , but then , ariana huffington is a politician and was born in greece . 
  * foreign policy * has been critical , but i do n't know the history there . 
  other than that , i see a lot of critical british sources ( which makes sense : i assume that the uk does n't see the euro as a good idea ) . 
  i also see a scattering of smaller , left-wing sites ( and black-flag left-anarchists on this site ) . 
  i 'm assuming that there 's interest in seeing a left-wing government in europe , and that if that government has to adopt liberal policy due to creditor requirements , that kills a potential social experiment ... whereas a grexit would potentially mean an opportunity to try out another far-left system . 
   no one is blameless in this slow-motion economic and fiscal trainwreck in greece actually , that 's kind of an interesting question . 
  let 's say we were to rewind forty years . 
  what should have been done differently ? 
  i 'm actually kind of inclined to blame poor policy from the eu , though not because of all the angry claims of `` malice '' or `` wanting to humiliate greeks '' or that stuff that journalists are off rabble-rousing with . 
  * perhaps the eu should n't have extended membership to greece when it did . 
  that being said , i do n't know the history there , and there may have been good reasons to do so . 
  * the eu should have extended a limited amount of money and attached verifiable reforms to that early-on , and required real conformance , and made very clear to the public what that involved . 
  the problem today does n't seem so much to be reform , but in the staggering scope of the debt that was run up . 
  nobody wants to find that they 're suddenly on the hook for immense amounts of someone else 's corruption . 
  if this had been caught much earlier and made an `` in-or-out '' issue then , when the issue was much smaller , it would have been easier to resolve on both sides . 
  that seems to me -- without expertise on the eu 's political history -- to be the most important misstep . 
  once this had happened , once you 're looking at 2010 , there really are n't any solutions that are n't going to leave a lot of people upset . 
  asking for the ability to run an audit of how eu funds were used does n't seem that unrealistic ; in fact , i 've seen a few people from poorer eu members saying that they were very happy with the work that the eu did on grants to ensure that they were not misused . 
  * the greek people should have tamped down on government abuse of their budget . 
  that being said , the normal feedback mechanisms ( `` no creditor trust means no money means you ca n't buy thing x that you want '' ) were n't happening . 
  * during the very recent discussions , some a few heated quotes have come from the negotiating parties . 
  that seems like a really bad idea , * even if * it feels good to vent after months of working on something . 
  if you 're a negotiator , part of your job is to keep quiet unless you 're officially-responsible for presenting the public face of the negotiations . 
  i think that that 's minor , but even * if * talks had broken down , any comments could have been politically-sensitive . 
  * it seems to me that both the eu and greece did a poor job of convincing the other side 's negotiators as to what they would * actually * do . 
  ideally , each party would * know * what the other side would do if pushed to do so , so that this does n't have to actually happen . 
  the fact that people involved were playing hardball up to the current state of affairs means that neither side was able to establish much credibility about stating what they would do . 
  neither side would have wanted things to reach the current state of affairs . 
  * i do n't understand what drove the pension increases , which were part of the problem , but i wonder if it might be a structural problem in the eu , and one which might badly affect other eu members . 
  as i understand it , greeks working abroad can not vote in greek elections .
