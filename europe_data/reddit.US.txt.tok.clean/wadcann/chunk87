  however , the eu permits freedom of labor movement , and , as i understand it , provides for transfer of pensions from country to country . 
  furthermore , skimming [ population demographics of greece ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/greece/age_structure.html ) compared to , say , the [ united kingdom ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/united_kingdom/age_structure.html ) shows that greece has an old population . 
  i wonder if that part of this may be the young going abroad now that labor is free to move among the eu . 
  they can still be taxed to feed a pension scheme , but they no longer provide any political resistance to increase on pensions . 
  if the country then simply does the expected steady increase of pensions , it helps dig the country into a financial hole . 
   and generally pursue policies that turn it into a cheap labor platform for european companies . 
  this is more-or-less also what i 'd expect moving to the drachma and then inflating would do -- real wages drop down towards whatever the country is bringing in either way . 
  feels [ kind of like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7drocm_sby ) ... it 's not that greece is being * removed * , just that the money is n't coming in any longer ... 
  < headscratch  here 's the quote :  the leaked proposal also suggests greece hands over $ 50bn of `` valuable greek assets '' over to eurozone authorities to be sold off over time !, 
  that would kick in if greece can not deliver `` a significantly speeded up '' privatisation programme . 
  greece already agreed to perform a certain amount of privatizations before certain milestones some time back , and chose to not do so . 
  signing that agreement , i would think , would have been the meaningful choice . 
  okay , maybe greece never intended to privatize from the get-go and considered this simply part of the politics , but greece at least * said * that it wanted to make that trade . 
  in this case , what seems to be happening is someone saying `` either conform to your promises and privatize before the dealines , let us perform the privatization , or we do n't really believe that * this * time the privatization will actually happen '' . 
  i mean , if the eu used a special legal position to , say , seize state control , or if it marched armies in , that would be one thing . 
  but all that people are saying here is what any other creditor could as easily do . 
  they had a promise , it was broken , now they 're saying that they can send someone in to fulfill that promise ... but it 's not as if their authority extends further than that . 
  i mean , i 'd think that if greece negotiated the earlier agreement in good faith , that the earlier agreement , in which it accepted privatizations , should represent as much a loss of sovereignty as this does : the two just differ if the intent was to not actually perform the promises . 
   there is no way greece can accept this did n't greece already accept privatization some years back , then see little movement happening ? 
  my understanding is that greece has had problems with an overweight public sector . 
  one way to deal with that is to privatize the state-owned enterprise , and have the new owners will lay off a lot of people . 
  i also understood that substantial commitment was earlier made to privatize state government . 
  i do n't know whether the scope was the same , but this sounds to me like someone saying `` you promised , as a condition of receiving money earlier , to reform the government . 
  one of these was to privatize a certain amount , and you did only a small fraction of that . 
  if you want more money , either privatize , we will perform the privatization process if it 's too politically-difficult for you , or you can forego the money . '', 
  now , maybe that 's a bad idea ( personally , i think that privatization of uncompetitive government-owned operations would probably strengthen greece , though i 'm no expert ) , but it 's something that greece * had * already said that it would do as a condition for funds before , yes ? 
  this is n't new . 
  if the idea of setting such a condition puts the eu at risk , i 'd have thought that the eu would have been at risk years ago . 
  on the whole , [ the eu 's addressing that lack of a mechanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_withdrawal_from_the_eurozone ) has been a whole lot less bloody than [ the us 's addressing of the question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_war ) . 
  thanks . 
  hmm . 
  what is the source of the summary of these positions ? 
  if i were to rank eu governments by how much their governments have contributed to the eu effort , i think that germany would not do badly at all . 
  are you saying that greece 's government has done more for the eu ? 
  that 's not what the source linked by that twitter comment says . 
  you linked to [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/politicoeurope/status/620261588885458944/photo/1 ) : it links to [ this ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/greece-crisis-live-tsipras-parliament-referendum-bailout-reforms-eurozone-eurogroup-council-summit/ ) . 
  that has the text :  by wednesday this week , in order for negotiations for a new bailout to begin , the eurozone wants greece 's parliament to agree * in principle * on a raft of reforms : that 's not implementing legislation for it , it 's agreeing that in the future they will implement it :  1 . 
  streamlining vat   2 . 
  broadening the tax base   3 . 
  sustainability of pension system   4 . 
  adopt a code of civil procedure   5 . 
  safeguarding of legal independence for greece elstat -- the statistic office   6 . 
  full implementation of automatic spending cuts   7 . 
  meet bank recovery and resolution directive   8 . 
  privatize electricity transmission grid   9 . 
  take decisive action on non-performing loans   10 . 
  ensure independence of privatization body taiped   11 . 
  de-politicize the greek administration   12 . 
  return of the troika to athens ( the paper calls them the institutions ), 
  well , obviously i 'm just talking about economics -- europe will have to decide what it wants to do from a political standpoint itself . 
  i 'm just saying that in terms of finances , that would be a possibility . 
  and to be fair , the federal government does n't normally get to tell the state government what to do ( though it does get to determine how federal funds are spent ) . 
  that does n't mean that doing this is the right thing for the eu . 
  heck , that does n't mean that doing this is the right thing for the us . 
  it 's just an option . 
  [ for 2014 , the us gdp was $ 17.41 t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_states ) , and the [ federal budget $ 3.02 t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_federal_budget#major_receipt_categories ) , so 17 % . 
   nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program . 
  -- milton friedman, 
   and now greece wants almost 80 billion euros , three years more time and a debt restructuring and all of that on the back of the taxpayers in the other eurozone countries ? 
  after all the drama they have caused over the last few months ? 
  of course the people have their doubts about greece . 
  it 's totally legitimate for the people of the eu to decide that this is what they want , but i 'd also point out that the united states sends each of [ pennsylvania , indiana , south carolina , and north dakota ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state#tables_of_federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state ) about $ 50b/year . 
  that may or may not be what the eu wants to do , but it could be done : the eu has an economy the size of that of the united states ' .

  / r/trains has [ the video ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/trains/comments/3cw313/dutch_steam_engine_pulls_a_stranded_emu_video/ ) . 
  if you 're talking about the [ law of the sea ] ( https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm ) , though ... that bit mandates that they be pulled from the water :  1 . 
  every state shall require the master of a ship flying its flag , in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship , the crew or the passengers :   ( a ) to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost ;   ( b ) to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress , if informed of their need of assistance , in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him ;   ( c ) after a collision , to render assistance to the other ship , its crew and its passengers and , where possible , to inform the other ship of the name of his own ship , its port of registry and the nearest port at which it will call . 
  as far as i know , it does n't mandate that they be permitted to claim asylum or live and work in the country while their situation is reviewed : that comes from case law and the [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) :  article 31 . refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge   1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  [ snip ]  article 32 . expulsion   1 . 
  the contracting states shall not expel a refugee lawfully in their territory save on grounds of national security or public order . 
  [ snip ]  article 33 . prohibition of expulsion or return ( `` refoulement '' )   1 . 
  no contracting state shall expel or return ( `` refouler '' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 
  however , it is acceptable for a country to withdraw from the treaty , and specific provision is made for this :  article 44 . denunciation   1 . 
  any contracting state may denounce this convention at any time by a notification addressed to the secretary-general of the united nations . 
  such denunciation shall take effect for the contracting state concerned one year from the date upon which it is received by the secretary-general of the united nations . 
  any state which has made a declaration or notification under article 40 may , at any time thereafter , by a notification to the secretary-general of the united nations , declare that the convention shall cease to extend to such territory one year after the date of receipt of the notification by the secretary-general . 
  i 'm not trying to push europe to accept floods of people boating in illegally but there are very clearly two options that would both cause europe to not pull in refugees : * kill them in the mediterranean . 
  * withdraw from treaties that provide the legal support from accepting more people under refugee status review . 
  let 's say that europe decides `` this is totally unacceptable . 
  we need this to change . '', 
  that 's fine -- that is a legitimate position . 
  but * surely * you would agree that the second approach would make more sense than the first ? 
  the first would violate international agreements * and * wind up with a lot of dead people , whereas the second approach would legally-modify international agreements and not kill off a lot of people . 
  if killing people were the only viable way to deal with immigration issues , that might be one thing . 
  but i really do not believe that that is the case . 
  if they broke laws , might as well take them to court . 
  i would assume that what was paid for , though , was expertise in figuring out how to do whatever was done legally . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  i 'm not saying that there are n't problems with making decisions in the eu , but seriously ... the * membership * of a country is not something to be taken lightly . 
  that 's not necessarily just a `` appoint some guy and have him thumbs-up-or-thumbs-down '' the thing . 
  also , the ez and greece could have made a deal a long time ago , without the brinkmanship . 
  i do n't think that the system is broken so much as the fact that it was intentionally pushed to the limit . 
  if greece leaves the eurozone for five years , what is the likelihood of it re-entering any time soon ? 
  i mean , there will have been a sour memory on both sides , they will have undergone the overhead of the transition , and i assume that any re-entry probably would n't be attached to a whole lot of cash being handed over from the rest of the ez . 
  a `` temporary '' transition might be pretty permanent . 
   strong stances on caucasian issues sunburn and stuff . 
   greek deal in sight as germany bows to huge global pressure for debt relief is that the reason , or is it that greece changed its position in negotiations ? 
  the two statements are n't incompatible . 
  my guess is that the us * is * the top threat to national security in russia .
