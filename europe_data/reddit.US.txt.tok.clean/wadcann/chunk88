  and this statement :  `` so if you want to talk about a nation that could pose an existential threat to the united states , i 'd have to point to russia . '', 
  gen dunford told senators on thursday . 
  ... is pretty hard to argue with , just because of nuclear stockpiles . 
   i would like to say , bulgaria ( my country ) , we do n't matter , and it 's the same thing with us , as to be without us . 
  so , we should leave the eu . 
  i 'd think that you 'd want to leave the eu if you were better off outside the eu , rather than if you were a small chunk of the eu . 
  i do n't think that an unstable government was a problem ... but my point is that it seems like it would be hypocritical to be saying `` this works for me , but you need to do something else '' , rather than `` this works for me , you need to do the same thing '' . 
  at least via [ these 2008 numbers ] ( http://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/03/government-spending-as-percentage-of.html ) , greece had a more-privatized economy than slovokia , romania , france , or sweden ... but also a more-public one than the us , poland or switzerland . 
   ` stabilize , privatize , and liberalize ' is the mantra of the imf and the world bank . 
  every aspect of this standard recipe is now applied to greece ... the greeks are well on the way to becoming the european colonials . '' having a stable government , private institutions , and a liberal economy is n't something that i 'd normally think of as bad . 
   we did n't really need them for the first world war hmm . 
   after the sinking of seven us merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the zimmermann telegram , wilson called for war on germany , [ 143 ] which the us congress declared on 6 april 1917 ... [ the united states had a small army , but , after the passage of the selective service act , it drafted 2.8 million men , [ 144 ] and , by summer 1918 , was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to france every day . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i ) graph : [ german versus allied strength on the western front ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:riflemen-1918-western-front.jpg ) . 
  additionally , germany was forced onto the ( less-favorable , in world war i ) offensive role because of us entry :  the spring offensive sought to divide the british and french forces with a series of feints and advances . 
  the german leadership hoped to end the war before significant us forces arrived . 
  i am not particularly-familiar with world war i , but my understanding is that stalemate and a diplomatic resolution was a real possibility , had the us never entered the war . 
  i do n't have any particular preference when playing one side or another in world war ii war games . 
  it 's a bunch of pixels . 
  i 'm kinda surprised that it 's that big a deal from your standpoint ... i see people on here playing paradox games all the time , and that seems to ( perhaps less graphically ) be doing the same thing . 
   short-term a debt restructuring will only have a very minor impact as most of the debt isnt due in the next years and also the interest rates are extremely low . 
  would n't that depend on how the restructuring is set up ? 
  fair enough . 
  it looks like greece has over twice the per-capita debt that puerto rico has ( $ 38k versus $ 16k ) .

  do not want to contribute to a bail-out but has much to lose if they do n't . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't know . 
  does absolute contribution determine position ? 
  i 'd think that it would be something more like percentage of gdp contribution . 
  otherwise , you 'd just have large countries wanting greece out , and small countries wanting it in . 
  clearly a [ greek big mac-adjusted index ] ( https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-geo ) is required . 
  you 're [ also right about remote status ] ( https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-remote ) . 
   how strong they can be if no pain stops them ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stopping_power#psychological  emotional shock , terror , or surprise can cause a person to faint , surrender , or flee when shot or shot at . 
  emotional fainting is the likely reason for most `` one-shot stops '' , and not an intrinsic effectiveness quality of any firearm or bullet ... pain is another psychological factor , and can be enough to dissuade a person from continuing their actions . 
  [ snip ]  however , if a person is sufficiently enraged , determined , or intoxicated , they can simply shrug off the psychological effects of being shot . 
  during the colonial era , when native tribesmen came into contact with firearms for the first time , there was no psychological conditioning that being shot could be fatal , and most colonial powers eventually sought to create [ more effective ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/webley_revolver ) manstoppers . 
  well , if you drop * enough * of almost anything from a sufficient height , they probably are . 
  * at one point , a lot of [ alchemists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alchemy ) got fed up with the mysticism and secrecy in the field and tried to make practices more rigorous and share information , and renamed themselves `` chemists '' to try to stand out . 
  * not that long ago , psychology had plenty of its own mysticism and took a [ very long time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychology#beginning_of_experimental_psychology ) for people to start focusing on the [ measurable and experimental ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/behaviorism ) . 
  * in the western world , medicine took [ about two thousand years to realize that humorism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humorism ) was pretty bad as a core medical theory . 
  we , i think , tend to think of medicine as being a very data-driven , analytical field today ( since it * is * often , today ) , but medicine took a very long time to get there -- the idea of gathering data and crunching it [ was just emerging about 150 years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_broad_street_cholera_outbreak ) . 
  * science took a long time to emerge from its larval form of [ natural philosophy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_philosophy ) . 
  the social sciences need to deal with some problems that other fields do n't . 
  it 's hard to repeat an experiment and vary the parameters . 
  sometimes , it 's hard to gather complete data . 
  the complex , chaotic system of the brain tends to insert itself . 
  but none of these are insurmountable . 
  astronomy is also not amenable to repeating experiments while tweaking the parameters . 
  in a great many fields , we have a hard time gathering much data -- at the edges of any new field , we typically lack much information . 
  whether it 's early telescopes or the large hadron collider , the people building new fields are trying to glue together what data points they have with theory into something concrete . 
  i believe that we have made very real advancement in economics , and that it has predictive power . 
  [ mercantilism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) has lost its position , for example , and there * are * generally-accepted facts . 
  i do not think that our economics of today is less-predictive than our economics of yesterday -- people will always identify flaws in prior predictions and create new , more-sophisticated models that seek to become more-accurate . 
  [ weather forecasting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weather_forecasting ) , which also deals with somewhat-chaotic , complicated systems , did n't really become practical until the last hundred years . 
  today , i think of it as very unusual if we * do n't * know what weather will be like for the next week . 
  so , yes , i think that the social sciences will do the same thing that other sciences have done -- the level of rigor and predictiveness will simply increase . 
   in that case , he absolutely had no idea what the baltics are , what their macro environment was or why they acted like they did . 
  to be fair -- and mind , i 've had plenty of moments of being irked with mr. krugman myself -- i think that this is simply human nature , and applies to a great many experts . 
  when someone becomes very well-known and respected in a field , there 's a tendency to be accustomed to simply * being right * . 
  you 're rarely wrong in a debate , so you stop being open to the idea that you 're wrong . 
  that might work when you 're in your area of expertise , but it becomes increasingly easy to edge outside of it while maintaining the same sort of stance . 
  i 've seen people make confident pronouncements on areas that they really are not familiar with at all , to remove the `` i think '' or `` i 've heard '' from their speech . 
  that 's not just bad for * other * people -- it 's bad for them , if they wind up wrong , since they 're constantly putting their reputation on a limb . 
  one example that comes to mind is that of [ eric s. raymond ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eric_s._raymond ) . 
  mr. raymond is , for those not familiar with the field , a very well-known open-source software engineer , who has written a number of important software packages , some well-known books , a great deal of documentation , has engaged in critiquing and analyzing practices in the open-source software world , and so forth . 
  he 's one of a very tiny handful of people who can typically , in this world , be simply recognized by his initials -- `` esr '' . 
  he 's a bright person , and someone whose opinion i respect in his field . 
  but , he is , or at least was , not an expert in the business or finance world . 
  at one point , he [ wrote a rather-critical open letter ] ( http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/let-java-go.html ) to scott mcnealy , the ceo of sun , treating mr. mcnealy 's familiarity with the business very lightly . 
  unfortunately , while writing his letter , esr was n't familiar with the fact that a company can not be valued by simply looking at its share price . 
  and so , his public letter went out to the world :  but the casual equation between `` open source '' and `` zero revenue '' suggests that on another level you do n't really know what you 're talking about . 
  open source is hardly a zero-revenue model ; ask red hat , which had a share price over triple sun 's when i just checked . 
  at the time , sun was a much larger company than red hat was , and , i believe , was making quite a bit more money . 
  to esr 's credit , he left the incorrect letter up ( and has to this day ) , included the criticism of others , and wrote a response . 
  however , what struck me is that someone who is bright and is really knowledgeable in a field , and certainly did not start out insultingly informing ceos of large businesses how to run their companies , could sit in their room of expertise for a long time , and forget , over the years , that their expertise in one area does not extend to all other areas . 
  when one has a great deal of reputation , it becomes , i fear , an easy crutch to rely upon to drive home one 's points . 
  why waste time researching and supporting one 's points , when one can simply place one 's authority on the line ? 
  do you have a source on third generation children not integrating ? 
  in the long run , the universe suffers heat death . 
  it might have been important politically , as well . 
  besides , even if someone is complaining about negotiations , i can not imagine that the cost of the vote itself is anywhere near as significant as the cost of the banking shutdown . 
  probably not really worth getting excited about , anyway . 
   they forced them to loan the money at market rates . 
  they were loans , but they were n't at market rates ; that subsidy was what was given . 
   that the us government is supporting an alleged `` left-wing '' government should be a warning sign how far we 've jumped off the deep end . 
  keep in mind that french , finnish , and german taxpayers are going to lose money on greece , whereas any us exposure is far smaller . 
  it 's not * quite * a comparable situation . 
  upvoted for agreement !, 
  so your concern is the use of antibiotics being permitted resulting in large-scale , industrial farming practices , resulting in getting sick from foodborne diseases ? 
  that is , it 's pathogens rather than directly from some additive or something that the fda permitted in ? 
  as far as i can tell , the most-widespread cause of foodborne illness is salmonella ; i had to go digging a bit to find someone that had comparative estimates of both rates in the eu and the us . 
  reporting rates vary drastically ; germans report it at a much higher rate than elsewhere in the eu , for example , but this is expected to be due to reporting rate differences , rather than the food having more pathogens . 
  i did [ dig up a paper in * food safety * from 2013 from the uk ] ( http://www.researchgate.net/profile/sarah_obrien2/publication/233725098_the_decline_and_fall_of_non-typhoidal_salmonella_in_the_united_kingdom/links/0deec53ad2488183f4000000.pdf ) , which has :  in the united states , nontyphoidal salmonella species are estimated to cause 1 million foodborne illnesses [ 8 ] and are the leading cause of death among foodborne bacterial pathogens [ 9 ] . 
  across the 27 member states of the european union ( eu ) , there were estimated to be 6.2 million cases of salmonellosis in 2009 [ 10 ] . 
  the eu has a population that 's 1.6 times the us 's population , which does account for part of the difference , but if anything , the numbers here would be favorable to the us in terms of salmonella in the food chain . 
  mr. gosling * does * make a compelling argument ... and yet , how can i know that mr. gosling has n't been killed years ago and replaced by a trained agent of the illuminati ? 
  surely he would be a high-priority target . 
  if that were the case , to trust his articles would be to fall into the hands of the illuminati ... oh , decisions , decisions .
