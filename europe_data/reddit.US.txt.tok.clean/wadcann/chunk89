   the us has too many cases where by the time they ban it , it 's already caused a lot of harm . 
  could you give some examples ? 
  no , although usually if the us is off on an [ adventure of any significance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_united_states_military_operations ) somewhere in the world , the uk is also taking part . 
  err ... yes , my point is that it was a very great deal of influx into lesbos . 
  the eu uses them heavily and wants the us to recognize theirs and the us does n't use them much and does n't want to give the eu rights over brands in the us that it presently treats as generic terms . 
  edit : sorry , i guess i should have said `` gi '' rather than `` pdo '' . 
  [ more detail ] ( http://capreform.eu/geographical-indications-gis-in-the-us-eu-ttip-negotiations/ ) , and a [ newer update ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/germans-fret-about-kentucky-fried-bratwurst-under-ttip-311067 ) . 
  well , you 're going to get a lot of subjective answers ; it 's hard for an individual to have the immense , unbiased view required to really answer that . 
  pew polls on different opinions , and [ did a poll a while back ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/12/how-do-americans-stand-out-from-the-rest-of-the-world/ ) that could be summarized as : * relative to most polled countries around the world , americans much-more-strongly feel that success in life is under their own control , versus forces outside their control ; the uk also ranks near the us . 
  * relative to most polled countries , americans feel that working hard is very important to getting ahead in life . 
  not directly-answering-your-question , but that poll also has americans as an extreme outlier in describing the current day as a good day ; normally only poor countries do this . 
  no reference to the dispute over [ pdos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_indications_and_traditional_specialities_in_the_european_union#protected_designation_of_origin_.28pdo.29 ) . 
  i wonder if that got ironed out . 
   lesbos , an island about 10 km off the coast of turkey , received 1,600 arrivals on a single day last week . 
  the entire united states only grants lawful permanent residence to ~ 2,700 per day . 
  also , wikipedia says that the [ population of lesbos , as of 2011 , was just 86,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lesbos ) . 
  hmm . 
  that would cost money . 
  how about we provide moral support and guidance from the sidelines and someone else do the spending part ? 
  :-) thanks , uk !, 
  i suspect that a major part of this is that people tend to use , as their source of material : * media coverage . 
  this tends to focus on the sensational . 
  you do n't videotape countless hours of people walking down to a grocery store , but rather someone being shot . 
  my chance of being killed in a subway bombing in the uk are * vanishingly * low , but if i went to the uk , that 'd be very much on my mind , because aside from the voice actress who does the voice recordings and a catastrophic fire a few years back , that 's just about the only thing that i know about the uk subway system . 
  * articles that are trying to perform political advocacy in another country . 
  for example , let 's say i read material put out by media sources affiliated with sinn f\u00e9in , writing for an irish leftist audience , describing the european economic system , and that 's all i read to learn about the system . 
  i 'm probably going to get a view of the european economic system that is very different from what the average guy living in the netherlands has . 
  the imf and the eu had to reach an agreement in order to make that proposal to greece : that was something that they would have all accepted . 
  now , you can say that the proposal was n't acceptable to greece , or that it could have been improved , but not that the imf and the eu are unable to agree on something that they 'd accept in terms of greece 's actions : that was a concrete set of terms . 
  are there still internal differences , where one might give on one point a bit more than another ? 
  sure , but that will always be the case when any organization comes up with some proposal . 
  `` enthusiastic and they wholeheartedly support the us giving the same support to greece today if the us is willing to do so , '' i expect . 
  the flip side , though , is that the greek levels were n't going to be sustainable . 
  even if all of the debt was zeroed tomorrow , the creditors were never going to continue simply shoveling money into greece forever at the rates that had been seen . 
  if , for example , china and the eu suddenly started dumping huge amounts of money into the us and salaries dramatically-increased , but then the two stopped and us salaries fell much of the way back down towards prior levels , that seems like it would be more-comparable . 
  are there public estimates of how much greece loses each day that it does n't have some form of money ( drachma , whatever ) circulating ? 
  no need -- they dug their own hole ( though i understand that it was partly unexpected federal legislative changes that acted as the shovel ) . 
   you ca n't just compare him to such a far-right lunatic [ snippets from the nazi platform ] ( http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/25points.htm ) :  therefore we demand :   * that all unearned income , and all income that does not arise from work , be abolished . 
    * since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure , all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people . 
  we therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits . 
    * we demand the nationalization of all trusts . 
    * we demand profit-sharing in large industries . 
    * we demand a generous increase in old-age pensions [ nigel farrage , on the other hand : ` the tories have failed ; only ukip dares cut spending on nhs and pensions ' ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100257048/nigel-farage-the-tories-have-failed-only-ukip-dares-cut-spending-on-nhs-and-pensions/ ) you tell him , nigel . 
  do n't let those nazi hippies run amok . 
  also , that 's on top of the fact that they 're only open for a while each day , so all they have to do for planned maintenance is do it outside of trading hours . 
  and i 'm sure that they have an insane budget . 
   we never hear about how greece 's creditors are completely unable to reach an agreement over what they actually expect from greece . 
  i thought that the troika proposed an agreement which was rejected by greece a week ago . 
  most of those are not even concrete milestones . 
  that gives concrete times , but leaves a lot of flexibility as to how to implement them . 
  is that a * summary * of the plan , or the plan itself ? 
  i wonder how many [ nines the nyse gets in uptime ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_availability#percentage_calculation ) . 
  i know , i ca n't wait until there can be a greater focus on puerto rico 's debt !, 
  that 's not what you said above . 
  you said that government spending creates more gdp . 
  i gave you three numbers above . 
  the first is $ 300b . 
  this is gdp -- it 's just a number on paper that is some measure of the amount of `` economic activity '' in a country . 
  the second is $ 120b . 
  this is tax revenue -- that 's how much money the government takes in . 
  the third is $ 150b . 
  this is government spending -- that 's how much money is going out of the government . 
  the difference between tax revenue and government spending is the deficit -- the value of that affects whether-or-not / u/ekferti84x 's point holds . 
  when you said that gdp measurements include government spending , you 're saying that the $ 300b above includes the $ 150b of government spending ; your multiplier effect means that the $ 150b probably contributes a bit more than $ 150b to the $ 300b . 
  but it does n't mean that the $ 120b number need be greater than than $ 150b , which is what determines whether a deficit exists . 
  that does n't affect what i 'm saying -- i 'm pointing out that gdp is not tax revenue , and that this is the issue with your argument . 
  if you 're using / u/ekferti84x 's definition of `` overspending '' , that 's not true . 
  let 's say that greece has a gdp of $ 300b . 
  in this year , government tax revenues are $ 120b , and government spending is $ 150b . 
  you 're running a $ 30b deficit . 
  if the government keeps doing this each year , greece 's public debt will grow , and an increasing amount of its tax revenues will be consumed by debt service . 
  each euro that greece spends will indeed increase the amount of its gdp , but that does n't mean that greece ca n't run a deficit -- increasing the gdp by a euro does n't mean that greece then gets an extra euro in tax revenue . 
  does greece have penalties , like fines , for failing to provide a receipt ? 
  it seems like it would be really easy to have undercover tax investigators just go around and purchase services and record businesses not issuing receipts . 
  and it should be pretty easy to determine whether a tax investigator is generally-corrupt by having more-than-one investigator cover the same areas and running statistical analysis on the results : if one investigator is getting a statistically-significant higher level of receipts , they may be bad news . 
   lingua franca ( heh ) fyi , i 'd always vaguely assumed that the etymology of * lingua franca * had it coming from `` french language '' as well -- and that would make sense , because french * was * a major international language in the diplomatic world for a while -- but a couple years back i discovered that that [ did n't appear to be the case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lingua_franca#etymology ) . 
  why , if the request is n't for debt reduction , but just a later conference on same ? 
  creditors could go to the conference and just say `` no '' , and surely it does n't hurt them to at least listen to greece 's arguments . 
  if there 's no financial impact , the only effect is political . 
  is it * that * essential that syriza be totally politically-separated from any eventual , non-guaranteed debt forgiveness ? 
   and there is so much stuff the eu has done to us and played us for suckers you feel that on the whole , the other eu members have financially-benefited and greece has lost from greece 's time thus far in the eu ? 
  only slightly-related comment , since you 're talking about parties : just out of curiosity , the only non-obviously-tainted pro-european major greek party that i see [ listed on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_parties_in_greece ) is the very young potami , which i assume is trying to harvest centrist voters from the ruins of nd and pasok , who had ( temporarily ? ), 
  fled to the far left or far right . 
  i had n't seen much discussion about it during prior votes . 
  what do people in greece generally think of potami ? 
   government ca n't overspend by definition because everyone dollar the government spends = one dollar of gdp + the government multiplier effect . 
  what / u/ekferti84x is referring to by `` overspending '' is the fact that the cost of debt servicing in a country like greece will grow if it engages in deficit spending , and that high costs of debt service are undesirable ; therefore , some level of deficit spending can be seen as `` overspending '' . 
  what you 're saying is ... actually , i 'm not totally sure what you 're saying . 
  i * think * that you 're defining `` overspending '' as something like `` government spending being 100 % of the gdp '' , but in that case , you 're using a very different meaning -- that 's not what / u/ekferti84x was trying to say . 
  after the numerous times that rt has exposed the truth , you * still * have n't realized that the cia is behind all of the institutions in the eu ? 
  gotcha , thanks , same here -- median salaries on the order of $ 200k - $ 500k/year depending upon field of medicine . 
  i thought that it could be some form of state-set salary or something , since medicine is something that certainly can be treated specially , and in a few countries , like russia , doctors are unusually low-paid relative to people who work in other fields in the country . 
  nope !, 
   well , both receive in that case . 
  well , all right , employment contracts , then . 
  i was n't trying to argue with your comment as a whole : just picking at that one little nit . 
  normally if there 's an institution and a lot of individuals cutting deals , the institution is going to write the contract , and while it 's true that * usually * it 's not the institution handing out money , i do n't think that that 's always the case . 
  well , fair point , but while i do n't know this for certain , i 'd be very surprised to find that recording of state crime is not also a state function over here . 
  would a meeting of member states also be required to rapidly push approval of any accepted deal through , by this point ? 
  okay , wait a minute -- stop making fun of it for a sec .
