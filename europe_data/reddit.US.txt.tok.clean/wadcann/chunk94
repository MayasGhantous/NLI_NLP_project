  i mean , are n't military coups normally not driven by people from the elected government in power ? 
  http://t-government.blogspot.com/2011/06/greek-budget-visualisation-where-do.html not with the same level of detail , and this is four years old ( and quite possibly , given the time , incorrect ) data , mind . 
  does n't mean that that itself is n't part of accomplishing the broader goal . 
  well , i 'm not sure how interesting this is today ( obviously , the military balance of power has dramatically changed ) , but my understanding was that historically , the fact that russia had to pass through the dardanelles to reach the ocean and turkey , which controlled them , was in nato gave nato terrific power over russia 's naval forces . 
  russia today leases a naval base on cyprus , but if it were to have a naval base in the mediterranean with only greek water around it , and such that submarine traffic could n't be easily-monitored , that would presumably be interesting to russia . 
  they 'd have a better ability to place bases with aircraft and missiles that could be used against europe ( and in particular , to control the mediterranean ) in place , and to place radar and other sigint assets in the mediterranean . 
  i think that that 's a pretty big jump from where we are today , though . 
  if greece leaves the ez ( which at least some sources are flagging as likely ) , it might not leave the eu . 
  if greece leaves the eu , it may not leave nato . 
  if greece leaves nato , it may not affiliate with russia . 
  fair enough ; the analysis paper credited the greek situation . 
  i 've no way of judging whether it was correct or not . 
  [ searching for `` oxi '' on youtube and sorting by submission date ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=oxi&amp;search_sort=video_date_uploaded ) currently has 8 out of the top 20 hits being from rt , the russian state media outlet . 
  they 're having fun with this ... 
  i do n't know about that ... [ morgan stanley claims that a grexit is now probable ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c8n9f/greek_referendum_megathread_part_iii/cstevy8 ) after the `` no '' . 
   why would the creditors send a better proposal to him of all people before the referendum ? 
  [ because ... v is for varoufakis !,

  of course , if they were perfect at that , we 'd never have panics or bubbles ... or , for that matter , changing valuations at all . 
  :-) also , i 'm not sure whether the [ 29 % fall over the last three weeks in the shanghai composite index ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/07/06/china-stock-market-investors-pulling-out-directing-money-into-property-survey/ ) is at all related to european matters , but ... 
   i love this guy more every day . 
  well , this is over two years old . 
  also , remember that he 's speaking to a radical-left audience , and probably to at least some extent the speech is tailored to them . 
   lagarde acted against the advice of her own research department by not pushing for restructuring the greek debt . 
  the report was not published with support from the political side of the imf . 
  non european countries had to push hard to get it published before the referendum . 
  i 'm going to reference [ one of my comments from the megathread , part 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c8n9f/greek_referendum_megathread_part_iii/csth61b ) : according to the university of chicago analysis paper in the megathread , it 's apparently now expected that europe will lose its permanent leadership of the imf due to the fallout from the greek default . 
  i 'm not sure how much that had to do specifically with ms. lagarde 's actions , but i imagine that there will probably be chairs being shifted . 
  the ecb does n't need to engage in `` total economic war '' , yes ? 
  it just needs to stop providing subsidies to render the * status quo * untenable . 
  as [ the apocryphal story goes ] ( http://everything2.com/title/two+letters ) , now there 's a fresh letter to open ... 
   the french mayor complained it was being used on border defence and not to fix the town 's image would n't that be expected ? 
  i mean , the uk does have a good reason ( and thus should spend on , if it is to avoid externalities ) to want border control , but not to improve calais 's image . 
   the uk 's also deploying the ` national barrier asset ' . 
  [ wikipedia : national barrier asset ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_barrier_asset ) fair-enough , and if it 's intended to isolate the waiting area for the chunnel to separate pedestrian and vehicle areas and prevent stopped vehicles from being broken into , that seems reasonable . 
  perhaps it will resolve the problem ... 
   road haulage association warns of potential for fatal attacks and suggests deployment of french military to boost security that does not sound like a good idea to me . 
  the military is specialized for : * operating without infrastructure or pre-in-place supply ( which can be good not just for fighting but for addressing disaster situations ) . 
  * fighting wars/dealing with international situations . 
  * dealing with threats beyond the capability of police ( armed insurrections , etc ) . 
  * dealing with temporary issues -- they can be very quickly moved * en-mass * to one place . 
  none of these seem to be true for the calais situation . 
  the first item is not true because calais is a city . 
  it is perfectly reasonable for a regular police force to be in place . 
  the second item is not true because calais is not a war , and it is within france -- there is no requirement for the military 's ability to operate internationally . 
  the third item is not true because there is no rebellion or issue that police officers could not theoretically deal with . 
  the fourth item is not true , since there is no real reason ( that i can see ! ), 
  why the calais situation would be temporary . 
  if that 's the case , i 'd think that it would make more sense to hire more border patrol or police officers . 
  the people in * these * roles are going to be better at conforming to law , preventing escalation of a situation , and ensuring that nobody winds up hurt . 
  that seems like a more-appropriate response to what is currently happening . 
  believe me , i am more-than-happy to see europe adopt strict policies on illegal immigration , and if someone was proposing , say , repudiation of refugee acceptance or modifying what refugees could do during their time as refugees , that would be one thing , since it would have the potential to address a real problem . 
  however , i do n't think that putting military in as a police force makes much sense here : it 's not as if the military would be somehow * more-effective * at addressing the issue of illegal immigration than police would be . 
  putting a military force into the role of a police force has occasionally had serious consequences when issues are handled by people not trained as police : for example , the [ kent state shootings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kent_state_shootings ) in the us . 
  and even if you want to remove the kid gloves , remember that the kent state situation backfired politically against people who were unhappy against the people being policed . 
  i think a better approach would be to ask whether there are externalities , whether , for example , the uk is expecting france to do something that benefits the uk but not france . 
  if so , the uk should probably consider contributing money or personnel . 
  if not , then to look into why existing police have n't been able to deal with the situation -- are their numbers currently insufficient , or are they restricted in some way from addressing the situation ( e.g. 
  there is no law against loitering near the waiting area to enter the chunnel ) . 
  i understand that the eu does n't currently have a federalized pension system . 
  if all of the following are true : * pension is paid predominantly from income taxes . 
  * european countries assess national income tax based on where someone is working . 
  * within the eu , there is freedom to work move anywhere . 
  ... i do n't understand how the national pension systems can work in the long term . 
  there would presumably always be a strong incentive to move to a wealthy or young area and work there , rather than to an old and poor area . 
  this will cause wealthy/young areas to drain the tax base from the older , poorer areas . 
  is there some mechanism for addressing this ? 
  i 've been [ seeing sporadic news articles ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2015/0602/clean-sweep-ukraine-cans-all-its-bribe-hungry-traffic-cops ) about this : there 's been an effort on the `` fire everyone and start from scratch '' level to eliminate corruption in the law enforcement system , which i guess is the first step to bootstrapping everything else . 
  i would guess that you think of the `` other '' being `` greeks , composed of some corrupt people within the populace and a lot of people who evade taxes '' , and greeks think of the `` other '' being `` some corrupt people who cut deals with eu officials to rob us , who we refuse to give any taxes to '' . 
  to talk about europe !, 
  for those in europe not familiar with [ bernie sanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernie_sanders ) , he 's a us senator on the left end of the political spectrum in power . 
  i 'm neither an ir expert or economics expert , but i 'd say `` no '' . 
  it might have demonstrated flaws in some eu programs , but eu programs cover a wide range of things , and it 's a long way from even showing that the current-implementation of the eurozone does n't work outside of greece , much less a modified eurozone working , much less all eu programs -- trade agreements , standards-sharing , etc -- as a whole . 
   if the banks collapse , your society collapse too . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't know my economic history . 
  are there examples of a society where the economy is working relatively well other than investment banks flatlining and then the country as a whole locking up for a long time ? 
  you do n't quite have an [ uyghur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/july_2009_%c3%9cr%c3%bcmqi_riots ) or [ tibet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_tibetan_unrest ) situation in europe or the us . 
  one tidbit that caught my eye from the [ pdf of analysis from the university of chicago linked in the metathread text ] ( http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/papers/a-primer-on-the-greek-crisis_june29.pdf ) was the tidbit that europe will now probably lose its position of having leadership of the imf :  traditionally the head of the imf has been a european . 
  that is very likely to change since many countries believe that greece was treated preferentially because it was a european country . 
  i 'm not sure how much * practical * impact this has , but ... 
  on the other hand , cell phone companies are also literally hitler , so you 're between a rock and a hard place . 
  the [ * globe and mail * now has this tidbit ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/polls-suggest-greece-evenly-split-on-referendum-as-voters-turn-out-in-droves/article25306916/ ) ( which i believe is from morgan stanley , with * the globe and mail * being in error on the name ) :  after the vote results were confirmed , the foreign-exchange strategy team at wall street bank jp morgan said the no victory makes grexit -- greece 's exit from the euro zone -- `` [ our ] baseline scenario , with a probability at two-thirds at present . '', 
    there is a thread currently going on , talking about greece counterfeiting euros . 
    to be fair , if this iou thing varoufakis spoke about proves to be true , it is not very far-fetched . 
  i do n't understand how the iou thing is equivalent to counterfeiting . 
  an iou may be the route off the euro . 
  but it is not counterfeiting euros . 
  it can be distinguished from a euro , and if it turns out that it can not be converted to a euro , it is the iou that will fall in value , not the euro . 
  counterfeiting was * also * raised as a possibility by some representative in greece , but that 's not related to what mr. varoufakis was saying . 
  oh no you do n't . 
  japan probably hurt germany more than italy did in world war ii . 
  italy attacked greece and fell on its face , diverting german soldiers into greece to bail them out . 
  but japan attacked the us and brought her in , which definitely was not a net positive from germany 's standpoint . 
  the anglosphere would shift to being a pacific group . 
  huh . 
  i 'm pretty sure that that would melt the ice caps and flood various places in the world . 
  i would n't advocate for you to accept refugees ( though that 's one way to address the problem ) , but you are in the schengen area . 
  that means that if undesirables get in through a border , they 'll run around your country freely as well . 
  so it does make sense to share costs of border enforcement , the same way that provinces in poland would not force just border provinces to bear the cost of border enforcement .
