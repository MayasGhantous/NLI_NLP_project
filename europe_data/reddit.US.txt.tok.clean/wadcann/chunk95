  that could take many forms ( one of which would be accepting refugees ) , or might involve a policy change to have no country accept anyone at all . 
  because some people do n't know how to set up flairs ? 
  i do n't see how it would solve any problems . 
  greece leaving the euro would be because it wants a currency in which it can control the supply . 
  just as it ca n't generate more euros , it ca n't generate more dogecoins . 
  remembered it ; updated . 
  you 'll fit right in . 
  [ welcome to the popcorn factory 's \u00ae wholesale bulk popcorn program ] ( http://www.thepopcornfactory.com/wholesale-bulk-popcorn?flws_rd=1 )  custom printed or custom sized cartons require a minimum order of 5,000 units . 
  that probably should n't be an issue , though . 
   they did nothing to help the corruption and clientlism of the greek state they could n't . 
  germany and other creditors had no authority to arrest , investigate , or replace corrupt officials . 
  one characteristic of the eu in its present form is that all members are sovereign -- the only thing that other members can do is apply pressure via choosing to do business with each other or not ... and that 's what they have been doing . 
  there 's actually a subreddit devoted * entirely * to discussion in the form of an over-the-top victorian gentleman 's club , but i can not , for the life of me , remember its name at the moment . 
  edit : ah , got it -- / r/proper, 
  i would n't worry . 
  if ( a ) greece went that route and decided to print illegitimate euros and ( b ) the ez decided to address this via the `` invalidate currency '' route rather than the `` block consumables '' , or `` destroy the press '' , or `` make use of threats '' routes , there would assuredly be a period during which notes could be exchanged during which only a small number of bills would have been issued , and you 'd certainly be able to perform the exchange then . 
  there 'd be no reason to disrupt the ez so dramatically by just immediately invalidating currency in order to avoid the inflation that greece could potentially generate in a short period of time . 
  does n't have to involve blowing things up -- could be just `` helicopter people in , seize irreplaceable components , leave '' ; whatever has the least risk to render the press unusable . 
  thanks for doing the multiple megathread thing , mods . 
  kept the feedback readable and current . 
  [ ] ( http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f396/index.htm ), 
  or members from other eu nations could have their military destroy the press ( probably not on the expected agenda a week ago ! ), 
  or limit access to whatever consumables it uses , if those can be controlled effectively . 
  do n't forget the pound . 
  ca n't leave the uk off the list of powerful-organizations-that-must-be-pissed-off . 
  the us has [ blamed north korea for running state-operated us dollar counterfeiting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superdollar ) before . 
  the `` counterfeit option '' ca n't be a long-term solution , as there 's no way that it would be permitted to stay in place persistently by other ez members . 
  it could drain wealth from them for a short period of time at best . 
  this is interesting , but along the lines of what we recently-discussed re : flagging blogs-on-publication-domains , i 'd point out that this is a blog on the wsj domain rather than the wsj publication itself . 
   so through grexit ( greece exiting eurozone ) or any other means , greece may -- and now can -- look for other sources than eu interests to help its financial problems . 
    greece was invited to join brics bank very recently considering how greece was invited by russia to join brics bank ( source ) recently , referendum result gives the government the go card to get about going independent of eu interests . 
    brics bank may also demand various conditions from greece for loans , however considering how it was founded as a means to replace imf and provide a means to participating countries to evade political demands pushed by imf , its highly unlikely that the demands will be anything greece would hesitate from . 
  hmmm . 
  darn , that 's short notice to get wiretaps in place . 
  that 's fair enough . 
  i 've not heard of it before , but [ techcamp ] ( http://techcampglobal.org/ ) appears to be an open program that the us department of state has run [ around the world if someone can come up with funding ] ( https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/techcampglobal.glc2qpvi/page.html?access_token=pk.eyj1ijoidgvjagnhbxbnbg9iywwilcjhijoiee9ucxm2qsj9.nsh9bxwt66g9sxltboawqa#2/0.0/0.0 ) that covers electronic communication and marketing ; the destination pays $ 30k - $ 40k to cover the cost of the event -- that much looks legit . 
  they have a [ webpage ] ( http://techcampglobal.org/empowering-the-ukrainian-and-belarusian-civil-societies/ ) on the `` techcamp kyiv '' event that the legislator is referring to , with photographs and links , and there are videos of some of the events ; these are also held in the us and other places . 
  since the gentleman is claiming that these exist to fuel violent uprisings and that he had someone attend , are there recordings available of violent uprising advocacy being advocated by these ? 
  are greek banks not capable of moving to the drachma by tuesday ? 
  did n't poorer eu members also * see * an increase in standard-of-living with the existing eu policies relative to their pre-eu status ? 
   every major prosperous seaport city , and many inland cities have a greek community .

   allow companies to bring in workers from the third world well , workers are showing up in greece . 
  from the third world on their own , without any effort from companies . 
   `` the united states has initiated all those events in ukraine . 
  it has initiated a coup and put the current ukrainian leadership in power , '' he said in a reference to the massive public protests that chased ukraine 's former pro-moscow president from office . 
  one country has had everything from special forces to artillery to assault helicopters , naval forces , and annexation statements going on in ukraine over the past year , and it has n't been the us . 
  if you want to claim that the ukranians were n't running maidan , and that this was puppeted by the us , feel free to place down your evidence : my guess is that the world media would love it . 
  when nato said that there was russian artillery in ukraine , it provided photos . 
   patrushev claimed that the settlement of the ukrainian conflict depends entirely on the u.s.   `` if the u.s. takes steps to normalize the situation , it will be normalized . 
  if it does n't want to do so , the situation will drag on for a long time , '' he said . 
  i expect that the us does want the situation to normalize , and for ongoing occupations to end , which is why russia is presently subject to sanctions in the us . 
  in any of these countries , does the monarchy still hold the real political power ? 
  since we were talking about highlighting state news agencies , i 'd point out that [ xinhua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xinhua_news_agency ) is the state news agency of china . 
  yet ... 
  we did this with liberia . 
  `` and ... with an even number of votes , we appear to have come to an exact tie . '', 
  the brits were bringing up similar complaints about not having explicitly-voted for `` ever-closer union '' . 
  < shrug  i 'm sure that there are us examples as well . 
  just to be clear , there 's no negative connotation associated with it . 
  more-realistically , it 's probably because `` panzer '' started being used way back in world war ii in english media reports and through movies and books and whatnot afterwards , and thus entered the popular lexicon . 
  same as * blitzkreig * . 
  i dunno , why do n't we call the katana `` japanese scimitar '' ? 
  well , he 's presumably trying to find something that will be palatable both to creditors and to greece . 
  she 's a business reporter for * the telegraph * and [ this article was written for it ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11718554/germany-pleas-with-uk-to-remain-in-eu-to-fight-red-tape.html ) . 
  i assume that it 's more just that yahoo trusts * the telegraph * . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the uk 's eu membership is a bigger deal than greece 's . 
  on the other hand , in a parliamentary system , control of the executive and the legislative branches are merged , and that eliminates a check on the power of the executive . 
   in addition , zhirinovsky approved russian military build-up , using advanced weapon . 
  `` we need new missiles , laser , magnetic , natural , weather guns , '' he said . 
  now * i * want a weather gun . 
  score !, 
  no blame for the us !, 
  no , certainly losing tax dollars does n't invariably set opinion . 
  however , if you 're looking for a reason for a difference in overall opinion , i think that `` the americans did n't put money into this and get burned over the past years '' is a plausible explanation . 
  i do n't dispute that , but you said that you felt that the greeks would not like us views on pensions . 
   it is unfortunately impossible to sell in corrupt countries without bribes . 
  all companies including airbus , bae , lockheed , etc. 
  do it . 
  i ca n't say that they do n't , but if us companies get caught at it subject to 1977 , when the us cracked down on this :  as a result of u.s. securities and exchange commission investigations in the mid-1970s , over 400 u.s. companies admitted making questionable or illegal payments in excess of $ 300 million to foreign government officials , politicians , and political parties . 
  [ 5 ] the abuses ran the gamut from bribery of high foreign officials to secure some type of favorable action by a foreign government to so-called facilitating payments that were made to ensure that government functionaries discharged certain ministerial or clerical duties . 
  [ 5 ] one major example was the lockheed bribery scandals , in which officials of aerospace company lockheed paid foreign officials to favor their company 's products . 
  [ 6 ] :10 another was the bananagate scandal in which chiquita brands had bribed the president of honduras to lower taxes . 
  [ citation needed ] congress enacted the fcpa to bring a halt to the bribery of foreign officials and to restore public confidence in the integrity of the american business system . 
  ... they will be punished : [ wikipedia : foreign corrupt practices act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_corrupt_practices_act )  the anti-bribery provisions of the fcpa make it unlawful for a u.s. person , and certain foreign issuers of securities , to make a payment to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with , or directing business to , any person . 
  since the 1998 amendment of fcpa they also apply to foreign firms and persons who take any act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment while in the u.s. 
  the meaning of foreign official is broad . 
  for example , an owner of a bank who is also the minister of finance would count as a foreign official according to the u.s. government . 
  doctors at government-owned or managed hospitals are also considered to be foreign officials under the fcpa , as is anyone working for a government-owned or managed institution or enterprise . 
  employees of international organizations such as the united nations are also considered to be foreign officials under the fcpa . 
  < headscratch  i 'm not sure i follow ; my point is that the us presently provides comparable ppp-adjusted pensions to greece , though we would not use the term `` pension '' to refer to social security . 
  http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2013/06/07/labour-ministry-33-of-greek-pensioners-get-e360-gross-another-33-gets-e675/  according to the ministry , the average retirement income derived from the aggregation of main and supplementary pension and benefits does not exceed 907.65 euro , before taxes and deductions for healthcare . 
  that 's $ 12,101.04 / year in us terms at present exchange rates . 
  [ ppp-adjusted to a us equivalent , it looks like $ 15,126.30 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/pa.nus.pppc.rf ) . 
  https://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/income_pop55/2012/incpop12.pdf see table 5 . a1 ; median social security benefits for retirement-age ( 65 ) or older beneficiaries is $ 16,799 / year . 
  well , to be fair , the greek situation has now eaten a lot of their tax dollars , whereas for the us it 's just a `` oh , look , someone in europe is in trouble '' . 
  not quite a comparable situation . 
  i took -- perhaps incorrectly -- / u/dclauzel 's comment as an allusion to the practice of diluting wine . 
  my initial comment was more that including an entire industry into that category is starting to give a special status to a wider and more-mundane range of things than the perhaps unique and irreproducible works of art or architecture that also enjoy that status . 
  because `` panzer '' sounds cool .
