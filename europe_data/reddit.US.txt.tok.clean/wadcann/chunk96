  sure , and i 'm not saying that the goods purchased were of poor quality ( or due to bribery , though i suppose it never hurts to look into that ) . 
  i 'm just saying that us companies appear to have benefited more from greek military spending ( at least in gross , dollar-figure terms ) than german companies did . 
  [ afraid that we have n't the inventiveness to come up with all these clever adulteration schemes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2013/01/08/wine-scams-the-ultimate-hall-of-fame/ ) . 
  no , but i was really intending to draw a contrast with mr. papadimoulis 's statement , which was specific to germany . 
  also , i 'll be blunt : the us has been less-willing to provide money to greece than germany has . 
  germany , france , and other european sources extended greece below-market-rate loans . 
  the us did not . 
  what germany is talking about now , worst case , is simply doing what the us * always has been doing * , which is not extending below-market-rate subsidies to greece . 
  while i appreciate the political side of this , and that european creditors may benefit in ways that the us does not from subsidizing greece , i also think that it 's not entirely fair to germany to ignore that fact . 
  germany is , in absolute terms , not really threatening to do anything other than adopt us behavior . 
  true , the greek-german press discourse has become a bit acidic , due to germans being angry about potential loss of their taxes , and greeks being angry about potential economic damage due to change from the * status quo * , but surely the tone of words in journals at the moment is not the thing that really matters , at the end of the day ? 
   `` if there is one country that has benefited from the huge amounts greece spends on defence it is germany , '' said dimitris papadimoulis , an mp with the coalition of the radical left party . 
  the article 's chart shows almost twice as much greek spending going to us arms manufacturers as to german . 
   but the biggest crime is for the current generation , they have nothing to do with it yet they will pay for some stuff other people did . 
  happens with debt problems in general , regardless of the country . 
  that sounds actually about right -- iirc i saw one news story that listed 30k people . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/05/wine-strengths-country us wines appear to be the strongest ( in ethanol content ) on that list , and french wines the third-weakest , behind only portugal and canada . 
   i 'm sure toyota have already worked out the cheapest and quickest way to get the goods to their factory , doing it another way means delays and it also means that they either have to change the price of the car at the end or face making less money . 
  yes , i expect that they have : i 'm not advocating permanently shifting away from the chunnel . 
  however , the article states # 1b in losses , and there 's a question of whether it would cost # 1b to reroute the traffic . 
  that seems like a pretty substantial chunk of money to pull in additional ferry ships , and pay more rotterdam port workers . 
   note that -  loan not free money ... . 
  l o a n. to the extent that it was below market rates , it was free money -- just that the amount given was much less than the loan total . 
  there comes a point where world heritage status starts to become a bit diluted . 
  fair enough . 
  in this particular case , as per the first line of the story , while the russian bombers were off sweden , they did not violate its airspace . 
  the rotterdam-hull ferry ? 
  i mean , the glorious thing about shipping is that it 's really hard to take advantage of a monopoly over the flow of goods . 
   russian defence spending has increased to 4 per cent of gdp . 
  nato members are still striving for 2 per cent . 
  if nato ca n't be bigger , it must be smarter -- and more cost-efficient . 
  pooling military expertise makes strategic and economic sense . 
  err . 
  first , the us does n't spend as high a percentage of its gdp on the military as russia does , but it 's far above 2 % . 
  last i looked , estonia and greece were also meeting the 2 % level . 
  second , in absolute numbers , the sum total of nato member funding is much higher than russia 's . 
  [ russia has $ 69b/year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_armed_forces ) as of 2014 . 
  [ nato members in 2013 had a sum total of $ 1.02 t/year ] ( http://www.stripes.com/news/despite-cuts-nato-still-accounts-for-most-of-world-s-military-spending-1.269882 ) . 
  now , in fairness , nato members are more-politically-fragmented ( will all members respond in the same way to a conflict ? ) . 
  they are more geographically-separated : the us and canada ca n't just roll all of their tanks into a scuffle in europe . 
  also , the us also has obligations in east asia : us military port facilities there do n't contribute directly to european defenses . 
  but calling nato unable to compete with russia in size is a pretty big stretch . 
  honestly , how much more does it cost to use a ferry than the chunnel ? 
  surely it 's possible to increase ferry capacity ? 
  [ wikipedia : japan-russia relations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japan%e2%80%93russia_relations )  according to a 2012 pew global attitudes project survey , 72 % of japanese people view russia unfavorably , compared with 22 % who viewed it favorably , making japan the country with the most anti-russian sentiment surveyed . 
  well , for one , russia produces some products that europe imports . 
  europe could doubtless get them elsewhere , but it would cost more . 
  you have to ask yourself whether a particularly strong economic defense against russian influence is worth the continuing costs . 
  maybe it is , but i do n't think `` there is a vulnerability here '' makes it inherently worthwhile . 
  in some areas , like natural gas , having a plan b ( stockpile , lng shipping , pre-created shortage plans , cutting deals in advance with lng providers , etc ) in place to ensure that russia ca n't induce catastrophic problems might be valuable , but that 's not the same as a complete firewall between the economies . 
  no flashing . 
  please . 
  a russia-state-run news agency that tends to run articles positive of the kremlin and negative of things that the kremlin does n't like ; it has a substantial budget and has been linked a fair amount on reddit . 
  originally `` russia today '' , later renamed to `` rt '' , and now apparently `` ruptly '' . 
  [ wikipedia : rt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt_%28tv_network%29 ) for more . 
   there is something wrong with a democracy where people like these can climb to the top . 
  i would assume that this is just whatever the pr people think will best sell the greek public on a `` no '' vote at this point . 
  he did n't say things like this in the past . 
  well , [ greece only has 1,228 km of land borders in * total * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_territories_by_land_borders#g ) , so that kind of puts a cap on it . 
  from wordnet ( r ) 3.0 ( 2006 ) [ wn ] : protest n 1 : a formal and solemn declaration of objection ; `` they finished the game under protest to the league president '' ; `` the senator rose to register his protest '' ; `` the many protestations did not stay the execution '' [ syn : { protest } , { protestation } ] 2 : the act of protesting ; a public ( often organized ) manifestation of dissent [ syn : { protest } , { objection } , { dissent } ] 3 : the act of making a strong public expression of disagreement and disapproval ; `` he shouted his protests at the umpire '' ; `` a shower of protest was heard from the rear of the hall '' sounds like that 's compatible with being government-organized . 
  well , in my case , i 'd like to know whether a particular news source is a state-operated international information outlet ( read : propaganda source ) . 
  to be fair , ( a ) the us-mexico border is 3,145 km long , and ( b ) it 's not clear that the us government really is that concerned about this . 
  both / u/crap _ people , who was the op , and / u/kapparoth , who you were responding to , were not advocating blocking them , but highlighting the source . 
   so fuck random bloggers , and viva the status quo ? 
  well , if that random blogger can establish a good reputation with me , he can * displace * < arbitrary news source  . 
  i can think of a couple blogs that win for me over a couple of mainstream news sources . 
  i agree that those sites have substantial bias and do n't give a remotely-complete view of topics they discuss ( and add zerohedge to that mix ) , but how do you identify that bias in a way that everyone would agree with ? 
  i see four issues that people have raised in this thread : ** state foreign news organizations ** ( or , less-delicately , propaganda ) . 
  rt is obviously an important one here ; sputnik news is another . 
  the main concern with these , i 'd think , is that they have a goal to promote particular views ; if someone does n't know that they 're looking at a propaganda source , putting them high on reddit can contribute to being misled . 
  also in that camp ( though i personally think that the bias level is vastly lower than rt/sputnik ... but of course , maybe that 's just my us-centric perspective ) would be the us-operated [rferl.org ] ( http://www.rferl.org/ ) and the [voanews.com ] ( http://www.voanews.com/ ) sites . 
  whether-or-not these are objective on an article-by-article basis , they exist because one country wanted to adjust international views , and i would n't be surprised if topic selection there , at least , is intended to affect views . 
  ( example from the current rferl.org front page : is it * really * important international news that some jews are fleeing putin ? ), 
  al-jazeera english , from qatar , and iran 's presstv are other good examples . 
  i am kind of in favor of the idea of highlighting state-funded international news agencies with the state running them ; i think that it takes people a while to learn the name/country mappings . 
  then there 's ** publications that simply have a bias or where someone is complaining about their quality ** . 
  this ranges from things that exist * just * as political advocacy , like * mother jones * , to things like * the guardian * , where there 's going to be a center-left british bias . 
  this seems , to me , like a hard issue to address . 
  maybe you can flag some of the most-egregious offenders , but this is starting to get into objecting to fairly mainstream material . 
  furthermore , while * the economist * might seem statist to me with its support of the nhs , it might seem downright * laissez-faire * to others : some of the bias is a function of the viewer 's eyes . 
  next , ** material that comes from what initially appears to be a reputable news source , but is actually a blog ** on the same domain , where pages there are held to a much lower standard than the edited publication itself . 
  it took me a while to pick up on this , and i suspect that a lot of people have also been thrown . 
  that might be something that could be addressed , though it seems like an ongoing battle ... and perhaps the right thing to do * is n't * to bother to try to distinguish between the `` blog '' and the `` main publication '' -- after all , if the publication is willing to slap its brand on something , perhaps it * should * cause people to simply lower their expectations of it . 
  finally , there are some ** dubious blogs ** . 
  maybe the author just does n't know material , or maybe he has an agenda . 
  globalresearch.ca , for example , has a very pro-russia , anti-us stance , and i occasionally see links to it , but i 've no idea whether it 's state-funded . 
  zerohedge , a popular source of links on reddit , has extremely alarmist articles , and i think that pretty much everyone out there would agree that it does n't give a complete image of what it covers . 
  of these four things , i think that the one that would be most-viable to address would be to flag state-funded news sources . 
  it at least is not particularly controversial , and it presently does have some correlation with biased material . 
  well ... in an ideal world , sure . 
  but let me be honest -- suppose i removed all publications and author information , and just gave you a big stack of anonymous articles . 
  it 'd avoid risk of bias , but it 'd probably take you a lot longer to evaluate the material . 
  reputation * does * count for something , and forbes-the-publication has ( at least in my mind ) a reasonable reputation , better than what a random blogger would receive . 
  i have been entertained with how rt periodically adjusts its name : russia today -  rt -  ruptly . 
  next i expect a logo change to split with any past reputation . 
  wikileaks put up some documents in the last few days where the uk bugged the franco-german discussions that were coming up with the greek bailout plan a few years back and sent them to the us ; that then was leaked . 
  it has been posted to this subreddit a number of times in the past couple of days . 
  it 's mostly-interesting at the moment because merkel and lagarde were n't sure during the discussions that greece could handle the debt load in the bailout plan . 
  for people complaining about the plan being unrealistic , this was taken as vindication of their position . 
  sch\u00e4uble 's position was also given -- he was advocating for more debt reduction .
