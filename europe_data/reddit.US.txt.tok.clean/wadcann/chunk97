  my point is that if he 's caught flak for the plan being too tough , it 's probably frustrating , since he was an advocate of reducing greece 's debt relative to other figures in the discussions . 
  a number of sources that i 've listened to or read have commented on the cyclic nature of [ religious revivals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_revival ) . 
  i mean , i suspect that similar sentiments were expressed at least as far back as the enlightenment , and yet there 's been remarkable resurgences . 
  they were n't always embodied as western christianity -- for example , a few decades back , the [ new age movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_age ) . 
  i guess what i 'm getting at is that religion has had pretty remarkable staying power , and i 'm skeptical that it will simply just vanish , based on past incorrect predictions along these lines . 
  not much content , other than it it associating the greek government with the spanish political situation , i guess . 
  google translate english :  yanis varufakis , greek minister of economy and finance , the spaniards goes to remind you that both peoples have much in common . 
    `` politicians routinely try to divide and conquer , so it is absolutely important now is for all europeans and of course spanish and greek to understand that we have a common interest , '' said the greek politician . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism  fascism ( / f\u00e6\u0283\u026az\u0259m / ) is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism [ 1 ] [ 2 ] that came to prominence in early 20th-century europe . 
  influenced by national syndicalism , fascism originated in italy during world war i , in opposition to liberalism , marxism , anarchism and traditional conservatism . 
  [ snip ]  fascists advocate a mixed economy , with the principal goal of achieving autarky to secure national self-sufficiency and independence through protectionist and interventionist economic policies . 
  the eu 's actions really have a difficult time fitting into this slot . 
  it can be undesirable or something that you disagree with , but i think that few would call it fascist . 
  i lean right-libertarian . 
  i 'm not sure why that would affect one 's take . 
  i do n't really think that war will happen ( well , maybe civil war in greece eventually ? ), 
  but there are certainly parallels there . 
  the weimar republic suffered from some of the same issues that greece has been . 
  both had severe ongoing debt payments , and the public did n't see a realistic , swallowable way out . 
  there were a substantial core of people who felt that they 'd been sold out by politicians , there was high unemployment and there was a recession . 
  if greece moves to the drachma , it will probably see a fair amount of inflation , as germany did . 
  is greece going to attack anyone as a result of it ? 
  its position is different from that of germany 's : maybe not , no , and maybe `` war '' ( outside of perhaps eventual civil war in greece ) is melodramatic . 
  but does it pose a risk of having similar internal political pressures in greece ? 
  sure , i do n't see why not . 
  heck , we would n't even be talking about syriza 's decisions as greece 's government if it had n't . 
  and there are plenty of other real , unpleasant ways in which extreme public dissatisfaction might register : greece [ has had an unhappy history of far-left terrorism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_greece ) , and that would n't be much fun to have popping up again in europe . 
  if many people feel that they will be crushed economically for their lifetime by the demands of creditors and want to swing back ... < shrug , 
  honestly , assuming that tank still runs , barring a lack of parts availability , it 's probably still useful from a military standpoint -- i doubt that the characteristics of recovery vehicles have changed all that much since then . 
   what troika is doing right now to greece is exactly what europe did to germany after wwi . 
  as [ dickrhino so eloquently put it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2copj6/the_autonomous_region_of_%c3%a5land_a_romantic_tragedy/ ) on his / r/polandball comic on \u00c5land : [ immediately after the creation of the league of nations ] league of nations ball : `` ho ho ho !, 
  buildings of eternal peace so easy , you all of idiots . 
  now where germany ? 
  i will of shoving things into germany 's ass ! '', 
  why does france ban surrogate parents ? 
  religious reasons ? 
  it 's pretty low-content ; a lot of `` democracy is good , pride is good , terrorizing is bad , this is a historic vote , courage is good , democracy has won '' . 
  i do n't know what the norm is for politics in greece , and i did n't expect him delving into specifics , but he really did n't make an argument about why greek voters would concretely-benefit from making a particular vote here , even at a very high level . 
  i think that a number of politicians in this crisis have let themselves fall prey to letting out emotions and personal comments . 
  i realize that maybe they wanted to just hold things in until negotiations broke off and have been wanting to vent for months now , but still ... part of the job should be not flaming people , infuriating as it may be . 
  vent privately about someone 's personality , not to the press or to blogs or twitter . 
  unless , of course , all this is a cleverly-crafted pr effort ... but it seems kind of inflammatory to be doing that . 
  this is not to make light of problems that greece will likely face , but i 'd point out that bloomberg is using `` pre-crisis '' as sort of a norm for the country . 
  if greece was then in a large debt-filled bubble of economic activity , and germany was * not * , asking how long it will take to return , via a sustainable route , to again hit those levels is asking two different things of the countries . 
  of course , in absolute terms , a german teenager might be better off anyway ... but i 'm not sure how interesting a `` time to to pre-crisis level '' metric is . 
  if you could magic a large , non-corrupt , center-right party out of the air , that 'd probably go over pretty well . 
  although ... you * are * in the eu with germany ... 
   i swear to god if i hear one more person compare government debt to personal debt ... 
  i do n't know what your basis for the statement here was , but if it 's from the past discussion on us debt where it became popular among people who favored more government spending , that argument was tightly coupled to the idea that a government could inflate its way out of debt , which individuals could not ; us debt was dollar-denominated ( outside of tips and other not-significant factors ) . 
  in greece 's situation , a key element of the crisis is over the fact that greece is using the euro , where that is not an option , and its debt is euro-denominated . 
  mr. krugman , for example , who felt strongly that concern over us government debt was misplaced and was a major advocate of the us taking on a larger debt load , here simply feels that greece should dump the euro ; he 's not taking the same position on greece as he did on the us . 
  if you have a different rationale for taking that position , fair-enough . 
   with no he will have to deal with the eu people why can he not resign in that case ? 
   before you post for the thousand time the `` legal expert '' who thinks it `` inconceivable '' to exit the eurozone and not eu ... mr. varoufakis blogged that one necessarily followed the other . 
  of course , he may be wrong , or he might intentionally be making an incorrect claim for political reasons , i suppose . 
  edit : the [ link ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2012/05/16/weisbrot-and-krugman-are-wrong-greece-cannot-pull-off-an-argentina/ ) to his blog post , which was on this subreddit the other day :  when argentina defaulted and broke the peg , the ill effects on its trading partners ( china , brazil etc. 
  ) , as well as on the broader macro-economy in which it was functioning , were negligible . 
  if greece leaves the euro , however , the results will most certainly prove catastrophic for our ` economic ecology ' , and in a never-ending circle of negative feedback , will bite our struggling nation back . 
    to begin with , greece must exit not only the eurozone but also the european union . 
  ** this is non-negotiable and unavoidable ** . 
  [ emphasis mine ] for if the greek state is effectively to confiscate the few euros a citizen has in her bank account and turn them into drachmas of diminishing value , she will be able to take the greek government to the european courts and win outright . 
  additionally , the greek state will have to introduce border and capital controls to prevent the export of its citizens euro-savings . 
  thus , greece will have to get out of the european union . 
   blaiming all on europe and sch\u00e4uble the nsa leak had him as being in the more-generous-to-greece camp , too . 
  if the troika believes that its proposal truly is not sustainable * and * truly never intends to provide debt relief , how would the troika benefit from greece adopting an unsustainable program ? 
  i can at least understand the claims coming from people saying `` well , greece would have been effectively dropped from the eu back during the crisis -- but the eu needed to stabilize its banking system , and so greece was given an unsustainable program '' . 
  they may be wrong , but the position is at least self-consistent . 
  but that argument does n't make sense to me * today * -- the eu 's banking system ( supposedly ) is n't going to go break if greece leaves the euro . 
  why would there be any incentive , if it * truly * is the case that it can not work , to adopt such a program ? 
  why would the troika bother to propose any plan at all or negotiate , if it has no reason to want to continue with greece ? 
   mod tools have not been updated in several years . 
  there * is * an open api . 
  what is the functionality that is lacking ? 
  also , honestly , your name is one that i 've seen repeatedly come up in spats associated with subreddit drama ( e.g. 
  fights over power-users abusing their position ) . 
  to be fair , if more debt forgiveness is desirable , this is probably a tragedy-of-the-commons situation : you do n't want to * individually * take action when you only benefit if a sufficient number of people all choose to do so . 
  so i expect that going through the troika , which is what has been happening , would be the way to go . 
  all the uk and us credit is private , though , so it 's not quite the same as the other countries : some banks in those countries will get burned . 
  i 'm guessing that voters are less-interested in private losses than public . 
  i understand that that depends on your region . 
  also , i do n't really feel that i have enough information to protest someone being fired/laid off/whatever . 
  there are legitimate reasons to fire someone . 
   if those guys knew what they where doing , they would \u00b4 t had promised what they could \u00b4 t accomplish an awful lot of politicians around the world apparently do n't know what they are doing . 
  wow , that was damned impressive :  fairly recent research shows what can arguably be seen as the ongoing effect on the public mind . 
    in 1992 , 15 % of americans considered it definitely or probably true that `` the aids virus was created deliberately in a government laboratory . 
  '' [ 2 ] in 2005 , a study by the rand corporation and oregon state university revealed that nearly 50 % of african americans thought aids was man-made , over 25 % believed aids was a product of a government laboratory , 12 % believed it was created and spread by the cia , and 15 % believed that aids was a form of genocide against black people . 
  [ 2 ] other aids conspiracy theories have abounded , and have been discredited by the mainstream scientific community . 
  i knew about the `` african-americans have an extremely-high rate of belief that the us created hiv '' phenomenon , but i always thought that this stemmed from the [ tuskegee syphilis experiment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuskegee_syphilis_experiment ) fallout , which was a major political scandal in the us , not from an actual soviet propaganda program . 
  also maybe / r/gifts and / r/giftideas . 
  `` oh , thanks / u/spnthrwwy !, 
  it 's ... oh , it 's a. . . well ... apparently a stack of extremely stale pancakes . 
  it 's ... just what i 've always wanted . '', 
  `` you 're welcome !, 
  i asked over a third of a million people what american things spaniards want , and this was their recommendation ! '', 
  it 's a step that would potentially let a police state control population movement ... logging where people travel and having a history of that would be interesting . 
  on the other hand , cell phone data probably already * tends * to leak a lot of that . 
   yet , however obvious it may seem to some now , at the time it really was inconceivable that a country would willingly shoot itself in the foot and lie it 's way into euro for its own detriment . 
  a country is n't a unitary mass . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the greek * public * , given a `` shoot self in foot '' button , would n't push it . 
  it 's just that repeated governments had did things that were in their own interests but not in greece 's .
