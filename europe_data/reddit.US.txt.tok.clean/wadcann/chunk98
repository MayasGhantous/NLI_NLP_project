  honestly , if the eu could standardize a `` reform '' process that really worked , it would be a huge advancement . 
  probably , from a political standpoint , reforms that impose service cuts ca n't come early . 
  the dna is very popular , on here , for example -- the question becomes how to create that kind of structure . 
  in romania , it wound up being permitted to exist , or at least was n't directly-dangerous to its creators in the immediate term . 
  the fbi took something of this role in the us when the mafia became a big deal -- the mafia would have to simultaneously corrupt both local law enforcement * and * the fbi , which was specifically going after the mafia . 
  granted , i 'm not saying that the us is a mirror here -- the fbi was n't an early structure in the us -- but it might work . 
  let 's say that the eu creates an anticorruption law enforcement agency with jurisdiction across the eu and a mandate limited to investigating and prosecuting state officials for corruption and dealing with organized crime . 
  my guess , based on the dna , is that this would be wildly popular with the public , so it passes the `` public referendum '' test . 
  it might * not * be popular with politicians who are skimming off the top , but if it could be constructed in such a way as to be a referendum question * and * be tied to things that people want * and * would grant amnesty on crimes up until this date , it might manage to get in . 
  it would also be politically-difficult to avoid . 
  establish serious criminal penalties for this eu-anti-corruption-force for leaking information outside of investigations . 
  at that point , the eu is providing a popular-with-the-public service that seems to be one of the reason that the population of countries really want to get into the eu -- to get a way to avoid national corruption . 
  it 's addressing one of the major problems that the eu has ( that has potentially caused a member state to fail out of the eu ) . 
  seriously . 
  the thing has n't caused any problems since world war ii . 
  let the poor guy have his tank . 
  maybe needs a good , scary external enemy posing an existential threat , like the us states had with the uk during formation . 
  russia does not really qualify for most eu countries ( and the fact that germany is hellbent on looking like it 's not a military power for political reasons and thus not a source of protection for eastern europe probably does n't help ) . 
  `` immigrants '' or `` russia-imposed russians forcibly as part of the [ russification process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification ) and also low-education africans flooding claiming refugee status ? '', 
  because i think that * most * countries would n't be all that enthusiastic about either of the latter . 
  let 's say you had a bunch of , say , medical doctors from india wanting to get in . 
  would poland be complaining about that ? 
  well , polish * doctors * might not like that , but i bet that poland as a whole would be pretty happy with it . 
   i want it to stop , and i know it is very much possible for it to be stopped in theory . 
  well , spying is an old practice , nothing new , and as i [ point out below ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3buluu/germany_to_spy_on_us_and_uk_intelligence/cspt6af ) , it 's pretty hard to verify that someone is n't spying . 
  i 'd guess that you 'd need to do one of the following : * you need to invent a way to verify that spying does n't happen ( including intelligence-swapping to obtain information indirectly ) so that you have a mechanism to cut deals on spying . 
  * you need to have such overwhelming penalties that the risk is unacceptable ( `` if we find out about a single case , we nuke you . '' ), 
  * while i suspect that even within the us , states engage in * some * degree of espionage against each other ( e.g. 
  when conducting bids for countries to locate near each other ) as far as i know there 's no formal state-level intelligence system . 
  so i guess that unifying interests within the eu as much as possible , establishing a trans-eu federal justice system with jurisdiction across the eu and within that , establishing federal laws against spying , and federalizing intelligence agencies would probably help reduce the frequency of inner-eu spying . 
  be a pretty big project , though , and you 'd have to construct it so that it would be in the interest of all members to adopt it . 
  in greece , is it illegal for the army to suppress a rebellion ? 
  in the united states , that 's one of the limited cases where the army * can * be used domestically . 
  i expect that he 's too busy writing articles , like [ `` putin says ukraine being overrun by fascists - and he may be right '' ] ( http://www.jpost.com/international/putin-says-ukraine-being-overrun-by-fascists-and-he-may-be-right-403205 ) . 
  is that what was implied , or rather that it suppresses rebellions ? 
  let 's say that greece leaves the ez and the eu . 
  in what way does it change the motivations and incentives of eu members from a month earlier that would cause them all to now not want to be in the eu ? 
   tsipras might have come close to signing even without debt restructuring , whereas v-man was completely opposed . 
  i am dubious that they walked into the negotiations without coordinating a position and then honestly split there . 
   together with the fact that these treaties are negotiated in secret often with no knowledge of who 's taking part of the negotiation as far as i know , trade deals are normally produced privately . 
  as as i 've pointed out before , i do n't think that producing them publicly buys anything . 
  the us congress is televised and public . 
  this means that all the real decision-making via phones or private meetings , and then there 's some for-public-consumption speech-making that does not exist to convince legislators . 
  same thing with , i 'm sure , parliamentary legislatures . 
  you can mandate that negotiations be public , in which case you 'll have private , out-of-band discussion making the real decisions and then some sort of choreographed public `` decision-making '' process to arrive at these . 
  maybe so , but would knowing that change his position ? 
  i 've no reason to believe that he is doing things that he believes goes against greece 's interests . 
   after all , we 're no more than strategic partners , hardly worthy of the treatment say , nzl gets ( for speaking english ? ) . 
  ... the us and the uk also spy on each * other * . 
  take the [ suez crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) . 
  the uk tried pulling off an invasion without the us knowing until after it had been completed , and the us was meanwhile spying on the thing . 
   as you might guess , i think of the us as more than a partner but as a vital friend and ally . 
  and in a time of increasing competition from china or india , the `` free world '' should n't do this to each other . 
  i 'd be very surprised if the us and germany did n't also exchange information on china and india . 
  i do n't know what current obstacle there is to germany being elevated to the uk 's position re : the us . 
  if i had to guess without any knowledge whatsoever : * i 'm not familiar with the origin of five eyes , but probably part of it was that there was probably already some commonwealth intelligence infrastructure in place from the british empire and the us got elevated into * it * rather than visa versa . 
  that is , it was less `` us : new zealand speaks english , so they 're cool -- we should trust them with intelligence deals '' and more `` uk : us , you want to swap information with the ol' british empire intelligence system that we 've been running since time immemorable ? '', 
  * from a sigint standpoint , the commonwealth nations are all around the world , which was historically nice for placing listening stations . 
  * in terms of `` groups '' , the smaller the group , the less-risky it is as regards leaks . 
  i expect that the uk is pretty irked that the us screwed up and let the snowden leak let germany know that the uk was spying on it . 
  * i 'm sure that germany and the us already swap intelligence information themselves directly , and ditto with the uk . 
  i also doubt that germany is high on the list of things that the us is worried about relative to , say , china , but it 's one of the major countries in the world , and things that germany is up to definitely affect the us . 
  * germany spends [ $ 600m/year on the bnd , $ 231m/year on the bfv , and $ 74m on the mad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesnachrichtendienst ) . 
  the uk [ spends # 2.3 b/year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secret_intelligence_service ) . 
  ( the us [ spends $ 80b/year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_intelligence_budget ) ) . 
  it 's probably easier to find interesting information to swap if you 're gathering a lot . 
  keep in mind that the reason this is coming up now is because the snowden stuff makes the us particularly visible . 
  in the past , public leaks have exposed other things , including israel spying on the us and the nsa spying on canada . 
  would it be cheaper in terms of counterintelligence spending if countries knew that they were n't spying on each other ? 
  cheaper in terms of intelligence spending if countries knew that anything that they cared about was being shared ? 
  probably , but even if countries wanted to do this and chose to agree to it , it would be totally unverifiable , which makes it a non-starter . 
  furthermore , it would be viable to swap some * other * country 's intelligence agency for something even if the country that wanted the information did n't do the spying , which means that even verification that a country 's own intelligence agency was n't spying would n't mean that it was n't obtaining intelligence . 
  who cares whether he has a designer scarf or not ? 
  would he be doing a better job if he were wearing rags ? 
  i only do that because they invariably change the style up or stop making them in a year or three and it becomes impossible to get the thing again . 
  really annoying . 
  ca n't wait until we have computerized garment-production-on-demand . 
   he does n't seem to understand the difference of extending the second bailout ( could have been a quick process if he had n't let that expire ) and negotiating a completely new third bailout ( will be a lenghty process any way you look at it ) . 
  surely if you are familiar with this , he would be too , given that it has to have been a major focus of his for months ? 
   there 's no realistic scenario in which we 'll be in a war with the us or the uk anytime soon . 
  none of this was military intelligence . 
  it was `` germany is going to try to push through a tax on the us and the uk '' , not `` germany is about to bomb london '' . 
  iran was n't [ collaborating with the others in world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-soviet_invasion_of_iran ) .

   comes and spies on the industry i 'm not convinced that the nsa/cia is taking technology/bids and giving them to competitors , which i believe is what you 're concerned about . 
  i will bet that it 's off spying on ttip negotiations , though . 
  no , but thanks !, 
   as soon as getting busted for frivolous espionage starts costing people their tax money , the domestic pressure on governments to stop doing it will mount up quite quickly . 
  [ pressure from exposed taxpayer spending on frivolous espionage operations does n't seem to have dramatically-curtailed the cia in the past ] ( http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-weirdest-cia-programs.php ) ... 
  the us had a big , bitter political spat a few years back that in some ways parallel this one ( spend with debt or make use of austerity ) , and ezra klein and matthew yglesias and some of the other names that i see there were advocates of the same positions then ; it also became something of a partisan and ideological issue at that point . 
  that 's why i do n't think that us commentary is [ so much driven by nationality , as some folks here seem to think ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bt9xk/a_response_to_krugman_stiglitz_sachs_co/cspcx7z ) , as it is by positions established at that point in time in reference to the us 's situation . 
  i 'd think that median wage would be more-interesting than mean wage . 
  hmm . 
  apparently [ wonkblog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dylan_matthews ) shares authors with vox.com . 
  it 's been linked to a few times recently and [ has a similar take ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/6/30/8871981/germany-angela-merkel-greece ) . 
   alleged dumping pricing of solar panels ? 
  oh , good grief . 
  is that a claim in the eu too , and not just the us ? 
  a new task would probably require a budgetary increase for the bfv . 
  also , now that mi6 and the nsa have new difficulties to face , they probably also require budgetary increases .
