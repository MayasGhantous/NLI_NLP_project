  if abruptly the entire western hemisphere imposed a tax on financial transactions , i would assume that there would be a lot of people figuring out how to move their transactions to unaffected financial centers .

  i do n't know the guy , and i 'm sure that many people are very unhappy with his positions ( and with the net effects of past administrations ) , but i 'm pretty sure that negotiators have dealt with people with all of those characteristics before . 
  yes , obviously if he were standing up and gibbering about how the table was trying to eat him , that might be a different affair ... but i 'm also pretty sure that nobody is claiming that .

  [ snip ]  the artistic achievements are less abundant than in europe . 
  [ snip ]  nevertheless , us works remain very close to the european models until the twentieth century . 
  [ snip ]  in the late nineteenth century , culture is monopolized by an educated and wealthy elite . 
  [ snip ]  there is no ministry of culture in washington , dc , to avoid centralization and all official art . 
  also , can the american cultural policy appear to be extremely fragmented among thousands of players . 
  [ snip ]  there are two types of culture in the united states : the learned and elitist culture ( high culture ) , apparently unknown in europe , and popular culture ( mainstream , lowbrow culture ) that seems to have conquered the world . 
  [ snip ]  american culture is nevertheless the result of european influences ( academy of fine arts , impressionism ) and global . 
  american culture is partly broadcast by capitalism , globalization and liberalism , but they are not the only factors explaining 57 : the use of english , the dynamism of american universities , the liveliness of subcultures , support from foundations and philanthropy , the action of local communities and cultural agencies are all strong points . 
  but it is not imposed by force , as recalled by the political scientist joseph nye with its concept of `` soft power '' . 
  adrien lherm takes up this idea that americans benefit from globalization without imposing it by force :   '' [ ... ] the export of american model responds less to a program that imperialist '' pure `` and simple logic of profit - greedy , yes , but not conquering military and political sense . 
  what they are now working to do , across the planet , it 's less to impose an example [ ... ] to ensure outlets for their powerful cultural sector [ ... ] 58 . '',

  huh . 
  ex-soviet states at the time of the breakup ? 
   the man 's erratic , manipulative and seems to lack basic decency . 
  if that 's a real problem impeding negotiations -- and i am skeptical -- i am dubious that the best of the entire diplomatic corps in europe can not manage to handle this . 
  indians ( as in , people from india , not native americans ) , in my experience , do not generally drink beverages with ice in them . 
  in the us , it 's very common to ice beverages in restaurants ( soft drinks , water , etc ) .

  would n't the public have noticed the lack of a wave of death associated with the introduction of air conditioning ? 
  a breeze is not the same thing , though . 
  a draft is , as you put it , moving air indoors ( or in a cave or something like that ) . 
  a breeze does n't have that indoors connotation ... if anything , it would imply being outdoors . 
   and they all say that keeping your ac lower than 6 deg . 
  c below what 's outside is a health hazard . 
  o_o this is like the moment when i realized that korean [ fan death ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fan_death ) fear was a real thing . 
  oh , absolutely -- it ca n't generate wealth out of thin air . 
  all it 's doing is potentially being a more-politically-acceptable way to transfer wealth , because you 're just `` extending a loan '' . 
  actually , i will give one caveat -- in greece 's case , where leaving a currency is being talked about , a no-interest loan might be a transfer but would * also * tend to lock them into the euro ( since it would still be a debt presumably denominated in euros to pay ) . 
  greece could n't convert that debt to drachmas ... but i guess that that 's already pretty much the case for greece 's debt , so ... < shrug  it also means that the inflation rate of the euro over the next n years would set how * much * wealth is ultimately transferred to greece , so it might create an incentive for greece to advocate for policies that generate euro inflation , but assuming that the existing euro-denominated loans have a defined rate of interest , the same is already true . 
  anyway , it 's only really relevant if merkel and friends * want * to give more money and simply have their hands tied by their public * and * their public wo n't be upset by wealth transfer via this route . 
  in the past , countries have sometimes extended zero-interest loans . 
  because the currency that the loan is denominated in normally constantly sees inflation , there is a transfer of wealth : this is the difference between the value of money at the time it was extended and at the time that it was paid off . 
  that might be more-politically-acceptable than just saying `` i 'll give you $ n '' , even if it has the same effect . 
  i 've seen a few people mention it here as being more-politically-acceptable . 
  for example , if i lent you $ 10b in 1980 , the loan had no interest attached to it , and you just had to pay me back by 2010 , because you 'd be getting $ 10b in 2010 money back rather than $ 26.5 b in 2010 dollars , i 'd have effectively given you on the order of $ 6b in 1980 dollars . 
  a * lot * of this is just the * moscow times * 's take on the situation ; the * moscow times * is a publication critical of the kremlin . 
  it 's not clear to me : * that this event was widespread in impact in russia . 
  they had a few quotes from interviewees , and that 's it . 
  * that this particular event was a change from the norm . 
  * that the television denunciation was actually what caused the firing . 
   essentially it will be a political suicide to cut debts in greece . 
  would zero-percent loans , which nibble away via inflation ? 
  without further details , it is pretty plausible to me that the people performing the condemnation had no knowledge of what the uk 's intelligence side was doing . 
  it 's not like the whole uk is one monolithic unit , where the * times * gets issued every morning with the details of what the uk happens to be spying on each day . 
  * i assume that it is possible for any member to withdraw from the treaty . 
  nafta , for example , lets a member withdraw with six months notice . 
  if it turns out to indeed be be a horrible , awful , terrible disaster for any party , they * could * walk away from it . 
  * i assume that the negotiators on all sides are more-or-less competent . 
  i assume that there will be things that each side does n't like but which have to be swallowed to harmonize things . 
  i was just talking on here about how the us has been very unhappy at the eu wanting to establish pdo protection in the us , which appears to be part of ttip discussions ; that will cost us food producers a lot , as it will cut them out of brands that have become generic , and if it goes in , there 's going to be a lot of complaining from vendors over here . 
  * it 's a trade agreement between developed countries . 
  that , i assume , means that it has a different impact from a trade agreement between developing countries and a developed country . 
  nafta , for example , was disadvantageous to us autoworkers who were no longer competitive with mexican autoworkers ; on the other hand , it was advantageous to us auto consumers . 
  there will assuredly be impact , which will make some businesses go belly-up and others do better and open gates for some new businesses to exist , but it might tend to shift wealth * within * a society less . 
  [ mind , i 'm no / u/savannajeff : i really do n't know the expected effects within europe other than seeing a map of the expected positive net impact on various european nation gdps . ], 
  i 'm actually really surprised about the degree of concern about ttip on this forum : ttip comes up * occasionally * in the us , but the pacific rim tpp has gotten significantly more media coverage , and even that is n't typically a huge news item . 
  that 's true ... but remember that this was significant due to the timing : getting early access to opinions on the bailout before the positions became publicly-known . 
  i do n't expect a german or a frenchman to say `` oh , that spying is totally fine with me '' . 
  nobody wants to be spied on . 
  but i do think that it is at least within the realm of what one could traditionally expect nations to be spying on . 
  what would make me concerned would be if someone would turn up evidence of the us electronically stealing information about , say , bids from siemens and handing it off to us companies . 
  that would be a serious concern , and i 'd be concerned about someone else doing that to the us . 
  if china and russia are off having deep talks about something , it 's a pretty good bet that the us is really interested in what 's going on and would like to spy on that . 
  if the us is off making deals with , say , south korea and japan about moving us military over to east asia , i would n't be surprised if other nato members tried to spy on that , because they care a lot about whether the us military might wind up being tied down elsewhere : it affects their own national security ( or , for that matter , china spying on same ) . 
  or during the american civil war , i assume that the uk would have a terrific interest in spying on any negotiations between the north and the south , since the outcome of the war and the length of the blockade would have a major impact on both its own industry and even its political stability . 
  i 'm sure that if someone gets caught spying , they 'll still get in deep trouble : it 's not as if spying is now some above-board business . 
   many britons promote the collapse of the euro for nationalist reasons . 
  americans not so much , though their government seems to not be enjoying the usd losing in international value . 
  did n't you [ just post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3brnhn/economists_krugman_and_stiglitz_on_why_greeks/csou34c ) comments [ saying that the us was trying to collapse the euro ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bsywv/why_greeks_should_vote_no_the_sustainability/csp7s40 ) ? 
  look , i do n't know what the us government 's position on the euro is . 
  i can understand an argument that being the sole reserve currency gives particular value to the dollar ; that makes sense to me . 
  on the other hand , the us has also spent a lot of effort in europe to try to increase trade within it from world war ii on , and the euro certainly contributes to that . 
  obama makes vaguely-nice comments about keeping the euro healthy and according to discussion here the us has contributed to the bailout efforts ( though i do n't understand the process by which us funds make it through the imf to greece or whether any opt-in is required ) , but that could just be diplomacy . 
  probably there are people out there who have a good idea of what us interests here are , but it 's not me . 
  but i * can * say that as far as i can tell , the people from the us advocating for particular policies have more to do with their personal politics and pet economic positions than with nationality . 
  that does n't mean that those positions necessarily are right or have much to do with greece , but i think that it has very little to do with nationalism . 
   and that another one can happen at any time * but * ... that might also be used as an argument for later creating a federation , along with all that might entail , like lack of ability to leave and maybe majority instead of unanimity votes . 
  if that 's the goal of folks who want a federation , i do n't see how this would be a huge setback to it . 
  heck , even aside from that , if this winds up being really painful , it creates a reason to stay * in * the eu if at all possible . 
  i do n't understand how the `` greece did something once and it was really awful so other countries will want to do so in the future '' argument really goes . 
  also , only greece has failed , not other countries . 
  it did so after not actually meeting the initial goals for eu membership and then subsequently not making required reforms , so as long as countries are comfortable that if they 'd met those bars , they would have been acomodated ... 
   ... the country be in a similar position within two years .
