  thanks neville chamberlain . 
  welcome to europe . 
  now , get on the train you pleb . 
  and your complimentary sheep good sir . 
  agreed . 
  i hate it when they do the non perfect timing split to screw people over . 
  your choices are 10 days for 10 euro or 9,000 years for 7 billion euro . 
  choose wisely .

  everyone knows that is google 's job . 
  guaranteed that 90 % of germans on the highway are driving around with google location services enabled on their smartphone and do n't even think twice about it . 
  nope . 
  not a joke . 
  we do the same in the u.s. just not to the same extent : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_toll_roads_in_the_united_states, 
  cmon , just admit that it is only to grab money from the germans who do n't know about the old road on their way to croatia  . 
  agreed . 
  i live in rijeka and the cost to drive to zagreb an hour away is stupidly high . 
  but ... the real jerks are the slovenes with their $ 7.50 vignette to go 20km from italy to croatia . 
  it does seem better than distance based tolls . 
  stupid france , i am looking at you and your $ 2.25 every 20km . 
  lived in serbia . 
  can confirm . 
  secret double genocide probation . 
  you do not fuck with a croatian mothers perfectly white and meticulously ironed sheets .

  / r/meetaplace would be better . 
  done . 
  no problem . 
  i get the same response all the time . 
  the reasons that you mentioned are exactly why i moved here . 
  where everyone sees problems i see a wide open marketplace for building a business . 
  the smart entrepreneur goes to where everyone is not because that market is under-served . 
  and , if worst comes to worst , i can be back in the states with a giant paycheck in under a week . 
  i like living here . 
  i have a nice apartment that costs me about 1/3rd of my apartment in socal . 
  i have a great network of people who take care of me . 
  croatians have been incredibly welcoming to me and i feel like a part of their family . 
  i like to hang out with my girl ( yay , croatian women ! ), 
  and work hard . 
  i do n't go out much because the `` bars '' are a joke . 
  if i wanted to drink the same three shitty beers ( i am looking at you ozujsko , karlovacko and pan ) every night , i will do it at home . 
  if i want to party i hop on a plane to berlin or something . 
  the food is crap unless you are eating at home or at a decent konoba . 
  i just eat the food that my croatian `` mothers '' make me and what my girl makes . 
  and that shit is deeeelicous ( i am looking at you sarma , mjesano meso and brancin ) . 
  somebody needs to open a taco stand or real burger joint in rijeka . 
  it blows my mind that the only damn food you can get after 9pm is bureg or food city ( which is so bad that it makes me physically ill ) . 
  no kebab , no tacos , no real burgers and no exotic food . 
  that part does kill me a bit . 
  the nature , the people and the challenge are what keep me here . 
  next time you are here , pm me and will grab a san servelo beer , 
  yep !, 
  i 'm sold !, 
  ohh wait , i already moved here  .

  neither of those are quality beers . 
  diverse , as in many different types of races , religions and morals . 
  internet pro tip : when someone makes a broad statement like that , they do n't literally mean everyone . 
  they are talking about a trend or majority . 
  do n't get lost in fine niggling details, 
  that was terrifying !,
