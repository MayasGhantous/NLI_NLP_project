  apply yourself !, 
  1 ... 2 ... . . floor !, 
   but the government are keeping it in a separate account belonging to zus . 
  why ? 
  because fuck you . 
  that was some very good information . 
  it sounds like your taxes are fun and frequent , 
  thanks so much for the information . 
  the stuff regarding the temp workers with foreign agreements was particularly interesting . 
  it is also interesting to see how the labor law works in such a high tax , wealthy and socially progressive country . 
  also being a history nerd , i must say : . 
  ** what have you done !, 
  my afternoon is ruined !, 
  now i must read all about the history of cypriot mining  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyprus_mines_corporation http://www.peace-cyprus.org/memories/labor/ http://www.mitsero.org.cy/english/mining_quarries.shtm http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/38758/2/mpra_paper_38758.pdf, 
  well , i feel like a proper ass . 
  i got my post replies jumbled . 
  apologies to the fine people of austria . 
  thanks for the extensive information about ~ ~ poland ~ ~ austria . 
  it looks like the taxes are fairly high when combining the employee and employer wages . 
  but , the workers seem to have some strong unions and protections . 
  it 's like the independent saw the question i just posted : . 
  [ [ question/survey ] - what are the laws for temporary and part-time labor in your country ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kaama/questionsurvey_what_are_the_laws_for_temporary/ ) . 
  * scurries back to his hole after making a shameless plug for his post * . 
  edit : gon na ride the downvote train on this one for sure . 
  choooo chooooo !, 
  la voz de un espa\u00f1ol es especialamente interesante por mi . 
  yo intento  . 
  thanks for the answers . 
  it is very interesting to see how the laws work in france . 
  given your history of strong workers right , going on strike often , etc. . sant\u00e9 !, 
  it sounds like the labor laws are very flexible in your country . 
  the postman example was especially interesting . 
  it is these types of knowledge that i can only get from you awesome people  thanks for the epic response !, 
  fair enough . 
  thanks again for your answers . 
  now get back to work , 
  that is somewhat surprising to me , given the whole , you know , communism thing . 
  thanks for the awesome answer . 
  i learned a little about latvia today . 
  i hope to visit there someday . 
  [ trade union - wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trade_union ) i will update the question . 
  thanks so much for replying . 
  very interesting stuff !, 
  hopefully more people will answer  edit : lol at this part : is there a minimum income requirement ? 
  i do n't know about immigrants . 
  i knew that the camino de santiago could be dangerous , but this is ridiculous . 
  thanks !, 
  link ? 
  i have seen many a douchebag and douchette in southern france . 
  they know how to travel too . 
  actually , i was agreeing with the croat above me . 
  additionally , saying that croatian people complain a lot , when in fact i see croats often complaining in my daily life , is not insulting . 
  i have a grease stained burek wrapper which is so transparent that i use it as the window in my living room . 
  fun fact . 
  time leads to schedules . 
  schedules lead to responsibility . 
  responsibility leads to death . 
  have you heard croatian ? 
  you guys should have an angry language contest . 
  i had this exact talk with my ex-girlfriend once . 
  she 's not german . 
  burek is 93 % of croatia 's gdp . 
  fun fact . 
  bitching 6/10 style 8/10 references 9/10, 
  can confirm . 
  croats are excellent at complaining about the economy . 
  so , no roast potato ? 
  roast potato !, 
  man feels good ? 
  similar elements to california , numb nuts . 
  did i anywhere say they were the same ? 
  hell , i even gave a big old spiel above about how difficult drawing comparisons is . 
  not to each other per se . 
  they each had elements that fit with california . 
  this is kind of a loaded question because cultures can be so different . 
  even cultures that are similar usually have vast differences . 
  also , unless you are living in a foreign place for at least a year , you probably wo n't have that good of an understanding of the culture . 
  having said all that , here are some culturally similar places that i have been : * bologna , italy * toulouse , france * rijeka , croatia * copenhagen , denmark * soorts-hossegor , france * istanbul , turkey, 
  the liquor stores are definitely open in istanbul after 10pm . 
  this will make it about 5 times more expensive when i go drinking on istiklal . 
  a beer from a shop costs about 2usd and from the bar it is about 8usd . 
  cocktails are upwards of 12usd . 
  insane prices when you consider that a plate of amazing doner costs less than a single beer at the club . 
  this new law is going to absolutely suck for me as a tourist . 
  let me check that for you , bill . 
  literally not hitler . 
  still beautiful . 
  would you like slightly flavored water or flavorless water ? 
  downvote away croats . 
  pan is better . 
  this is not the awesome little subreddit you are looking for . 
  no croat is . 
  apparently you have never seen your women , because a large line of entrenched defenses could n't keep me away from them . 
  me too !, 
  what a great city !, 
  holy cow you are late to this post :-) . 
  i did go to toulouse and it was great !, 
  that made zero sense . 
  that was a vietnamese monk .
