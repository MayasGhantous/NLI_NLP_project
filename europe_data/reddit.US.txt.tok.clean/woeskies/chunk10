  there is a logic in the sense that it is anti israeli . 
  that does not make it just or right , but saying it is completely illogical is just untrue . 
  if you take today , you take mohammed and ignore all the bits between sure . 
  but that is not the reality, 
  it 's clearly anti minority , but not specifically anti semitic . 
  if you say `` i hate all non french people '' that 's makes you a massive asshole but not an anti semite, 
  what is wrong then ? 
  what . 
  saying that that is the fucking logic behind it is anti israeli ? 
  give me a break, 
   again , pay close attention to how your argument always circles around the `` muslims were treating jews badly , buuuut christians were even worse ! '', 
  and pay close attention to how you make blatently untrue statements and ignore them when asked . 
  again , where does it say in the quran that jews are dogs ? 
   stop deflecting this onto [ christian ] europe . 
  i 'm gon na repeat myself for the last time considering you are using examples from a century , and during the period of 100 years before israel the jews were well integrated into islamic society there is a problem . 
  oh totally islamic society before the 1860s hated jews , but afterwards there was a massive dip to almost nothing . 
   the notion that muslim hatred of jews is because of israel is preposterous and blatantly false . 
  im not saying all of it , but its because of israel first , historic reasons second . 
  not the other way around like you make it sound . 
   i 'm willing to accept it has amplified it , which is true - the muslims will never forgive israel for existing and for its war prowess against them . 
  or you know the whole palestine thing ? 
  way to ignore the issue , and pretend its something else . 
   jewish sentiment has roots in many other things that predate israel , most notably the religion itself and its disdain towards jews . 
  you mean the non existent part of jews ? 
   feel free to explain why a muslim country on the other side of the world , absolutely detached from israel , like malaysia or algeria , would have such huge anti-jewish sentiments . 
  becuase they are imported in part due to the palestinian struggle for independence  . 
  feel free to explain why the majority of muslims in european countries express anti-jewish sentiments . 
  because immigrants from the country of origins . 
  its not like these are converts for the most part . 
   are you seriously trying to belittle muslims to the point that you 're gon na claim the majority of them are stupid enough to confuse israelis with jews ? 
  they dont confuse them but they certainly do equate them a shit ton . 
  [ as a link you posted earlier said ... ] ( http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths3/mftreatment.html ), 
  15 % of yall think the us government did 9-11 , this shit is common . 
  people are fucking stupid . 
  you got at least 3 % in all muslim countries on the top http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/17/in-nations-with-significant-muslim-populations-much-disdain-for-isis/, 
  a lot of turks are closet atheists , a lot of that number is going to be secularists saying `` this is what the akp will lead us to '' in essence . 
  that does not change the fact that jews were treated rather well in muslim countries , especially when compared to christians in muslim countries and other minorities at that time period up until israel . 
  i find it funny that you literally said a blatantly untrue statement , but what the fuck do you expect . 
  them to be treating jews better than muslims ? 
  religious hatred is fucking common as shit among the abrahamics , you remember your sonderbund war ? 
  the muslims treated jews quite well , nothing crazy but they were well integrated . 
  they were not kicked out of many , they were kicked out of a few , and were much more commonly kicked out of [ chrisitian countries by a fucking mile ] ( http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/expelled.htm ) muslims were not always anti semites in the way we think of it , that has everything to do with israel . 
  ok , never referred to the jews as dogs . 
  that is blatantly false . 
  of course there is some bashing of jews in the quran , what the fuck do you expect when the point of the quran is that the bible and torah were corrupted . 
  same thing exists in the bible , you know personal blame on the jews , ect , and they rejected and forfeited their duty . 
  besides the fact that its from a pro jewish website on the israel palestine conflict , i literally picked out an except at random , the first anti-semitic one i laid eyes among . 
   and thou wilt find them [ the jews ] the greediest of mankind ... [ surah 11 , v. 96 ] the verse it is referring to \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u06e1 \u0627\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0633\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064f\u0648\u06e1\u0633\u0670\u0649 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0670\u064a\u0670\u062a\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0644\u06e1\u0637\u0670\u0646\u064d \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0628\u0650\u064a\u06e1\u0646\u064d\u06d9 walaqad arsalna moosa bi-ayatinawasultanin mubeen literally translated and of course sent we musa ( moses ) with insignia our and authority clear . 
  like this is not literally translated , like this is fucking made up bullshit . 
  ill edit as i find more edit 1 :  taste ye [ jews ] the punishment of burning . 
  [ surah iii , v. 18 1 ] is also not even close to the original . 
  completely unrelated . 
  edit 2 :  first one that i can at least make sense of the most vehement of mankind in hostility [ are ] the jews and the idolators . 
  [ surah v , v. 82 ] thats not what it says at all , it says that jews and polythiests will be the greatest disbelievers/opponents of `` the one true religion . '', 
  it then goes on to say that christians are relatively close . 
  next passage is about conversion so while im no quranic scholar a quick glance is that it is rhetorical and meant to show that the jews and polytheists are on an equal level in difficulty to convert . 
  i think i proved my point, 
  the examples you are bringing in are from the 1830 . 
  there was anti jewish sentiment before israel , no doubt , but it was not open conflict for like 100 years , when pogroms were taking place in russia in the 1900s , plus the whole holocaust thing . 
  violence started because of israel , it was not a continuation of earlier polices edit : also , a lot of these anti jewish attacks were part of larger anti non muslim pogroms , so it was not anti semitic in character , but rather anti non muslim . 
  even then , when religious fervor was at its highest , jews were almost always hit after christians . 
  yeah it 's pretty much demonstrably false . 
  jews were killed during the balkan wars because they were thought to be too close to the ottoman empire . 
  the muslim world was much less anti semitic than the christian world until israel, 
  including turkish territory ? 
  ( assuming democratic vote ) . 
  but i mean stuff like headscarf bans ( which were repealed ) , the turkishenss laws , reducing influence of the military ( although erodgan did do that ) , introduction of less exclusive turkish language laws ( allow laz to be tight along with kurdish and arabic ) also stuff like armenian genocide recognition ( although my view is more nuanced becuse i also consider the atrocities committed during the balkan wars to be genocide ) , opening of the borders with armenia to undermine the azeri autocracy on condition of partial withdrawal from the nkr for turkish protection . 
  the real problem comes from the 10 % threshold , because honestly thats the only thing keeping the akp in power ( well that and a pathological fear of coalitions ) . 
  that shit needs to go the fuck away , but the hdp is not going to want to do it because it will just mean that there will be islamist kurdish parties , the chp is at this point held together by chewing gum , and the akp only prevents the semi religious and more radically religious from forming their own party and going over to the saadet party respectively . 
  the only party that could reasonably support it would maybe be the mhp . 
  maybe their positions might change but lets hope to god the next election brings a result that requires a coalition that lowers the threshold . 
  because that will honestly do wonders for turkish politics . 
  i mean there are definitely a ton of policies you may disagree with me on , like me wanting to allow a vote for kurdish independence ( assuming the violence is stopped first ) , that is region based , at least kurdish autonomy , plus repeal of the ataturk laws , but i dont mention it because the circlejerk around here already thinks kurds are literally jesus . 
  the hpd is a weird fucking party . 
  its one of the most religious parties when you look at who votes for them , iirc with a higher percentage of strong believers than the akp ( although they have some atheists and non believers , and those dont exist in the akp ) . 
  a lot of kurds are essentially `` quran toting '' some are pkk supporters , but a lot focus on mainly kurdish rights . 
  the reason it is so liberal is that essentially quran toting kurds will tolerate liberalism for kurdish rights , while the leftist kurds wont support a party that is super religious . 
  the mps are fairly irreligious but there are definitely some closet pkk supporters among them . 
  the party leadership stays away from the pkk with a ten foot pole of course , condemning attacks but not condemning the pkk outright . 
  so basically the supporters are pretty religious and `` hillbilly '' the mps are pretty irreligious with closet pkk supporters among them in order to get pkk support , and the party leadership refuses to outright condemn kurdish terrorism . 
  its passive in the sense that they dont want to close down the border completely to avoid a shit ton of isis bombings in retaliation , maybe `` lethargic '' or `` cautious '' is the best way to phrase it . 
   any secular progressive kurdish movemen really any kurdish movement , at least pro independence or autonomy . 
  he banned tourist agencies from helping . 
  not that it matters too much that the rubble is down the toilet . 
  turkey , turks , jerks , jews ... holy shit illuminati . 
   according to most government provided educational material , everyone wants a piece of turkey and everyone is constantly trying to destabilise the country . 
  reminds me , what is that map where they put all the claims on turkey by other countries over turkey ? 
  study you in uni , understand the politics . 
  turkey had a whole laundry list of problems , i acknowledged that fully , but its not completely hopeless , and i usually only correct statements , rather than provide unique information , which can make me seem rabidly pro turkish . 
  according to the statistics i have , nope . 
  it 's from turkey not turkish, 
  except the people who come mean that the sex ratio in turkey is off , and there 's not a sex imbalance among the refugee population at large, 
  but if you brought over family units it would not be an issue . 
  because turkey ca n't provide them opportunities they move on . 
  also i 'm in favor of bringing more over to the use, 
  most numbers are 2.7 for german turks . 
  3.3 for latvia + estonia . 
  numbers are off, 
  this happens every refugee crisis though . 
  focus on bringing in families and the situation will calm,
