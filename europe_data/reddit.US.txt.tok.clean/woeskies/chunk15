  so how are they and others in association of taliban and al-queda ? 
  do i have to read out every group/organisation on that list and ask you now too ? 
  or are you going to tell me al-queda and isil are the same thing ... 
  anyway dude , it 's pretty clear . 
  the u.n. do not list the pkk as terrorists . 
  do they ? 
  that is the question and the answer . 
  that 's all there it is to it . 
  i 've had enough . 
  it was originally designated under the al-queda resolution in 2004 . 
  so yeah , even if they are considered separate it was added under the same method . 
   no they did not fucking do it . 
  it 's a different organisation with different choice of methods . 
  methods that they were not allowed to do within the pkk so they split off possibly , for example . . how the fuck can you then blame the pkk as if they are a country and can regulate these things . . because they use these groups do further their goals while appearing legitimate ? 
  its not really hard to see when half of the time ( granted some are independent ) they are associated with the pkk and are rarely expelled . 
  its using a different label for a different product . 
   can you point me to where it states such a thing ... first link concerned at the growing and dangerous links between terrorist groups and drug traffickers and their paramilitary gangs , which have resorted to all types of violence , ** thus endangering the constitutional order of states ** and violating basic human rights while the un has no official definition of terrorism , nobody at the un includes states in it . 
  kofi annan put it as `` it is time to set aside the debate on so-called state terrorism . 
  the use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law ''  but if you 're still not going to accept that , then i am going to leave you with this - which says that most states do not accept terrorism , and the most commonly accepted definition is non state actors . 
   go read that list again , not one single civilian targeted attack is blamed on the pkk . 
  this is not evidence , this is accusations . 
  http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4125159,00.html http://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/meb6.pdf those are all specific instances . 
  again , lack of precision statement does not mean that the pkk was not responsible . 
  the pkk was responsible for some including the resort bombings in july 2005 but they were not explicit for writing style . 
   so do it !, 
  find me links on what the turks do , ah but yet again you found two things on the pkk . . 
  the first one a bullshit link that does n't tell the full story . . 
  the pkk said it was an accident and they saw he was driving fast towards the pkk checkpoint , they fired warning shots and then they killed him thinking he was military or police ... later a lot of kurds were angry at the pkk for this , so do n't act like accidents do not happen , they did n't purposely target a civilian . 
  why should i find links if we both already agree it has happened ? 
  that seems super redundant does it not ? 
  also , blocking down a road for a shakedown ... hummm , seems like terrorism to me ...  ayg\u00fcn was freed unharmed on 14 august 2012 . 
  [ 3 ] in his first statements , he said he was in good health and that he had been treated with respect . 
  `` the young fellows who undertook this [ kidnapping ] are children of this country too , and they said they wanted to send a message of peace and a call for a cease-fire with this action . 
  '' [ 4 ] ayg\u00fcn 's statements caused controversy within his chp party . 
  while hardliner metin feyzio\u011flu criticized him for `` approaching a terror organization with sympathy , '' the party 's spokesperson haluk ko\u00e7 stressed that ayg\u00fcn had made a call for peace . 
  they still kidnapped somebody , which is terrorism . 
  i am not denying that it was a largely positive , but it was still terrorism . 
  also , wait to leave out the full story yourself `` i told them no decision can be made on this matter at the barrel of a gun '' and `` democratic autonomy were a democratic request that did not require using arms and was practiced in many european countries ''  thanks for desperately trying to paint the pkk in a bad light . 
  i am 100 % sure you are a turkish shill pretending to be american . 
  you can say that all you want , but support democratic autonomy not done with the barrel of a gun . 
   `` islamic state '' is on the list . 
  so how are they and others in association of taliban and al-queda ? 
  do i have to read out every group/organisation on that list and ask you now too ? 
  or are you going to tell me al-queda and isil are the same thing ...

   haha !, 
  what a counter argument !, 
  yes i did read my own link . 
  are you blind or something ? 
  it shows quite clearly you completely made up : `` only the taliban are and al-qaeda are on the list '' , `` basically '' . 
  why is it that everything needs to be stated twice with you . . 
  i have to literally repeat it for you to get it eventually . 
  ca n't you see quite clearly that your statement is wrong and you 've been fucking completely wrong the entire time ? 
  that there 's other organisations on that list ????? 
  hahaha . 
  groups in association with the taliban and al-queda according to the directive of unscr 1267 . 
   again - no you did not , nor did i ignore it , i responded to you . 
  i asked for what you have , but the best you could do was use wikipedia !, 
  ( by that logic i can make a page and come back here and use it as evidence ) and the citation for that states nothing other than the turkish media accusing the pkk . . 
  so let me fucking highlight it for you , let me fucking spoon feed you the information you quite clearly failed to see : yeah ... but they fucking did it . 
  its a pretty clear thing that pkk and associated groups did it . 
  and again , you ignore the second link . 
   where exactly does it state it does not include `` state actors '' , you love to make things up . 
  stop picking and choosing just to suit your needs , what a joke this is ... ... .
