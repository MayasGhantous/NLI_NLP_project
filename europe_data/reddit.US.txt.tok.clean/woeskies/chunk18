  he went in there for bs reasoning that sounded good to berlin so he could go on a strapping colonialist adventure . 
  honestly i like the hands being removed . 
  its juxtaposition shows how one can go in with the `` best of intentions '' excuse and be even more fucked up in your actions than the excuse . 
  just an fyi , it 's spelled africa because fuck you english, 
  the alternative is the exact same issue though , if not worse , for kurdistan as turkish kurdistan is like 30 % turkish ,, 
  but yeah that 's kind of my issue . 
  it 's a bit too much on the atheism imo, 
  yeah , but a conservative dress would get ignored despite that being a thing in some christian sects, 
  nobody would give a shit if a christian wore that . 
  my problem is this shit . 
  it 's just offensively bigoted honestly http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7170140, 
  however , it is a sentiment across the county to a less extreme . 
  it is state atheism , under the guise of secularism,

  uhh the highest i have seen is like 5-10 % ? 
  what ass did you pull that from ? 
  no , but france has to stop doing shit like requiring schools to serve pork . 
  france 's version of secularism goes to far . 
  secularism is good , france 's is not, 
  banning all salafis wo n't help as some are apolitical . 
  salafist jihadism can get fucked though, 
  because french 's secularism is basically anti religious ? 
  i 'm not going to say muslims can or ca n't be integrated , but france is not the best candidate, 
  yea but let 's be honest , y' all are almost an eu vassal . 
  plus with croatia , serbia is practically surrounded, 
  the 90s is my bad , on my phone and whatnot , but turkey was undergoing democratization in the invasion of cyprus , but not bulgaria . 
  and it had more to do with turkey did not even flinch when the ethnic cleansing took place , i also have another case study which talks about the realism aspect . 
  turkey intervened in cyprus , but did not intervene in bulgaria in the 90s during the revival process despite having ample justification to do so . 
  my paper explores why you get different outcomes for similar scenarios . 
  my answer came down to democratization and self ideation . 
  i 'll give you a hint , it 's an eu country that is totally in asia . 
  should not be too hard to figure out :p, 
  also thanks for being imperialized , helped make my paper easier . 
  hard to find a lot of good case studies on why counties pull a putin in ukraine with a positive and negative case, 
  yeah that whole area is a mess imo , armenians and azerbaijanis slaughtering and massacring each other . 
  actually mostly from iraqi banks ... 
  i actually just wrote a paper on that scenario actually . 
  youre probably safe because well the eu , but mainly the fact that turkey does not want to do anything more in the balkans . 
  also , many , many people consider turks to be a different race . 
  other dude here , its a possibility , but not a certainty ... and rather unlikely . 
  turkey is being passive towards isis to avoid a paris attack every week in its country , so its possible the turks ignored a threat on the rally , but other than that its pretty much had to be organized and done by an isis or isis like group . 
  [ big old list for you . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_turkey%e2%80%93pkk_conflict#early_2015 ) the events are not 500 killed because the kurds are rebels , but it is still common . 
  germany and france have allowed pkk into their country in the past . 
  while not supporting it , it is certainly comparable to turkish `` support '' for isis, 
  it 's about the same as the us in level of support too , to be fair, 
  eh not entirely . 
  because you have to have the ability and will to enforce it, 
  you can have a court ruling but unless a country is willing of submit to the court ( they do n't have to ) , nothing matters . 
  states make up shit as they go basically, 
  ehh not really . 
  anarchical system of states and whatnot, 
  which i 'm not saying is right , but you can not just extend airspace and not the sea territory . 
  ooops , my bad i meant o say `` armenian people '' i realize that the people on the ground are not responsible which is why i did not say `` armenia as a whole '' or anything like that . 
  my facts were largely impersonal for a reason . 
   also , i 'm not aware of any eu state that it 's actually having military conflicts in its own territory ( the kurds ) . 
  basque conflict ? 
  when did i ever use a term like armenian people, 
  however , idps are resettled , which makes the 600,000 questionable too . 
  also , the 150,000 refugees were including the nkr population at times which is no longer the case . 
  they were temporary refugees , not permanent . 
  so no , overall as a net the azeris were still higher . 
  you can deny it all you want , its not a numbers game , but it is important for perspective . 
  no , they displaced like half , not to say that matters , but get your fact straight . 
  also civilians not government . 
  very simple question ? 
  we 're the armenians right to ethnically cleanse 500,000 k azeris ? 
  is the inverse not true ? 
  is it physically possible both are pricks ? 
  til understanding but disagreeing with many of the policies of turks ( such as towards the armenian genocide ) , although not thinking turkey is literally hitler makes me a turk lover . 
  somewhat is a bit of an understatement when the armenian population is 150kish in the area and the azeri population is about 500k in the area in total pre war . 
  i think armenians have a right to defend themselves , but i dont think using civilian territory as hostage is ok . 
  same reason why i have problems with cyprus . 
  i think its unrealistic to expect a non negotiated settlement in both cases , but its still fucked up . 
  im excluding the azeris from armenia for the reason that i dont then have to bring in the armenians expelled from azerbaijan . 
  we have not seen the 2015 number published , but there was a marketable increase in the 2005 census . 
  its hard to say for sure , which is why i have been waiting on the 2015 census numbers . 
  in the nkr proper , not the area surrounding the nkr . 
  i support nkr independence , i dont support the ethnic cleansing of the surrounding areas . 
  the area surrounding the nkr had about 450,000 k azeris before the war according to soviet censuses . 
  so ethnic cleansing is cool then ? 
  can i get a yes or no answer . 
  if that is the case according to your logic was the greek genocide not ok ? 
  i dont think it was , but according to your logic . 
  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-russia-turkey-airspace-incursion-20151006-story.html [ but where is the proof !, 
  ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1436/20/1436207137459.png )  the other jet moved south , if you have proof that the pilots of that jet heard the warning and moved south for that particular reason , please share . 
  correlation is not causation . 
  that has to assume that 1 . 
  russia did not know the boundaries of turkish airspace to begin with 2 . 
  the russian pilot had no communication whatsoever , and he took no issue with that . 
  there is a history of russian violations over turkey during this war .
