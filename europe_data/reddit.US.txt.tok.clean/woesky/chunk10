   he main turkish guy in a community often slept with a newly married christian woman , so she gives birth to a turkish child . 
  this is also just a straight up lie . 
  a fairly tale , sure it might have happens in one village in the 1600s , but it was not an ottoman practice . 
   there was so much hate even till today , and someone is surprised about the ottomans being treated badly ? 
  you are literally justifying ethnic cleansing and genocide here , what the fuck , i 'm surprise they allow this here . 
   it is like the kurds would be blamed for a persecution after they beat isis . 
  so if they start raping arabs you are ok with that then ? 
  i just want to confirm . 
   the ottomans left divided tribes who hate each other even after such a long time . 
  no , the british and french did that , they were united under ottoman rule ... 
  lets be honest here , if you got taxed 300 euro for acknowledging the sky was blue , you would deny it in a second . 
  you know the sky is blue , realize it , and fully accept that , but you keep your mouth shut and say it is purple . 
  and either way , pretending those genocides are somehow separate from each other is rather silly . 
  it is like saying the holocaust only took place in poland . 
  it is just silly , and it really just says you admit it . 
  and either way , they could in theory still pressure for reparations via the kurdish regional or iraqi government . 
  they acknowledge it , they just pretend otherwise , not justifying it , but it is really not that hard to understand . 
  [ i mean the exact same shit happened in your country , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_from_poland_during_and_after_world_war_ii#post-communist_.281989.e2.80.93present.29 ) poland just tries to justify it rather than pretend it did not happen . 
  it would be nice , but you realize that at no point in history has it has a black sea port , or have touched the sea . 
  it has had a mediterranean port , but the best you could hope for would be a chile bolivia agreement where they get duty free port access . 
  but that is not likely anyway , there is too much money to be made . 
  the local population would not want to be part of armenia anyway, 
  but but the evil muslims oppressed the pure christians , ~ ~ and then when they gained independence they went and did the same ~ ~ totally were completely innocent and there were never any muslims there , especially not majorities in some areas . 
  [ let me show you a map ] ( http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/attachment.php?attachmentid=45393&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1206984837 ) . 
  now , admittedly , it has a turkish bias to it , but all of the items are verifiable . 
  for example , the french consoulate to bulgaria-turkey at the time stated that the edirne province was majority muslim . 
  so this map might even underestimate the amount of muslims , but regardless , it gives a good sense that there was significantly more muslims in the balkans . 
  [ here is a map of the modern balkans . ] ( http://www.balkannetworks.org/wp-content/uploads/map-of-balkans-with-religions.jpg ) . 
  it is estimated that several millions of muslims fled to anatolia , or were killed , about at a half to half ratio , more or less . 
  so to say that muslims were not relatively wiped out of the balkans is bullshit , its like saying that well , hey a couple of jews live in germany today , they were not all whiped out , or a couple of armenians still live in western turkey , whatever man . 
  and either way , many of those people were natives to the balkans , hell the vast majority were converts . 
  i mean if i am a palestinian , i decide to marry a jew and learn hebrew , and later convert to judaism all of the sudden i am an immigrant and should leave ? 
  fuck no . 
  modern turkey was definitely not always the population center for turks , the heart of turkey was once the balkans , anatolia was a backwater who gives a shit about it kind of place . 
  stop it , you are justifying genocide and ethnic cleansing . 
  that is garbage and i cant believe they allow this on / r/europe, 
  nope , it has everything to do with fucking money . 
  makes the world go round . 
  wana know why ? 
  because the [ armenian revolutionary federation . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_revolutionary_federation ) . 
  these people are so fucking crazy , they make neo-nazis and the golden dawn seem chill . 
  seriously . 
  read up on them . 
  and the thing is , they have been in and out of armenia 's ruling coalition , they are currently out and unpopular , but importantly , they are super popular among the diaspora . 
  like , the biggest ( which really means only important ) armenian lobbying groups in the west are all affiliated with these nuts . 
  if armenia said hey , we want an apology , no land , no money , recognition might happen . 
  turks would deny the sky was blue if they had to get taxed for it , anybody would . 
  even if they recognize it unilaterally , they are afraid they will be pressured into paying . 
  so it has to be bilateral . 
  another important factor is the nagorno-karabakh conflict . 
  let me start off by saying that they were right to intervene in the first place . 
  it voted for independence and was majority armenian . 
  however ... 
  when they invaded , they occupied a ton of land around the nkr as well as a buffer zone , and to protect 100k-120k people , they made 400-500k refugees . 
  currently , it is an de facto independent country , supported by armenia , and it claims the lands that were never armenian majority . 
  it is probably the biggest still active case of ethnic cleansing outside of an active warzone such as syria . 
  turks dont want to do much with armenia until they fix their shit with their biggest ally , azerbaijan , as genocide recognition is really important to them , so they use it as a sort of carrot , politically with armenia . 
  nope , turkey was attacked during the first balkan war , the first world war it was kind of forced into by germany ( it was planning on sitting it out ) , and then the war for independence was a fuck the treaty of sevres operation , which i mean technically was aggressive expansion , but there are numerous documented atrocities by the greeks and french against the local turkish populations, 
  bit of column a , bit of column b ? 
  as i understand it a fair amount are refugees from turkey . 
  but so is at least half of modern day armenia , so that really is not the biggest factor . 
  i think what it comes down to is the fact that they have no consequences for being completely crazy , while if you are in armenia , that means that the border is shut down and the economy sucks . 
  money is powerful, 
  uhhh ... there [ are no turks in armenia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_minorities_in_armenia#background ) , and well the only turkic community they had , [ kind of got deported ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_azerbaijanis_from_armenia ) ... [ yet there is still a small armenian community in turkey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenians_in_turkey ) ... 
  you do realize that the center of the desire for recognition [ is these guys right ? ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_revolutionary_federation ) . 
  the really fucking crazy ones ? 
  the ones that [ want this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_armenia ) as their stated political goal . 
  and the biggest [ armenian american lobbying group ] ( http://www.anca.org/ ) is an affiliated organization with them right ? 
  [ these dudes have been in and out of the ruling coalition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_revolutionary_federation ) . 
  they are not too popular in the moment , and are currently in opposition but as long as they continue to demand [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_armenia ) , well , not possible for the turks to realistically accept anything . 
  importantly among the diaspora they are incredibly popular , which is another big deal . 
  yeah mainly because you are using technicalities every fucking time to get out of admitting that your people did fucked up things . 
  first it was the technicality that the nkr is not part of armenia . 
  then it was the technicality that there was possibly a slightly biased source . 
  then the possibility that since it does not literally have a wikipedia page calling it a pogrom , it somehow did not happen . 
  i hope you can sleep well at night . 
  because your nationalism makes you sound like a turk denying genocide . 
  you seem to love that ticking straw man since you ca n't actually prove me wrong . 
  are you telling me that 20 people is not mass murder while 50 is ? 
  you just want to deny it because you ca n't prove me wrong . 
  you 're nationalism is disgusting . 
  what the azeris did was fucked up , but your denialism makes you know better than the turks you claim i am . 
  any update ? 
  or are you just ignoring me because i proved it ? 
  look at what the ex nkr territory proper vs what they currently control and administer . 
  i did a quick estimation but i 'm sure if you really wanted to to you could find the exact numbers . 
  i just looked at the top level , i 'm sure you could find more specific numbers . 
  please get back to me if you do estimate that is better than mine . 
  here is a armenian source . 
  they say that there were a number of azeris that died , they just disputed the number . 
  if a reductionist of the numbers verifies it , it happened http://www.sumgait.info/press/express-chronicle/express-chronicle-910416.htm, 
  here is the nkrs official census http://census.stat-nkr.am/, 
  the nkr claims it as their territory so there are likely settlers there , but sparse as there is simply not a ton of people available to settle . 
  however their census claims that there are something around 10-20k people in the disputed regions according to the nkr itself , so there is at least some settlement . 
  but either way it was ethnically cleansed which is insanely fucked up and colonialism is not acceptable under international law, 
  you 're no better than the turks when it comes to denialism . 
  it 's sad , and honestly , you really think 200k azeris left and nobody died ? 
  you 're kidding yourself and blinded by nationalism . 
  here is an american source , u.s. government . 
  specifically mentions both sides used violence to force ethnic minorities out state.gov / md27823.htm .
