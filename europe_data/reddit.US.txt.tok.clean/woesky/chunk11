  how about a new york times article ? 
  not true , un is not biased . 
  ok , un are shrills as well . 
  i 'm sure if you had a honorary degree from an armenian university though they are totally reliable, 
  can you add a blurred out cigarette as well ? 
  it 's a turkish thing . 
  i dont think the number is so much the issue , but there is certain other parts of the debate that i often here , like ataturk was a genocidal dictator that hated the armenians and he was only a continuation of the young turks ( he thought about giving you guys van , but was forced to back down by his officers ... ) , those are the bigger sticking points . 
  i think ataturk was not great towards minority , but he was not out on a plot to kill them , hell this is a literal quote from him . 
   these left-overs from the former young turk party , who should have been made to account for the millions of our christian subjects who were ruthlessly driven en masse , from their homes and massacred , have been restive under the republican rule . 
  but there is this strange instance that clearly he was the perpetrator of the genocide . 
  it is just silly . 
  it is like blaming president obama for a war crime that some soldiers committed that he later condemned . 
  as for the balkan situation , maybe `` get away with it '' was not the best choice of words , but it was more of a , it was done to us , so we can take revenge . 
  that the soviet republic of armenia and it 's successor , modern day armenia , participated in systematic explusions quote `` the armenian authorities discriminated against ethnic azeris and were unwilling to protect them against acts of violence perpetrated by the armenian population . '', 
  there is an insane amount of evidence that violence and killings were comitted against the azeri population . 
  stop denying it , you sound like a turk who nitpicks through sources saying they have a bias and are all lying . 
  also [ this ] ( http://edoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/servlets/mcrfilenodeservlet/halcore_derivate_00003079/nagorno-karabakh%20conflict.pdf ) is by a swedish professor , names a few specific instances of the burning of villages, 
  greek muslims are allowed to use sharia law . 
  [ seriously ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/apr/10/sharia-greece-human-rights-inheritance-law ), 
  til the un is a paid shrill . 
  that is very different from what i am suggesting , and while they did not deserve , there is an argument to be made that because of what happens to millions of turks in the balkans , they thought they could get away with it . 
  still insanely shitty , and not justifying , especially because armenian =\\ = greeks but it is an important motivating factor, 
  there is a massive difference between compensating survivors , and whole people 's , and you know it . 
  the armenian genocide survivors are basically all dead . 
  if they were alive that would be the difference, 
  turks should get compensation from the balkans then ... and then the balkans should get compensation from them ... and then the romans should compensate the vandals . 
  wait ... that is insane . 
  an apology is fine but reparation are fucking retarded . 
  because you are going to keep denying it no matter what i post . 
  i can literally offer demographic data , yet nope , apparently they all left by choice . 
  also , that is not a staw man . 
  i am saying either you believe that or you are fucking nuts . 
  that is not a straw man . 
   context matters the context was that they lost a war , and the bulgarians , greeks and serbs hate the turks and wanted to get rid of them . 
   intent matters . 
  the intent was genocide or mass explusion . 
  similar to the armenian genocide in where once they got to armenia they did not give a shit , but if you died along the way that was great . 
   time matters you realize the balkan wars were both the cause of the first world was and happened less than two years before the first world war and thus the armenian genocide right ? 
  by the logic in this article , every single country with more than a century of history and at least one lost war has been the target of genocide . 
  yes they have been , and it is important to acknowledged it not cherry pick genocides, 
  neither are the armenians . 
  you prepared to move back to india ? 
  so basically , since the turks are worse , the greeks can still treat them like relative shit and get away with it ? 
  they have a significantly lower reverve in universities for the minority population ( only .5 % when compared to a 1.25 % population . 
  [ this also happened ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_komotini_events ) , much later than the istanbul pogroms . 
  so both sides being shit is totally ok , and the turks have to admit it first . . for reasons then ? 
  because people think that if i acknowledged the atrocities of both sides i am devaluating christian lives , or something . 
  i 'm just breaking the anti-turkish circle jerk really . 
  they were roughly 1-1 .5 million expelled or killed in the balkans during the balkan wars . 
  a similar amount for the russo-turkish war of 1878 . 
  those were in armenian genocide sized chucks . 
  and either way the size should not even matter . 
  when they ethnically cleanse the areas surrounding the nagorno-karabakh republic which had been ethnically azeri majority for centuries ... yes . 
  it is pretty typical honestly . 
  these people are so blinded by nationalism that they can not understand that hey , they did some pretty fucked up shit too . 
  plus the common response to the armenian genocide is `` the numbers are inflated '' , and they get so mad about that justifiably , but then turn around and do it themselves .

  enough for you or is it all a ~ ~ illuminati ~ ~ turkish conspiracy ? 
  to be fair greek muslims live under sharia law whether they like it or not and that allows polygamy . 
  i know , but that is the more commonly known theory so i used it so i had less of a chance of the opposite comment . 
  [ cough ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_nagorno-karabakh ), 
  except you made an incorrect comment that the reason the turkish-armenian talks broke down was genocide related rather than nkr related , which both sides acknowledge . 
  i love how this gets downvoted . 
  the armenian nationals love brigading . 
   we get it . 
  poor colonisers got genocided . 
  what a shame . 
  literal quote from you . 
  ah that treatment of the muslims as people . 
  so hard to do . 
  also i 'm american , 0 % turkish decent , mostly orangeman but in reality all american . 
  i have never tried to argue that , i am arguing that both sides fail to acknowledged the massacres on the other sides . 
  oh wait i forget . 
   we get it . 
  poor colonisers got genocided . 
  what a shame . 
  somehow muslim lives matter less than non muslims . 
  read up on it , but just realize that while the protection of the republic was justified , the occupation of the area surrounding it is where the armenians fucked up . 
  except they do you just ignore them . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khojaly_massacre http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capture_of_garadaghly http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malibeyli_and_gushchular_massacre oh wait , no khojaly was an azeri conspiracy ?!?!??!, 
  / s you just have massive selective hearing dont you ? 
  in the context of making an incorrect comment as to why the borders are not open it is perfectly valid ... 
  around you ? 
  maybe . 
  in r/europe ? 
  another story . 
  they did not illegal invade , the only illegally occupied . 
  they had a legal right via the treaty of guarantees to invade if the government was overthrown to restore order . 
  they simply tried to use it as a tool for concessions however , leading to the clusterfuck that is today . 
  also curious , what is your opinion on the nagorno-karabakh republic and the 600k refugees armenia cause to protect a population of 150k armenians ? 
  you realize a. they had a legal right to invade if the government was overthrown via the treaty of guarantee ( it is only the continued occupation that is fucked up ) and b. there was % 20 of the population being turkish , and they had legal protections that were being ignored right ? 
  so you are justifying ethnic cleansing ... humm sounds strangely familiar . 
  were those people a threat fighting for a foreign force ? 
  also you do realize the surrounding rayons are essentially uninhabited right ? 
  the turks had roughly 30k troops in the battle of manziket , but you have to realize that there were two waves of turkic migration , the seljuk and the mongol invasion . 
  they had like 50-60k there . 
  now realize that they migrated with their entire families , so multiply 100k combined by like five or six at a minimum .
