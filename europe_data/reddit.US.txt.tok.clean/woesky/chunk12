  there you go . 
  here is a [ soviet census ] ( http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng89_reg1.php ) of 1989 , include the seven surrounding occupied rayons . 
  approximately 500k in there . 
  50k from nkr and another 150k from armenia , and bam , 700k . 
  yeah , except your denialism of the population of the area surrounding the nkr ( [ here is the fucking soviet census ] ( http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng89_reg1.php ) , approximately 500k people lived in the surrounding areas , plus 50k azeris in the nkr ) is bullshit and sounds like technical armenian genocide denialism , just towards azeris also , you would not have been able to take baku . 
  you would have been pushed back and would have stretched too thin . 
  [ you forget about these . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_nagorno-karabakh ) . 
  [ and these people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_azerbaijanis_from_armenia ) , [ plus add 50k from here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nagorno-karabakh ) , and you got yourself approximately 700k . 
  [ til these dont exist ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_nagorno-karabakh ) . 
  go look at the soviet population data , the population was approximately around 500,000 at a minimum before the ethnic cleansing . 
  add the azeris in nkr , 50k , and you got yourself around 600k by 1994, 
  except you clearly downplay and justify the muslim genocides in your comments . 
  wait so stating the actual reason stated by the turkish government is a red herring ? 
  til, 
  because they ethnically cleansed 600k azeris to protect a population of 200k . 
  granted the 600k was from the adjacent rayons , but it was not like they were universally greeted as liberators, 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian%e2%80%93tatar_massacres_of_1905%e2%80%http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian%e2%80%93tatar_massacres_of_1905%e2%80%9307 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/azerbaijanis_in_armenia, 
  guess what . 
  the un has repeatedly offered to take over control of the area surrounding the nkr , but yall keep telling them to fuck off . 
  that is my issue . 
  mutually ethnic cleansing and genocide yes . 
  however the land around the nkr is depopulated so there is no reason for the continued occupation, 
  i 've heard somewhere around 300k , but i accept whatever number the armenian government throws out as long as it is not 8 billion, 
  they should have a right to if they want . 
  now again , if it is an option that is realistic and makes sense is a totally other matter . 
  besides , you ca n't allow for ethnic cleansing like that . 
  and you wana know the reason that jackass both got power and has retained it ? 
  the nkr war . 
  you are justifying ethnic cleansing here . 
  replace a few words and it would not be that hard for you to sound like a turk about the armenian genocide, 
  idps are for al intents and purposes refugees . 
  it is a marginally different title . 
  one is international one is internal . 
  however , in this case since the nkr is not controlled by azerbaijan and the nkr is supported by armenia , it is reasonable to use the same terms, 
  yeah both sides are fucked up , your point is that you are justifying people losing their homes permanently . 
  they should have a right to return if they want . 
  it may not be part of armenia but blocking returning is fucked up . 
  it 's not black and white , but genocide is never acceptable . 
  explaining the reasoning behind the actions is ok , but you are justifying it which is beyond shitty, 
  political status nkr http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_nagorno-karabakh, 
  because you are not including the population of the area surrounding the nkr which was not part off he republic this did not vote ? 
  yeah , the areas surrounding the nkr are what are important . 
  and the ethnic cleansing begin around the 1989 census . 
  they may have marginally overestimated it , but not by much . 
  besides you around like a turk disputing the exact numbers of the armenian genocide, 
  fuck you , you are justifying ethnic cleansing . 
  strategy does not justify ethnic cleansing , nothing does, 
  yeah . 
  you can not even say you are turkish , totally protected there . 
  the turks being complete garbage towards their minority does not make the greek treatment justified . 
  shit is shit , no matter by whom, 
  http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/11/10/shocking-decision-from-greek-supreme-court/ they are not literally forced but there are a lot of hoops to use non sharia as i have been told by my greek turkish friend . 
  they also filter out the mutfis , and appoint half of them anyway . 
  im also not turkish, 
  except they can not call themselves and are being forced to use sharia law against their own will by the greek government , plus the greek government controls the muftis anyway . 
  so it is an issue, 
  because there is actually a fair amount of debate to be had on the exact numbers ? 
  it is pointlessly pedantic for the most part , and it should not be an issue , but there are some issues with the 1.5 million statistic , 1 to 1.2 is closer to what happened . 
  not saying it should be the case , but it is just reality . 
  they view the republic of bulgaria communist era policies as ethnic cleansing , but they brush over the early birth of bulgaria stuff . 
  and i guess i kind of see what you are getting at , however , you must realize that at least 6 mil muslims were forced out or killed , it could be up to 10 mil , in an extreme estimate . 
  so basically , the fact that they were kicking people out mattered far more than they were moving people in . 
  they mostly moved to attica or macedonia though , so thrace would not have been as effected . 
  nope , bosnians were , but then the austrian hungarians took over so a lot went to turkey, 
  354,000 of them were muslims during the population exchange you are talking about . 
  that is one tenth to fortieth of the total affected . 
  so yeah , your argument is bullshit . 
  it was mostly genocide , the 1923 population exchange was the tail end of it . 
  so most of it was genocide , stop kidding yourself . 
  also that was just in regards to greece , the other balkan states did no such thing . 
  this is civilians . 
  also , they were the fucking majority in a lot of those lands . 
  even in the most pro christian map i have seen of the balkans during the ottoman empire , the black sea coast of bulgaria was majority turkish . 
  also , that is civilian deaths , not military deaths . 
  also , yes , the german genocide in western poland was a thing . 
  granted , it was committed by the soviets not the poles , but it was a fucking genocide . 
  2 million german civilians died during that . 
  god fucking damn it , it is so comparable to the armenian death march it is not even funny . 
  [ look at this fucking map ] ( http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/attachment.php?attachmentid=45393&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1206984837 ) . 
  massive genocide during the balkans decolonization . 
  your denialism is disgusting , both were terrible events . 
  the german civilians were not all at fault for the military leadership . 
  except that the area surrounding the nkr was not majority armenian . 
  even the armenian government will state that . 
  while armenia had every right to defend the nkr , they did not have the right to invade the surrounding territory with the sole exception of maybe a small strip for supplies . 
  what they did do however is ethnically cleanse three times the amount of azeris from the surrounding territories than there were armenians in the nkr . 
  it is utter garbage . 
  yeah except that there were not close to three million slaughtered in decolonization in territories that were majority british . 
  they invaded the area surrounding the nkr through . 
  those were clearly azeri majority . 
  also , not only did turkey have the legal right via some treaties to invade if the country attempted to annex itself into greece , but while it may have been pan turkic , it was counter to a clear pan greek coup which was the stated goal . 
  also look at this [ map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/cyprus-distribution-1891-1931.jpg ) . 
  and this [ map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/cyprus-distribution-1946-1973.jpg/640px-cyprus-distribution-1946-1973.jpg ) . 
  it is a visual demonstration of the persecution of turkish cypriots . 
  so you acting like the greeks were loving the shit out of the turks , they were persecuting them . 
  the point is that both sides are treating each other like garbage in both conflicts . 
  so the mass ethnic cleansing of turks is ok . shit cool , elective punishment is totally ok !, 
  only certain genocides are acceptable , and those are against muslims , it makes perfect sense ... fuck off . 
  all genocides are terrible events, 
  ok , cool .
