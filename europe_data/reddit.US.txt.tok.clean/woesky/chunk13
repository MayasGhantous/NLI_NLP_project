  turks and greeks both had refugees during the cyprus war ... 
  your point ? 
  the problem is that there are still parties in the armenian parliament that are pushing for land reparations and that would only give them more strength . 
  plus it is a strong negotiation tool for turkey in regards to the nkr . 
  that is the most important reason . 
  armenians number one priority is genocide recognition and the only reason they have not annexed all of the depopulated territories around the nkr and told the 600k azeri refugees to fuck off is because of the allure of genocide recognition, 
  except they still keep 600k azeris as refugees , and being an azeri in armenia is not safe , no matter how much you pretend otherwise . 
  also greeks forced turks out of their homes during the war too and `` occupied '' them as well . 
  and you should see some of the signs along the demilitarized zone , if they had the ability to their would be some serious genocide during the reconquest of the north . 
  that what they currently say , they only downplay the number and debate the intent. ,, 
  think what would happen if you dumped a bunch of salt on young tongue and the face you would make . 
  it 's people getting pissed off essentially, 
  oh so acknowledging that both genocides were completely awful makes me a terrible person . 
  you 're right , only christian lives matter , i forgot . 
  native american arnt people either / s denying either is disgusting . 
  seriously , the salt in this thread is insane . 
  because acknowledging the armenians or greeks did fucked up shit means i hate all christians or something, 
  it 's extremely comparable to cyprus though ... 
  hey armenia did it with the nkr . 
  caused 600k refugees to protect a population of less than 200k . 
  i think both should . 
  your point ? 
  i 'm not the op . . 
  nagorno karabakh is not part of armenia . 
  even your government does not consider it so . 
  600k from the nkr and surrounding areas 250k from armenia . 
  also feel free to look at soviet population statistics , confirm that an azeri population of similar size exists . 
  you sound like a turk right now downplaying the armenian genocide numbers right now, 
  and the armenians displaced the native cultures of its area . 
  should the armenians go back to india with the rest of the indo europeans ? 
  so like the turks did with cyprus , except at least the occupied territories did not have triple the azeri population than the armenian population if you put the occupied territories plus the nkr together ... 
  unhcr report on current status http://www.unhcr.org/4bd7edbd9.html . 
  note total amount was 700k azeri refugees from armenia and surrounding territory , 600k just from the nkr area plus occupied territory edit : since people are doubting it here is the [ soviet census ] ( http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng89_reg1.php ) verify it for yourself . 
  of course , but the ottoman empire was exceptionally evil narrative is garbage . 
  there is a reason christian peasants also defected to the ottoman empire in its early days . 
  while they had a higher tax rate than muslims , their absolute tax rate was lower than it would be in the christian world . 
  they started off exceptionally good and ended up marginally worse than average in the last 50 years . 
  ethnic cleansing was unfortunately still super common in the other empires of the time . 
  not saying it was ok , nor do i fail to understand the logic behind these atrocities , but that never will justify it, 
  sorry just 600k , my mistake , still triple the armenian population of the nkr though http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_and_internally_displaced_persons_in_azerbaijan, 
  to be fair , serfdom and mandatory military service, 
  yeah , but that was called an early modern state . 
  rebellion like that happened constantly everywhere, 
  yeah it all comes down to a fear of losing what they had left . 
  you have to realize that something like a third or half of the anatolian turks at the time of the genocide were refugees from the balkans that had their families slaughtered in similar manners although at a smaller scale . 
  not to say the armenian genocide was ok , it was not and insanely fucked up , but the mediterranean coast and istanbul were in danger , and they felt that if it was done to them they could do the same to others, 
  and then as soon as they were liberated , the christians went and did the same . 
  that is not to say that what the ottoman empire did is ok , but when you have the persecution of ottoman muslims http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims , your painting of the ottoman empire as exceptional in its cruelty is garbage . 
  the ottoman empire was shit , but not an exception . 
  also related , your point ? 
  neither are ok http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims, 
  seriously , they are so god damned comparable it is not even funny . 
  a minority being oppressed and pushed into a smaller and smaller area , and then a foreign power intervenes to protect their ethnic cousins but then ethnically cleanse a huge area and overstay their welcome . 
  oh so it 's ok for the international community to punish turkey for genocide denial but turkey using leverage to stop an active case of ethnic cleansing is not ok . 
  i mean it is a purely turkish armenian thing . . 
  both are shitty situation and all methods should be used to fix them , they are both atrocious . 
  it 's a double standard and you know it, 
  fuck you . 
  any genocide is a terrible event . 
  saying one is better than the other is frankly one of the shittiest things to can say . 
  fuck off with your genocide olympics, 
  it 's not perfect of course but it gives an idea, 
  except that they caused 700,000 azeri refugees , and caused more azeri refugees that the armenian population of the area they occupied ... 
  to be fair , it is related to the greek side of things . 
  they just celebrate them ... 
  yeah , except these were large scale ethnic cleansing . 
  that does not make it ok . 
  they turned [ this . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/atlbalkrelig.jpg/300px-atlbalkrelig.jpg ) into [ this . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/atlbalkrelig.jpg/300px-atlbalkrelig.jpg ) i cant believe you are saying genocide is ok . 
  so apparently turks are time travelers now because that happened before the armenian and greek genocides . 
  you realize you are literally saying genocide is ok because it is `` the evil muslims '' implicitly right ? 
  both the armenian and turkish genocides deserved to be recognized you asshole you dont turn [ this ] ( http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/attachment.php?attachmentid=45393&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1206984837 ) into [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/atlbalkrelig.jpg/300px-atlbalkrelig.jpg ) without genocide . 
  [ hell going by 1877 statistics it is the other way around ] ( http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/attachment.php?attachmentid=45393&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1206984837 ) ... 
  i hate these arguments , so ignorant . 
  [ or muslims . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims ), 
  to be fair , the bulgarians , greeks , serbs , and most of the balkans essentially celebrate and glorify genocides or at a minimum massacures of ottoman turks . 
  [ more information here . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims ) . 
  you [ dont turn this ] ( http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/attachment.php?attachmentid=45393&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1206984837 ) into [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/atlbalkrelig.jpg/300px-atlbalkrelig.jpg ) without genocide . 
  importantly , the europeans did not give a fuck about the rights of ottoman muslims , hell they almost downright supported massacres against them . 
  seriously , there are so many better examples . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bengal_famine_of_1943 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herero_and_namaqua_genocide, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims several american genocide sized chucks in there . 
  the genocide issue is not a precondition to opening borders , it is the nagorno-karabakh conflict and allowing the 700,00 azeris to return to their homes that is the issue ... several attempts have been made specifically without making a statement on the genocide either way , they just failed because of the nkr . . 
  yeah dude , that thing is a historical black hole . 
  likewise , [ with muslim massacres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims ) ( several were arguably genocides but i wont get into that debate ) . 
  the fall of the ottoman empire was a mess full of atrocities on both sides , yet both sides deny/celebrate one while being shocked at the other . 
  to be fair , the armenians also do the literally same with with the nagonro-karabakh republic . . 
  i think honesty immersion schools for elementary are the best policy . 
  i do n't have a lot of opportunities to practice spanish , but i retain fluency and i 'm in university at the moment, 
  and istanbul is important to the greeks , but it is a fools errand considering that it has a larger population than greece . 
  you could also make the same argument for azerbaijan and the nkr . 
  your arguments are kind of silly . 
  if they want independence they should get it . 
  cubans do n't though , and they are not the majority anyway, 
  i say go for it . 
  istanbul has a larger population than all of greece anyway . 
  they could do whatever the fuck they wanted, 
  even if the turkish army did it , it was more than likely a higher up acting independently of ataturk rather than being directly responsible,
