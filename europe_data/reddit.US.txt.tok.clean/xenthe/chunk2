  there is plenty of completely legitimate wiretapping and cyber-surveillance that does need to happen via established , legal channels with proper oversight , both for national security and law enforcement reasons . 
  also , fwiw , the `` right to privacy '' is a pretty controversial issue in our bill of rights . 
  the very word `` privacy '' appears no where in the constitution . 
  the very concept , as it is understood today , did not exist in 1789 . 
  this is one reason why using the `` right to privacy '' as the basis for abortion rights - which i support , fwiw - is an awful case to make . 
  iceland ? 
  of course they do . 
  we 've had an extradition treaty with them for over a century . 
  very long story that 's probably too complicated to go into here . 
  but for our purposes here , it 's not anything like the nhs . 
  basically the gov ' t heavily subsidizes a lot of new private insurance options on a progressive scale and sets minimum coverage standards for all plans . 
  the recent spate of public shootings is far from `` normal . '', 
  i do n't have a problem with your country - why do you have such a ` tude towards mine ? 
  fair enough - not a `` machine gun , '' but rather a semiautomatic . 
  he got it because pretty much anyone can buy one , with minimal restrictions , because stupid gun laws . 
  ** united states ** * some idiot walked into la 's airport ( lax ) and started firing a semiautomatic weapon . 
  he killed a tsa agent and wounded some other people before being shot and subdued . 
  turns out he 's just some 23-year old crazy guy with a machine gun . 
  * turns out the nsa is spying on everyone . 
  reddit cares , but it 's become way less of a mainstream issue . 
  * everyone is super pissed that the healthcare.gov website was crashing and non-responsive for a lot of people when the affordable care act ( i.e. 
  obamacare , if you 're a 7-year-old ) went into effect the other week . 
  lots of grandstanding about how it should 've been better prepared , even though a few people remember how the republicans shut down the government and threw a hissy fit a few weeks ago trying to repeal it . 
  * everyone is also pissed at obama because apparently some private health plans , which everyone was told we could keep if we wanted , will no longer be available because they do n't meet the minimum requirements set by the federal government for coverage . 
  * the nyc mayor 's race is getting a lot of press , as is the election for virginia 's next governor , which is seen as a bellweather for national political trends . 
  the democrat is almost definitely going to win , while the republican is batshit insane . 
  ( disclaimer : i am from virginia . ), 
  * everyone is fascinated by these two enormous ( ~ 18 feet ) oarfish that washed ashore in california . 
  ** edit ** - why am i getting downvoted ? 
  almost certainly not . 
  germany has an extradition treaty with the u.s. . as long as we basically promised that snowden would not face the death penalty , germany would be legally bound to hand him over ( as would almost every other european country ) . 
  i , too , do not understand what the big deal is all about . 
  but no one 's saying that any other government is required to prosecute snowden , according to u.s. law or any other ( except if required by treaty , of course ) . 
  * whatever * you may think of the nsa or the righteousness of what snowden did , the material fact is that he ** did ** commit a crime under u.s. law , and likely treason . 
  when he is caught ( and he will be , i have zero doubt ) , he will face trial here . 
  moreover , via long-standing extradition treaties , if germany ( or most other eu states ) did receive snowden , they would probably be legally obligated to hand him over to the u.s. that 's not a matter of u.s. law over any other . 
  you 're the one trolling on reddit . 
  international law \u2260 enforceable, 
  i am 100 % positive that there 's a bnd analyst sitting somewhere in bonn right now who is performing electronic surveillance that you , and the majority of german/european citizens , would be highly uncomfortable with . 
  it 's just a fact of life today . 
  the only difference between european intelligence agencies and our own is that ours have much greater funding and technical capability . 
  i think it is virtually certain that chinese intelligence seized everything snowden had upon landing in the prc ( which includes hong kong , fyi ) . 
  whether they 've been able to decrypt it or not is only a matter of time . 
  i understand well enough . 
  i wonder if you do . 
  first , you are profoundly mistaken if you think this breaks down as a traditional liberal/conservative , dem/repub issue in the u.s. 
  it is n't . 
  for example , i 'm a liberal democrat . 
  that said , i 'm not against the u.s. cyber-surveillance program . 
  in fact , i want us to have the world 's most powerful intelligence capabilities to spy on any nation or individual , anytime or any place , and i 'm glad we do . 
  like ( i think ) most americans , i just want it directed at the right targets ( i.e. 
  let 's spy on putin a little more , and on the german chancellor a little less ) , and given the proper amount of oversight . 
  second , i 'm not worried about the europeans . 
  the eu ca n't even agree which side of their bread to butter in the morning without a 2-year fact finding panel , let alone on european-wide regulation or policy responses to anything . 
  european states and the us are too intertwined economically , politically and militarily to step back from that relationship now . 
  sure , we might see some minor policy setbacks ( the trade deal , for example , or safe harbor , etc. 
  ) , and we might not be able to twist arms on diplomatic issues as effectively , but that 's about it . 
  the u.s. is too powerful and influential to not engage with deeply , and it 'll always be in the eu 's interest to do so . 
  third , i think you 're probably an angsty youth who lacks judgment or any sense of perspective if you seriously believe that there 's any parallel between a open , liberal democracy like the u.s. and china or russia . 
  i think the vast majority of europeans have a better grip on reality than that . 
  snowden collected a ton of highly sensitive , top-secret national security information and then fled to china , as a part of a long premeditated plan to compromise u.s. national security . 
  it is completely feasible ( if not likely ) that he was acting as a mole for an unfriendly government . 
  what are you , in high school ? 
  welcome to our world these days . 
  fuck you . 
  as a fellow american . 
  obviously , the difference is that the u.s. government is not subject to german law . 
  snowden is an american citizen , was working for the u.s. government on u.s. soil , so yeah - that makes him subject to u.s. jurisdiction . 
  also , fwiw , you do n't think the german intelligence service spies on other , friendly governments ? 
  give the guy a fair trial !, 
  by all means !, 
  but by snowden 's own admission so far , the facts look pretty damning . 
  he took a job with the cia and then nsa , and specifically moved into positions handling sensitive national security material , * specifically with the intent of disclosing them to the public , * contrary to the oath he took . 
  he then fled to a hostile government ( china ) with a huge amount of top secret material , which he has then released piecemeal to the press ( and very likely wholesale to chinese/russian intelligence ) . 
  so sure , let 's try him . 
  but this is all public record , of snowden 's own disclosure so far , so it 's hard to see how the story gets a lot better with a free and open trial , which is no less than what he deserves . 
  fwiw , it 's possible to not see snowden in a positive light and * not * be an unthinking `` useful idiot '' of the government . 
  i do n't like many things my government does , including much of the nsa surveillance . 
  also , views on the selectivity of what he 's released vary widely . 
  i 'm sure glenn greenwald ( who has a long history of playing fast and loose with facts and then not apologizing for them , btw ) would like everyone to think that they 're carefully vetting everything , but a lot of fair-minded people are challenging that . 
  would kim philby receive a fair trial in the uk ? 
  would any defector , of any country to an unfriendly foreign government , receive one ? 
  the question is whether you think he would be judged on the basis of evidence and reason . 
  i think he would be . 
  nor do i think any foreign body or government has the jurisdiction to try him instead . 
  i 'm baffled that europeans think snowden is some sort of saint . 
  the usg is not treating `` dissent as defection , '' or `` criminalizing political speech . '', 
  it 's prosecuting - not * persecuting , * which is similar but substantively different - a defector who committed major legal infractions against his own government . 
  snowden committed treason . 
  if he thought that what the nsa was doing violated his ethical principles , he should 've just stopped working for them . 
  but he did n't . 
  he worked for years to compile enough confidential , top-secret material to create an uproar , and then just dumped it into the public square , materially harming u.s. interests . 
  the question of what everyone thinks of us surveillance efforts is ** completely beside the point ** when it comes to considering snowden himself . 
  snowden is a traitor who disregarded his legal duty and compromised us national security , and he needs to be held to account . 
  i fully hope that if he ever steps foot outside of russia , there 's a cia black ops team waiting to bundle him away to face trial on u.s. soil . 
  ( and i bet there will be . ), 
  interesting . 
  are there any non-christian religious groups who qualify under the `` church tax ? '', 
  are there jewish temples , mosques , hindu temples , etc. 
  benefiting as well ?
