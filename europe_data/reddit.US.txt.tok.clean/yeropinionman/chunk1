the greeks work more hours per year on average than any other oecd country except mexico . 
  [ here 's the data ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) . 
  just sort it by clicking on a year . 
  republicans would love to do this in the usa . 
  i bet very few welfare benefit recipients would bother to learn basic dutch . 
  fair enough . 
  fyi , we use the term `` energy independence '' a lot here in the us . 
  ( which is silly because we get most of our dreaded `` foreign oil '' from our best friend , canada . ), 
  not sure what the rest of the english-speaking world calls it . 
  it seems like the threat from russia is n't that big . 
  to maintain their military and their client states they really need the revenue from selling oil and gas to other countries . 
  they have to sell it to you just as much as you need to buy it , right ? 
  i suppose they could build pipelines to china or something ... 
  the main things that come to my mind are efforts to * minimize * rather than eliminate the threat of russia screwing with gas supplies : * develop some storage capability so that some amount of disruption can be dealt with with reserves . 
  this would raise the cost to russia in terms of how long they would need to give up gas revenue before it really started hurting the eu countries . 
  * tax the use of natural gas . 
  raising the price will give building owners an incentive to insulate better , use alternatives like geothermal heating where feasible , and to turn down the thermostat in the winter . 
  the tax could be relaxed during periods of disruption by russia . 
  the revenue could be used to lower the vat or something else that helps regular people . 
  is n't home heating with biomass stoves popular in the nordic countries ? 
  ( forgive my ignorance if that 's not true . ), 
  i admit that this probably does n't scale well . 
  true , but the original question was about reliance on russia , not reliance on anyone at all . 
  this is a truly excellent comment . 
  what `` reforms '' would get unemployment below 10 % faster than more stimulus would do it ? 
  ca n't these `` reforms '' be undertaken at any time ? 
  why must they be done right now when there are bigger problems ( mass unemployment ) ? 
  * stalin was from there . 
  * language not slavic . 
  * first territory in `` christendom '' to fight the mongols . 
  ( got their asses kicked , like everyone else . ), 
  * one of the core territories of 13th century mongol empire , from which many invasions of middle eastern and european lands came . 
  * some kind of dictatorship . 
  * natural gas . 
  * has a [ huge burning hole in the ground ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kazakhstan+burning+hole&amp;oq=khasakstan+bur&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.6118j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=utf-8 ) . 
  oh good , i 'm glad you 've solved the neo-nazi tattoo problem . 
  * reputation for good beer * people considered unsophisticated by their czech cousins, 
  and do n't forget the local celts playing both sides . 
  fiscal policy ( government spending on useful stuff to create demand ) is n't available to greece because of their past over-spending and current economic depression . 
  they just ca n't borrow money . 
  the only way such investments are going to get made in the next few years is if the rest of europe pays for it . 
  it appears unlikely . 
  monetary policy is also not available to greece because they made the mistake of joining the euro . 
  the ecb thinks its only job is to keep euro-wide inflation under 2 % . 
  maybe to also prop up sovereign debt in a true emergency , like it did for spain last year . 
  but that 's it . 
  they look at greece and say `` it is not my job to solve this problem ; to do something about this would require euro-wide inflation above 2 % , which is unacceptable . '', 
  this is exactly why the euro currency union does n't work : because europe is not unified enough culturally to allow a transfer union or a monetary policy that works for everyone . 
  germany just wo n't sacrifice anything for greece . 
  unless there is a transfer union * or * germany accepts higher inflation for a while , greece is fucked . 
  it appears that many germans look at this situation and say `` why should we give anything up ? 
  they deserve what they 're getting ! '', 
  it 's an understandable position , but it means the euro never should have been created . 
  * `` middle class '' country in terms of gdp/person . 
  * lots of awesome mathematicians * paprika in food * amazingly able to keep separate language despite historically always being part of someone else 's empire . 
  * language not slavic nor germanic nor romance . 
  * historically plagued by very poor governance ( including by outsiders ) and institutions , making it very difficult for its people to succeed economically if they stay in their home country . 
  * reputation for having a lot of organized crime that operates throughout europe . 
  that would have the advantage of sorting out the optimum currency area situation . 
  but it would have the disadvantage of not allowing countries to use central banks to manage the economy . 
  i think the central bank is a really important technology that does a lot of good . 
   us states also suffer under this problem ? 
  i believe your states `` compete '' with each other using subsidies and tax rebates for corporations ? 
  yes , the usa is also not an [ `` optimum currency area '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) , and it does have inter-state competition on tax and regulatory policies . 
  however , we have several advantages that help us avoid the problem of `` germany is fine and spain is fucked '' ( a technical economics term ) . 
  * our federal government is [ over twice the size of our state and local governments . 
  ] ( http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jbs `` graph as percentage of potential gdp , red line is federal government '' ) . 
  furthermore , much state spending is funded by grants by the federal government . 
  some of this spending is related to economic conditions ( unemployment insurance , anti-poverty programs ) , so there 's some automatic redistribution from rich states to poor states . 
  ( ironically , the poor states tend to vote for a smaller federal government . ), 
  * language and cultural barriers are much lower , so if things get really bad people can move from one state to another . 
  ( of course , people still prefer to live near `` home . '' ), 
  * a central bank that does a better ( though not perfect ) job targeting aggregate statistics for the whole area . 
  for example , if nation-wide inflation is low , but inflation is high in california , the bank does not tighten monetary policy . 
  i think the ecb is trying to make sure that no individual country has high inflation when it seems like it should instead be targeting the whole euro zone . 
  * a central bank with a `` dual mandate '' to balance stable prices * and * full employment . 
  they have n't been perfect on this ( as the seem to care more about inflation ) , but they 're at least trying to come up with a reasonable balance . 
  as i understand it , the ecb is not officially allowed to consider whether unemployment is high or low , only targeting inflation . 
  then their monetary policy will be `` whatever policy is good for germany , fuck everyone else '' . 
  good luck . 
  some kind of voucher-based public school system with lots of choice for parents rather than centralized publicly-run schools . 
  about the same population as the us state i live in ( michigan ) . 
  very high taxes on alcohol . 
  much more aggressively egalitarian than many neighbors ( e.g. 
  germany ) on the role of women in society . 
  wisely did n't join the euro . 
  i 'm curious about viipuri/vyborg . 
  i understand that viipuri was finnland 's second largest city before the russians took it and made it part of russia , right ? 
  do many finns still live there ? 
  was there an exodus west when the soviets took it ? 
  do people still talk about it much ? 
  do n't worry guys !, 
  we would never [ invade the wrong country after being attacked !, 
  auto-correct works on your spelling but not your thoughts, 
  sorry , did n't see it . 
   mario monti ( 10 % ~ ) is the current pm ... has a bad reputation since he put a lot of taxes . 
  this is one of the major dangers of the european central bank requiring `` austerity : '' it makes the mainstream parties ( who are currently in charge ) unpopular , making it more likely that some fringe party will win . 
  when you force spain and greece and italy to immediately cut their deficits by taking actions the people do n't want ( like monti 's tax increases ) , it gives the centrist `` adults '' who implemented the policies the stench of failure , tone-deafness , and cruelty . 
  then who wins the next election ? 
  communists , fasciests , and berlusconi !,
