neoliberalism is essentially center-right . 
  so that 's not surprising . 
   because it 's not relevant to whether or not a country is occupied or independent . 
  it 100 % is relevant and that is as far as i need to go . 
  the greeks backed the 1974 coup that led to the greek military junta to try to join the greek country , which goes against the 1960 treaty of guarantee . 
   no one would say iraq was an independent state with democracy while the us still stationed 50,000 troops there and a carrier group off its shores . 
  would you say south korea is n't independent ? 
  by your standard , they are not , and [ neither is southern cyprus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenic_force_in_cyprus ) . 
   in fact , we have an international organization meant to keep peace and allow for unbiased elections called the un . 
  it 's not like turkey has no other recourse than to invade and then plant an enormous army there themselves . 
  in 1974 the un was a sham and had no ability to really monitor elections or guarantee peace . 
  in the aftermath of the cold war , it has gotten better at this , but it is still an awful arbitrator . 
  the only way this is going to end is with the recognition of northern cyprus as an independent state . 
  their elections have been legitimate , the people are deeply nationalistic and desire this independence , and there is no way that turkey is going to let ethnic turks be under the boots of the greek turks again . 
  that was an awful situation that led to civil war and ethnic clashes . 
  there is absolutely no reason as to why the island needs to be reunified . 
  none of the relevant parties can even agree to terms on how to do it . 
   nobody is fooled by turkey 's actions you are so unbelievably biased it hurts . 
  if turkey 's actions are so geopolitical in nature , what about the greek 's actions between 1955 to today ? 
  they 're the ones who backed a coup . 
  they 're the ones who backed a government that repressed the turkish cypriots . 
  they 're the ones who tried to unsuccessfully bring cyprus into its own government . 
  they also have a force in southern cyprus . 
  i 'm going to leave it with this because you seem to have a very deep misunderstanding of the history and politics of the island . 
  you 're right . 
  it is different . 
  but not because of the reason you stated . 
  originally , before the split , turkey , greece and the uk had already guaranteed the island 's independence . 
  while monaco was n't subject to a blossoming civil war , cyprus was that sprang from a greek-backed coup d'etat and greek intervention between the 50s and 60s . 
  i do n't understand why everyone loves to ignore greece 's role in this . 
  nearly half of the population of cyprus * did n't * want reunification with greece , whereas the plotters of the 1974 coup wanted it . 
  we could also talk about the forced prevention of turkish cypriot involvement in their parliament , enforced by a military junta . 
  considering the ** 1960 agreement between greece , the uk and turkey to guarantee cyprus ' independence ** the invasion in 1974 was 100 % warranted because of the greek-backed coup , a civil war and movement towards reunification with greece by the greek backed government . 
  so please , you can decry it 's independence all you want , but it all started with a move towards joining cyprus with greece . 
  this widespread assumption that northern cyprus does n't actually want independence from the south is completely backward and ignores the history of the island as a whole . 
  they 're about as independent as monaco then , insofar that they are a political entity which has another country that guarantees their independence . 
  that 's not his point . 
  he 's saying they were denied entry before cyprus was admitted to the eu and that northern cyprus is n't occupied regardless because it has its own political entity that wants independence from the south . 
  do you have any numbers to back that up ? 
  well . 
  is she a smoker ? 
  that usually does it . 
  i want numbers that prove your point . 
  not anecdotes . 
  numbers like the ones that show that melenchon voters may abstain en masse . 
  edit : did n't think so . 
  have anything to back that up besides feels ? 
  she 's only 48 ? 
  jeeze i would have guessed a hard 60 . 
  because he agrees with the other less ? 
  better to get something than to get nothing . 
  and yet , she still is behind by 26 points . 
  no it does n't . 
  brexit/trump was way closer . 
  a 26 point deficit is so far outside of the margin of error that it is incredibly unlikely that le pen will win . 
  would you rather an experienced fascist or an inexperienced one ? 
  and the establishment won the popular vote in the states . 
  the chances of her winning with a 26 point deficit is incredibly slim . 
  really . 
  there are a million variables that separate lebanon from france . 
  yeah . 
  it 's the biggest build up since the cold war because after the cold war , we had almost * nothing * in poland . 
  we sent ** one brigade ** all of ** 4000 troops ** to poland ** in response to ukraine . 
  ** then sent another to estonia . 
  this is n't even a show of force . 
  it 's a political move to make the baltics and poland feel better . 
  you need to relax . 
  yeah . 
  we have a ridiculously small force in poland and the baltics . 
   i 'm sorry , this was no orange revolution . 
  you 're referring to those the decade before . 
  yeah ... i am ... i do n't know why you 're referring to `` starting a revolution with neo nazis '' then . 
  yes because two brigades are so much to worry about . 
  and no . 
  the us had zero to do with the orange revolution . 
  we were allying with them before that even happened . 
  i understand why putin would go batshit over nato expansion , but ukraine was never going to join because germany would have vetoed it . 
  hopefully it 's the populists on the left that gain some momentum for you guys . 
  they do n't involve uprooting millions of people . 
  it 's pretty easy to give an artifact back . 
  i was talking about historical artifacts only . 
  but k. 
   it 's about understanding why you 're told to hate other countries as a way of justifying conflict . 
  it 's about improving your country 's policy , not blindly rooting for the continuation of idiotic policy . 
  sure that 's fine , but you still are whitewashing russian policy and being an apologist based on your rhetoric . 
  i more than understand the russian position , but what we have done in no way excuses their aggressive policy towards georgia and the ukraine . 
  what they do is an extension of their domestic policy . 
  the invasions have everything to do with putin trying to pump up his favorability numbers so that he can maintain his regime . 
  this is far from our fault or more of the fault with putin for building a `` dutch disease '' economy that is reliant on gas and oil , while surrounding himself with an overbloated and too powerful fsb as his source of advice . 
  he has no one around him besides his paranoid intelligence community that feeds him what he wants to hear , making him a reactionary paranoid leader . 
  yes we have our problems , but do n't try to rationalize a dictator who is n't even playing realpolitik well . 
   you do n't see , you think you see because cnn tells you so via some random observatory in coventry actually , most of my information comes from the russian analytical digest , eastern european politics , patronal politics and various books i 've read on the matter . 
  if ethnic russians in the baltics and ukraine really wanted to live in russia they had several opportunities to move there and would have . 
  in fact , most russians in both the ukraine and the baltics are more happy with their country , and see them as their home country , than they do or feel about the russian federation . 
  while it is an american project , you 'd get a veto and a seat at the table . 
  having a second great power would probably be a good way to get another strong perspective on the world . 
  i would think of it as empowerment for you guys more than anything . 
  tbh i do n't think it 'd be a waste of money one bit . 
  we suddenly would n't have nearly as many nukes pointed at each other which is a win for us . 
  i 'm sure you feel the same way .
