  they always tend to be full of luxury condos that sell for $ 1 million, 
  try not to imagine nigeria with 800 million people , then . 
  well , the free cities would be prominent roman colonies , italy would be a smoking sea . 
   he dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures ... mongols and huns , certainly , but also alans , sioux , cheyenne , and various other amerindian tribes ... seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy . 
  so any resemblance to arabs or turks is coincidental . 
  well , except to the extent that the [ historic ] turks were also originally horsemen of the steppes , not unlike the alans , huns , and the rest . '', 
  the source i linked gives you their english name . 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
   so i guess the sed - sozialistische einheits partei deutschland aka the government that ran `` socialist '' east germany wasnt far left either then . 
  it was marxist-leninist [ source ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=dikwj3psb2gc&amp;pg=pa115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) . 
  it was far-left . 
  again , what the fuck are you on about ? 
   and if hes a socialist in private that puts him far left of the political spectrum far-left is marxist-leninists , trotskyists , anarcho-communists , etc. 
  unless sanders incorporated part of the sandanista manifesto in his platform , he 's not extreme left . 
  sanders is a social democrat in public , maybe a democratic socialist privately ( considering his eugene debs documentary narration ) . 
  make sure to annex switzerland for to fix that ugly border gore if it happens . 
  i do n't think anyone on the left thought macron was a savior . 
   with those approving of his record slipping seven points , to 36 per cent . 
   those disapproving of mr macron 's record rose to 49 per cent , up seven , a net negative score of -13 points . 
  `` disapproval rating '' is not really used in english , it 's always just approval , so when it 's down it 's `` approval rating reaches new low '' , `` approval rating under 50 % '' , `` approval rating goes negative '' .

  basque is always the odd man out on language maps, 
   i 'm guessing you 're ok to be judged by your president and government . 
  yes i am , but that 's beside the point . 
   surely all people in the country are just like the government . 
  nice stretch of logic there . 
  where exactly did i state `` considering their government , which was obviously voted in en mass due to euroskepticism among the polish people '' ? 
  pretty high for poland , considering their government . 
  so do c still want to form a coalition with m after their shift ? 
  i 'm going to take a wild guess and say most of those comments are not from germans but from the likes of / pol /, 
  well , the hottest temperature record for reykjavik was set in 2008 ( 26.2 \u00b0 c ), 
  i 've been casually following swedish polling , what 's the reason behind m 's collapse and c 's rise ? 
  also i bet v and sp are internally so angry at fi , `` you 're just taking our votes and you wo n't even past 4 % ! '', 
  65 % , ca n't speak danish and know 0 of the artists . 
  france , italy , and greece all have long lifespans too tho [ in fact greece is higher than denmark , and italy is higher than norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy#list_by_the_world_health_organization_.282015.29 ) dat mediterranean diet, 
  why the massive disparity between the two ? 
  in the us , philosophy undergrad majors are among the highest scorers ( possibly the highest , ca n't recall exactly ) on the lsat for law school . 
  oh , things here are going swimmingly , tovarisch .

  bruh the article you linked is on spending habits , and even says  `` millennials , the people born roughly between 1980 and 1997 , are famously conservative spenders in part because the great recession '' i have conservative spending habits too but i 'm sure as fuck not a conservative, 
  it 's not like kadyrov is sitting there without putin 's blessing . 
  ceuta is n't muslim majority , more likely to do with muslims not being very imaginative with their names . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceuta#demographics  as of 2012 , the portion of ceuta 's population that identify as roman catholic was 68.0 % , while the portion of ceuta 's population that identify as muslim was 28.3 %, 
  well stalin re-criminalizing homosexuality certainly did n't do any wonders for lgbt rights in the su . 
   jesus pretty much abolished the old testament yeah , okay . 
  let 's see what jesus has to say about the old testament  do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets . 
  i have come not to abolish but to fulfill . 
  amen , i say to you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law , until all things have taken place . 
  ( matthew 5:17 )  `` did not moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law '' ( john7 :19 )  `` it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid . '' ( luke 16:17 ) `` abolished '' indeed . 
  not even the alt-right specifically , the ( american ) right has been using soros as a boogeyman for decades , because he funds liberal groups .

  they had a communist president relatively recently , although i do n't know how communist he actually was . 
  northern cyprus occupies the north-eastern half of the island , but is n't recognized by anyone other than turkey . 
  the capital is also split between them . 
  british military bases akrotiri and dhekelia occupy a non-insignificant amount of the island and ( i believe ) are the only british territories to use the euro . 
  just pretend it 's a weird gulf , and switzerland is one big lake . 
  the socialdemokraterna have been the largest party in parliament for the past century , and in government for most of that period . 
  casus belli : pretty borders, 
  eh , they managed to recover after 1993 . 
  democratic socialists and communists are naturally enemies . 
  like communists and anarchists , or communists and social democrats , or communists and syndicalists . 
  i would n't call renzi 's pd centre-left , seems ideologically similar to new labour or the us dems, 
  does forming a coalition with the left bloc & communists count ? 
  this subreddit does n't care about labor rights as long as you 're europhile enough . 
  it 's the most consistent country to fuck me up on sporacle geography quizzes because i can never remember how to spell it .

   when is a nondemocratic government better ? 
  establishing long-term funding plans and not getting them cancelled every time a new party comes to power . 
  like nasa 's main mission changing every 8 years .

  the socialist candidate this election ( benoit hamon ) is much closer to sanders , even saying he 's an inspiration . 
  you wo n't see macron ( if he was american ) narrating any documentaries on eugene debs, 
  not really , they 're a centrist liberal party that would have been cannibalized by en marche if they did n't join forces, 
  should be noted that the ` radical left ' party is n't really far left or anything that the deep red color would imply . 
  they 're members of s&d in the eu rather than gue-ngl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radical_party_of_the_left, 
  the lib dems have been stagnant in the polls since the election was called , they are n't likely to pick up many votes at all . 
  i hope the french left has a good candidate that 's not melenchon a decade from now , otherwise they 're fucked when he 's gone . 
  rip french left,
