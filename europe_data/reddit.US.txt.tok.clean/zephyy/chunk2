  great , so he can be an asshole in 4 different languages . 
  i agree with basically the entire ` platform ' but i think you 'd be better off practicing some entryism in your local centre-left to left wing major party . 
  i learned these country names in spanish class a few weeks ago !, 
  i was so excited knowing what they meant . 
  although polonia was obvious ... 
  reactionary thought from a guy with a hardcore biblical username , whouda thunk it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statue_of_lenin_ ( seattle ) man makes a good statue what can i say, 
  so is it really just the case that bigger = better for these ? 
  how come ? 
  maybe better asked in askscience ... 
  i remember reading some super far future sci fi stuff about a collider that spanned the orbit of saturn around the sun . 
  germany could always use a new state that is n't austria or poland . 
  people forget how far europe extends into russia . 
  whoa , good news for once ? 
  christianity will probably decline to being as irrelevant as judaism is now in 100 years , in europe . 
  however , christianity is exploding in sub-saharan africa and africa is the fastest growing continent , so expect it to remain a force for centuries to come . 
  lol at one that just says `` sweden '', 
  light pollution . 
  are they going to rename oslo to lavender town ? 
  it 's nice to fantasize , is n't it ? 
  too bad they 've got less than a year to completely shift public opinion in their favor about 15 % . 
  you probably buy sliced bread, 
  it 's much easier to radically introduce changes to the voting system when your entire countries population is the size of a big city rather than 4.5 % of the entire world ? 
  the closest is laos which is conservative right wing , but they 're going down in the opinion polls ( probably a lot of voters just switching to golden dawn or independent greeks ) so not really, 
  if you did this for ocean ancestors the entire map would be blue, 
  i take it you 're a fan of the golden dawn then , cause they 're certainly shaking up greek democracy . 
  ah , the ole grand coalition , the most boring government possible . 
  they 're tall . 
  they have a lot of muslims , at least relatively to other european countries except maybe france . 
  it 's very flat and the land is nearly all below sea level . 
  also they made a bunch of new land , which is neat . 
  first country to legalize gay marriage . 
  grey area on drugs and hookers , in amsterdam . 
  there are only two things i hate in this world : people who are intolerant of other peoples cultures , and the dutch . 
  oh , and when i was a kid the name `` the netherlands '' made me think it was some like ... fantasy esque land . 
  like i did n't even think it was a country , just some land that was like lord of the rings with vast roaming plains and mountains and stuff and i knew they had internet and technology but at the same time i just thought it was basically one big area of people larping with metal armor and swords . 
   too extravagant would you say it 's a bit ... * gaudy * ? 
  i do n't understand these nationalists who want to be part of the eu like i get , sure , maybe your country will have an ` equal voice ' in the eu as a whole compared to spain , but eventually you 'll just be submerged into the growing superstructure, 
   communistic  state think about that oxymoron . 
  why is diversity necessary ? 
  would n't a unified culture strengthen us and make us get along better ? 
  used to be nomadic until the 800ish . 
  arpad dynasty ruled it for very long time . 
  magyar is a unique language compared to its surrounding neighbor languages . 
  ( closer to finnish than any nearby slavic language ) something something austria-hungary . 
  politics are a bit shit , current ruling party do n't seem too keen on democracy or liberalism . 
  previous ruling party leader straight up admitted to lying to win the election . 
  third biggest party are literally fascists . 
  i never understood the appeal of strip clubs . 
  pay to get blue balls ? 
  well , by the time turkey would enter the eu ( if ever ) , it would be the largest in the eu . 
  germany 's population is declining and turkey 's is growing . 
  are you functionally retarded ?

  original guardian story is correct . 
  try trusting a respected newspaper and the bbc over a jewish tabloid . 
  see : former british empire minus some countries, 
  lucky old germans , could n't have happened to a nicer people . 
   a lot of people still do n't fancy these governments but at least now we know they 're backed by the majority of the voters . 
  not necessarily a good thing . 
  a lot of people do n't seem to be a fan of these governments like in portugal . 
  whatever happened to revolution ? 
  why ? 
  it 's like it 's foreign knowledge to people that the catholic church has traditionally been on the side of the poor and critical of capitalism . 
  shit , look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pope_pius_x '' i was born poor , i have lived poor , and i wish to die poor . '', 
  he 's still the same ole same ole `` gay rights are bad , contraception is bad , abortion should never be allowed '' catholic standard . 
   turkey  european east thrace has 3 % of the area of turkey and roughly 12.5 % of the population . 
  the dutch would n't have much to do . 
   syriza  far left maybe 3 years ago , but their entire left platform split the party . 
  imagine if a literal neo-nazi party got 6 % of the vote in america . 
  ah yes , which is why every time i check the bbc , npr , and al-jazeera , they 're always clamoring for seizing the means of production , worldwide socialist revolution , and destruction of the bourgeoisie . 
  if all the migrants were embracing atheism , drugs , alcohol , and sexual permissiveness , they 'd be integrating well into western society and less people would have a problem with them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_legislative_election,_september_2015#opinion_polls here you go . 
  xa is already the third largest with kke and lae ( the anticapitalist faction of syriza that split it off ) are fighting for 4th place .

  the torygraph neglected to mention it .

  great , another splintering the left into a dozen factions . 
   does n't even include russia , which is the most christian nation in europe . 
  poland . 
  italy . 
  greece . 
  romania . 
  all more christian . 
  and here 's your evidence if you 're going to downvote . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_russia russian orthodox ( 41 % ) muslim ( 6.5 % ) unaffiliated christian ( 4.1 % ) other orthodox ( 1.5 % ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_poland roman catholic ( 87.5 % ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_romania romanian orthodox ( 81.0 % ) roman catholic and romanian greek-catholic ( 7.6 % ) protestant ( reformed , pentecostal , baptist , adventist , unitarian , lutheran and other neoprotestant ) ( 6.2 % ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_italy christianity ( 83.3 % ) no religion ( 12.4 % ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_greece eastern orthodoxy ( 98 % ) other ( 2 % ), 
  sweden no ? 
  probably because germany 's muslims are turks and kurds and britain 's are pakistanis and bangladeshis . 
  just do n't tell him i said it . 
  gerry adams , leader of sinn fein in ireland . 
  also sanders will have to grow a beard to fit in . 
  they are afraid of the glorious future of the anglo comrade governments led by sanders , corbyn , adams , and mulclair in the year 2020 . 
  sounds like a good investment . 
  a century long bender for the entire country . 
  [ but why skulls ?

  yeah , it seems like if these social democratic parties took a harder line on immigration they could absolutely clean house in elections, 
  almost the same in norway i think too ? 
  progress party are hard right on economic issues and immigration , the conservatives would never put them in a coalition until the progress party got bigger than them . 
  i thought these parties mainly got supporters from the traditional social democratic parties because they appeal to the traditional working class voters that the sd parties ` abandoned ' .
