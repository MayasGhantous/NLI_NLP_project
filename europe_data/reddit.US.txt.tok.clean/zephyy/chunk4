  should be noted that sanders is polling better than paul ever did . 
  sanders is guaranteed to win a few primary states ( paul never won one ) and has already raised more money ( $ 41 mil ) than ron paul did in 2012 ( $ 40 mil ) . 
  who 's gon na oppose her ? 
  the second biggest party is her coalition partner , and they have the same policy . 
  the parties in opposition also favor her policy . 
  current government ? 
  sweden managed to get through the entire cold war without nato and russia was a much bigger threat then than now . 
  is n't kd polling under the 4 % margin to enter parliament ? 
   despite the party 's name , the psd belongs to the centre-right , to the right of the socialist party and the left of the people 's party . 
  its first political position , after its foundation as the people 's democratic party , was centre-left and social-democratic , but it moved to the right during the 1980s . 
  they should probably change their name . 
   furthermore , even tsipras ' syriza is following the same path . 
  this does n't mean they are any less socialist . 
  it literally does mean that , actually . 
   the govt is not any kind danger based on what this article says . 
  well , depends how well die grunen do . 
  the spd would gladly ditch the cdu if they and the greens were able to form a government ( or in case of miracle : they invited die linke into government ) . 
  the cdu would do the same if fdp get back into legislature . 
  finland really likes kotor, 
  it 's the bush years all over again , except with less competence, 
  his vice president also claimed cigarettes did n't cause cancer h e l p, 
  they have a a half dozen communist parties who rail against `` the system '' every day . 
  which would be 160 billion , or 10 times nasas current budget . 
  imagine nasa with a budget of 160 billion * daydreams *, 
  for comparison , [ nasas budget hit 4 % of the total us budget during the space rate ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/nasa-budget-federal.svg/900px-nasa-budget-federal.svg.png ) \\  tfw ull never live among the stars because nixon nixed plans for a moon base and a mars landing, 
  alright well color me corrected . 
  thrace is , where roughly 14 million turks live in turkey 's biggest city . 
  someone care to enlighten me how a former georgian president ( who has no ukrainian ties , as far as i know ) became a governor of a ukrainian region ? 
  tartu , talinn , and utrecht apparently i should move to the baltic, 
  who wants a tory who pretends to be red though ? 
  i hate to godwin it , but it was n't unlawful when the nazis outlawed other parties . 
  because they wrote the laws . 
  when mps are getting arrested , it 's a slippery slope . 
  north milky way treaty organization, 
  will pay someone to set up an algorithm that automatically shorts the pound when detecting `` article 50 triggered '' in multiple news articles in a few minutes, 
  party that does complete opposite of its election promises polls poorly in following election , surprise . 
  so seize the means of production then !, 
  it looks like left-green + pirates + either socialdem or bright future is enough to form a coalition , is that likely ? 
  who 's likely to be pm in that situation ? 
  so , it might just be because maybe their largest places of support have n't been counted , but the pirates seem to be under-performing badly in the live count . 
  good . 
  fuck the ` gig economy ' . 
  they 've only been in the lead for 1 of the past 4 polls , so do n't get your hopes up . 
   i still do n't understand what they did exactly to be this unpopular . 
  they did n't act like socialists , for one . 
  * stick it * as in `` fuck em '' . 
  i 'll buy 10 blu ray copies when it comes out . 
  fascists deserve no statues ? 
  if you 're going to be pedantic then roads are n't free either . 
  april 1 , 1939 worst day of my life, 
  i 'm really interested in the dutch election , from what i 've seen from the polls it 's gon na be a crazy situation . 
  pvv possibly being the largest party , labour falling behind gl and possibly sp and d66 . 
  pvvd gaining up to 6 seats which is crazy for a testimonial party , 50 + getting 7-10 seats . 
  it seems like dutch labour has collapsed and their voters are going everywhere else . 
  i 'm sure there 's a decent amount of die linke that are communists, 
  do n't see anything about immigration but you can see a bunch of their economic and social policies here http://piratar.is/stefna/stefnumal/, 
  so did detroit . 
  la , we made money off it last time . 
  who would n't be , in electing a `` radical '' left wing government that does right wing policies . 
  all these nationalist party leaders love authoritarian strongmen , surprise . 
   mental anguish is this counting major depressive disorder ? 
  cultural victory, 
  is it really a setback if they did n't have any seats in the local government before and now they do ? 
  honestly , this whole gay bishop thing just proves people really like the identity of being part of a community like a church , but ca n't agree to the basic tenets of the religion that the church is supposed to follow . 
  in 20-30 years all these `` christians '' will become those `` spiritual but not religious '' people . 
  you 're probably right about eastern europe due to the lack of muslims there , [ this is what i was basing it off ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2016/07/ga_2016.07.11_national_identity-02-00.png ), 
  largest roma / gypsy population in europe . 
  that 's what people think of when they think `` immigrants from romania '' . 
  i think in most western * european countries , romani are viewed less favorably than muslims . 
  yeah that 's not socialism , that 's social democracy . 
  socialism and capitalism do not cohabitate . 
  anyone who does n't is a savage and an idiot, 
  the real joke would be to have furry dick convention open in another tab, 
  pretty sure he thought it through just fine , he knows if he 's on the ballot , the membership will re-elect him , regardless of what blarite mps think . 
  free mercia, 
  it really ca n't go much further , germany 's unemployment rate is 4.2 % the oced defines `` full employment '' as anywhere between 4 % to 6.4 % 0 % unemployment never happens , because it means people are n't moving around in typical market conditions ( quitting jobs , seasonal jobs , etc. ), 
  some economists argue that 0 % unemployment is actually unhealthy because it would cause inflation ( `` non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment '' ) stagnating wages for the working class just for a small downtick in unemployment is n't worth it . 
  morocco recognized us before either of them though !, 
  well i do n't know about economically , but ulster nationalism is pretty niche , none of the parties in the ni assembly support it . 
  [ what i think of when i hear danish language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_iixmqsbqw ), 
  why are european pollsters so garbage, 
  the eu might be able to federalize more efficiently now that its biggest eurosceptic member has cut itself out . 
  `` i must break you . '', 
   they may want to come back in 50 years but they wont want too if the eu gets mean . 
  i do n't think that 's how this works . 
  you do n't get to jump out when the going gets rough , then jump back in when everything 's sorted . 
  lot of `` vote leave '' by the anti-eu ones , barely any `` vote remain '' by the pro-remain ones, 
  if brexit passes then soros and a thousand other traders are going to make a hefty profit shorting the fuck out of the pound, 
   anarchism do n't use the word if you do n't know what it means . 
  his facial structure and his hair texture ? 
  not to mention sweden treats rape statistics a lot more liberally than other countries which leads to higher rates . 
  not saying there is n't an integration problem , but people see what they want to see . 
  sweden no, 
   \u017dz-ni who are they likely to support ? 
  they seem like nationalist protectionists . 
   google is n't selling anything adwords is n't free . 
  i mean , they 're 5 % right now , so you 're asking for a quadrupling in 34 years . 
  greece 's situation would be different if syriza had a backbone . 
   undemocratic is the european parliament not democratic ? 
  are the heads of state sent to the european council not democratically elected ?
