  and smaller independence movements in pretty much all of their other regions . 
  sinn fein talks about reunification all the time , and wales is about as likely to leave the uk as london is to leave england . 
   they were a cabinet with a left party . 
  based on their ( pvda ) results , it seems that left party did fuck all to try and moderate the cabinet . 
  i think it would be more satisfying if there was a bit of joy from them `` merkel btfo '' followed by `` wait , they replaced her with someone more pro-immigrant ? '', 
  they stopped being social democrats . 
  greenleft did n't beat pvv ( maybe , exit polls are exit polls ) , but i guess you ca n't have everything you want . 
  first round * le pen : 26 % * macron : 25 % * fillon : 18.5 % second round * macron : 58 % * le pen : 42 %, 
  if by some days you mean right after the grab em by the pussy tape , yes . 
  make trabzon trebizond again ? 
   this obsession american democrats with the popular vote is a very dangerous one . 
  as you probably know , hrc put a lot of effort into states where she had already won in order to win the popular vote , and almost completely ignored the states which finally cost her the election as a result . 
  i 'm not trying to make a `` trump is n't legitimate because he did n't win the popular vote '' argument , i 'm just stating that national polls were n't as inaccurate as people claim . 
  regardless of whatever hrc 's strategies were , the polls generally captured that nationally . 
  national polls in the us were accurate , hillary did win popular vote by several % . 
  it 's the state polls in the midwest that fucked up . 
  how accurate was ipsos last time ? 
  also both gl and sp ahead of pvda , glad they 're getting what they deserve . 
  hopefully this will teach pvda that if their traditional voters wanted a centre-right coalition , they would n't be voting for them . 
  you have a dozen parties to choose from and you ca n't find one you like . 
  i envy you . 
  i love shit like this , i 'd love to see it at night with all the lights on . 
  screams cyberpunk . 
  i 'd rather have ` chaos ' than what we have . 
  * sniff *, 
  national polls were fairly accurate , it 's the state polls in the midwest that fucked up . 
  and in the second round he was expected to get 51-52 % both times . 
  polling firms get your shit together . 
  sorry i did n't realize you were incapable of reading anything beyond face-value . 
  the argument put across by the bt campaign meant leaving the uk meant leaving the eu with the implication of no guarantee of re-joining , would it make you feel better if i put an * next to the guaranteed part ? 
   during the referendum , the better together website said : ` scotland enjoys membership of the eu because of our membership of the uk and if we no longer are members of the uk then it follows that we are no longer are part of the eu . 
   ruth davidson said `` i think it is disingenuous of patrick [ harvie ] to say that no means out and yes means in , when actually the opposite is true , no means we stay in , we are members of the european union . '', 
  does a tweet from the official better together twitter account count ? 
  https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584  what is process for removing our eu citizenship ? 
  voting yes . 
  i think it 's semi-legality is the reason its not first , same reason for portugal . 
  once you remove the taboo , some people decide to not smoke . 
   how can she say that she as an ironclad case for a second referendum ? 
  well , considering one of the main arguments used by the `` no '' side in 2014 was that staying in the uk meant a guaranteed stay in the eu . 
  i 'm sure they 'll find a way through the cognitive dissonance . 
  i like his response to the rumors `` where would i find the time ? '', 
  dude some of us are at work , careful where you post saucy stuff like that .

  as an outside it 's pretty crazy to see pvdd doing so well . 
  like , i get why ( their policies seem to fit people who think pvda is too far right but who do n't want to go with sp ) , but having an animal rights testimonial party getting that much space in a countries parliament is super interesting . 
  i have a feeling , considering hollande 's approval , the best thing he can do to prevent a le pen presidency is to keep quiet on it . 
  cultural marxism has been a codeword used by the right-wing in general , long before the alt-right popped up . 
  funny , one of the things i constantly heard was trump was the only republican who could lose to clinton . 
   state polls were wildly off . 
  giving her +10 in wisconsin and she ended up losing it slight exaggeration , it was closer to 6.5 , http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wi/wisconsin_trump_vs_clinton-5659.html, 
  neo-liberalism does n't apply to anywhere else than the economy . 
  if hamon is hard left , what 's melenchon ? 
  super robo-trotsky ? 
  but would he be able to run as the lr nominee , considering he was n't voted in the nomination process ? 
  is it actually feasible for juppe to become the nominee with a month to go ?

  yes , the open beta gets old very quick . 
  granted , it 's still a beta but it suffers from division syndrome , where the missions start to become redundant quickly and you 're doing the same thing over and over ( infiltrate this narco compound and kill x / steal y / blow up z ) . 
  ugh the border-gore , it 's like a crusader kings map . 
  so an outsider all the information i have on 50 + is `` pensioner party '' . 
  what does that actually mean ? 
  i 've read people including them in both left and right wing government coalitions . 
  do they only care about old age pensions ? 
  do they have any set policies on anything else ? 
  it 's okay bolivia , it 's not a very good game , it gets old quick . 
  it also helps that , unlike her father , marine has n't made any openly anti-semitic comments and is n't a raging homophobe . 
  text for those behind paywall :  as the populist party for freedom ( pvv ) slides in opinion polls , possible coalition scenarios are multiplying as more seats are up for grabs . 
  the centre-right vvd , led by prime minister mark rutte , has now overtaken geert wilders ' pvv , which has been ahead in the polls since mid-november . 
   the vvd is now projected to take 23-27 seats , which will guarantee its place in a governing coalition . 
  due to the splintered nature of the race , the alliance will need at least five parties ( if we are to trust current polling ) and the vvd is present in all 11 of the possible scenarios simulated in our coalition calculator . 
   only one previous coalition has featured more than four parties . 
  in 1973 the five-party cabinet took 151 days to formalise . 
  https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3a%2f%2fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2fcc1ea642-ff76-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30?source=next&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;width=600  the calculator excludes the pvv because most of the main parties have ruled out the possibility of partnering with the anti-immigration , anti-eu party of geert wilders . 
   the dutch electoral system is an extreme version of proportional representation , in which multi-party coalitions are the order of the day . 
  any party that wins more than 0.67 per cent of the vote will get a seat in the 150-strong parliament . 
   given that there are now five parties polling at 8-12 per cent , mustering a majority coalition might need to involve even more partners . 
  https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3a%2f%2fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2fcd857da8-ff76-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30?source=next&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;width=594  to build the scenarios , we calculated every possible combination of five - and six-party coalitions , avoiding groupings that would be impossible because of parties refusing to work together , and removing any that failed to reach the required 76-seat majority . 
  we also removed parties that are polling at a level which would leave them with fewer than five seats . 
  bet on jupp\u00e9 now , the odds have never been better !, 
   lots of complaints , zero solutions .

   `` not all are scum , but there is a lot of moroccan scum in holland who makes the streets unsafe , '' mr. wilders told reporters in english at an event kicking off a parliamentary election campaign in the working-class town of spijkenisse , outside rotterdam .

  it 's not uncommon : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_families you should see the kennedys :  at least one kennedy family member held federal elective office in every year between 1947 and 2011 , and then from 2013 onwards , a span of time comprising more than a quarter of the nation 's existence . 
  yeah well as long as the csu is the sister party to the cdu , it will never be passed with the cdu in government .
