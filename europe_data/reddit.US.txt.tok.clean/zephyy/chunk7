  it 's going to be 200 million people living in a flood plain , `` climate refugees '' are going to be a serious issue . 
   not more collectivist than what we already have . 
  which , like i said , is anathema to us republicans . 
  well it 's not like hollande is exactly a socialist revolutionary , despite the sp next to his name, 
  le pen 's economic positions do not jive at all with the us republican party . 
  nationalism is a helluva drug . 
  this election is actually relatively tame compared to previous elections . 
  far left to left parties in the 2002 election ( not counting sp ) : * worker 's struggle * citizen 's movements * revolutionary communist league * french communist party * worker 's party far left to left parties in the 2007 election ( not counting sp ) : * revolutionary communist league * french communist party * the greens * worker 's struggle * independent candidate jos\u00e9 bov\u00e9 ( alter-globalization activist ) * worker 's party far left to left parties in the 2012 election ( not counting sp ) : * left front * new anticapitalist party * worker 's struggle * europe ecology - the greens far left to left parties in the 2017 election ( not counting sp ) : * unsubmissive france * new anticapitalist party * worker 's struggle hard to believe in 2002 , trotyskist parties got over 12 % of the vote and now the only leading left candidates are a democratic socialist and a democratic socialist / social democrat hybrid . 
  2 months in election season feels like a lifetime, 
  what even are m5s ' policies ?

  meh i was taught the [ eastern bloc ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/easternbloc_borderchange38-48.svg/396px-easternbloc_borderchange38-48.svg.png ) was an extension of the warsaw pact / soviet bloc , counting all communist party countries in that area of europe , albania also . 
  \\* first in the former eastern bloc ? 
  first in eastern europe ? 
  considering the gap between hamon and macron / fillon is about 4-6 % ... 
  soon sd will be at 30 % and every other party will be tripping over each other trying to form a government without them . 
  how high do they need to be before soc dems and others take the hint ? 
  does n't the v\u00e4nsterpartiet support the government ( at least in the case of a vote of confidence ) , if not joining in a coalition ? 
  `` tough on crime '' rhetoric i 'm guessing , focus on punishment instead of rehabilitation , etc. 
  what makes you say that ? 
  hamon and melenchon are candidates of the left . 
  they 're just not getting into the 2nd round . 
  curious to see how that will work , macron seems to do 1-2 % better than bayrou is n't in the race . 
  on the other hand , every time a poll has included bayrou , he himself been at 5 % ish . 
  wonder how many of his voters will take his endorsement to heart . 
  the real crime is people who put black olives on pizza . 
  you might as well spit on it . 
  that seems like short term thinking . 
  those young people wo n't be young forever . 
  [ macron accepts alliance proposed by bayrou ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2017/live/2017/02/22/en-direct-suivez-l-actualite-politique-de-la-presidentielle_5083385_4854003.html ), 
   there 's no evidence that ( especially if we focus on improving energy intensity ) not to keep going for quite a while as long as we do n't wreck our planet okay but the way our market system is set up , companies seem to have no problem wrecking the environment . 
  that seems like a fatal flaw in the system . 
   you will continue to need a free market for economic growth ; care to elaborate on how an ideology based around needing constant economic growth is sustainable on a planet with finite resources ? 
  the decline of the dark red makes me sad . 
  the massive growth of the grey makes me sadder . 
  maxed out $ 2,200 on predictit ? 
  so those rallies with people cheering around him waving eu flags do n't count as campaigning ? 
  ( not sarcasm , honest question ), 
  the thing is , le pen 's economic policy is more left-wing than right-wing . 
  nice going , macron . 
  i mean , keep in mind not everyone subscribed to iceland is from iceland . 
  a shame their parents are idiots , hopefully their kids getting measles will teach them a lesson . 
  maybe italy needs to implement siestas, 
   hamon 17 %  melenchon 13 % just kiss and make up already, 
  [ i mean , it was happening , but then jt came along ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/opinion_polling_during_the_2015_canadian_federal_election.svg/936px-opinion_polling_during_the_2015_canadian_federal_election.svg.png ) the ndp lost a very charismatic leader ( layton ) and the liberals gained a charismatic leader . 
  i mean , it was n't that boring  the liberal party 's increase of 148 seats from the previous election was the largest-ever numerical increase by a party in a canadian election . 
  prior to the campaign , the liberals had held only 36 seats -- the fewest seats ever held at dissolution by any federal party that won the following election . 
  the liberals also became the first federal party in canadian history to win a majority of seats without having been either the governing party or the official opposition in the previous parliament , and this was only the second time a party went from having the third-most number of seats to the most number of seats ( the first being in 1925 ) . 
  does n't france have relatively high voter turnout for a western country , including the youth ? 
   what are the odds of her winning the race ( sources vary , again ) against macron ? 
  pretty low ( 20 % ish margin in polls for 2nd round ) . 
  against fillon ? 
  uncomfortably close ( 10-15 % margin in polls right now ) . 
  it 's part of france . 
  there are multiple definitions of the third world . 
  that one is based on mao 's `` third worldism '' https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/first_second_third_worlds_map.svg/860px-first_second_third_worlds_map.svg.png, 
  psst belarus you want to smoke some nato ? 
  do n't fuck this up macron, 
  clearly only folded 50x over , instead of 1000x over, 
  i guess it explains why we have turkish royals as cigs, 
  geez , imagine the life expectancy of spain and greece with their med-diets if they quit smoking . 
  uhh six illinois governors have been charged with crimes during or after their governorships ; four were convicted , and of those , one ( blagojevich ) was the first to be impeached and removed from office . 
  george ryan , republican governor from 1999 to 2003 , and rod blagojevich , governor from 2003 to 2009 were both convicted and sent to prison . 
  i believe the only state to have two governors back-to-back go to prison . 
  other than that ... land of lincoln ? 
  fillon is more to the right than chirac was in 2002 , and marine is n't an open homophobic anti-semite like her father was . 
  yeah but a lot of leftists are going to feel hard pressed sucking it up to vote for fillon , the social conservative thatcherite . 
  at least macron is progressive socially , if not economically . 
  le pen consistently polls worse against macron than she does against fillon . 
  in fact against fillon it 's uncomfortably close ( less than 20 points ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017#opinion_polls_for_expected_second_round_of_voting `` blah blah 2016 polls ca n't trust em '' they still all show a consistent clear trend, 
  you do have an election in one month . 
  does that matter though ? 
  that would just guarantee macron gets into the 2nd round , and she would have to steal enough voters to close a 30 point gap in the 2nd round .

  we 're in carcosa now ... 
  jerry brown is even still governor !, 
  because most of the people who are voting le pen do n't like any of the other candidates , so they 're not voting for them in the first round . 
  you can see how this happened in the french regional elections . 
  fn scored well in the first round , but did n't move their % at all in the 2nd round : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_regional_elections,_2015, 
  marine le pen 's victory would mean a weaker eu and a weaker nato , both things in putin 's favor . 
  ca n't say i 'm heartbroken , they 're barely social democrats anymore . 
  it 's almost like they 've been hemorrhaging voters since they stopped being actual parties for labour and started supporting neoliberal market policies . 
  wilders ' party looks likely to be the largest in the tweede kamer , but polling shows its likely they will get 30ish seats out of the 150 in the dutch legislature . 
  out of roughly a dozen parties , most of which are not fans of wilders . 
  most of pvda ( labour ) seem to be going to greenleft , with d66 ( centrists liberal types ) , socialist party , party for the animals , and 50 + ( pensioner party ) getting discontented labour supporters . 
  what 's to like ? 
  melenchon does n't want an alliance with anyone from the sp . 
  i was n't trying to say life expectancy in spain was lower , there 's just a higher overall life expectancy in southern europe ( portugal , spain , italy , greece ) than in north . 
  it 's just another theme of difference . 
  people seem to be taking and the others as me saying `` hue hue look how shit southern europe is '' when really all i 'm just saying is there are stark differences in a lot of aspects . 
  romance languages vs germanic , gdp per capita , higher life expectancy due to med diet , history of catholicism vs history of protestantism , etc. 
  so when someone says `` southern europe is not a homogeneous group '' , yeah no fucking shit . 
  the north-south divide is still real because of a lot of overlapping themes . 
  well there 's definitely a north-south divide [ belief in god in europe ] ( http://www.churchpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/belief-in-god.png ) [ gdp per capita in europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qoe4mv3.png ) [ credit ratings ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ed/f7/8b/edf78b1f71abedad9bd8c8a025737404.jpg ) [ life expectancy ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-chlyma-ahve/vgyk-kvfqoi/aaaaaaaanhw/wozdsvpanc4/s1600/tumblr_ne9euetasf1sq2igro1_1280.png ), 
  quite interesting how spain bucks the trend among the southern countries . 
  berlin in east germany , bavaria in west germany .
