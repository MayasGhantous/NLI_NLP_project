   lasso , who belongs to the right-wing creo-suma alliance bleck . 
  the only election i 'm worried about is the dutch one , since wilders ' party is in the lead there . 
  however they 're about to have so many parties in their parliament that forming a government is going to be belgian-style , so meh . 
  ah , a very fran\u00e7ois hollande sp / syriza situation there it seems ? 
  her only real overlap of supporters would be with dupont-aignan and a bit of fillon ( and maybe a few disgruntled economic leftists who like her public services positions ) . 
  meanwhile , centrist support is split between big hitter macron , bayrou ( who has n't decided to run yet , but he 's included in this poll anyway ) , and a bit of hamon and maybe a bit of fillon . 
  and left support is split between big hitters hamon & melenchon . 
  jadot , arthaud , and poutou as well but they 're only 3 % of the vote combined . 
  you have to remember her father , jean-marie , got 16.8 % of the vote in the 1st round in 2002 and he was a much more upfront nationalist / xenophobe ( antisemitic statements , homophobia , etc. ) . 
  marine has tried to reshape the public image of the fn to be `` nicer '' , so it 's not unbelievable to go from 16.8 % with a straight up anti-semitic , homophobic ultranationalist , to 25 % with a ` softer ' nationalist . 
  especially since immigration is n't fn 's only policy , marine has shaped the party to have a lot of populist economic policies that may be described as left wing ( government control / intervention in health , education , transportation , banking and energy ) . 
  appeals to the old left wing types , the ones that would vote melenchon if immigration was n't such a big issue . 
  you should take a look at the 2002 elections https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2002 workers ' struggle , workers ' party , communist party , revolutionary communist league, 
  has the linke led coalition in thuringia ( i believe ? ), 
  lended them any authority on forming a national coalition ? 
  nah , that 's / r/france . 
  it 'd probably be macron . 
  pro-europeanism , but critical of the neoliberal market policies of the eu . 
  it 's pretty common among the left to be internationalists , but not want to do it in a free trade deal style way . 
  why do you dislike linke so much ? 
  policies or association with gdr ? 
  just trying to understand the phobia of a spd-grunen-linke coalition, 
  why is moravia more religious ? 
  turns out `` we elect the party , not the person '' is n't so accurate, 
  almost like reddit is n't representative of countries, 
  http://zapatopi.net/belgium/ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  you guys remember dick cheney ? 
  he 's back !, 
  in ~ ~ pog ~ ~ white supremacist form !, 
  well , i would n't count macron as left , but yes it 's good for him and hamon . 
  unless he somehow makes it into the 2nd round , because right now fillon is slowly becoming the only candidate who can lose to le pen . 
  do n't blame them . 
  hey blame whoever does that stuff for wikipedia . 
   lol no , macron is going to win . 
  damn , did n't know macron and hamon were the same person . 
  maybe not individually , but [ brandt & schmidt were back-to-back for quite some time ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/8fbeb37bbc55fed2c43080d50624914b.png ), 
  the train is now multi-track drifting . 
  damn , hamon just took like half of melenchon 's voters . 
  please please please also that would be crazy , this would be the first french presidential election that neither a lr ( or their predecessor parties ) or ps ( or their predecessor parties ) was in the runoff since 1931 . 
  hey , if he has n't had an affair then he 's already doing better than most french presidents in the marital realm . 
  he 's not le pen and he 's not fillon . 
  if hamon was in 3rd instead of macron you 'd see the same fawning . 
  not really , le pen is going to make it to the 2nd round regardless . 
  the person in 3rd place ( macron ) who is likely to leapfrog fillon if this scandal hurts him enough , actually polls better against her than fillon does . 
  granted , both poll over a 20 % lead , macron 's is just bigger . 
  would that even be possible ? 
  they 've already had their primary . 
  * crosses fingers * enough to knock him into 3rd place enough to knock him into 3rd place enough to knock him into 3rd place, 
   there will never kotor 3 . 
  new vegas 2 is happening , never say never . 
  question seems intentionally vague . 
  imagine the opinion is different if you split it between `` fight a defensive war '' and `` fight a preemptive war '', 
  that 's still fantasy land , your theory involves half of a two people 's separate bases of support shifting over to one person . 
  and she 's not even the only person they could shift their support to . 
  le pen would have to double her support for that to happen , that seems absolutely absurd . 
  is this big enough to knock enough support off for fillon so macron will be the person facing le pen ? 
  how did he become leader ? 
  ahh reagan  a few months ago i told the american people i did not trade arms for hostages . 
  my heart and my best intentions tell me that 's true , but the facts and evidence tell me it is not . 
  as an outsider , your election is gon na be fucking interesting . 
  50 + getting up to 10 seats , gl , sp , and d66 all possibly surpassing pvda , pvdd gaining up to 5 seats . 
  good luck forming a government, 
  question for any french : if fran\u00e7ois bayrou were not to run and endorsed macron , would that big enough deal to propel him to the 2nd round ? 
  he 's rich and uses that to fund liberal / progressive causes worldwide . 
  so of course the right-populists hate him . 
   on trump , `` i am fairly optimistic . 
  trump seems a moderate , the media have misrepresented his point of view . 
  yeah uhh 1000 euro bet that grillo has n't bothered to look at trump 's cabinet appointees, 
  help us , not help you by getting rid of them, 
  send help, 
  not your usual east-west divide, 
  * scooby doo gang pulling the mask off the afd logo and revealing the npd logo *, 
  does n't macron have plenty of friends in the ps ? 
   so they can feel the pain they caused , of course , we should always lower ourselves to the level of these people . 
  [ never forget the betray of the spd ] ( https://i.reddituploads.com/d8ed7ed2634546ea9ba7310fbc75712e?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=371a364ff5aa6a63cda9e8fb4503eed9 ), 
  more tories voted against the marriage ( same sex couples ) bill than for . 
  it was only because nearly all of labour voted for it that it passed . 
   they better make him part of the left or they 're not going to win an election again he will never be part of the left because he 's not a socialist , not even a social democrat . 
  full stop . 
  he can make his own centrist party if he wants , just do n't pretend it 's part of `` the left '' . 
  besides , hollande was elected on leftist promises . 
  he just did the fucking opposite of it while in office . 
   from what i 've read it sounds like the far left are angry at hollande for reneging on promises and being too centrist , while the centre are angry at him for being too far left yeah it 's almost like you should govern based on the people who elected you , instead of pandering to every side , which ends up making everyone hate you . 
  it 's not an `` ideological purity test '' , it 's basic political definitions , and the quality of bill 's presidency is irrelevant to the comparison i was making ( clinton not being left-wing ) . 
  he is not a socialist , he 's not even a social democrat . 
  he 's not left wing and it 's dumb to say `` the left is divided '' when speaking of macron because he is n't part of the left . 
  tony blair is more `` left '' than macron . 
  he 's a former investment banker who self identifies as a centrist and was at the forefront of pushing through pro-business reforms during his time as minister of the economy . 
  socialist party ends when they stop being socialists , surprise . 
  macron really is n't the `` left '' though , he 's about as left as bill clinton . 
  the year is 2142 , the balkans consists of 2000 city-states, 
   on a serious note : do you actually believe that all ideologies are represented by the french political parties / candidates of the upcoming elections ? 
  let 's see , you can pick from * worker 's struggle - far-left , trotskyist * new anticapitalist party - far-left , neo-communism * left front - left wing , democratic socialist * europe ecology - centre-left , green politics * socialist party - centre-left , social democracy * en marche - centre , centrism / third way * democratic movement - centre-right , liberalism * the republicans - centre-right to right wing , liberal conservatism * france arise - right wing , conservatives * national front - far-right , nationalism , right wing populism what ideologies are you missing out that you 're so picky ? 
   2 left ( macron & melanchon ) macron is about as left-wing as bill clinton . 
  big if true, 
  what makes the greens so unappealing to csu when they 're willing to suffer coalitions with the spd ? 
  i really hope fdp do n't get back in .

  ehh is sp really far left anymore ?
