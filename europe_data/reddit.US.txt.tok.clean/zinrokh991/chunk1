oh yes , they 've lowered it but not stopped it . 
  `` hm , 900k seems like it disrupts the population too much . 
  let 's try 800k . 
  better . 
  ok let 's try 700k . 
  ok great . 
  700k per year it is then . '', 
  how many migrants were coming in 5 years ago ? 
  will 2017 be less ? 
  probably not . 
  but hey , it looks like they lowered it . 
  lowered it enough so that it is a net increase from 5 years ago while still giving the illusion that they want to lower it . 
  political engineering at its finest . 
  i know how `` conservative '' the cdu is . 
  in the us they would not be considered conservative at all . 
  theyd be considered `` left '' , like a clinton or obama . 
  the `` left '' in germany would be like a bernie sanders . 
  afd would be like the us republicans . 
  and trump would be your adolf . 
  the current reality is very simple to see . 
  germany is taking thousands of migrants more than they were taking 5 years ago , and have only deported a small fraction of those that are n't suppose to be there . 
  but wishful thinking leads us to believe the situation will be handled . 
  fingers crossed !, 
  nobody answered the other question i had , what happens to all the children of these migrants who are n't supposed to be there ? 
  i 'd imagine that is thousands of more people to support over the course of a decade . 
  there 's nothing wrong with all this anyways . 
  by and large , as long as the native population approves of this then it 's fine . 
  just seems strange that the rest of neighboring european countries have told germany to fuck off while germany is ok with that , continuing to take more . 
  no , i do . 
  i do n't think you understand the huge inefficiency of your government that led to this problem in the first place . 
  it is a lot easier to dig yourself into a problem than dig yourself out . 
  then problem you have in germany has been going on years . 
  it has only kicked into high gear recently . 
  you have had thousands coming into germany but the government has done very little . 
  yes , but im sure it 'll happen , * eventually * . 
  i wo n't hold my breath . 
  if the us has n't done it , it sure as he 'll wo n't happen in a more left leaning country like germany . 
  germany needs to consider their way of life with an additional 1-2 million refugees/migrants . 
  deporting a thousand every year means nothing when you 're bringing in millions per year . 
  the fact that germany refuses to stop the influx of refugees and migrants should give you a very good idea about how seriously they take deportation . 
  probably not very effective either at the state level . 
  if politicians have n't handled paperless economic migrants by now , it 's safe to say that they are there to stay . 
  the real question is how to integrate these people as german citizens and functoning members of society , and how to create a transition process for future migrants . 
  i 'd imagine it 's not easy at all . 
  with the amount of migrants in germany you would need to be establishing an entire department or agency dedicated to the legal processing , transportation , and deportation of everyone . 
  ca n't just put them on bus and wish them well . 
  i 'm sure these agencies exist as they do in the us , but they are really just symbolic organizations who are legally and financially limited in what they can and can not do . 
  i presume in both the us and eu immigration is not that big of a deal for most people , and will likely calm down again after a generation . 
  if immigration was a priority concern then people like trump , le pen , and afd would have greater momentum , but they dont . 
  so it is currently a secondary concern and i imagine will simmer down after some time . 
  it 's just made headlines recently because of trump and the string of migrant attacks earlier this year . 
  but these are outlier events and just a blip in the trendline, 
  are n't the majority of people coming economic migrants ? 
  what is done with those people ? 
  i 'm legitimately curious because the us has had illegal migrants here for decades but nothing is done . 
  nothing can be done . 
  if they migrants come and have a bunch of babies on us soil , they sre us citizens . 
  is it the same in the eu ? 
  i get the impression that europeans think if they do n't get citizenship they will go away . 
  that does not stop illegal immigrants from using emergency services , educational services , and other social services . 
  here in ca we give illegal immigrants scholarships to public universities . 
  we have federal laws against it and a set plan for deportation , but none of it is ever enforced . 
  in ca there are sanctuary cities that purposely defy federal law with zero repercussion . 
  i 'd imagine something similar will happen in europe . 
  people are mad now , but in another 20 years this will be the new norm , just as it is for the us . 
  i would n't worry about . 
  you 'll get use to it , espicially when the media does n't make it a big deal anymore . 
  muslim demographic increasing by 1 % every 10 years . 
  this is not deniable . 
  exponential growth with populations . 
  2nd generation muslims are even more susceptible to being recruited . 
  just because they are born there does n't mean they assimilate . 
  the same problem is in the us . 
  you have cities in europe like molenbeek . 
  you really think these people are integrating well ? 
  http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/28-young-muslim-american-skerry  as she elaborates , `` quite a number of muslim youth in america are becoming rigidly conservative and condemnatory of their peers ( muslim and non-muslim ) , their parents , and all who are not within a narrow ideological band of what i will define as internationalist , ` identity ' islam . ''  this trend was picked up by pew pollsters who reported in 2007 that muslims older than 30 were much less likely ( 28 percent ) than those aged 18-29 ( 42 percent ) to agree that `` there is a natural conflict between being a devout muslim and living in a modern society . '' when it surveyed muslims again in 2011 , pew asked if `` there is only one true way to interpret the teachings of islam '' : 31 percent of foreign-born muslims agreed , but 46 percent of native-born muslims did . 
  also that year , pew found that 58 percent of foreign-born muslims agreed `` the american people are generally friendly toward muslim americans , '' compared with only 37 percent of their native-born offspring . 
  german birthrate 1.3 . 
  you have 2million refugees in german , plus millions more coming in the next year . 
  what is their birth rate ? 
  german birthrate `` grew unexpectedly '' last year . 
  i 'm sure these are german babies replacing the german population . 
  i 'm sure that 5 % will still be 5 % in 2050 / s http://www.dw.com/en/germany-birth-rate-rises/a-18664819, 
  wow , good luck europe . 
  what will you be saying to yourself when a german erdogan is `` democratically '' elected . 
  first it will happen in a small suburb . 
  ** shrug ** no big deal then it will happen in a larger city . 
  ** shrug ** it is only one of many then it will happen in a state . 
  ** shrug ** perhaps we shall draw open debate on the issue finally , you have a chancellor like erdogan . 
  all of this , under the auspices of freedom and democracy . 
  is it still democracy if people democratically elect totalitarianism ? 
  what about them ? 
  they were a reaction to invading forces . 
  islam invaded what is now modern day turkey with the intent to capture europe . 
  this is n't new . 
  since the sac of rome islam has been vying to conquer europe . 
  franks , germanics , vandals , nords were all fighting each other until islam showed up . 
  then they united under various empires like the holy roman empire to push islam back . 
   the sea passage is n't that far , especially not between turkey and greece . 
  most people ( about 97 percent ) survive the trip .
