or the way american settlers massacred native americans while the us government warred against them . 
  til : muslims are just like america 's hispanic population . 
  more egregious is that one is boeing and the other lockheed martin, 
  sweden has planes , and shipss ?!? 
  `` hey man , you should n't go fight in syria for the islamic state ... '' `` what a bummer '' '' ... you should do it right here , in london . 
  i know right ? 
  people usually always move for emergency vehicles . 
  even in bumper to bumper traffic , cars in a lane split in two to let the ambulance or fire truck through . 
  if you hit a paywall http://lmgtfy.com/?q=36+hours+in+copenhagen&amp;l=1, 
  ... and then there were two, 
  if your success makes it harder for others to succeed , then yes , i would understand their resentment . 
  argentina did n't default on their debt in pesos . 
  it 's the one denominated in dollars that is hurting them . 
  obviously , they ca n't print their way out of this . 
  really ? 
  the lightning adapter is perhaps the best plug made for a phone . 
  it 's reversible but the main feature is that it 's a simple piece of medal with the connectors on each side - so it wo n't break . 
  [ look at this connector mechanism ] ( http://pocketnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/azl2696.jpg ) . 
  do you see that little thin flimsy piece in the middle . 
  how durable do you think that is ? 
  it 's not . 
  i have had plenty of phones stop charging due to this one huge design flaw . 
   on the weekends shooting lead at targets and deer is a national sport . 
  you mean * hunting * ? 
  there 's a xenophobia part to it as well . 
  take saudi arabia . 
  i think their main concern is that a person of another race wo n't follow their strict interpretation of islam - not that their neighbor is white/asian/black . 
  must be nice to celebrate independence from a country that does n't exist anymore . 
   you might as well pull your cock out and start janking it , we 'll be just as uncomfortable . 
  but that 's * my * personal space . 
  mind your damn business , danes . 
  do n't worry , mads mikkelsen can star in all the danish and english movies/tv shows he desires . 
  i just ca n't get enough of that guy . 
  it 's my understanding that that rule applies to content in new posts and not the links in the comment section . 
  fixed eve though i could n't find any rules prohibiting them .

  oh look , it 's the cast of borgen in this show . 
  ha , that would never work in the states . 
  companies will start giving 200,000 loans willy nilly to anybody who has enough competence to sign a piece of paper . 
  i ca n't say i agree . 
  i know switzerland is famous for its chocolates and ski resorts , but i do n't know anything about the netherlands and belgium . 
  it 's the petroeuro and petrodollar conspiracy to rule the world / s, 
  there are multiple effects of having your currency as a reserve currency . 
  however , the usa by and large benefits greatly from this . 
  wow , that is expensive . 
  i ca n't imagine paying anything more than 10 $ for a movie . 
   with interest rate right now at 1,2 % i should move to sweden , that interest rate is unbelievably cheap for a student . 
  i had a good laugh , thanks for that graphic !, 
  yep , and who were the banker-lawyers ? 
  jews , of course . 
  shhh ... let ukraine have her moment , she needs it . 
  always one to follow his big brother . 
  the road to riches is built with legos . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  iraq is the fourth largest * exporter * in the world . 
  exporter is the key word here since they have the ability to change the world prices of oil through international trade . 
  so imagine a scenario where iraq just stops producing oil . 
  suddenly , the us will find out that the 40 % of oil that it imports will have become much more expensive since other oil countries can charge higher prices . 
  tldr ; iraqi oil does n't need to be flowing to the us for the country to benefit . 
  i was n't asking about fireworks , fuckwad . 
  if you saw the sochi opening ceremony , they had cultural icons like * war and peace * and troikas embedded in the performance . 
  not to mention , they had peter the great , red revolution and the fall of the soviet union too . 
  whole lot of them in english . 
  `` i love you '' ( i luv u ) - english :d, 
  you hit the nail on the head . 
  usa sided with pakistan * because * they were pro china . 
  nixon wanted to reapproach china after the vietnam war , but they could only do it through pakistan . 
  because `` fuck america '', 
  [ ` nuff said ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cblwmudee64 ), 
  iceland does n't have a standing army , so of course it 's a hyperbole . 
  shall we compare it to the incredibly productive and wealthy regions of chechnya and south ossetia, 
  germany is getting a little too nationalistic . 
  yes . 
  never have i seen such a weak and tepid leader in this regard . 
  or a withering economy . 
  a united germany from paris , to berlin , to warsaw and to moscow . 
  basically , norway invests all of the money it receives from oil and natural gas overseas . 
  this in turn stabilizes the norwegian krone and prevents norway 's exports from becoming less competitive . 
  first segment i watch : russian tourism to bulgaria plummeting . 
  yeah , this channel is as anti-kremlin as rt is anti-american . 
  what the fuck ? 
  how is that repayment scheme sustainable ? 
  case in point : soviet union before and after barbarossa . 
  * sigh * just because the leaders are buddies does n't mean that brazilians perceive russia and putin well, 
  so does the current location blue dot . 
  as an american , measuring disposable income in terms of electronics just sounds very foreign to me . 
   they 're upper middle class ( highschool teacher and government official , respectively ) , but not upper enough to hit the tax ceiling . 
  what happens once you hit the tax ceiling ? 
  woah , two computers and two ipads ?!? 
  settle down there , denmark . 
  you 're looking for the word `` effective '', 
  vw is not the same as gm . 
  the u.s. government can go hard on foreign car companies since the risk of it backfiring is much lower . 
  united states at that time practically had an open border policy . 
  as long as you were healthy and disease free you could enter the country . 
  irish and italians were n't the only one coming to america , but also plenty of chinese . 
  it was n't until the chinese exclusion act that the usa became picky and started only letting europeans in . 
  am i really supposed to believe that the rich countries in the world would just accept the five billion people in poverty around the globe ? 
  millions of refugees are housed by iran , jordan , turkey and lebanon . 
  so muslims are doing their fair share of accepting refugees .
