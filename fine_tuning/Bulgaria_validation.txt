  that 's weird ... in our folk tales the youngest son is the bravest and smartest , and so on ... 
  in bulgaria it 's letters showing the county of registration too ... 
  it 's sometimes useful . 
  or else ... do n't make me call the prime minister !, 
  this prime minister is the pimp . 
  also - can europe into turkey for a beautiful turkish girl ? 
  not that i want to ruin someone 's fun , but these are not the average candidates ( though the average candidates are still ... pure shit . ) . 
  these are the most fun and bizare cases ( most often from some small unknown village ) that already circulate for a while in bulgarian web . 
  and that 's basically bulgarian politics in resume . 
  congratulations and respect for the spirit , the will and the strength , that led to the revolution , hungarian brothers !, 
  basically what happened : to be honest , it 's like some kind of dark comedy . 
  there was a big group of aggressively behaving people ( btw - the investigation says videos with violence were found on this guy 's phone , it does n't yet say if they were isis propaganda videos ) , so , there was this big group . 
  there were these three guards , one of them was an ordinary police officer relocated from other part of the country , so they were 20 times fewer than the group , it was in the middle of the night ... and they were under a bridge , in the `` wilderness '' . 
  the group did n't want to collaborate ( after all they were over 50 , and the guards were three guys ) . 
  here comes the irony - so this guard wanted to make an warning shot ... he did it . . in the air ... under a bridge . 
  it ricocheted , hit this guy and he died later in the hospital . 
  btw - press conference expected in 30 minutes ... we will get to know more . 
  . . everybody is in shock in bulgaria ... that our soldiers know how to shoot a gun and to defend themselves . 
  apf , nothing personal against the russian people themselve , but about that `` best buddies '' we still ca n't get civilized enough and we 're still with all the shitty communist mentality , administration , `` connections do everything '' , stealing in every sphere and so on stuff ... and if someone from western europe ( or canada , or usa ) says they have also shitty administration - you just do n't know and have n't experienced ours ... , 
  well , poland offers two times cheaper offer , so why not  also - the money will stay in nato , so that 's kind of a bonus . 
  ah , these are probably some of the humanitarian rockets sent with all the other `` humanitarian '' stuff ... 
  this looks like a million times better than our students dormitories . 
  article ( in bulgarian ) - `` student 's life - in dirt , mold and cockroaches . '', 
  `` euro army fetishists '' * oh , yeah baby , talk to me about leopard tank and eurofighter typhoon , yeah baby , i know you like it !, 
  i urge russia to stop with the unfriendly troll propaganda in our medias . 
  please ? 
  there 's a small difference in mentality , at least from our part of europe and the usa . 
  it 's true we do n't pay that much money for university education , so we do n't get student loans , but , according to statistics , more than half of the young people live with their parents . 
  i think that 's because we do n't want to take loans . 
  for me , personally , the last thing i would do is to take a loan , if it 's about life or death situation . 
  absolutely the last thing . 
  people here prefer to live with their parents and not to take loans for buying even a cheaper house/flat . 
  ( though they are not very cheap , because , let 's say , a month net salary outside of sofia could be 300 euros net and a flat , again - outside of sofia , could be 45 000 euros . ), 
  the other thing is that we 're not so sure about our economical future - we do n't know if we will keep our job or not , so we prefer not to take any risks . 
  or we could end up with over 100 salaries in debt . 
  for example i live with my parents but we 're in a pretty big apartment - over 120 sq. 
  metres , so it 's not like it 's crowded . 
  if i want to i can always move out and rent a small place , but it would just be throwing away of money . 
  when i plan about starting a family it 's absolutely not a problem to move out . 
  about starting a family - well , it 's hard to say . 
  but on theory we prefer to do it after graduating university . 
  though i 've seen cases of pregnancies during last years of school . 
  such is life . 
  also i 've seen pretty smart , educated people with careers and shit who are over 30 and single . 
  `` fun '' fact : both of the candidates are ex-members of the bulgarian communist party . 
  my personal opinion - they both suck . 
  haaaa . 
  haaa . 
  also hugh laurie and ( the old ) top gear :d, 
  it 's a mystery for me too . 
  the politicians , the generals , and the other fckers said , they can get grippens . 
  which would be like one thousand times better . 
  the thing with the army here is , they do the offer where they can steal the most . 
  probably half of the money is for `` commissions '' . 
  i love uk for terry pratchett . 
  and rowan atkinson . 
  douglas adams . 
  george orwell . 
  economic power and nice army speak louder than just economic power . 
  what about if the army is just for defending the territories of the eu ? 
  indeed , we have nato for that , but eu army would be a bit quicker to deploy and after all - a factor that should be considered , if some country decides it can go wherever it likes . 
  whoever pays the money gets his cock sucked : /, 
  this farage guy suffers from extreme form of masochism , it seems . 
  imagine an us politician to say - `` as long as we can bring the united states down , it does n't matter how we do it . '' . 
  or russian politician - `` as long as we can bring the russian federation down ... '' ( separating the republics ) . 
  funny guy . 
  may the heroes fighting for freedom and independence be remembered forever !, 
  greetings from bulgaria !, 
  do n't know , bro . 
  but here it used to be like that during the communism . 
  portraits of our dictator everywhere , in every school , in every building , everywhere . 
  the mentality changed . 
  now if someone puts the portrait of the prime minister he 's either an idiot , or he 's the main local party member or something . 
  this cult is not normal , it 's considered ridiculous . 
  we 've been burnt by this shit . 
  i hope you 're right and there is not such a cult of personality of putin . 
  i 'm glad to hear it , if there is n't . 
  if there is , this looks more and more like stalinism . 
  first it 's portraits everywhere , second - you do n't dare to criticise any decision , because the fanatics will shut you , and finally - you ca n't criticise , because you will ... disappear . 
  naah , i do n't think it 's at the same level . 
  actually , is it proven that the so called `` right '' politicians in western europe are sponsored by russia ? 
  we have whole party sponsored by russia . 
  it 's like a pr but in a form of a party with a tiny retarded leader who shouts all the time and pretends to be a communist hitler or somethin ... also - party 's newspaper and tv station . 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  ( just kidding , just kidding ), 
  these , for example http://www.zanzu.de/de/arten-von-sex , 
  it 's funny how they 're in every colour imaginable , that 's still somewhat plausible . 
  one of the `` white '' women is pink as a lollipop . 
  it 's like a huge international orgy . 
  * drinks rakija and nods understandingly *, 
  showing off with your metaphorical navy dick in front of nato member . 
  these guys sure are brave ... 
  oh , i 've watched documentaries about it , also videos . 
  it 's so surrealistic to see tanks shelling a building in the centre of moscow ... 
  you 're right . 
  in russia they would need to find people speaking bulgarian at pretty good level , which would be expensive , while here they can rent a shady company to do this shit way cheaper . 
  http://www.vesti.bg/bulgaria/politika/internet-trolove-s-hiliadi-komentari-v-polza-na-bsp-6005169 there you go , 
  it 's really hard to say where they are geographically . 
  it 's proven before , that pro-russian political party used trolls in bulgaria , for commenting under news in the websites and creating fake profiles , but it 's hard to say if the russian propaganda machine uses troll factories in bulgaria , or trolls who are in russia . 
  the trolls on our internet use bulgarian language , though sometimes , for example on reddit - the `` bulgarian '' sounds a bit strange .

  not so much if you ' r from european countries though . 
  you might have problems `` integrating '' then i guess . 
  [ sofia is cloudy and rainy at the moment , but that makes it super cozy ] ( http://picturesbg.info/images/albums/7/12908985191.jpg ) [ this one 's from another year , but how it usually looks on the ground . 
  taken at `` borisova gradina '' park . 
  ] ( http://kova4ev2012.blog.bg/photos/142750/original/-8959.jpg ), 
  the baltics is eastern europe by any criteria - geographic , demographic , economic , geo-political ... 
  sorry , you ca n't into nordic . 
  and a `` white person '' can do that in regards to modern day racism and institutionalized discrimination of white people in many place on earth ( south african republic , zimbabwe , saudi arabia ... ) and asian person can do it in regards to discrimination in many places towards asians , a black person can do it for the same reason , a middle-eastern person , an amerindian etc. 
  you point looses complete sense - all people , of all races , have been and are discriminated in some way at some place . 
  what 's the point in saying then that her people are too ? 
  especially as a remark to a couple of guys dicussing something entirely different - the notion the turks are historicall oppressed as a country and the claim someone made they were `` muslim liberators '' . 
  it jsut feels out of place and pointless . 
  but the guy you wrote that too u/projectmayhem666 was answering the statement by another user that `` someone out there already used to call ottoman empire `` muslim liberators '' '' . 
  it was therefore a question of historical oppression , not the turkish immigrants in europe the past 50 years . 
  he asked how come turkey ( meaning the ottomans ) was oppressed as a nation , when they themselves had balkan slaves under occupation . 
  bringing the turkish immigrants to europe into the question by you is entirelly irrelevant to the poitns of these two users . 
  ah ok , lots of bulgarians put a big bg at the end so it confused me . 
  oh i did n't see the guy 's flair was voivodina , i thought eu balkan states . 
  btw , why the bg on your name , if from serbia ? 
  do n't the syrians concentrate in the east of turkey , which i was under the impression was vastly different culturally from the west , in terms of being much more like the mid-east , islamic , religious , traditional etc. 
  and many syrians on the other hand were quite educated and secular before the war . 
  so would there really be such a cultural clash in the most religious , rural part of turkey ? 
  do n't they need the same documents to go to balkan countries as they do to go to western europe ? 
  both are eu , so do n't both have the same requirements ? 
  the u.s. per capita gap is higher than all european countries , because those include the ones ruined by communism . 
  ( like mine ) why lump 500 million together and compare them with 320 million ? 
  take 320 million of europe 's richest countries and see if there 's a gap then . 
  so now the whole turkish nation is oppressed because its immigrants were at some point ? 
  are there immigrants of a any nation that have n't experienced racism at some point ? 
  you do know that anyone 's comment history remains and can be seen by everyone , right ? 
  anyone can go to my account and see not even 10 % of my comments concern russia , so why lie just to try and make a point in an argument ? 
  `` your kind '' i used referred to the radical wing of russophilic/communist bulgarians who openly wish bulgaria was occupied by the kremlin . 
  ( and celebrate every year the day it happened in 1944 ) i 'm not sure why you decided `` your kind '' is inflamatory , i did n't mean it that way back then , but right now i certainly would consider them ( since you ' v asked about them ) as the lowest of scum that lives in our country . 
  open traitors who 'd wish our 1300 year old state absorbed and who celebrate the mass murder of bulgarians by the red army in 1944 every year . 
  i doubt you 'd describe them any different if you had such a percentage of people in your country , who openly celebrated operation barbarossa every year or dreamt of russia being annexed by washington . 
  no i did n't mean that , i meant dilluted in the sense they deny what is modern day fyrom had a population 100 years ago that identified predominantly as bulgarian and spoke bulgarian , as the vast majority of ethnographers of the time show ( hence the maps ) , and so do the ottoman records . 
  bulgaria fought in the second balkan war and first world war to unify with a region that held a large chunk of the bulgarian nation , but was occupied by the serbs in 1912 , who refused a redistribution of the ottoman lands on ethnic basis . 
  no , but i am sure you 'll enlighten me . 
  roughly 1 male for 2 female . 
  why are 90 % of the comments of a bulgarian guy on reddit about russia ? 
  like , i know very well your kind are practically open national traitors and proud of how much you 'd rather you were russian and bulgaria part of russia , but i wonder how it 's rationalized in your own head . 
  horribly wrong . 
  my best teachers from youngest to oldest age were male . 
  in first grade i was 6 and will still remember till death my history teacher , who also was the principle of the school , and how he sparked the flame in me that made me study history at university and love it to this day . 
  my literature teacher from 4th grade onwards was probably the coolest guy i ' v met and a great male role model . 
  meanwhile i remember some terrible , unsuitable female teachers . 
  your conclusion is entirely baseless . 
  on average . 
  no , it 's because the us became the leader of the capitalist world , making business with the countries in it during the cold war and spreading its culture there . 
  people learned english to make business with the us , not to read dickens . 
  that 's why it was n't spread to eastern europe durign the cold war despite the relevance of english history and colonialism - they just did business with russia , and so our parents speak russian instead . 
  we learned english after 1991 because we became part of the world that was dominated economically and culturally by the us . 
  i am actually quite pleasantly surprised by this episode . 
  the issue around the balkan wars has been very much diluted here by bulgaria 's neighbours , who would refuse to admit the vast majority of the population of what is today fyrom was inhabited by bulgarians . 
  if they were to admit this it would make them thieves and not the bulgarians `` greedy for territory '' , so i do n't expect them to ever do it . 
  i wonder what did european ethnographers at the time think of macedonia 's population : [ french ] ( https://jaddeyekabir.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/balkans-ethnic_1861.jpg ) [ english ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/ernst-ravenstein-balkans-ethnic-map-1880.jpg ) [ german ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/bulgarians_in_1912.jpg ) [ austrian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/ethnic_map_of_balkans_-_german_1882.jpg ) [ russian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/ethnic_map_of_balkans_-_russian_1867.jpg ) [ german consul in adrianople , using ottoman census ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/ethnographic_map_of_european_turkey_from_1877_by_carl_sax.jpg ) [ american ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/distribution_of_races_on_the_balkans_in_1922_hammond.png ) [ german again ] ( http://kroraina.com/makedonija/karti/ethno/volkerkartevonmittel-undsudosteuropa.jpg ) [ swiss german ] ( https://www2.bc.edu/~heineman/maps/ethnic.jpg ), 
  ergo it is for men as difficult to be teachers as it is for women to be miners because their brains are different ? 
  there 's physical restrictions to being a miner . 
  there are n't any to being a teacher . 
  they ' r dead . 
  there are , indeed idiots who blame the actual refugees from syria for economic migrants , but i think they are a minority . 
  most are angry at the lumping together of actual refugees with , indeed many , purely economic migrants from out of syria . 
  people like me , who in fact want us to wellcome every single syrian refugee ( and eritrean ) into europe because they actually , genuinly need it , but get particurarly angry a whole bunch of economic migrants from nigeria or pakistan end up taking spaces for refugees and give society a reason to lump all together and be opposed to any migrants at all . 
  you 'll certainly die if you keep them . 
  your economy at least , when no investor wants to touch that toxic labour environment . 
  already there 's a proper french capital flow to much less-regulated london . 
  just watched miasto ' 44 / warsaw 44 ' movie about the warsaw uprising , so these shots almost made me tear up a bit at how the city 's risen from the ashes . 
  damn , the albanians are the only neighbour we have n't fought since medieval times it seems . 
  i 'd love for us to get ohrid and the south , skopje for you , so each gets their former medieval capital . 
  precisely due to the albanians i think it might become more important , as the country just ca n't remain the same . 
  it 's the most volatile construct on the balkans after kosovo , and most likely to fall apart . 
  the redistribution of the pieces will bring back the relevance of the question of ethnic identity . 
  and who knows , maybe for us fourth time 's the charm ? 
  i ' v actually heard the ones in the north-east are serbomans , and the one around ohrid to the west bulgarophiles . 
  surprisingly . 
  there has been a completely acceptable debate on the nature of human rights in political science for the past 200 years . 
  people like me who studied this are made to read for example jeremy bentham , who describes the notion of human rights as `` nonsense upon stilts '' , and argue the points in class . 
  a lot of both modern and past political theorists reject the notion on many different grounds , without that meaning they are radicals , nazis or people who wish others to suffer . 
  it ' a a complex political debate you have just dismissed lighthandedly because you never really thought about it as an issue with different sides to it . 
  the only reason it slowed down was because of the crackdown on corruption , making the local burreaucracy unable or affraid to embezzle as much funds as it used to . 
  bulgaria only has a higher rate because we still have n't cracked down on it so the embezzling is going full speed . 
   well that depends which yugoslavia , the later one we did n't certainly rule , the first one eh maybe considering the royal family was serbian . 
  its the second one that invented macedonians . 
  the one we did n't have a stronger influence on than others . 
  i am interrested , who did ? 
  capital was belgrade , the serbs dominated the burreaucracy and the army , whilst the croats did the economy , so who ? 
   we had control over macedonia before too , 13th century and onwards with the serbian empire whose capital was in skoplje itself , after its fall it was ruled by serbian lords . 
  by `` onwards '' you mean less than 100 years . 
  bulgarians first settled there in the 7th century , then it joined the first bulgarian empire for 400 years , then the second for another 200 , and in the 19th century it was one of the centres of bulgarian national revival . 
  a huge part of bulgaria 's revolutionary freedom fighters , artists and later statesmen came from there . 
  the referendum on church belonging in the 1860s resulted in the region voting firmly to be part of the bulgarian church . 
  western ethnography firmly puts the region as primarily inhabited by bulgarians in the time period , and ottoman census from a few years before the liberation of bulgaria put almost a quarter of the entire bulgarian nation in what is modern macedonia . 
  in 1901 there were , again according to the ottoman archives , around 4500 schools in the region , of which upwards of 4250 were bulgarian . 
  considering schools were on voluntary basis , not organized by the state but by the people of each region , it is a telling number for the people that lived there . 
  one of bulgaria 's more famous historians bozidar dimitrov loves to joke that macedonian `` historians '' dread istanbul and its archives , precisely due to the availability of ottoman records on the region and its predominantly bulgarian demographic . 
  i wrote serbs not serbia , considering the serbs first took the region in 1912 and they mainly ruled yugoslavia . 
  i fully understand the two countries are separate and have no ill feelings for modern serbia . 
  yugoslavia invented the `` macedonism '' identity , the idea they are a well defined , separate nation that always called itself macedonian , from the time of alexander , and has in fact been the one to rule medieval byzantium and bulgaria , but those histories were stolen from them . 
  here 's a post i wrote about it a while back with all the links and events i 'm too lazy to write again here : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3e60jm/when_did_macedonia_become_a_primarily_slavic/ctc9p8x, 
  did someone else take the region and impose 45 years of yugoslav bulgarophobic , `` macedonism '' education on the people , the product of which is their current schizofrenia of ancient greek , medieval serb and modern bulgarian history mixture ?

  here 's a google translate : expected load of passengers due to the introduction of a temporary 100-percent control of eu external borders of bulgaria , announced the directorate `` border police '' , quoted by the press office of the interior ministry . 
  for the same reason the slower will be processed identification documents of border crossing with turkey , macedonia , serbia , and through checkpoints sofia airport . 
  the increased border control is part of the bulgarian government introduced measures following the terrorist attacks in the french capital paris . 
  it is recommended that bulgarian citizens the opportunity to rethink their travel plans , according to the changed situation . 
  airport `` sofia '' there is increased police presence and police dogs , police `` focus '' . 
  the flight from france to bulgaria , `` bulgaria air '' is delayed by about 30 minuti.ochakva to arrive at 14:43 pm. , according to the tray . 
  that 's the problem . 
  actual migrants are willing to fight tooth and nail to earn their place . 
  second gen migrants end up being whiny upper-middle class shits that get recruited by is . 
  i ised to be a a regular at / r/askhistorians , but then i decided to quit on moral grounds . 
  i applaud their attempt at keeping things accademic , but hard thruth is they are very western biased . 
  they were willing to take a very shit source ( popular , hardly researched book on slavery in the balkans ) by an english writen in english over an untranslated paper in bulgarian by an academic who 's had at least 35 years in the field and cites other academics as well as primary sourcesin different languages . 
  just on the merit of being bilgarian or english one is concidered more credible and the other more biased and unreliable . 
  as far as the video in question , i do n't know about other places , but in the central and eastern balkans , the dots were shockingly spot on . 
  i could elaborate on almost all of them as they appeared on the map . 
  since a lot of those are hardly researched and often overlooked by western historians , i 'm giving the guy some credit and assume he 's been as dilligent for all the others . 
  nothing new here . 
  all the pro-russian protests and manifestations that gather tens of thousands according to rt , are for the most part 10 to 50 strategically placed people . 
  yes , bulgaria is rabidly christian . 
  also , the chimn of our holiest patron saints literally starts with `` forward , science is the sun , burning bright within our sould '' . 
  as for iraq - we held a lousy airport and then a base . 
  because of the whole do n't shoot the locals , be civil and etc , a bomb truck got inside the outter peremiter of the base and soldiers died . 
  if we were anything like what you describe , we would have whiped that village off the map .

  obviously your knowlege of your country 's history is somewhere between third grade and jack squat . 
  just because people outside of bulgarian are n't aware of this , it does n't make it any less true . 
  plus those are well documented recent events , not claming ancesstry to a foreighn dude who ruled your province . 
  bulgarian sour milk ( youghurt ) is quite popular there , as well as rose oil . 
  we were allies in ww2 . 
  also , the bulgarian sumo fighter kaloyan mihalev - kotoshu is hugely popular and one of only 16 foreighners to ever compete in the heaviest sumo category . 
  i 'm pretty sure they know where bulgaria is , though i woul n't say the same about americans and france . 
  actually i hate anime and my favourite swords are the cossack shashka/palash and the bulgarian officer sabre . 
  the samurai were a mounted archer force for most of history , to use their sword was a great shame because is showed a pathetic lack of skill with thw bow and/or getting dismounted by some pesant . 
  only in later centuries when western influence came and they turned to a more bureaucratic duties the sword came in handy . 
  also there is no such thing as a honor code/philosophy in bushido . 
  ( there is n't one in european chivalry , but that 's another topic . ), 
  as far as bravery , the guys took two nukes and a lot of generals were still ready to fight on , so there 's that .

  yes , there was even a samurai who fought in the russo-turkish war . 
  reguardless of the political regimes or even the cold war , we 've always had a good economic and cultural relationship .

  pretty soon the right wind supremacists are going to become obsolete and the govt will turn them into outcast calling itself civilised . 
  in absolutely no way , shape or form . 
  in fact most people , as the recent referendum prooved , have only maginal concept of how the ruling institutions work , let alone the eu . 
  all people know is the shit soup the russian media serve them every day . 
  ( 80 % of media in bulgaria is controlled by oligarchs , who are installed by former comunist state security / russia . 
  hell , even the supreme party lead todor zivkov admitted in one if his last interviews , that the ds ( stazi ) had agents directly reporting to russia . ),

that _ is_cheap . 
  in bulgaria a domestic 0.5 l is ~ $ 0.7 . 
  for a good beer you pay ~ $ 1.3 edit : nevermind i thought it was $ 0.3 for a beer . 
  so basically same prices as here . 
  we _ did _ celebrate 100 years of independence ... 6 years ago . 
  it 's got euro written in cyrillic but bulgaria is n't in the eurozone . 
  guess that settles it - the lev 's days are numbered . 
  you 're almost right . 
  this is actually a frame from an animated spinnig globe which was not meant to be examined in detail . 
  the person who did it did n't bother to put the correct names probably because he was instructed to just make it look good and the details are n't important . 
  he was most certainly not a geography entusiast so this is the final result .

  * one of the largest banks - ktb is facing bankruptcy . 
  after special police forces invaded their offices people went on a bank run and currently the bank is under protection from bnb ( bulgarian national bank ) . 
  they have ran out of liquidity and all transactions are frozen for the next 3 months .

  not sure really . 
  you need to contact the bulgarian embassy in norway . 
  our country is easy on tourists and immigration so you 'll have no trouble getting in . 
  bulgarian weather offers something for everyone . 
  with full four seasons we have cold winters with lots of snow on the mountains and it 's a very popular affordable skiing destination . 
  the summers are hot and the beaches are beautiful . 
  definitely visit in the summer and if you enjoy clean and uncluttered beaches there are plenty of them outside of the popular resorts . 
  springs are amazing , everything 's green and in my opinion it 's the best time to explore the mountains and older villages . 
  customs - there really is n't anything you should worry about . 
  most young people speak english and can be very helpful . 
  the majority are christian and we have a turkish minority ( ~ 9 % ) but we really are n't that religious . 
  basically all you need to do is stay out of trouble and you 'll have a great time here . 
  just do n't take it personal when vendors and cashiers seem rude . 
  they are n't rude it 's just the way they appear . 
  it 's kind of normal here . 
  do n't expect smiles or even hello . 
  bulgaria is a really interesting country when it comes to the price of goods and services . 
  restaurants , alcohol , cigarettes , transportation , theatres , amusement parks , landmarks access , etc are very cheap compared to most western european countries . 
  but goods in the supermarket and clothing are sometimes even more expensive than what you can find in germany for example . 
  so basically it 's a great tourist destination . 
  if you have more questions ask right away . 
  everyone in europe who has had an encounter with a gypsy has a negative opinion about them . 
  people who live near gypsies simply hate them . 
  but you first need to know which gypsies are we referring to . 
  when americans and most people in the first world hear about a gypsy they are picturing [ this ] ( http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/7017/1-1/deluxe-tarot-card-gypsy-costume.jpg ) . 
  when in reality gypsies look like [ this ] ( http://newobserveronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gypsies-sliven.jpg ) . 
  almost all of them have committed at least one crime . 
  they do n't pay taxes , electricity , housing , etc. 
  they build illegal houses near towns and villages and constantly rob them . 
  they have many kids because governments in europe pay for child support . 
  the kids do n't go to school and are on the streets begging . 
  in corrupt european countries they are used for their vote . 
  they usualy give them a beer and something to eat or 20lv ( ~ $ 11 ) . 
  are you that afraid of the feedback that you put / s just in case you have to explain yourself ? 
  do we really need to pretend to be politically correct when there 's this huge fucking elephant in the room ? 
  really ? 
  weird , i was in romania a few years ago and i saw i think a couple . 
  granted it was smaller towns - negru voda to mangalia . 
  i remember them because they were a lot more colorful than ours . 
  decorated with all kinds of stuff . 
  old dacias were like that also . 
  is it some sort of a tradition there ? 
  not really . 
  gypsies do n't care at all about their horses . 
  i 've seen many malnourished and obviously abused horses owned by gypsies . 
  they eat whatever is around them and pull that cart until they drop dead . 
  a used car need constant maintenance and fuel which costs _ a _ _ lot _ for a gypsy . 
  many hard working bulgarians ca n't afford a car . 
  edit : wrong reply . 
  i do n't get it . 
  who oppresses them ? 
  their government is your standard eastern european corrupt government but they were n't oppressing anyone . 
  and then we have these `` terrorists '' out of nowhere shooting at people and everyone 's protesting now . 
  how convenient . 
  but for who ? 
  i 'm not being cynical here , pretty bad stuff happened and it should have been avoided but you have to agree that something 's off . 
  so it 's generally not a good beer ? 
  maybe i like it because it tastes differently from most beers i consume . 
  i like most czech beers that can be found here and starobrno is definitely on top of the list . 
  * as someone who has experienced the convenience of the bicycle in holland 's urban areas , sometimes i wish it was a bit more flat around here . 
  not to mention 30 % of it was an ad . 
  are n't youtubers making enough money off the views anyways ? 
  i 'm sorry but 30 % of the video was an ad .

  it 's not some traditional bulgarian salad . 
  it was promoted to tourists during the `` golden age '' of communism . 
  it caught on and now it 's the most popular salad . 
  we bulgarians have lots of different dishes , meat , sweets , etc but even we refer to most grilled meat as `` srabska skara ( \u0421\u0440\u044a\u0431\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430 , literally serbian grill ) '',

  i watched it live on eurovision 's youtube channel with headphones and there definitely were boos when countries gave high points to russia . 
  the audience found a way around the anti-booing technology of the producers by extending their boos after the initial fake/enhanced applause sounds , a.k.a. 
  the applause sounds lasted for like 8-10 second and the audience would ( continue ) boo ( ing ) for about 5-8 seconds more so they can be heard .

  and malta should be half-blue , half-green since they introduced civil unions in april , last year . 
  it 's not that . 
  it was promoted through the planetromeo.com gay dating website , which is based in the netherlands and has been around for 10 years . 
  it 's fairly new on the world stage as its previous name was gayromeo.com and was mostly and specifically oriented towards the european msm community . 
  i would even speculate that it was the first internet platform that gathered a large bdsm-interested gay men for the groups that is has on the topic and the people there were/are mostly from germany . 
  this also explains the very few respondents from countries outside europe . 
  lastly , even in the report it says :  the survey was a collaboration between planetromeo.com and a research team at the department of communication at the johannes gutenberg university in mainz , germany ( jgu ) . 
  the website promoted it and recruited people , whereas the university gathered and analysed the stats . 
  kinda . 
  the first story that pops up in google search on it is from catholic-news . bg ( you can guess what it says ) , then there are 2 articles from different news sites with the same text , taken from [ this french article ] ( http://www.lejdd.fr/international/europe/video-le-grand-angle-diplo-l-europe-divorcee-sur-le-mariage-homo-732610 ) , then there is an article that cites [ this rt\u00c9 article ] ( http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0219/681528-referendum/ ) as well as [ this article from the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/irish-voters-to-decide-on-same-sex-marriage-in-may-referendum ) , then there is one citing the irish times and that 's about it . 
  the rest are old articles ( about the announcement of the referendum in 2013 ) . 
  i participated in this survey ( and even [ posted the link to the questionnaire here on r/europe back then ] ( http://np.www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2pwm5m/academic_gay_rights_monitor_2014_survey_available/ ) ) . 
  i 'm currently in the works of several maps that 'll show some of the findings from the survey . 
  i 'm only taking the countries ' results , whose sample size is representative enough ( confidence interval up to 5 max ) , so look forward to that . 
  thank you , nonetheless . 
  the reason i asked about that is to see whether the argument ` it 's expensive ! ', 
  could be potentially used against the implementation of this type of voting and if it 's possible to debunk that argument with actual numbers .

  definitely shit .

  i 'm also not sure how those 260km/person were calculated , so i 'm also taking those stats with a grain of salt . 
  here 's the latest i could find regarding the technical issues with the ro-bg pipeline :  a gas interconnector with romania being built since 2012 will not be operational before september , sources close to the construction say . 
  the 25-kilometer-long connection between bulgaria 's city of rousse and romanian gyurgevo was initially scheduled to be ready in end-2013 at the latest , but the deadline was extended over technical difficulties . 
  sources close to bulgartransgaz , the system operator in charge of the interconnector , told website econ.bg that a broken pipe going under the danube river was the reason for the latest delay . 
  attempts are now under way to pull the pipe out of the waters , with experts called on site to provide assistance , the informants have assured . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/162151/bulgaria-romania+gas+link+suffers+further+delay ) as for quantity , on bulgartransgaz 's website it is said :  * the total length of the gas pipeline is 25 km , of which 15 km on bulgarian territory , 7,5 km on romanian and 2,5 km danube undercrossing . 
  the diameter of the pipe is dn 500 mm and the working pressure pn 40 bar . 
  the maximum design capacity of the interconnection is 1,5 bcm/year and the minimum 0,5 bcm/year .

  and what exactly is the `` thing '' ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  i ca n't really say that for our politicians over here , sorry . 
  only time will tell . 
  reforms need to be made and change has to come from within . 
  yes . 
  i had to delete the following sentence , because i was exceeding the 10 000 characters mark , from the article :  it is traditional in bulgaria for the school children to bring flowers for their teachers on the first day of school , september 15 . 
  it is done to express students ' gratitude for all the hard work the teachers do to educate them . 
  from the [ creator ] ( http://alphadesigner.com/art-store/europe-according-to-bulgaria-print/comment-page-1/#comment-2296 ) :  because bruxelles is the seat of the eu . 
   a society that deprives many of its youngest members the opportunities of participation is wasting potential and undermining itself . 
  \u2116 1 reason why people started leaving bulgaria , 1989 onward . 
  as a bulgarian i need to explain . 
  it all goes back to the critical years of the 90s , when basically people massively migrated to the most ` accepting ' rich country . 
  accepting meaning easier access i.e. 
  with a bribe here and there you could get there and start working . 
  men went to spain to work either as truck drivers or open their own businesses and take the rest of their families in a few months . 
  women went to italy to be babysitters or cleaning ladies , hence what italians think of bulgarians . 
  so today there is still large bulgarian communities in madrid ( for bg population ) and especially in the coastal cities and resorts . 
  thank you !, 
  glad to be of service !,

  but then where will i buy ... umm ... forget it . 
  that 's too hardline for the eu , but i can see it being the best solution . 
  hopefully australia 's positive results ( ? ), 
  will teach us . 
  i bet there is a soup kitchen in your city , what is stopping you from queueing there now ? 
  that 's right , it is too much of an inconvenience for a person with money . 
  so no , you wo n't stop buying food , because you want specific food at specific time and you can afford it . 
  it is . 
  anise flavored rakia exists , but it is n't popular . 
  i 've always found this back and forth between humans and bulls in spain quite amusing . 
  it seems spaniards realize how unfair it is to torture bulls in the arenas so from time to time they give them equal opportunity for revenge . 
  a whole country that hosts a terrorist organization , because it is more powerful than the government . 
  sad . 
  rakia , yesterday . 
  9 % turks . 
  i do n't know personally a single one , so no idea what is n't true . 
  i do n't believe we have a stereotype for them as a whole . 
  i guess wearing hijab ( ? ), 
  and farming tobacco can apply in the villages . 
  they are here , because we were under ottoman rule for 482 years and they settled . 
  our problems are of course with the 5 % gypsies , but i ca n't talk about that because i 'll get banned again . 
  well , yes , i too suspect they are gaming the asylum system to seek economic migration . 
  [ quality of life survey - kosovo ] ( http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_publication/field_ef_document/ef1350en3_1.pdf ) it 's not somalia . 
  i guess the camps overflowed . 
  that 's still 500 000 , but yes , my condolences . 
   however under turkish law they can not apply for refugee status but only temporary protection status . 
  hey , you are not granting them asylum !? 
  i doubt they will return on their own to a pile of rubble and if you just cut off their work permits and welfare things may get worse . 
  i never thought of airbnb 's impact that way !, 
  by regulating hotels you can regulate the amount of tourists . 
  why are so many from kosovo ? 
  there is no dictatorship or war , it seems pretty much as good as macedonia . 
  what grounds to ask for asylum do those 48 100 people have ? 
  that is 3/4 of their christian population . 
  in one quarter . 
  those millions are in a temporary tent camp in the middle of nowhere , not roaming around the country doing whatever people with absolutely no ( prospects for ) income do for survival . 
  edit : most of them are n't really . 
  unhappy with the result of the crimean war , russia waged a new one with the ottoman empire and in the end , among other things , the bulgarian state was [ somewhat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_bulgaria ) reestablished . 
  imo syriza has little to do with q2 and absolutely nothing with q1 data . 
  they came to power only on 26 jan. 
  even if they started legislating on day 1 ( which takes months ) , the whole economy does n't change so quickly unless you do something drastic . 
  wtf this is actually about the uk where english is the official language !, 
  feel free to explain how things are fine in varna . 
  from the mayor 's office to the chief of police . 
  that 's a lot . 
  after the fall of communism security and insurance were the prime sectors for criminal gangs as they gave the opportunity for legalized racketeering . 
  such stickers on cars , shops , homes clearly mark who is paying . 
  the one you are talking about is for tim.bg , a private security firm . 
  for 20 years the mafia diversified its business a lot and for all these years tim remains unchallenged in varna , while a lot of sofia bosses were killed over the years . 
  in varna ? 
  [ there is nothing else ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tim_ ( firm \\ ) ) .

  you mean putinophobia . 
   everybody talking about putin , your precious eu is even more corrupt . 
  can you base that on any research ? 
  how do you divide 80 000 euros by 10 000 people and get 800 ? 
  i 'm confused by the terminology ( first , second ... ) . 
  what education does a university graduate with bachelor 's degree ( 4 years ) have ? 
  no , we need more euromonies . 
  otherwise i do n't know why should we care , nothing is made in the uk to worry about customs . 
  you do n't base such decisions on exceptions . 
  these crises are only an excuse , the uk is too proud to be part of an empire . 
  [ kamen donev - ladies and gentlemen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knjtkkrru84 ), 
  what was the reason for the killings ? 
  the imf fixed my country in worse situation - bankruptcy and hyperinflation . 
  again they gave money in exchange for reforms , that were catastrophically delayed before . 
  its failures come not from the measures it prescribes , but from stubborn governments that do n't adopt them at first . 
  it happened here too , we needed several `` packages '' . 
  because the imf deals with economics , not politics and can be trusted to say the hard truth . 
  then if politicians decide to do what 's right , but unpopular , they can throw some blame on the imf . 
  or ignore them and be the good guy while throwing more billions into the fire . 
  oh , that is a point of view i totally understand . 
  i do n't know how old are you , but ubuntu is actually mind-blowingly good user distro considering what we had before . 
  what other user distro just works ? 
  but really , because i 've had enough botched debian stable updates . 
  they cut it because what follows does n't matter . 
  microsoft corporation can always choose to believe it is necessary . 
   basic transportation is one of those things so is water , electricity , internet , food , heating , shelter ... where do we stop ? 
  no , he wants his statement to reach as many people in europe as possible . 
  he is spreading ideology . 
  too long, 
  yes , but my government will use the money for something else , not lower the taxes . 
  and this new tax will be calculated in any end product i 'm buying . 
  for example they can get 1 % of the vat . 
  my vat will still be 20 % , but 1 % will go to the eu and 19 % to the local government . 
  it is probably not ideal , i 'm only illustrating what i meant . 
  figure out a way to do this without increasing my taxes , thank you . 
  typical nazi scum - 5 to 1 and still use underhanded tactics . 
  then the moment they face opposition by the two blue shirt guys they retreat . 
  or most of your friends simply do n't want to smell bad , lose teeth and die in terrible pain .

  of course , smoking is bad for business and raises the burden of healthcare .

  because of the soviet era . 
  corruption . 
  non-existent political elite . 
  we have dumb but well-connected people playing politics . 
  incapable administration . 
  the socialist state was notoriously ineffective without open competition . 
  that creates 99 % equally inept workers on all levels .

  this idea comes from western cold war propaganda and the tendency of the church to present itself as a victim of unbelievers/nonchristians . 
  it has much more to do with the integration and status of the russian orthodox church in the monarchy and the risk its power and position in society posed to the new state . 
  processes that rejected the power of the church have also been happening in western europe , stalin was just a radical maniac who consolidated a lot of power that allowed him to do almost anything . 
  the church and its leaders were put down like anybody else who tried to stay in the way . 
  this includes a lot of people that were much much more real communists than stalin . 
  in fact stalin started with them first before he demolished churches . 
  i would love to see this with main import destinations . 
  [ the illustration ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vtf0iad.jpg ) is wrong though . 
  a0 is not 1m x 1m . 
  it 's 841mm x 1189mm ( still 1m \u00b2 ) . 
  this is aspect ratio 1 width : \u221a 2 height ( ca . 
  1:1,41 ) which he explains later at the end of the video . 
  it 's a gigantic victim-complex . 
  then you 've never been in a bulgarian bookstore ( there 's a whole section for conspiracy theories books everywhere ) or a newsstand ( about one third is made of publications with stuff like this ) . 
  [ our freaking military dug ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnchk07woj4 ) a gigantic hole because some person told them there are aliens there . 
  yep . 
  that 's the tip of the iceberg . 
  if you read carefully you 'd notice they quote bulgaria 's president with that number . 
  i 'm actually not calling this a conspiracy but pondering upon the irony that there is a real conspiracy happening yet the conspiracy obsessed bulgarians never thought of it . 
  bulgarians absolutely love conspiracy theories . 
  you can hear and read all kinds of crazy shit from all kinds of people . 
  all these years i 've been hearing about this jewish world order or that sneaky turkish plan for the islamisation of bulgaria , or how the eu is secretly destroying our economy to control us , or how americans are hiding gigantic caves with alien pyramids in bulgaria ... 
  but never did anyone ever mention the fact that russia is devising a master plan for destabilizing us with a `` hybrid war '' as part of some post-berlin wall ex-kgb oligarchy imperialism aiming to get them back in the game . 
  it 's officially called `` social security '' in english . 
  even with all the cold war reserves and the paramilitary it 's 3,2 million at best . 
  norway has a population of 5 million . 
  preschool math here , people . 
   their entire population is about the size of russia 's military that 's not even remotely true . 
  are arabs huge fans of [ goatwhore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ft5fowymii ) or what is that referencing to ? 
  the extremists are the mainstream . 
  putin thinks he 's got it all figured out but he created a rats nest that will not go away for generations . 
  civilians on war fronts celebrating are truly the stupidest people . 
  german eurosceptical party won seven percent by saying `` we should be more like switzerland '' and now are entering the eu parliament . 
  most news broadcasters and articles are meant to inform people . 
  present facts and analysis . 
  that article is doing this . 
  it 's not propaganda because it 's not in any way manipulative with the information it presents . 
  it in no way sways opinions . 
  it presents the reality through a set of of unbiased and widely recognized terms and definitions and deals with facts . 
  if you feel like facts oppose your personal views try to maybe question your views and not the mere facts . 
  i thought this was `` immigration propaganda '' ? 
  now it 's brain drain defence ? 
  two different things . 
  it 's merely an issue of insufficiency in the labour force within an ever commercializing industry that pretends its aims are the advantage of nation-based teams within an international competition , when really its about business and maximizing profit . 
  most of all it 's a fact . 
  meanwhile in bulgaria : `` what now ? 
  you guys do n't like awesome friendly beautiful fair great generous fantastic not crazy big brother russia ( which we love and cherrish a lot , like very much ) !? 
  you guys are crazy , we have no idea what you 're talking about * fearful grin * '', 
  i think this should be a wake up call to serbia and serbians . 
  ukraine has been their pet and they are getting * this * treatment . 
  you think it 's really a good idea to be their next pet . . 
  voluntarily ?!, 
  you 're selling yourselves to satan here . 
  you can lick russia 's ass until your mouth is full of shit but it wo n't bring back kosovo . 
  stalin is the right reference here . 
  hitler wanted to make more `` lebensraum '' for the germans . 
  he did not succeed but stalin did it for the russians . 
  stalin played out what hitler and the nazis wanted to do with their `` lebensraum '' aims . 
  do you know why there are so many russians on the crimean peninsula ? 
  because stalin got them `` lebensraum '' there . 
  stalin deported the crimean tatars , armenians , bulgarians , and greeks which was a full blown ethnic cleansing and a forgotten genocide through starvation , mass murder , and deportation . 
  i wonder on which side the romanians and bulgarians are . 
  this means i have to march around with the nazi salute and call everyone hitler !, 
  this is a massive cliche in germany . 
  foreigner doing something stupid , police officer with poor english skills tries to talk to him , foreigner goes into dramatic `` you 're all nazis '' mode of stupidity . 
  nationalists at both sides pick up the pitchforks . 
  on one side you have morons who think it 's okay to offend germans with nazis `` because their language sounds funny '' or their police officers/border police exercise the same form of authoritative persona as in any other country in the world ; and on the other side you have germans who will do all they can to pretend like they have no idea why something like this is happening . 
  to the morons - you deserve to be taken into custody and fined . 
  to the germans , it 's clearly not your direct fault but it also was n't that long ago for you to expect this to never happen . 
  just try to communicate to people and explain the misapprehension before everything escalates . 
  it is illegal in germany to some extent . 
  especially if you use it in a way which will allow them to present themselves as victims e.g. 
  some arrogant diplomat bringing up wwii because his vodka soaked brain is obsessed with pathetic inferiority complex upon hearing german . 
  the weather report on that site says -43 c right now . 
  it 's the big irony about asking about arrogance . 
  the [ bacteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus#history ) in yogurt is named after bulgaria . 
  * tears of pride *, 
  romania gets nothing . 
  yes . 
  are you people blind or biased ? 
  right behind them are other cops with guns not pointed at them . 
  if those two were rioters the other cops would be hiding or firing . 
  so they are trying to get to the top level of the movement and murder them all ? 
  it 's always been like that and always will be . 
  the illusion of a pacifistic freedom movement was created by those who fear for they power not those who fear society would destroy itself . 
  that 's true but it 's also true that bulgarians are the only people who watch bulgarian movies . 
  by the way the bulgarian movie is on [ youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7shz7i9yegs ) but unfortunately the english subtitels are not in sync . 
  hotel mama : saving the establishment 's ass . 
  albanians are n't being officially accounted for . 
  this whole `` bad migration '' thing works both ways . 
  bulgaria is quickly becoming an emigration country and it is new to us . 
  nobody seems to be able to handle it . 
  now everybody is talking about us like we 're the biggest european trash . 
  we actually always thought of ourselves like a mid-range trash . 
  a 13 century history has been reduced to `` europe 's mexicans '' . 
  people do n't even realize we 're not all `` gypsies '' . 
  in the last 20 years bulgaria ( which was at 9 million in 1989 and is now at 7,3 million people ) has been very seriously brain-drained and with laughable wages 8-14 times lower than in western europe it 's going to continue . 
  bulgaria 's biggest problem is the lack of good labor . 
  it cripples the economy and good investment . 
  because most institutions are ruined by the transition from soviet socialism most talent just leaves .

  as for the inability to integrate it is sadly there and it is very real . 
  i have some roma friends from italy which are originally from a village close to sofia . 
  they do not identify as roma and would be very offended if you said they are roma . 
  however as you said this is my side of the story but you asked for opinions and everybody will have a different opinion . 
  i am not going to display all the problems of roma people in bulgaria and the problems they create for the government and people in general because it will not be beneficial ... 
  however i am going to explain the most prevalent problems and make some comparisons to america . 
  roma people in bulgaria ( and europe in general ) can be compared to lower class black people in america . 
  there are some similarities but there are differences . 
  for example when enough roma families move into a neighbourhood you see the famous white-flight . 
  a lot of ethnic bulgarian sell their apartments and move to different neighbourhoods and as a result real estate prices take a steep dive . 
  the result is the typical `` roma ghetto '' . 
  with this comes an increase in crime and vandalism . 
  the biggest problem is however their inability to successfully integrate . 
  there were numerous programs to integrate roma people by giving them subsidized apartments in various neighbourhoods but like some other users mentioned those get destroyed very quickly ... and the problems is that the roma culture is very exclusive . 
  all other people are seen as outsiders and this creates a very strong `` us vs. them '' mentality . 
  roma people that try to go against the trend and adopt a bulgarian culture are seen as worse than the devil and are branded as traitors . 
  so basically roma people have to choose between their families and integration and it is no surprise which one they choose . 
  this is very comparable to black ghetto culture in america . 
  it is important to note that the situation is improving in bulgaria and more and more roma people are abandoning their outdated culture . 
  the integration of the roma people is sadly shunned by ethnic bulgarians . 
  a lot of bulgarians are very racist towards roma and blame them for all of the problems of this country and when they are shown examples of successfully integrated roma people they say that they are bulgarians ... 
  so you can see that in bulgaria roma is not an ethnicity but rather a culture . 
  it is indeed a very sensitive topic and there is no easy solution ... edit : sorry for the wall of text i did n't intend for it to be so long but oh well ... 
  a lot of bulgarian from smaller provincial town have theories that that is precisely why bulgarian are seen as beggars and thieves abroad because a lot of immigrants have roma background and they are put in the same group as ethnic bulgarians . 
  this opinion is not widespread in bigger cities but it might be true to some extent . 
  i am also in favour of referring to the origin country of immigrants and not their ethnicity as it will ease the integration of minority groups ( roma/turks/etc from bulgaria ) but it will also punish ethnic bulgarians to some extent so it is not all white and black . 
  montenegro separated in 2006 so i doubt they used a non-existing currency but they might have used it before they gained independence . 
  someone from there would have to enlighten us . 
  the eu has largely changed that mindset . 
  admittedly i am not part of the problematic countries - the yugoslav ones however bulgaria has it 's share of `` balkan '' memories . 
  however with the continued integration in the eu those memories are disappearing . 
  slavic nationalism does n't exist anymore for example . 
  everyone has forgotten macedonia or simply does n't care anymore . 
  people are accepting towards turks and muslims in general ( however not towards roma people ... ) . 
  there never was much conflict between serbia and bulgaria and there certainly is n't any now . 
  most bulgarians do n't even know south thrace was bulgarian less than a 100 years ago and those who do do n't care . 
  the story is similar for north dobruja ... 
  i realize that the situation is much more complicated for the post-yugoslav counties . 
  the conflict was only 2 decades ago . 
  the memories are still fresh . 
  but time is all they need . 
  i hope that in a couple of decades `` balkan drama '' will be just another irrelevant joke . 
  one does not have to be racist to realize that any sort of immigrants usually create problems . 
  the uk is considerably better in integrating immigrants than other european countries because the language is so widespread and makes integration easier . 
  the fact that the french growth is mainly natural ( which i am not so sure about ) can only be a plus . 
  however the difference between a tfr of 1.98 ( france ) and 1.85 ( uk ) is minimal . 
  i do n't understand the recent serbian hate . 
  for someone not from the balkans you must understand there is a lot of bad blood between the various states and especially serbia however everyone likes to blame serbia for everything which is wrong . 
  depending on who you ask you will get different answers for who started the flag incident and the court decision is probably political . 
  however this exchange between the pm had nothing to do with the first balkan war ... 
  i would bet it would be above 90 % . 
  anyone who can vote besides the few who will boycott the referendum will vote on practically their next 50 years . 
  i do n't disagree with you . 
  i was just pointing out where he got his numbers from . 
  he is citing the nominal values . 
  and with them he is correct as gdp per capita in romania is 9,570 usd and in greece it is 18,863 for 2015 . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita #imf _ estimates_between_2010_and_2019, 
  i do n't have any official statistics but i would say it is similar to romania with maybe a 5-10 % swing in favor of creditors so something like 20 % / 45 % . 
  however i would n't use the data i provided as it is obviously biased from the people i asked . 
  it is just to give a perspective . 
  well a political party in bulgaria is calling for open discrimination of turks and romani people and several newspapers are advocating outright genocide of muslims . 
  should we take their claims for serious and say that bulgarian media wants to kill everyone who is not bulgarian or is that not some extremist opinion and far-right delusions . 
  i do n't know what you are smoking ?? 
  germany paid close to 100,000 tons of gold of reparations for ww1 or around 270 billion marks . 
  the interesting part is that they finished paying it in 2010 ... 
  da ( \u0414\u0430 ) for yes ne ( \u041d\u0435 ) for no, 
  well to be honest before ww1 turkey did n't exist and the ottoman empire still had a lot of land in the middle east so to include them in the first two maps would be inaccurate and misleading . 
  still should be included in the last two ... 
  however taking big loans in bulgaria is the same as committing political suicide here . 
  this is common in all post-soviet states . 
  the recent 17/18 billion loan worried a lot of people although it 's much better than some other states ... 
  as far as i know this is the official policy - to wait and see what the outcome of the euro debt crisis will be . 
  the euro might not be the legal tender of bulgaria but literally every single big transaction is in euros already . 
  all of real estate purchases/sales are done in euro and investing is also heavily in euro . 
  infrastructure projects are also calculated in euro ... 
  i support the euro in bulgaria but i do n't think the majority of bulgarians do though . 
  i do n't know much about missiles or missile defence but even if the system stopped supersonic icbms with near perfect 99 % success rate the few that made it would still be absolutely devastating for europe . 
  i never said anything about the us not being involved . 
  it is actually heavily involved as much of the equipment comes from them as well as maintenance and support . 
  it should n't be too hard to find the reliable information . 
  just google sm-3 missiles as those are the ones that are primarily used . 
  there are many national missile defence systems but the one i was talking about is the nato one . 
  currently it is operational in romania and poland is expected to host one in 2018 but i believe the timetable has been pushed ahead . 
  there is also presence in the mediterranean in the form of ships with anti-ballistic capabilities . 
  turkey also host anti-ballistic missiles as well as early warning sensor . 
  the uk has the other one . 
  here is the official plan : https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/15/fact-sheet-implementing-missile-defense-europe, 
  nope . 
  russia is n't as strong as people make them out to be . 
  russia will encounter significant resistance in ukraine since it has already mobilized . 
  sure they would eventually defeat them but in the meantime romania and bulgaria will have a significant nato presence from western europe and usa . 
  turkey will pose quite a challenge for russia since it has very defensible terrain and very modernized equipment so in the very best case ( if they manage to incite a kurdish uprising ) they take ankara but will never reach istanbul . 
  poland is aware of the danger and i would be surprised if they have n't prepared extensively . 
  besides it 's in the heart of europe so you could expect a lot of foreign support . 
  baltics and finland are probably fucked . 
  i do n't think nato can mobilize quickly enough to prevent invasion . 
  however the most significant problem they face is holding the territory . 
  if they wish to not have an uprising every few weeks russia would have to massacre the local population ( which in the aftermath would be the end of russia as we know it ) or leave a sizable force in every city they take which means they have to rely on less and less troops the further they go . 
  if russia goes full retard and launches nukes eastern europe is fucked but russia will be absolutely obliterated since europe has an advanced missile defence system and will fare much better than moscow . 
  all in all even putin is not that stupid .

  thank you , dear neighbour , i 'm laughing with tears :d, 
  hah , the irony . 
  couple of decades ago they were hidden not to `` go '' to germany , but now they ( and ours ) are going on masses to germany on their own :d, 
  that 's not even their final form !, 
  also , why is no one wondering , what the hell are doing all these people `` with mental health problems '' doing on the streets , stabbing people and shit , and why they are not in some mental institutions or hospitals ? 
  oh well ... at least you make very sexy photos of raptors and b2 and what not , 
  russia occupies ukraine . 
  that seems to be left from the socialist years . 
  even we make `` parades '' though we do n't have that much fancy machines to show . 
  i can fap to this, 
  that was some deadly shit ... . 
  plant snipers all around charlie hebdo . 
  when they see guys with masks and guns , let them paint the walls with their brains . 
  well , if we put him in prison he * will become * an `` obedient muslim woman '' . 
  i can have this imam as a sex slave ? 
  norway ? 
  but also - paris , france . 
  i 'm actually kind of glad that it 's not a terrorist attack this time , because it probably should be resolved without additional problems . 
  still , it 's ugly to see such things happening . 
  everything is nothing . 
  as all the other cases - he 's probably insane gay nazi . 
  condolences for the victims :( as i 've heard we have sent rescue teams to help , i also hope we will help you with all that 's needed - food , medicines and so on . 
  may god protect us all from such disasters . 
  that 's ... a really hard question . 
  on one hand , here the people hate our politicians so much , that we would n't even fight in a paintball war for these dirty corrupted fat awful lying stupid bastards . 
  if they say - you have to go `` there '' and do `` that '' ( if there 's a mobilisation of the army ) we would show them a middle finger and run away in some forests or something . 
  but on the other hand , if there 's something threatening our loved ones , our families and friends , our existence ... well , we got ta do what we got ta do and we 're pretty good at it . 
  after all , it 's the balkans . 
  shit would get real and we would kick some ass , even if we 're poor as fck . 
  could be , could be . 
  i 'm not arguing with you , but i still ca n't get the logic of `` they want war , they want some response , so we should not give them that . '', 
  imagine , if during the ww2 the allies said - oh , the nazis ? 
  they want war !, 
  that 's what they want !, 
  we should not fight !, 
  ( we had pacts with the axis , so i 'm saying it from your point of view . ), 
  or ... something more painful for us - the ottoman empire . 
  imagine , if our kings and heroes during the huge 500 years slavery , also - during the liberation of bulgaria said - oh , the ottomans ? 
  they want war !, 
  we should n't do anything about it !, 
  i just ca n't get the logic behind it . 
   also , it 's possible that the integrated muslims in europe , not talking about the islamists in the ghettos , feel even stronger hate against isis for fucking up the name of their religion , so what would isis do when many muslims from all over the world fight against them together with the christians and the other religions ... 
  yes , it 's indeed powerful machine  i was talking , that if there 's a ultimate clash of civilisations it would be the full power of the guys bombing the jihadists at the moment plus many more who suffer or are pissed off because of islamist terrorist acts on their territory . 
  we 're talking about a ultimate clash of civilisations , the eu is just an economical union . 
  basically , it 's like poking a sleeping lion with a stick . 
  then you get buttfucked , and also exterminated . 
  now imagine if someone is ready to kill his children , how much of a fuck he gives about random ( `` infidels ! '' ), 
  people on the street . 
  when the reporter was talking with that paedophile ... 
  i 'm not sure i would be able to control the urge to break his god damn ugly head in the wall . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  it 's kind of unsolvable problem . 
  it 's really , really painful question for us ... and it 's all connected . 
  here the votes for the places in the parliament are often resolved with the gypsies votes . 
  that 's why the politicians ca n't make laws like `` if you have a child under 16/18 you will not get welfare . '', 
  or ... `` if you do n't have ( the mandatory !! ), 
  high-school education , you will not get welfare . '', 
  if they get money for not working and having a lot of children , they ca n't be made to work by force . 
  here the bulgarians are not racist , meaning - we would welcome everyone , no matter which country , but we 're kind of pissed because of our gypsy population . 
  not only because of the welfare and using our healthcare system without paying , but because they steal in the villages , but it 's another huge topic , fuck that . 
  in the end . 
  i want you ... to imagine something . 
  imagine , if the percentage of unemployed people in finland was 80 percent , or 80 percent of the finnish people just would n't work . 
  what would happen with the country then ? 
   also - we fucking enjoy the western countries , because you have such well working systems , social , health , education and so on ... ( while ours are ... not working ) that 's why we 're kind of angry when we hear someone is exploiting or trying to ruin your way of life . 
  there were such rumours , but they are doing something easier - they just fake documents . 
  there was this `` funny '' case where whole ghetto was full with children with asthma ( faked medical documents ) , so they could get extra benefits . 
  also , if you 're thinking i 'm joking  here 's a video from the national tv about a gypsy woman with 12 children . 
  if i have to translate you all of it i 'm going to vomit . 
  basically - 12 children . 
  she does n't know their birth dates , she does n't make them birthdays . 
  i 'm absolutely serious , sometimes they do n't remember their names and how many children they have , it 's like having pets . 
  she and her husband do n't work because they have welfare . 
  she gave birth to her first child when she was 12 . 
  which is against the law here , it 's paedophilia , but the police is fucking retarded . 
  and so on ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjjfgucsnh4, 
  hahaha , here the minimum net salary is around 150 euros . 
  a lot of people outside the capital work for this shit . 
  france , gib money plz, 
  to be honest , i 'm not familiar with the laws , but i know that many villages have a huge percentage of their population ( gypsies ) in germany . 
  they go there with all of their children and as far as i know they get money from the state for every child . 
  our gypsies have a lot of children , sometimes literally more than 10 , that way exploiting our social systems , but in recent years - exploiting the german one , so it 's really profitable for them . 
  as i said , i 'm not familiar with the law , if their father starts some job and then quits , just to get the money , but i know they get money for their children . 
  there were cases where actually the children lived here , but on papers were in germany and still received welfare . 
  also - here the gypsies do n't work but still get welfare ( around 80 percent of the whole gypsy population is unemployed ) , do n't know according which laws . 
  ( we sometimes joke that the gypsies here know the laws better than the layers , because they profit by them.talking about ... money for electricity or wood for the winter , free food , all kinds of welfare , which , well , unfortunately the poor bulgarian pensioners just do n't get , because they do n't try to check how to get any . ), 
  sorry , it 's a painful problem and i could talk a lot about it , but it 's off topic . 
  oh , yeah , there are a lot of our gypsies living on welfare in germany . 
  mind you , the money they get without moving their finger whole month is more than the money we make here working our asses every month . 
  lol , that 's like one very big city in bulgaria , all of them on welfare . 
  thanx , merkel , 
  i see what you did there !, 
  you see , the difference between western and ... `` eastern '' media is , that both may be biased , but you can write in the western media , that it 's biased . 
  well , on theory you can write it in the russian , or ... chinese , or belorussian media too , but you can suddenly disappear or be `` suicided '' . 
  way fckin nicer than our dormitories , to be honest . 
  : / actually looks way better than most of our flats / rented places too . 
  at first i was like `` what the fuck is `` agency for fighting immigrants '' and why should we approve it when ( if it exists ) it should be somewhere abroad . 
  but yeah , the majority of the people here are ... not that smart people who like to check facts and be at least a bit sceptical about everything . 
  hello , friend !, 
   i was talking/joking about this : http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/07/15/485900076/how-a-danish-town-helped-young-muslims-turn-away-from-isis for me it looks like some kind of dark , crazy and sad comedy .

  same as i wrote in the title ? 
  i wrote exactly what the article says . 
  white people and men were asked not to attend an anti-racism event , and the student union supported it . 
  am i missing something here ? 
  did i misunderstand the article ? 
  i do n't know what editorialising means . 
  can you explain what i did wrong as to a non-native english speaker ? 
  i did n't think anything about it until i went on a visit . 
  of the 4 romanian towns craioiva seemed most infested with gypos . 
  later i met a ton of romanians in the uk and belgium and they explained to me it was such because they have one of the highest populations of gypos in romania . 
  same as sliven in our country , but much more numerically . 
  the centre was lovely though . 
  craiova is one of the most gypsie towns in romania . 
  considering our 3 countries ( i 'm from bulgaria ) are the gypo states of europe i find the name `` the craiova group '' fitting . 
  how sorry is anyone in the islamic world at the persecution of the large minority of europeans in algiers after it got its independence ? 
  or in the other middle eastern colonies ? 
  or in africa ? 
  i never really heard of anyone mention it . 
  same with muslims in the balkans - they are the direct result of the ottoman empire , a colonial population that would n't be there if the turks had n't invaded in the first place . 
  so who 's responsible for them when it falls ? 
  that same empire . 
  the reason you ca n't understand it is because , like most atheists today , you ' v created a straw man of religion in your mind , the product of satire and ridicule that makes it look quite different from what it is or how most believers perceive it . 
  atheists paint it as a bunch of irrational fairy tales , believed literally by gullible and weak people . 
  naturally the reason for this is primarily so atheists themselves can then feel like they must represent the opposite - rational , intelligent , strong-willed people . 
  the reality is far from this . 
  i ca n't speak for most other religions , but growing up catholic i was taught both by my parents , teachers and priests at religion classes to look at christianity as a philosophy on morality and life , rather than an explanation of the world . 
  the bible stories were dissected in religion class to show their metaphorical meaning , and never even slightly taken literally . 
  no one ever tried convincing me that there was a snake who talked , a man who split the sea or a `` fiery hell '' with pits of lava and horned devils . 
  and neither did christians believe in these things throughout history - the vast majority of what atheists use to ridicule christianity comes from works of fiction , not canon - such as dante 's inferno , `` paradise lost '' or modern culture . 
  only later , in the 19th century did fundamentalist christians arise among the us protestants , who grew to be today 's us `` creationists '' and evolution-deniers . 
  so what i would rather ask is how long will atheists continue feeding themselves the irrational , ignorant fairy tale that religion is this goofy , literal circus of ignorance portrayed in satirical works , rather than a complex set of philosophies , many of whom atheists themselves would agree with had they actually ever tried looking past the biblical metaphors that frankly , no one besides atheists and fundamental protestants takes literally . 
  poorer people today are fatter . 
  people migrate all the time , but when specific people are being settled by a occupation force on someone else 's land it 's called colonialism . 
  the ottomans settled groups of muslims specifically in the most fertile places in the balkans - like dobrudza and thrace . 
  people all the way from the caucasus were brought - like the circassians or the tatars . 
  they took over the land of local people as is very well documented in the case of the bulgarians continuously expulsed from dobrudzha and taken over by turks and tartars . 
  as late as 1877 bulgarians had no right by law to buy land in that area - an area they had been living on as early as the 7th century , or 600 years before the turks even set foot in europe . 
  you do n't call that colonialism ? 
  it does n't matter how long the muslims remained in the balkans - they did so only because of the ottoman occupation . 
  the ottoman invasion brought the massess of muslims to the balkans , the ottoman invasion gave them land from the locals , , the ottoman occupation kept them there and treated them with far more rights than the other `` millet '' . 
  this is pure colonialims and is therefore right that the end of the ottoman occupation saw the end of their presence there too . 
  i only regret bulgaria was far too tolerant and actually did n't expulse or take the land of their former overlords , which is why today we have almost 800,000 muslims here who try ruling the country through the disgustingly corrupt dps party . 
  accepting a historical fact happened and regretting it did are two different things . 
  those people you mention accept the violent expulsion of the muslim colonials in the balkans happened . 
  they just do n't care it did since they view their very presence there as a result of the ottoman invasion and thus its responsibility . 
  however the turks do n't even recognize the armenian genocide even happened . 
  they deny its very existence . 
  can you see the difference between the two or is too complex ? 
  if you do , then this is why people say your link is irrelevant - it shows a different example , not of something denied but something ignored . 
  if you want to give a proper example to the armenian genocide find a genocide of ottoman muslims that is being denied and completely not accepted as fact by the others . 
  oh wait , you wo n't find one ... 
  you still have n't explained what hypocrisy you mean . 
  hypocricy for hating on a country that occupied and oppressed you for 500 years ? 
  disliking ( i would n't say hatred ) for those people today , who deny that country 's crimes ? 
  i have no negative feeligns for the turks and neither do the vast majority of people in bulgaria since we live with many of them , both part of our turkish minority or some of the many turkish students in sofia , plovdiv and burgas , but i truly do n't understand how you 'd blame us for disliking those turks who deny our ancestor 's 5 century struggle against an ivador . 
  those turks who try claming the empire was `` like a brotherhood of nations '' ( i ' v been told this ) , `` where the local christians were actually given a great opportunity for success and rise within the empire '' . 
  such disgusting white-washing of history should make anyone , not just from the balkans , sick and yet you call us hypocrites for it ? 
  in the balkans no one blames the ottomans for the current economical state . 
  no one with a brain that is . 
  simply because we were already rich and developed 80 years ago , before the communists ruined us . 
  however , this does n't mean we ca n't blame the ottomans for the half a bloody millennium of occupation . 
  for 500 years my people did n't have a country , did n't have rulers or aristocracy , did n't have the basic freedom to build their own temples , rule their own settlements , have their own army , carry weapons or even wear certain colours of clothing !, 
  and yet i go on the internet to see smug turks be proud of the ottoman empire and tell me how well everyone lived in it . 
  then proceed to deny the genocides and crimes committed . 
  guess what , even the murder and deportation of the balkan muslims was indirectly the fault of the ottoman empire which brought those people there in first place . 
  had armenia , bulgaria and greece been independent and not occupied by the turks there would n't be a muslim and turkish minority in either of these countries , to be eventually subjected to revanchism and deportations . 
  do you think it was a crime the 1 million french colonists were kicked from algeria ? 
  i doubt it . 
  and algeria was barely 100 year french occupied - the balkan people suffered 500 years of that and still did n't murder the turks left there . 
  which is why bulgaria has 800,000 turks today . 
  turkey on the other hand has how many greeks , armenians and slavs left ? 
  the balkans were as prosperous as western and central europe before 1944 . 
  pictures of old sofia , belgrade or bucharest are hard to distinguish from cities in france or austria . 
  scientists from romania , bulgaria , serbia , greece and croatia contributed to science immensely for such a small region . 
  so yes , the balkans are a major contributor to civilization , with their current impoverished state entirely due to the red army 's imposition of 45 years of communism . 
  poland was certainly not unique in that . 
  large parts of spain were the same . 
  large parts of ukraine , modern belarus , the baltics , sweden . 
  poland was certainly not the only country with a large , habitable but sparely populated area , yet it was the only one to avoid the plague on such a scale . 
  and furthermore , you forget the other region attached to poland that missed it - bohemia . 
  a small area , heavily populated , very wealthy and connected , with population centres and trade . 
  there 's nothing unique about the demographic and geographic composition of either of these regions and yet they both , being attached to each other , missed the plague when all around them - to the south , north , east and west , did n't . 
  there has to be something more to it then . 
  but poland , and certainly bohemia , was n't lees connected , more isolated or sparsely populated than scandinavia , karelia or russia , which were shown as infected . 
  so why is the isolation and sparse population theory still repeated ? 
  but poland , and certainly bohemia , was n't lees connected , more isolated or sparsely populated than scandinavia , karelia or russia , which were shown as infected . 
  haha , that 's a golden comment right there . 
  `` also known as bulgarian salad '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shopska_salad, 
  a salad named after the shopluk area . 
  which is 90 % in bulgaria . 
  that entire answer was pointless . 
  it can be used for absolutely every single opinion on this site ever . 
  i am a person with an opinion - you can agree with it or try to disprove it . 
  making an ad hominem serves no purpose in the discussion and just shows the lack of other arguments . 
  you ' r completely wrong unless you studied in some forgotten village . 
  i had to study plenty of foreign litarature - victor hugo in 6th grade , ancient greek in 7th , shakespeare and chaucer in 8th , geothe in 9th and plenty more . 
  besides , bulgarian literature is neither scarce nor boring . 
  studying obligatory french and arabic is enough i guess . 
  they did n't and no one ever in any country claimed they did . 
  kyril and metodii created the glagolitic alphabet .

  you could also say this is because of the nature of the candidates , republicans being traditional and having issues with women and minorities and hillary being a woman but i think this is an issue you see everywhere . 
  i dont think its about smarts , it was hard for me to believe it but there were many smart people who voted for trump , in fact if only the white vote was counted trump wouldve have won by more than 80 % . 
  its about people relying on emotion rather than reason when voting . 
  ** edit - ** i shouldnt have stated percentages based on just memory without checking , the more than 80 % might have been based on white males only , sorry about that . 
  when people get used to the solutions they forget they are there only seeing the few issues that stick out . 
  well yeah but nobody is saying that they should be allowed to join before they complete the chapters which cover these things and the eu says they are ready . 
  they are currently in favour , so their self professed goals are converged with the eu . 
  the question is will it remain so , you are saying there is no question to begin with . 
  a person living in romania saying that aint convincing either haha . 
  but why isnt unity for the sake of unity a convincing argument ? 
  unity brings a lot of things with it , peace , cooperation which brings prosperity , safety , etc. 
  if thw whole world was united would that be a bad or a good thing ? 
  well then you better go out and do your part to keep europe united . 
  eu federalists represent !, 
  nah man fuck those people . 
  i would love to see serbia in the eu and to see our countries cooperate more . 
  as long as serbia completes all chapters and the eu says you are ready i will be cool with it . 
  heres hoping one day i can enjoy belgrade and serbian bbq without getting my ass pummelled by the roaming charges . 
  serbia can decide if it does when the time comes , currently more people are in favour than against . 
  haha nice dodge !, 
  if he were any austrian who would he be ? 
  true . 
  its also interesting that the republic never managed to recover especially since caligula was only the 3rd emperor . 
  though i guess augustus and tiberius had very successful reigns cementing the empire . 
  well you are trying to turn this into a fascist vs anti-fascist debate . 
   this is a result of such events being overblown constantly and considered high risk despite most being peaceful . 
  youre a mayor/chief of police and are told there will be such an event that is known to rile up people . 
  you cant know exactly how many people there will be so you send as many as you think would be necessary . 
  i dont think its an overreaction of what could happen at such an event , but that its an overreaction to how many people actually showed up . 
   both the far right and the far left had terrorist organizations in the past decades and both participated in riots , looting , assaults and swarms of other examples of violence . 
  hence why i said far-side extremists , not far-right . 
   lol , everything i write seems to be some kind of agenda apparently . 
  im talking about this post , if you feel that i have attacked all your comment history then maybe you yourself believe it . 
  i wasnt trying to be a dick to you or anything , its just weird why you would try to push this so hard out of the left field when it is so hard to make it relate to the topic . 
   in reality , i was merely making fun of how overblown such demonstrations are and especially clashes between such right wingers and antifas in the media . 
  they nearly always ad some 0 's to the numbers involved and hype it up as much as possible . 
  well i think its obvious , far-side extremists are much more prone to violence and the nature of their ideologies ( the fact that they are far ) drives them towards conflict the easiest . 
  i was really obsessed with caesar for a long time , recently it dawned on me that he was basically a roman trump . 
  he always campaigned with promises that he will save the republic ( make the republic great again haha ) and then the moment he returns from hunting pompey and shagging cleopatra he tries to destroy it . 
  he even had mark antony try to put a crown on his head at his triumph but the crowd was having non of it , mark antony put it on his head 3 times and the crowd booed him 3 times and he gave up . 
  if i lived in rome at the time i wouldve been absolutely against the populist tyrant , cant believe that the real heroes of rome were the senators that killed him ( inadvertently destroying the republic with him but hey they tried ) . 
  im not saying that trump will destroy the us but they basically got elected by running the same campaign and then neither `` drained the swamp '' . 
  they are just moving it from wimbledon to another place though , arent they ? 
  why are you trying to bring some bs agenda into the mix from nowhere that has barely anything to do with the topic ? 
  you are beyond reasoning . 
   international law or we can call it international system in this form was created after ww2 . 
  those who can break it they do it all the time/russia , us , france , uk , prc , saudis , israel and so on you know whats the difference ? 
  i can go to any square in the eu and protest any wrongdoings . 
  i can protest and protests bring governments down throughout europe . 
  go to russia and protest against the dictator , you will find yourself in jail or with a bullet in your head like many others have . 
  worst off yet , nobody wants to protest putin , hes got 90 % approval rates , he has the media and has the whole nation believing that what he does is the best for russia while he sanctions those same people and they struggle to buy food while at the same time believing its the eu 's fault . 
  where were all the russian patriots to battle against the food sanctions putin put out ? 
  where were they when he burned tonnes of food because they came from the eu ? 
  dont come here preaching that bullshit argument of `` we all do it so what '' because we dont all do it . 
  and even if we did we ** know ** that is not justification for doing more bad shit . 
  you are so brain-washed by the regime 's propaganda and its so clear because most russians people try to debate us as if we were brain-washed as well , and thats why you all never try to justify what putin is doing , at least the sane ones dont because they know there is not justification or truth to what your country is doing , all you bots do is say * `` kosovo , iraq , you did it to , but but america , its not your business '' , etc. 
   yes west created mess and let them alone ( nothing else could have been done in both cases after russian reaction . 
  you left them alone ? 
  havent seen russian troops and equipment moving away from eastern ukraine or crimea . 
  i havent seen them do the same in georgia where they randomly annex a couple of kilometres here and there . 
   why certain western states thought it is wise to , , support , , anti russian politicians and do crazy irrational decisions and that russia won t react is unvelievable . 
  what crazy irrational decisions ? 
  what support for anti-russian politicians ? 
  i swear every time somebody criticises russia the russians are like poor little us with the 2nd biggest military in the world which we use to bully other nations with are being ganged up on by the evil irrational west . 
  poor ol' us , dont they know that if they didnt disagree with us we wouldnt have to show them we are big strong manly men ? 
  100 % sure that if it wasnt for the eu and nato russia would use their influence to either turn bulgaria to their side belarus style or respond in force like it has done in ukraine and georgia . 
  russia is already financing the neo-nazis and radical nationalists . 
   italy has 0 reasons to be worried about russia , they have totally different problems . 
  so stop argumenting with bs like that until italy is invaded by russia ... yes it is not their problem . 
  how about upstanding international law and a country sovereignty ? 
  we cant just let the russians bully whomever they want and turn a blind eye because its not happening to us . 
  this is what happens when the governments controls the whole media . 
  nobody stuck up for ukraine , what happened to it ? 
  nobody stuck up for georgia , what happened to it . 
  of course you want to create division between the eu and europe so you can bully weaker countries because that is what your country does . 
  if that was n't the case russia would n't be financing the strongest euro-sceptic parties in each country . 
  if that was n't the case russia would n't come up with bullshit excuses for cases like the crimea annexation or the airplane their men shot down with their equipment . 
  italy is a western nation which should value democracy and peace , so automatically she should be against what russia is doing . 
  yeah cause russia never does anything crazy or unexpected . 
  the world will stay as it is forever and no shifts of power will occur ever again . 
  ah so until they invade italy its not your problem ? 
  with that mind-set russia might actually manage to gather enough power and influence do to it . 
   we 're not very enthusiastic in antagonizing a big trade partner . 
  or the number one reason china , saudi arabia and other authoritarian hostile nations have gotten so much powerful in the past half a decade . 
  the free market used to be free only for the democratic , peaceful nations . 
  now we cant even hold on to sanctions against warmongering countries who attack their neighbours . 
  `` we lost some money so lets * really * show russia they can do absolutely whatever they want . '', 
  its very hard to assess parties but imo our current president plevneliev was the cleanest one we have had . 
  but we just elected a general with 0 political experience who has unclear ties with the whole political establishment in bulgaria and is a great admirer of russia ... and because he won the government resigned and now nobody wants the mandate to create a new one sooo yeah . 
  the one good thing we had has turned to chaos as well . 
  as is said in the article we need to create an independent anti-corruption body but the more independent it is the more likely it jails the person who creates it . 
  the political scene in bulgaria is a total shit show and 2016 wasnt kind to us either . 
  bulgaria is so homophobic ... 
  even the younger people are mostly homophobic . 
   eu policy is decided by feelings and emotion , rather than logic and objectivity . 
  bullshit biased opinion meter going off the rails on this one . 
  i dont think it affects my point either wise . 
  what i am saying is that nation states where homogeny was sought and mostly achieved have driven superficial bodily differences to form between nations of common races . 
  with how ridiculous some factions have become you really need an / s on even the most unbelievable shit because there will always be someone who will say the same thing but seriously . 
  there were several incidents that got to the frontpage of r/europe when they happened in the weeks after the vote but maybe just google it and youll get the articles .

  but not really relevant to the statistic . 
  31 % are left for that . 
  how is it not relevant ? 
  mrf was sponsored by russia and turkey until the recent developments . 
  now they have split the party . 
  from this moment mrf will remain as russian backed and mestan ( former leader ) will [ create ] ( http://pik.bg/%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d1%81%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0-%d0%bf%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%8f%d1%82%d0%b0-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bd-%d1%81-20-%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b0-news486765.html ) a new party backed by turkey . 
  the same way some of our local parties are sponsored by turkey . 
  it should be considered but it is n't .

  what is going on here . 
  for the last half an year i have been actually thinking this refugee crisis is a blessing in disguise . 
  europe will come out stronger from it . 
  you sound like a rabid anarchist . 
  it is not the fault of the dog if a stupid father is bringing his 3 year old child on foot doing illegal actions . 
  is the image of lawlessness what europe wants to project ? 
  where all regular migration processes are ignored and people are simply allowed to storm in ? 
  what is the point in having them ? 
  how will you feel if you migrate legally and then in 1 year watch as the full shit hole of greedy idiots decide to simply hop the fence ignore all of the rules you played by and worked your ass to pass , and get special treatment ? 
  oh , piss off . 
  their parents should n't be so stupid to illegally cross borders and put their kids in danger . 
  this is the age of 0 personal responsibility . 
  no u, 
   and very little white . 
  should n't progressives/socialists not shame based on race ? 
  balkans are relatively diverse , although most people are pretty slavic . 
  but it 's not like i can convince you of that without showing you around . 
   which is why they must feel super embarassed when even the poorest refugees absolutely reject the idea of staying there . 
  no we do n't . 
  we do n't live to prove to the west that we are some kind of moral authority . 
  we just want to be left alone for once in the past 600 years . 
  besides what sane refugee is going to want to stay here with no government handouts , population that very much dislikes them and a language that is neither close to theirs , nor to english . 
  especially when you consider the extreme handouts offered by the progressive west . 
  your shaming does n't work here man . 
  go back to your nice bubble and stay out of our job . 
  we might have 99 problems but a refugee ai n't one . 
  nope . 
  we just have 0 white guilt . 
  especially the balkans . 
  also people are pretty patriotic around here . 
  even most of the hippies . 
  bleeding hearts are for those that can afford them . 
  the balkans ca n't . 
   i was talking about possible solutions and not what you might consider the most plausible solution . 
  the world has a funny way of not reacting as you might expect it to do . 
  example ? 
  yes , some phd in social sciences would be perfect !, 
  do you claim that this will not happen ? 
  irrelevant !, 
  we are talking about what should be done , and trying to make it possible !, 
  do you claim that it will not work ? 
  hmm , interesting , though i would disagree . 
  there are other countries as examples , you could take look there and , perhaps , try and reproduce what you need . 
  this sounds so smug . 
  do you read after you type something ? 
   do you claim that this will not happen ? 
  irrelevant !, 
  people actually talk like this ? 
   most ter rorists do know a valuable skill . 
  shit , some of them finished or were studying in universities of the uk . 
  if you consider studying in universities does not offer a valuable skill , ok , we disagree . 
  putting words in my mouth with the last sentence . 
  my point was obviously towards those that are not but you make a good argument . 
  if they are educated what more can you teach them ? 
  they sure have a decent understanding of the laws and morals of the society they live in . 
  most of the officers in the nazi army were very intelligent ( past 120 iq some even 140 + ) . 
  how can you reason with an intelligent man that has come to a realization of that sort ? 
  you are going to get him in an argument that he had n't had before ? 
  have you spoken to a truly devout mulsim ? 
  that believes the koran is as is and should be taken literally ? 
  i 've had the displeasure . 
  he always had an answer to justify his belief . 
   really ? 
  in an article concerning uk government and uk islamic terroists ? 
  do uks criminals wear union-jack bandanas ? 
  and why us ? 
  why did n't you mention the mentality of drug offenders in northern albania ? 
  would n't that be equally relevant ? 
  there are other countries as examples , you could take look there and , perhaps , try and reproduce what you need . 
  because it is very relevant . 
  if a group of people develop a different cultural and ethical norm they can justify a lot . 
  for example msulims do n't view some crimes ( like sex with sub 16 girls ) like the west . 
  would you think they would condemn someone that marries a 12 year old girl , or would they condemn the government for throwing him in jail for that ? 
  it is exactly the same . 
  crime and evil are relative to culture . 
   but , in this specific case , probably you are right . 
  you are not a terrorist and you know a skill and you have never been convicted ( i suppose ) and yet you are so close-minded concerning education , law and political change , that i can not expect anything from trying to deal with terrorists . 
  again you sound smug . 
  if you think education is the cure to the worlds problems you have to meet people out of your bubble . 
  people are not inherently good gems waiting to be polished by education , and then simply put in the right way . 
  you are delusional . 
  and who do you think is going to go there and try to educate them ? 
  some ph.d. in social science ? 
   creates the idea of `` some bimbo put there to educate them '' is the reason why `` education in prison '' should be done ( and be taken ) no it is n't . 
  and i do take education in prisons seriously just not the kind you think of . 
  they should be taught a valuable skill - carpentry , welding , plumbing during their time so they can find a job once they are out if they prove they deserve the education . 
  you ca n't simply put a recidivist in a classroom , tell him not all muslim beliefs are good and expect him to say `` hey , i have been blind '' . 
  edit :  i would respect a guy who does not end up with me inside again . 
  there is literally a whole fucking system in american ghettos of the so called street credit for people going to prison . 
  the more you spend there the more you are perceived as superior . 
  you are simply ignorant to human nature .

  i think all plans are fully 4g now, 
  is the new romanian government as bad with the economy as they are with corruption ? 
  asking for a friend, 
  in bulgaria , the top smarthpone plans are 20gb for 35 euro , but you can get a 20gb plan for 12 euro too, 
  great news , until there are elections in wallonia that is, 
  you are saying this as a joke , but high schoolers in bulgaria are huge , bigger that mid age and old people, 
  why , every corrupt politician denies no matter what, 
  then i propose we declare the french language hate speech , as it seems to be the deciding factor, 
  in bulgaria every place you can fit a car is a parking spot, 
  i mean , parking spaces reserved only for rich people seems like a worse alternative, 
  i do n't think such stats exist , bulgaria had to stop recording such things as part of eu joining process, 
  and how much does that matter ? 
  if russia instigates instability in estonia , trump will just call them cucks and say he likes countries that have n't been invaded, 
  sorry but they are very international people so they are your gypsies now . 
  who is n't ? 
  i doubt one can be anti-nuclear in france without being considered to be a lunatic , france relies on it for the majority of electricity, 
  ah that makes perfect sense, 
  oh man , eurobonds and no deficit limit , we 're all gon na be rich !, 
  it will when the republicans have it their way, 
  when the whole world is insane , being sane is a disadvantage, 
  he 's a great troll though , always gets a bunch of replies, 
  i know all the best things about baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , they 're great people , the best people , believe me, 
  the suit is great , trump is just too fat, 
  this seems like great news . 
  employment and wages both rising , with more full time jobs than insecure part time ones added, 
  this list makes no sense . 
  skodas are just cheaper vws these days , yest they are supposed to be far more reliable ? 
  i doubt it . 
  same with citroen and peugoeot not being right next to each other , considering most of their cars are direct equivalents with a different brand, 
  not anymore , automatics have caught up, 
  it never was yours you megalomaniac madman, 
  reeeeeeeeee, 
  then what 's the point ? 
  this is completely unrelated to federalisation, 
  ah , thank you . 
  not that strong of a link , but i 'm not entirely wrong at least, 
  there 's no way anything happens to them in the eu , all european car makers are heavily invested in diesels and have too much influence on almost all countries ,, 
  was n't it owned by chelsea clinton ? 
   my guess is that it would all kick off before anyone questioned what had just happened . 
  honestly , if i knew the other side was that incompetent to let isis dress up and attack me , i 'd declare war instantly as that 's a cerain victory, 
  it is the exact same thing , they do it 12 days later because their church uses the old calendar, 
  are you a dog ? 
  why do you want to someone to lead you on a leash ? 
  they 're $ 1.50 here , fuck, 
  it 's a common expression in bulgaria, 
  then what 's the point of schengen ? 
  thank you for posting this . 
  what i find interesting is that young scandinavians want to leave the eu, 
  numbeo uses numbers from visitors od numbeo.com , it 's completely useless, 
  killing their leader and fuelling a civil war was ok , but turning migrant boats back is impossible ? 
  this is ridiculous, 
  no , that was also russia, 
  we have none of those and our homicide rate is still much lower, 
  it 's the same in bulgaria , except control is sadly weaker than it should and we get occasionally local outbreaks of some diseases, 
  in a country as diverse as russia , ethnic nationalism is inexcusable, 
  this is good for bitcoin, 
  but they are the populists ... 
  i do n't know how it is in romania but in bulgaria pensioners vote for the party that stole the pension funds multiple times, 
  damn , trump was right on how bad that show is, 
  it 's also a thing in bulgaria , except we eat it on the 6th of december, 
  it was a train carrying lpg , five confirmed dead , some are with heavy injuries so this is expected to rise, 
   rt 's rooting for fillon but why would russia abandon le pen ? 
  i 'd love to , actually , and have an open invitation from relatives there , and may go for a little vacation if i can afford it next year, 
  i love your optimistic outlook on almost everything, 
  2008-11 was a period of very heavy austerity here , so i 'm not surprised . 
  i think it 's been going up lately although the increase is quite slow, 
  you 're just bitter because they 're funny and you 're not, 
  then you 'll be mostly ok . 
  i 'd be much more worried about the thousands of kilometers of steppes in asia than any part of europe on your trip , not many places to rest there if you walk, 
  it 's pretty big , you 'll get tired, 
  seems like a good time to buy dollars then, 
  reddit , being almost all text , still works great on throttled internet as long as you do n't try to load images, 
  because they are not dying out , only companies like htc and nokia , who kept thinking overpriced crap would sell, 
  the winners are the customers who get great phones at very low prices, 
  they still exist , unlike nokia 's smartphone division, 
  erdogan is right on this , the way so many eu politicians actively try to damage relations is dangerous and undermines us-eu ties, 
  nah , that 's the prime minister , he also likes russia and gave putin a puppy once so he 's also cool, 
  our new president is literally stalin ( except he 's bald and thinks stalin was too liberal ) so hopefully our relations improve, 
  except we all know that austria 's election is extremely close , as they had an actual election already, 
  from what i 've heard from north bulgarians , your drivers are decent until they get in bulgaria , then they become insane, 
  also older cars that are more likely to malfunction and have less safety features, 
  do n't delude yourself , absolutely nobody cares about the opinion of countries their size, 
  so , this is the cheapest advertisment and publicity he can get , right ? 
  sounds like a great deal for him, 
  libertatian utopia when ? 
  i 'm on mobile so i ca n't link it , but there 's an article about this on there , and it basically says that policy wise , very little will change . 
  i 'm inclined to agree with them, 
  too late for most places east of the berlin wall , sadly, 
  well , our situation is much dumber , as unlike erdogan , our guy resigns at the first opportunity and then wins the elections again, 
  so what will greece do when they leave the euro , keep their hundreds of billions of debt in euros , and get all their revenue in heavily devalued drachmas ? 
  i 'm tired of this country being borisov 's personal circus , it would be the peak of stupidity if he gets elected ever again , after he keeps showing he does n't want to govern , he just wants to win elections and brag about it, 
  then you 'll be disappointed as he is pro-eu just like any non-fringe politician, 
  he was asked at a campaign event and you ca n't just say no at those so he gave a conclusive non answer, 
  with 240 districts , we 're going to get so many weirdos in parliament, 
  make sure to save money so you can go to italy, 
  walking next to a busy street without shortening my life by 6 months would be cool too . 
   the stock of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles represented 0.15 % of the 1.4 billion motor vehicles on the world 's roads by the end of 2016 , up from 0.1 % in 2015 from wikipedia ices still have a very long time left to live,

  northwestern bg - poor as fuck , we have crazy accent and unless you have c2 profiency in bulgarian you 'll hardly understand us . 
  people tend to look like terminators and if you see somebody smiling he 's : 1 . drunk 2 . with mental problems . 
  swearing and screaming for even the smallest things here is pretty normal . 
  we have tons of gypsies and if you are slightly more richer you can use them as cheap labor force or even as slaves ( eg you just bought 5t bricks/sand/cement / whatever but you 're too lazy to move them from point a ot b - no problems !, 
  for 20 leva our gypsies will move everything while you sit and watch them ( just do n't forget to feed them ) politics - we are kinda left leaning and there 's strong `` everything was better when zhivkov ruled bg '' sentiment . 
  also talking shit about russia ( does n't matter putinist/soviet/tsarist ) is n't well recieved . 
  its ok to be gay in the big cities not so much outside of them .

  you 're free to have your own opinion . 
  well if ` buying ' gypsies for 20lv . 
  and 5 kebabcheta is n't manipulation ... keep believing in that `` democracy thing '', 
  a family member who worked on the last elections told me its more than easy to manipulate the elections . 
  probably that 's why the vote turnout was 45 % and over 50 % did n't vote . 
  poll results are n't that hard to manipulate tho i can find a thousand people who like russia and my results will be 85 % pro-russian support , 15 % pro-us and in corrupt country like bulgaria i can show my `` poll results '' on tv . 
   most bulgarians want to be allies with the us i 'm not so sure about this .

  i can say and prove there are many comments under articles not only connected with the situation in ukraine , but also under completely random articles , that are product of political propaganda . 
  many of them are copy-pasted , many are basically the same , in bulgarian they 're called like ... `` points '' propaganda points . 
  and i 'm not even into all the conspiracy shit , this is just obvious .

  the british should be `` afraid '' of the gypsies that already bring to bulgaria literally many millions of their money by stealing . 
  and not that much of the bulgarians that work and help keeping the economy going , 
  because there is space-space-space and all kinds of native ( so to speak ) cultures - even a lot of muslims ... 
  btw how 's the question about `` refugees '' going to switzerland ?

  are they not letting them in ? 
  how would the germans do it , if they , god forbids were refugees somewhere - they will get on strict queues , women and children first . 
  everything would be done easier , faster , quieter and without any problems . 
  that 's why i love that country even if i 've never been there .

  it 's pretty rarely produced , it 's a delicacy and it 's fcking tasty , absolutely pure and clean meat , i 'm not joking . 
  i 've tried a couple of times and mixed with pork it 's amazing . 
  greetings , macedonia !, 
  deer meat , 
  shhht , do n't tell that guy about south korea ... 
  is n't that somehow racist ? 
  if someone writes whatever article about `` you do n't have to be a black american ... '' or something he would get the full rage of so many people . 
  dude , if you bless me in such a manner i would be scared as fck . 
  send the fckin ' army , it seems they will be the only institution that could have some control, 
  soo ... the men do n't stay with their wives and children because ... germany ? 
  well said ... that 's another factor - the languages are from completely different family so they fave different structure , grammar , rules , alphabet and so on ... for an englishman it would be easier to learn german language ( and for a german - to learn english ) , i suppose this situation is similar to making and organizing a million germans learn arab . 
  you see ... the percent of literacy is indeed important , but more important is the fact that almost none of the coming immigrants speaks german . 
  somehow everybody forgets this fact . 
  to be honest , i do n't speak german too , but if , on theory , i want to immigrate to germany i would myself organize/pay and so on for my lessons and `` integration '' so to speak , as it is ( probably ) required for me to do so . 
  germany is social country but i think that would be the case . 
  now , if someone could explain to me how learning german could happen for these people ... and if someone says - language courses . 
  well ... okay ... organize language courses - teachers , rooms/schools for the courses , money for the teachers and so on , for a million immigrants , till they reach level at least a2 or b1 , hoping all of them would wish to learn . 
  let 's see how this could happen . 
  50 shades of jihad, 
  hm , i 'm interested in what provoked the police to fire rubber bullets ? 
  hope no one thinks the police started firing just for fun ... 
  oooooooohh - so fre-kt, 
  bulgaria - we suck balls at football . 
  every team beats us . 
  edit . 
  - oh , wait , it 's not just that week . 
  idiocy comes in many forms , 
  dude , with all my respect for your beautiful countries , i tried to watch the video but could n't watch it till the end because i know the things said in the video are right . 
  so , with all my respect i would slap your countries for being such ... such ... pff ... ca n't find the words . 
  such an amazing social and beautiful countries ... and being stupid . 
  and that 's a foreigner saying it , not a nationalist from sweden or finland ... 
  lol , sweden :d ps . 
  i made a thread in the subreddit of sweden talking a lot and explaining the organized criminal `` business '' of getting beggars from bulgaria ( and most probably the same way with the romanian ones ) and taking them to sweden so they can beg for money . 
  it 's all organized by criminals because there they get a loooot of money . 
  the beggars themselves make a lot of money and here build big houses and drive expensive cars . 
  these people have never worked and say `` we are not crazy to start working when we can make such money just sitting on the street '' . 
  these `` beggars '' get there in nubers - by cars or even orginized by small buses . 
  and i 'm not kidding about it .

  but i think we should be proud that we 're ones of the very few that reduced their emmissions in the last 25years . 
  it 's very surprising to me that developed countries with high standard of living like australia , canada , south korea havent managed to emit less , while the eu has seen a drop of 21 % . 
  lol , as always we 're the leaders in the `` dont know , dont care '' cathegory . 
  it 's better than hating on lgbt peps , but this mass indifference isnt a very good thing imo . 
  do you know the history of macedonia and how it was created ? 
  amazing, 
  thats not true . 
  the eu and us/uk are so intertwined economically , socially and whatnot , that any harm to the eu and its citizens is also harm to the us/uk and their citizens . 
  any competition between all of us is only in the interest of populist and irresponsible leaders , but its not in the interest of uk/us/eu people . 
  china is still a communist country . 
  we only see the face of cheap manufacturing of goods and big businesses on the east coast , but we have no idea what 's going on there . 
  the hungarian girl is very cute , but needs some body . 
  too skinny . 
  this is such a crime against his own people . 
  he basically tried to do a tiananmen square square on them , and if he had more power , would 've done it . 
  its one more example that those in power , who are `` pro-russia '' , are very much `` anti-their own country '' . 
  i love the quote from the daniel bernmar guy : `` the richer we become , the more we need to take advantage of that wealth in other ways than through a newer car or higher consumption . '' our productivity in the last couple of hundred years has never stopped rising , and it will continue to rise due to different innovations and technological improvements . 
  if you have more money than you need , do you keep buying new phones and new cars every 6months so you can spend it ? 
  there 's only so much that money can buy - our real resource is time . 
  and as wealth increases and when productivity can afford it - so should work day shorten and free time increase . 
  this is part of the atlas of prejudice , if anyone is curious . 
  you can google it for more stuff like this . 
  it 's curious to me that germany has a higher opinion of other countries in general . 
  the only above 90 % approvals are on germany 's map . 
  in other words taking money out of people 's pockets to fund his nationalistic and world power dreams . 
  i dont know how putin gets praised again and again for ` putting russia on the map ' , when its the russian people who are paying for all his whims and wishes , and they are paying dearly . 
  the guy is as much a threat to russians as he is to all of us . 
  if russia was a democratic country he 'd be gone from power years ago . 
  what 's so weird about that ? 
  when russia invades you and forcefully installs 45 + years of communism , that halts any development that you had , you might not be very happy about that . 
  people think that the progress differences between western and eastern europe just randomly happened . 
  we have to know our history , its 2016 peps . 
  i did n't have a good idea of those events . 
  that was very interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  that subreddit smells so much of someone paying to simulate activity , that its funny close to zero comments on most threads , yet new threads are made hourly . 
  on top of that its the best looking subreddit i 've seen . 
  yep , tottaly not funded by anyone . 
  we really need more and mass education . 
  too many elections get decided by rural and low-educated people being decieved by populism . 
  i 'm curious about that also . 
  california will probably blow everyone else out of the water . 
  so why is this guy saying something that benefits erdogan only ? 
  why excuse erdogan 's actions with the manipulative `` dont mind us what we do , but think of the people '' ? 
  if the guy was smart or real opposition he would use the situation to chew , burn down , trash any political legitimacy erdogan has , since its erdogan 's post-coup crackdown that forced eu 's hand and did all this . 
  and what is more , stopping turkey 's accession is completely the opposite of punishing 80million people , it is protecting 80million people . 
  if anything , the eu is safeguarding turkish people 's interests by showing to the turkish government that overthrowing the rule of law and disrespecting civil rights will not fly . 
  those that are losing from the situation are erdogan and his government . 
  they will now be known as those , under whom turkey 's eu accession talks stopped . 
  so what this guy is saying , is helping noone but erdogan . 
  that and the fact that he 's been allowed to exist as opposition amidst that massive crackdown of everyone and their mother . 
  it shows to me that he 's nothing more than a ` puppet opposition ' putin style . 
  it 's not about aligning . 
  it 's about the truth . 
  if you ca n't condemn a country that has invaded another one and started a war there , how are you fit to join the eu ? 
  you might be right about the origin of the word ` igoumen ' . 
  orthodox religious titles used by all countries were probably the same and i wont be surprised if they came from ancient greek . 
  but the town still has the slavic suffix - itsa or - ica in there . 
  a ton of names in slavic countires have it . 
  igoumenitsa means a female ` igoumen ' or a female abbot or the wife of the abbot in bulgarian . 
  it 's a slavic name . 
  its curious that slavs went so far south there . 
  sweden gon na have problems with so many muslims unless they 're integrated and ` under control ' . 
  nato or no nato , the us already spends a ton on military . 
  even in the years after the 90s when nato was obsolete , the us was still spending a ton on military . 
  it seems like military spending there is a regular part of the economy . 
  would eu countries taking a bigger share of the nato budget mean that the us will be spending less on military ? 
  or was it another one of trump 's `` they are taking our money '' ? 
  edit : for anyone curious , google gives me [ this ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/how-military-spending-affects-economy.asp ) on what and why the us spend on military, 
  i got no idea , but i guess that 's one of the basic questions of a military alliance , organization , union etc. 
  ( or any organization for that matter ) we 'll have to see how 's its done in nato . 
  well , the sanctions are a fact . 
  everyone supported them . 
   the army being an entirely eu controlled force instead of being individual countries controlling their own forces not really . 
  do we have any info that it will be like that ? 
  and we all agree about russian sanctions - some may have different opinions cause of economic relations with russia , but in the end everyone supports the sanctions , cause the threat is the same to everybody . 
  do we have any info if an eu army will be any different from nato in how decisions are made ? 
  and despite having different opinions , in the end we all agree about russia . 
  security threats are the same for everyone - terrorism , russia , immigration , piracy , etc. 
  it 's the same with nato . 
  controlled by many countries , yet i dont hear someone saying that german people have been forced into anything by others . 
  this is why its called a military alliance . 
  all members ' interests are taken in consideration , all members have a voice and they come out with a common stance . 
  nobody forces anyone with anything . 
  why do we act like german people 's interests , especially in security , are different from mine and yours ? 
  if nato/eu army has made a decision , chances are it 's for the security of everyone . 
  the whole idea that having an eu army will somehow make countries lose soveriegnty in the area of security , is ridiculous . 
  and the eu is n't some obscure unknown insitution . 
  it is the countries themselves . 
  it is germany . 
  how is an eu army different from nato ? 
  does someone else decide for germany and it 's citizens if , when and where they send troops now ? 
  this is good news . 
  first step towards no more energy dependence on russia . 
  now if we could only elect a pro-bulgarian , instead of a pro-russian president today . 
  pretty much all of the printed media is owned by guy from the muslim party , who suddenly and inexplicably became rich among a wave of corruption . 
  you can say all of the `` serious '' newspapers are toiler paper - biased reporting in favor of the communists and the muslim party . 
  the big question is how do you improve press freedom , when all of it is owned and monopolized by some mafia guy ? 
  we 're way too bent on having absolute top grades in school , that it puts so much stress and pressure on kids . 
  i remember reading about north california having one of the highest suicide rates among teens ( despite being among the top in the world in quality of life ) , and pressure from parents to perform in school was cited as one of the reasons .

  that 's a little smaller than our pm 's , so he is n't unpopular considering most of our politicians can barely get a 20 % approval rating , let alone larger than that . 
  there are only a few who have it . 
  i bet mugs like these you can find everywhere in the world , no matter the place . 
  there will always be some deranged people that do this kind of stuff , that does n't mean anything . 
  i do n't like such cups on display , nor do i approve of them being sold , however neither i , nor anyone else i imagine , would kill or hurt a shopkepper just because they are sold , most people would just pass them without caring . 
  that 's not evidence of anything . 
  edit : also , most people here ca n't distinguish russians and russia itself , so you have a larger support than it is in actuality just because they see russians as `` brothers '' , but not the russian state or government as a whole . 
  if you 've make a poll about how supportive the people here are of putin and the russian government , i guarantee you it will be a lot smaller . 
  that 's extremely unaccurate , tbh . 
  no , the vast majority of bulgaria does n't even give a fuck about russia , let alone be supportive of them . 
  borisov has levitated between europe and putin mainly because he is scared of putin . 
  i think the 2013 protests against his first government have taken the fear out of him . 
  the other reason is that he is former commie that 's pro-eu mainly because they are the ones that give the money from which he builds his projects . 
  the president does n't have a 7 % approval rating , that 's absurd . 
  if he did , he would have been kicked out of office a long time ago . 
  ?! `` gallup '' ?!, 
  bulgaria is extremely biased in its polls and it 's showing . 
  it 's just a bulgarian ( by bulgarian i mean they stole the name from the american one for legitimacy ) organization that tries to manipulate public perception , there is no truth in their polls . 
  in truth , most of bulgaria does n't care about russia , the rest do n't really like russia and prefer the eu and you have a small part of bulgaria that likes russia ( mainly bydlos and villagers . ) . 
  then you have the internet trolls paid by russia or russian-backed bulgarian parties that flood the forums and make it appear like the people are supportive of them , but as i said , those are paid shills . 
  who is this 4chan person ? 
  no , he is n't . 
  the anti-corruption act , the judicial reform , the education reform , the interior ministry act ... all nada . 
  there is not a single thing he has done correctly . 
  is he better than bsp , lutvi , stanishev and oresharski , oh yeah , absolutely , but that bar is set prettttttty low . 
  listen here mate , i know what you mean and i absolutely agree with you , i want us to be like switzerland and ireland , to be neutral and be wealthy , but our neighbors would never allow that , especially russia . 
  they have been trying to make us a vassal for more than a century now and they wo n't stop until that happens . 
  let 's look at it this way : distancing ourselves from our allies will only lead to disaster and make us an easier target for the russians . 
  you think the russians give a fuck , if we are neutral ? 
  no , they do n't . 
  they proved it numerous times in our history , the last time was when they occupied us even though we did n't send a single soldier against them . 
  and as much as you do n't like the states , they have guaranteed our freedom without asking anything in return but our friendship . 
  and distancing ourselves from them and the rest of our allies will only lead us back to a place where we really do n't want to go back to , we 've seen it already . 
  we are in nato , how can we be neutral ? 
  do you see us surrounded by friendly nations like france , germany and italy like switzerland is ? 
  we are surrounded by turkey and russia , two nations that want to control us , so we ca n't be neutral in any way . 
  there is absolutely no other way but to cut all ties with russia . 
  this is n't war mongering or anything , it 's a simple fact . 
  the whole country is lagging behind romania becuase the romanians cut all russian influence from their country while we let russians dictate us what to do because we 're too scared to do anything . 
  we let them have their companies here pay no taxes , we let their corrupt parties and ds agents in parliament , and we let them do absolutely anything they want here just because we 're too scared to `` hurt their feelings '' . 
  oh , boo hoo , i 'm sick and tired of russia dragging us through the mud since our independence and everyone here portraying them as some kind of a brotherly nation when they are absolutely no different to us than turkey is . 
  do n't let me get started on history , we 've played nice with the russians since our independence and what did we get ? 
  they spat in our faces numerous times , and they continue to spit at us which makes some people here think it 's raining . . what are we winning with our niceness ? 
  they are rolling around us , doing whatever they like and we keep losing because people like you just ca n't get it together . 
  you want a peaceful world where we are neutral and everything ? 
  well , so do i , but our world is n't perfect in any way . 
  putin shill , please leave . 
  terrible pm . 
  kill me , ffs . 
  coming from greece that does n't mean much but i 'll take it . 
  ok , we get it , brexit is leading . 
  do we need to have 5 threads about it on the front page every single day ? 
  our pm is a fucking joke . 
  this government is nearing it 's end , i can feel it . 
  no one . 
  this should have been done long time ago . 
  well , better late than ever , i guess . 
  how ? 
  by receiving the biggest share out of the eu budget ? 
  and i cringe from people like you . 
  do n't know why you 're even using the eu flag . 
  heard the loudest thunder in my life the other day ( sofia , bulgaria ) , like an atomic bomb dropping over my head . 
  they certainly have a minus since they are still paying , however for some reason they are n't shown on the map ( probably because they are outside the eu ), 
  romania makes me sad , and when i see ireland , i 'll probably fall into a deep depression . 
  well ... sweden is very progressive . 
  then why is he opening his mouth , if he has nothing to say ? 
  the conditions are clear , there is no point in talking about it . 
  the problem is , his opinion about the sanctions will be twisted to a certain degree by russian medias , and they will make it appear that he wants the sanctions to fall , which is not helping the eu unity on this issue at all . 
  even this article 's headline is misleading, 
  apparently you 're looking at data from 2014 since that 's when our ppp was 16,000 . 
  last year , as you said , was actually 17,869 . 
  as i said , try to educate yourself a little before entering discussions you have no information on . 
  furthermore , i have absolutely no agenda here and it 's not patriotic or anything , i just know more than you about bulgaria 's economy , and you probably know more about the austrian economy than me . 
  it 's that simple . 
  newly registered and already spouting so much bullshit . 
  did they ban you or something ? 
  you 're either baiting here or extremely delusional . 
  yeah , what a `` coincidence '' . 
  that 's kind of unfair . 
  the nominal gdp per capita of bulgaria is 8,000 last year while the gdp ppp is around 20,000 . 
  the ppp of denmark is 42,000 . 
  i do n't know if you gave these false statistics on purpose or you simply did n't know , but here . 
  are you a spice merchant by any chance ? 
  yeah , i do n't see the uk exiting , but juncker certainly does n't help, 
  i really doubt 6,000 people can speak for 700 million . 
  the number is wayyyyyyy too small to conduct a useful poll . 
  what 's the general opinion of macedonians towards bulgaria ? 
  has anything changed in these past years ? 
  actually , i think that was from old vmro 's ( imro ) motto '' \u0421\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442 '' which translates `` freedom or death '' . 
  yeah , from what i remember spain had lika 23 % unemployment 1 year ago . 
  this is a big improvement . 
  finally . 
  pretty excited for this if i 'm to be honest . 
  will be interesting to find out what happens to both the eu and britain . 
  how are we so far behind ? 
  we have the lowest taxes in eu , if i 'm not wrong . 
  bet it 's the judicial system and the corruption that comes from it . 
  who the fuck cares what erdogan says ? 
  the bulgarian empire was called and empire because simeon received that title from patriarch nicholas and recognized as a fellow emperor by the byzantine empire , the continuation of the roman empire , the originators of the world `` imperator '' . 
  the imperial title was alwys recognized as something rome itself can hold and no other nation and the fact that the byzantine empire recognized bulgaria as an equal was something extraordinary .

  had there been a full balkan union , the yugoslav wars would not have happened . 
  the issue was serbian nationalism . 
  they had no real counterweight after tito died . 
  had even bulgaria been part of yugoslavia , i expect that the outcome would have been much different . 
  but does n't this basically mean that merkel just pissed away 80 billion euros ? 
  wo n't this make it * more * likely she loses her election ? 
  that 's not true . 
  austerity is the equivalent of looking at your wood pile , seeing you only have enough wood for a 1 room house , and building a 1 room house . 
  instead , you could have gone to the forest to chop some extra wood . 
  disagreements in the political process exist . 
  that 's why we have democracy . 
  ca n't read , please ignore . 
  nah , to be serious , i think turkey considering themselves in europe is much better than turkey considering themselves in the middle east . 
  but for all intents and purposes , bulgaria does n't really need that land anyway . 
  who would you rather control it ? 
  bulgaria or turkey ? 
  i think he is scared that germany will buy or control the land , or worse , turkey or bulgaria will buy and control the land . 
  egomaniac with press attention automatically equals prime minister candidate . 
  not necessarily . 
  if the good is prohibitively expensive , and there is no private company with capital enough or reason enough to build it , the port wo n't get built . 
  that 's why we see governments building ports in the developmental part of a countries economy . 
  but i agree that in a developed country that probably wo n't happen , though i 'm not convinced that greeces economy is large enough to support companies who can undertake multi billion dollar infrastructure projects . 
  traitor is the wrong word . 
  people have disagreements , it is part of the democratic process . 
  without them , we would have single party rule . 
  so it is too harsh . 
  rebel is better , or a phrase like , ` has stuck to his anti austerity ideology unlike tsipras ' . 
  you mean germans ? 
  probably because ports are big , expensive , and lead to increased trade by reducing transportation barriers . 
  it 's a classic example of a government providing a public good . 
  usually , it 's the more law abiding citizens that emigrate from bulgaria , to be honest . 
  those that are willing to pay their taxes and are fed up with getting taken advantage from go to other countries , and leave the mess behind . 
  so bulgaria experiences not just a ` brain drain ' but a ` culture and people who will do the right thing ' drain ( could n't think of a word for the other one ) . 
  yes please . 
  with the caveat that this is only for judicial matters , where we need the most help . 
  we do n't have a particularly large debt . 
  just tell him/them that what they are doing is \u0433\u0440\u044a\u0446\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 and shame them into doing the opposite . 
  eh , following communism , bulgaria 's gdp shrank by 35 % and 2 million people emigrated . 
  it would be enough if there were tangible steps taken or at least planned to a better union . 
  federalist a are mad because it seems like europe is heading down the wrong road . 
  first , thanks for the downvote simply for disagreeing . 
  second , schauble would not be able to do anything for our gdp or growth . 
  our fiscal policies have been pretty spot on . 
  what is holding bulgaria back is the lack of an independent judiciary . 
  ( edit : if you want some more reasons why our growth has been anemic - political instability due to protests aimed at our corrupt politicians , russian sanctions , and the greece economic decline . 
  both russia and greece are major trading partners , and the recent years have done no service to the bulgarian economy . ), 
  third , you completely missed the part where i do n't want a foreign technocrat un-elected by the bulgarian people to have this much power over us . 
  the power of democracy comes with the ability to peacefully change those in power if their policies are n't working out . 
  we have n't gotten the democracy part fully right yet , but we 're working on it . 
  and last , your condescending attitude is exactly why so many people are pissed off at the germans these days . 
  i can tell you right now , that bulgarians are currently over 50 % against joining the euro at this point . 
  ( this is is just from reading commentary online and talking to people . ), 
  yes , the lev is basically pegged to the euro , but at least we have the option to devalue without all of this fuss . 
  and i personally do n't want bulgaria in the euro anymore . 
  we suck at our own fiscal policy , but at least i can attempt to vote out of office anyone i do n't like here . 
  i ca n't vote schauble out of office . 
  more importantly , pushing greece out of the eu altogether is now not politically possible or wanted for some reason , if it ever was either . 
  there are european institutions and treaties . 
  but yes , i do mean what you said . 
  maybe the 11th hour white knights of france and italy are going to save the ez and the political project . 
  after all , while germany could go it alone with its export economy , they would fail much worse ... 
  we 're hearing a lot about how greece has lost the trust and credibility . 
  i think rather that germany has lost these now , especially with the two proposals from yesterday . 
  we have found out that both sides are ` kids ' , with no real direction or vision for the future . 
  this crisis has firmly made me into an opponent for the euro in bulgaria . 
  we suck at our own governance and fiscal policy , but at least i can attempt to vote out anyone here i do n't like . 
  i ca n't touch sch\u00e4uble , and relying on a foreign electorate to help me out is not a position i want to be in . 
  end of the euro as a means for integrating europe . 
  sure , it will survive in the netherlands , germany and austria , but that wo n't mean much in the end . 
  the first nails are already in the coffin , with the french valiantly trying to pull them out . 
  the truth is that the eu and eurozone have now lost the trust of member states , and the respect external actors like the u.s. and russia . 
  the media and popular opinion are playing catch up , but unless we pull a miracle out of our ass today , i do n't see the eurozone surviving . 
  value of the euro would plunge , making europe poorer overnight . 
  yes , you 'd get growth due to a weaker currency , but the market always over corrects , so the initial shock will be quite severe . 
  not in the eurozone . 
  tomorrow we will see how the non eurozone countries ( including greece 's neighbors ) stand . 
   i 've also been noticing lately that people from diaspora are way more nationalistic than the people living here . 
  yup , same for bulgarians . 
  you are completely right in that it was a political decision , just like it is a political decision to keep so many dialects of german under the banner ` german ' , or that keeps swedish and danish as separate languages . . 
  i think macedonian language/dialect does , or at least did , have speakers in bulgaria / greece as well . 
  macedonian is a prime example of how a language can become it 's own after being backed by an army . 
  and here i was thinking about how overstated the amount of bulgarian is in turkey . 
  just because someone in a position of authority says something , does n't mean it 's true . 
  and we should always question things , and not take them for granted . 
  that said , i am not familiar deeply with the events in question , so i ca n't say anything one way or the other . 
  oh , i 'm sure - that area is probably the most diverse in europe . 
  i ca n't believe they named their stadium after stoichkov !, 
  any [ banat bulgarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banat_bulgarians ) still around there ? 
  dialect does n't mean that they have to be incomprehensible to each other . 
  for example , in bulgarian , probably the most common dialectal difference is ` eh ' to ` ya ' ( \u0435 , \u044f ) . 
  this is really common , and words like milk can be said either ` mleko ' or ` mlyako ' ( \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e , \u043c\u043b\u044f\u043a\u043e ) , the second being the official version of the word . 
  despite seeming minor , this is still a dialectal difference , as the first is common in western bulgaria , and the second in eastern bulgaria , around tarnovo , where the official dialect came from . 
  romania has been standardizing the language since the early 18th century . 
  they used to use the cyrillic alphabet , probably since the invention of the cyrillic alphabet , but phased it out and completely replaced it by the 1830s . 
  there are always dialects . 
  there are plenty of examples of villages and small towns still using borrowed bulgarian words , whereas the in the larger cities people have replaced them with more romance sounding words . 
  vidin speaks romanian ?? 
  hahaha . 
  you can maybe find 1.5 people there that speak romanian . 
  funny how it 's not even listed as a bilingual area just a straight up romanian speaking area .

   becoming a dictatorship venezuela has been a dictatorship since the begining of the 21st century century , it 's not becoming one just now . 
  these maps always fucking bundle several regions of bulgaria along with sofia , so we ca n't get our own tiny , dark-green island like the rest of eastern europe . 
  1 . procedures were not followed in selecting contractors . 
  2 . eu regulations required that the pipe is owned by the local country and can be used by others ( to promote free market principles ) and in any direction ( to reduce the dependency on individual countries ) . 
  russians demanded the pipe is used only by then , only for russian gas , 1 direction only . 
  this was non-negotiable for them and ultimately lead to them cancelling the project . 
  because it would be paid for mostly by the bulgarian state , and would benefit mostly the russian state ( since buglaria would not be allowed to use it in any way ) . 
  this is without even taking into account the knock-on effects from corruption . 
   they 're pretty nationalistic nationalistic socialists in germany ? 
  worrying . 
  little detail not mentioned - south stream was in blatant breach of eu regulations and blatantly against bulgarian interests . 
  when asked for a more balanced and less illegal deal , the russians backed off immediately instead of negotiating in good faith . 
  in comparison , nord stream is only of questionable legality and only slightly against long-term geman interests ( it still should not be allowed ) . 
  the same thing they have been working hard on since the election - completely isolate poland from all neighbours and allies . 
   which kind of enemy are you preparing against ? 
  there are several agressive neighbours and globabl threats to worry about , while most of the eu is effectively disarmed , barely able to maintain and operate tiny expeditionary forces , let alone wage a defensive war or any other large-scale operation . 
   nato already by far outspends any potential enemy merely `` outspending '' a potential enemy is not enough , especially if some of those `` potential enemies '' cook the books to mask their actual spending , or get cheaper military production due to a more centralised state and less concern with citizens ' welfare . 
   i think france , usa and britain have a much too high military budget . 
  of these , only the usa has a reliably functional military . 
  by your example , we should be aiming at the usa 's ~ 3.3 % of gdp spending instead of merely ~ 2 %, 
  somebody got drunk and smoked in the ammo dump . 
  or somebody sold 30 % of the ammo on the black market and and inspection was due soon . 
  feta is uniquely greek though . 
  bulgarian white cheeese have a completely different ( and superior ) taste . 
   assault rifle that melts i tacitly agree with your overal sentiment , but this is widely known to be bulshit . 
  the rifle does not `` melt '' , it merely overheats and loses accuracy when subjected to tests intended for fucking machine guns . 
  most assault rifles would not even survive the test , merely overheating is actually an achievement . 
  amazon.de usually ships the german version of products ( in german , clumsy censorship , higher quality packaging ) which might not be what everybody is looking for . 
  evil eu keeps trying to force members to curb corruption and respect rule of law . 
   why would you even admit ... ? 
  trump knows his target audience and voter base . 
  what a weird situation . 
  dairy prices are through the roof ( cheese is literally more expensive than pork , chicken and lamb in many countries ) . 
  farmers complaining that the market price for ( cows ' ) milk is so low it 's driving them out of business . 
  and at the same time we 're running out of butter . 
  looking at bulgaria , i 'd say this map does not take into account whether the tanks are actually in working condition . 
  reminds me of those photo-galleries of north korea . 
  everything is so glossy and obviously arranged to look good . 
  the only hint of how bad things were is the complete backwardness of the rural areas . 
  that 's some 19th century stuff . 
  nah , at least 40 % of the people will support them against the evil eu , 10 % wo n't care , and at least 5 % will just leave the country ( thereby cementing pis eternal majority ) . 
  it 's actually `` a valley elevated only 500 + meters '' for natives . 
   watch the polish govt . 
  change their tune now . 
  you 're assuming they 're not actually aiming for article 7 . 
  the territories were at least partially depopulated , like any border area that was subjet to raiding . 
  whether the remaining population was majority slav or romaion was up to debate i guess . 
   the bulgarians get their name from the volga bulgars the bulgars that settled near the danube did not come from the volga territories.both the buglar state of the balkans and the bulgar state of the volga territories were ofshoots ( rump states ) of an earlier bulgar state . 
   they call themselves tatars nowadays the russian government calls them that as part of suppressing their cultural identity . 
   ohrid ( city in modern day fyr macedonia ) was the capital of the first bulgarian empire it was only the capital for a while during the last days of the 1st buglarian state , when the capital of tarnovo was already lost . 
  and before tarnovo , pliska used to be the capital . 
  tarnovo was also the capital of the 2nd bulgarian state ( the tsarevets ruins are from that period ) . 
  ohrid was a regional capital and a very important center of learning . 
   bulgaria was thracian before it got conquered by the bulgars . 
  by the time the bulgar reached the territories of present-day bulgaria , those lands were no longer thracian . 
  they were nominally part of the ( eastern ) roman empire , but in reality the romaion were driven out by slav raiding . 
  most likely the lands were heavily depopulated and settled by slav chiefdoms . 
   north dobruja was originally part of bulgaria but then got conquered by romania . 
  north dobruja was never part of the modern bulgarian state . 
   bulgaria first lost contemporary fyr macedonia after stefan dushan defeated them in the battle of velbazhd . 
  buglaria 1st lost that territory when conquered by the eastern roman empire . 
  of course , it also used to be romaion territory before it even became bulgarian . 
   the second bulgarian empire got conquered by the ottomans and then become partially independent in the early 20th century . 
  it became fully independent as the kingdom of bulgaria after winning the first balkan war against the ottomans . 
  the modern buglarian state was initially liberated near the end of the 19th century ( 1878 ) . 
  it achieved unification with eastern rumelia ( most of present-day southern bulgaria ) after mass local revolts in 1885 and immediately had to defend it - not against the ottoman empire that until that point nominally held eastern rumelia , but against serbian imperial ambitions ( backed by austro-hungarian interests ) . 
  greece also declare war but , lacking a common border , did nothing . 
   started the second balkan war because they wanted fyr macedonia but lost a lot of territory there . 
  they tried to reclaim that territory in ww2 but failed . 
  the balkan wars were the greatest diplomatic and strategic series of blunders in modern bulgarian history . 
  the main reason bulgaria entered the 1st buglarian war was to recover the bulgarian-majority territories in parts of macedonia and southern thracia . 
  but the bulgarian claims were not secured by proper treaties , so after the war , those territories were split between greece and serbia . 
  still dizzy from the amazing wins during the 1st war , and ignoring the massive losses suffered as well as the logistical and numerical problems with their plan , the buglarian government decided to start a war against its former allies , leading to further territorial loss . 
   ex-communist state . 
  commies and their stooges are still in power . 
  the current pm served in the state security and was later a bodyguard for todor zhivkov ( the former communist dictator ) . 
   the cyrillic alphabet was invented by the bulgarian brothers cyril and methodius . 
  the cyrillic aplhabet was developed by their students in bulgaria , but cyril and methodius were ( most likely ) not bulgarian . 
   there is a region in bulgaria unofficially called pirin macedonia , but the people from there do n't call themselves macedonians . 
  they consider themselves bulgarian in terms of nationality and macedonians in terms of regional identiy . 
  see also greek macedonia . 
   bulgarian and slavic-macedonian are mutually intelligible . 
  not as much anymore . 
  when the modern macedonia state was created by the communists , one of the goals was to create a new identity and new language wholly separate from their bulgarian roots ( because bulgarians had , time and again , shown themselves as too uppity for the liking of russians ) . 
  so it started very close , but soon will probably be harder to understand than serbian . 
   they use the lev instead of the euro . 
  but the bgn is pegged to the eur ( it used to be pegged to the dm ), 
  it was only true of two specific generations and is ( hopefully ) dying out now . 
  pis ( pretends to ) hate russia because the opposite would be political suicide , but are in large part doing putin 's bidding . 
  i 'm still bewildered by people equating left and liberal , considering a large part of left-wing ideologies are strongly anti-liberal . 
   in fact the moderate left ( for example the social democrats which gabriel is a member of ) and the far left have a historically really bad relationship . 
  it 's almost like the left-right split is an unhelpful oversimplification . 
  cancel a demo of 20.000 people because 1 % of them are assholes ? 
  the usual thing to do with provocateurs and arsonists is rough them up and hand them over to the police . 
  that is , assuming you really are interested in peaceful demonstrations and those really are a small minority of provocateurs . 
  the eu does operate under a consensus model , and nobody was `` pressganged '' . 
  they are not telling anyone anything but to adhere to international agreements they 've signed and respect their own laws . 
  it 's not their job to take over the duties of national government or fix their messes . 
  and even though parts of the eu would like to do more , it is an alliance , and specific members ( the ones that complain the loudest ) blocked everything , because they need to use an external threat to use as distraction and the evil eu to use as an excuse . 
   it 's also the rest of europe 's problem too though i absolutely agree , but the whole thing is only even an issue because national governments are being stupid and short-sighted about it .

  other countries simply started having a bigger share of the pie , the same way europe accounts for less and less of the global gdp today with the rise of other developing nations . 
  i also do n't get how the the indian example goes against anything i said . 
  australia - a british colony with european majority versus india with pretty much no europeans left . 
  which one is a success and which is n't . 
  or you are trying to claim that india without colonization would be having 20-30 % ofc current day gdp ? 
  i hope that is not the point you are trying to make as it would be laughable . 
  what is the point you are trying to make ? 
  how can you sprout such uneducated shit when you can just open basic stuff like wikipedia and get the facts for yourself ? 
  uruguay , chile , mexico and columbia are gargantuan failures but somehow the french african colonies are not ? 
  you are clueless . 
  the worst french colonies are worse than the worst spanish ones and the same goes when we compare the best . 
  there are pretty much no french people left in africa , while the population of countries like argentina is of more than 90 % european descent . 
  the best british colonies are the ones with the biggest amount of people of european heritage . 
  wan na compare the best spanish colonies to the rest ? 
  you can follow the percentage of amerindians . 
  and before some retard jumps like a monkey screaming racism , the results have nothing to do with skin colour and everything to do with culture . 
  so indonesia and algeria are doing better than argentina ? 
  good to know . 
  as far as politically incorrect facts go , the colonies doing better are the ones that have less of the native population left . 
  take that as you wish . 
  well it 's normal . 
  first , we do n't really give a fuck about mexican food and second we do n't really have many mexicans here . 
  thread about germans and refugees ? 
  have to whine about the british !, 
  do n't they have like a kit kat special store ? 
  [ dat logo doe . 
  ] ( http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/no-slug/d49809d0146c7dbdcfbc5e25d90c63a7.jpg ), 
  so at the end of the day you say you would fuck off as well ? 
  i dont say i disagree with you ( i would do the same in that situation , except for the fact that i would n't move to such a country in first place ) but you are basically confirming that you will leave . 
  i mean he is from belgium . 
  do n't think he would notice any change . 
  yes in accordance to the wishes of the person while he was alive . 
  when you are dead it does not matter . 
  i cant believe you are talking about incoherent mess . 
  and the state not letting people claiming corpses has nothing to do with your presumed rights of dead people but with the eventual anarchy that will come from the lack of state protection . 
  by getting his will enacted on people who are alive . 
  that is why they exist . 
  the will is relevant only for living people . 
  the dead do n't care get that in your fucking head . 
  if you dont have anyone or anything you would want to mention in your will it becomes completely worthless . 
  the same goes for your body if there is n't anyone who gives a fuck about it after you die . 
  both have to do with the rights of your relatives and people close to you your will and body affect only people who are alive . 
  again , you stop existing the moment you die . 
  i dont think you need to rationalize with that guy . 
  he does not seem to be very bright . 
  that analogy is so dumb people are at risk of getting cancer just by reading it . 
  your body is not yours when you are dead , your house is n't , your money are n't and so on . 
  you do n't have any rights which are to be violated when you are dead . 
  you dont exist . 
  a lifeless body is as much `` you '' as the dump you took this morning . 
  it should be assumed that you dont give a fuck since you dont fucking exist and only if your family gives a fuck about this specific thing they can decide to opt out . 
  i cant fucking believe people write such shit in here . 
   because religion is something recognized as deeply embedded in the personality of people , whereas political views are not . 
  and that needs to fucking change . 
  religion does not deserve any special treatment . 
  no one glorifies the mongols . 
  they did not contribute to art , philosophy , industry , architecture or anything . 
  just a bunch of nomadic horse raiders who left no important legacy after the end of their empire . 
  the case with the ottomans is pretty similar but not as drastic . 
  we still have big corruption and quite a lot of nationalists and big time xenophobes , so shit is still not great . 
  speaking about my country in particular there is also a big dose of anti intellectual cult and easy money obsession proliferated by our infamous chalga culture . 
  so thing are indeed moving forward but we still have some big problems . 
  well that is how reddit works and you seem to be well aware of it . 
  bitching about it does nothing . 
  bitch you are on reddit . 
  every shit on here is an echo chamber , some more drastic some less . 
  the only thing you are mad at is that its not the kind of chamber you like . 
  go to uk politics if you want your decision to be justified and praised . 
  reddit is an interesting place . 
  most nationalistic posts on this sub usually get downvoted yet in this thread its the other way around . 
  that was unexpected . 
  i mean if it 's about contribution you should delete all your comments and close your account . 
  brits whining about it are pretty funny tho . 
  so you compare a political statement , which may or may not have any basis on reality to a completely racist terminology and call it the same . 
  another anecdote for my bag . 
  you can call me when brits and germans start getting called subhumans and get beaten to death on the streets of slovakia , poland and so on . 
  does `` those german subhuman immigrants are making our country shit '' pop up often ? 
  i will take your anecdote to heart and put it in my bag of anecdotes . 
  i like how it has nothing to do with europeans or racism against them , as it was in my claim which you are trying to debunk . 
  i also like how `` everything western '' was a code for american . 
  sheltered , lmao . 
  99 % of people here dont have the `` sheltered '' life that westerners can . 
  and where do you live ? 
  serbia ? 
  a cis country ? 
  first , this is not russia . 
  second , do n't project the western tendencies on eastern europe . 
  we do n't have racist issues against other europeans the way westerners do . 
  beautiful stuff . 
  would love to live in czech rep. in the future . 
  brits talking about colonization is the funniest shit on the internet . 
  and there is no prejudice against blacks and muslims in the west ? 
  the difference is that you just add eastern europeans to the list of hated ones . 
  typical greek thinking it was all about antiquity and the middle ages were all `` dark '' . 
  europe was having a renaissance while we were riding donkeys during the ottoman era . 
  there was never a chance for resurgence after the stagnation while we were under ottomans . 
  it would strengthen the relations between the other eu countries , not strengthen the eu overall . 
  context is not so hard . 
  le german humor . 
  lol indeed .

  also why after they started settling eastwards into slavic lands they took the names of bramborska region into brandenburg , ber\u0142 - berlin , sprjewja river - spree river etc. 
  i 'm not that well versed in the more recent history of the west slavic regions , so i have to ask - does the city you speak of lie east or west of the wendish slavic region of bramborska and the town of ber\u0142 on the sprjewja river ? 
  why are people there considered rude ? 
  the constantinople of turkey . 
  i 'm frankly dumbstruck by the kindergarten geo-politics in the above sentence . 
  got ta screen-shot the entire conversation to use as example . 
  wan na make up your mind ? 
  you ca n't say `` it 's not fine '' , but then `` well they had a reason and we should therefore stop sanctioning them '' . 
  that 's what being `` fine '' with it means you moron !, 
  ah , ok then , military aggression and land acquisition in 21st century europe is fine if there 's a national minority in the actual region being taken . 
  wonderful recipe for peace and stability in our time . 
  i meant by us skilled workers with perfect german , such as it devs or programmers as myself . 
  there are n't anywhere near millions of us looking for work outside of our countries . 
  the entirety of the german it sector - the largest by far in the eu employs barely 930,000 people . 
  in bulgaria there 's 25,000 of us . 
  how are we to pose a `` wave '' of immigrants that would become `` wage-slaves '' as in the belgian guy 's post i see not . 
  i worked precisely in it as a . net dev and had a sallary well above the average for the country , so i ca n't see how even if it did turn out to be less than my colleagues , classified as `` wage-slave '' the kind this guy described would come to germany . 
  nor how is germany supposed to suffer a `` wave '' of such immigrants , as if there were millions of us . 
  because skilled labour demands also a perfect knowledge of german language . 
  we ' r not talking a kebab shop here . 
  you ca n't just get some romanian villager or and indian who knows both perfect german , and has went through university to aquire the set of skills . 
  and if he has , then he would n't settle for little either . 
  uneducated immigrants settle for less , but in germany there 's a minimal wage anyway . 
  skilled workers , like myself when i was in the uk , only go there to work for the actual high sallary you get in those fields , not to be `` wage-slaves '' as you described us . 
  is n't there a minimum wage in germany ? 
  by stable you mean they had two major regions taken from them , one still in de-facto war with the rest of the country . 
  would you call it `` stable '' and not worth sanctions if one of them was pomorze and the other mazury ? 
  federalisation is not the only option for a more integrated europe . 
  people just love dramatic extremes - either leaving completely or becoming a single state . 
  the best option is a golden middle , as with almost all things in life . 
  so instead of answering the questions regarding the reason for the crusades , which was your initial accusation and my problem with your statement , you will just divert towards the actual behaviour of the crusaders now ? 
  fair enough , we saw you 've no knowledge on the circumstances of the start of the crusades , so it 's only logical you would want to change the subject . 
  lets see :  why are we leaving out that cursaders started progrom after progrom hunting down the jews on their way to ` help ' byzantinum because this has zero to do with why the crusades started and what kind of military endevour they were - a simply religiously motivated raid that they thought up one morning , or a justified and logical military response to a continuous invasion by another civilization . 
  such pogroms happened on all campaigns , be it secular or religious in nature , so what do they have to do with us defining if your or my explanation of the reason for the crusades is correct ? 
   suprisingly good , like a minority that recently occupied an area and does n't want it to get with the surrounding hostile majority and throw them out in a high bow ? 
  you continue to make anecdotal guesses based on a lack of knowledge on the subject and a preocupation with modern pop history myths . 
  it 's getting boring . 
  the population of those states was majority greek-speaking christians . 
  that of the kingdom of jerusalem was a majority greek or arab speaking christians and jews . 
  in none of them were the muslims a majority , so it 's the other way around - the previous muslim rulers were a minority trying to impose their ideology by the power of the sword and taxes ( the jyziah for non-muslims ) . 
   why are we not mentioning that the reason the kingdom of jerusalem had to defend itself was because of repeated attacks on peaceful muslim merchants ? 
  we had to resort to quoting kingdom of heaven now , have we ? 
  pathetic . 
  caravans were being protected by the kingdom of jerusalem , particurarly by the monastic orders of the hospitallers and templars . 
  it was its main source of revenue . 
  they had unsanctioned attacks in the late 1180s , but so did the muslims in the previous decade . 
  they had to defend themselves from the very start and that had nothing to do with caravans . 
  it had to do with a civilization from the arab peninsula that invaded the christian world in the 7th century , took half of it and continued its aggression until ad 1683 . 
  the crusades being the short respite the christian world was given from that by striking back . 
   why not mention that not a few of the muslims fighting for the kingdom of jerusalem were simply mercenaries ? 
  those were the turkomans , the fought for both sides and were not native . 
  i was referring to the local muslim inahabitants of the crusader states , who were n't mercenaries yet fought as eargerly for those countries as the christians against the fatimids whom they saw as a greater burden . 
  read christopher tyerman for more on that . 
   why not mention that the following crusades were not self defense but the hopeless , useless and way too bloody attempt to get jerusalem back ? 
  because that 's the same thing - striking back at the non-stop aggressor . 
  giving europe a short respite from islamic conquest that continued immediately after the crusades stopped and ended only in 1683 at the gates of vienna . 
  my own country was conqured by the muslims after the crusades stopped and occupied for 500 years . 
  where the crusaders struck is irrelevant - jerusalem , egypt , tunisia - as long as it hit the aggressors that had already taken half of christianity 's lands and were trying actively to take the other half . 
   why are n't we talking about constantinople being sacked and looted by ... oh ... yeah ... peaceful and noble crusaders ? 
  because it was n't sacked by crusaders , it was sacked by a venetian army excommunicated by the pope the very second it sacked a christian city in dalmatia . 
  when the pope did that he cancelled the crusade that was planned for egypt and warned that anybody who ventured forth with the venetians against christian states would be excomunicated . 
  the vast majority of people then left - those were the crusaders who had come to join the fight against the islamic aggressor . 
  those who remained did so with the full knowledge it would excomunicate them from the church , so how exactly are they anything but a secular , private army funded by the venetians to pursue the republic 's trade interests ? 
  how are they different any more a `` crusade '' than william 's conquest of england or otto 's campaigns in poland ? 
  if anything , they are even less so since those others at least were part of the church whilst doing it , wheres constantinople 's sackers were all excommunicated . 
   you 've probably got your reasons not to talk about these points overal , no , i 'd love to talk about them as you see above , since history is my degree and passion . 
  in the context of our discussion here - sure i have reasons , one in fact , that none of them have anything to do with the question if the crusades were a normal military answer to a continuous aggression as i claim , or just a fanatical ( yet also somehow pragmatic and greedy ) bunch of knights and priests that decided to out of nowhere to invade a peaceful civilization . 
  power projection is not just military maters , for those there is n't yet an eu army in the first place , nato fills that role . 
  by being part of an integrated union eu states have a common voice in the world , and with a common foreign policy they can assert far more influence - economic , political , social , cultural than any given member alone . 
  not a single remark as to the historical validity of your point and the counter-arguments i gave . 
  not a single attempt to adress the fact that the circumstances of the time made the crusade nothing but a response to an aggression and a military support for a country being conquered piece by piece . 
  ( byzantium ) you do n't even bother , because you ' v nothing in you head about the crusades but pop-culture stereotypes and maybe what you ' v seen in a movie or two . 
  care to comment on the dutchy of edessa or the county of tripoli and how they treated their muslim population , as opposed to the previous seljuk rulers ? 
  care to comment why muslims would end up fighting * for * the kingdom of jerusalem , as it taxed them less than their previous fatimid rulers and practiced greater religious freedom , whilst being a supposed kingdom of fanatical crusaders ? 
  i do n't think so , since for you to make your initial statement it must be obvious you ' v not bothered to read a single , even thin , book on the crusades . 
  hence why you regurgitated po-culture myths and established lies about the crusades . 
  we just love our coal . 
  no , they did it after the battle of manzikert , where the seljuk turks destroyed the byzantine army and flooded anatolia , prompting the emperor to plead the pope for help . 
  you had pilgrims being attacked in the holy land , you had christians in palestine ( still almost half of the population ) being harshly oppressed by the seljuks and mildly by the fatimids , you had the roman empire in dire need of help after yet another muslim invasion , and you had 4 centuries of unchecked islamic aggression on the christian world , which led to it losing half of its lands , including those most important theologically and most developped economically . 
  care to tell me , at what point is the christian world allowed to hit back the aggressor that almost brought it to its knees without this being condemned by edgy little anti-theist wisecracks like you ? 
  cause i 'm pretty sure you 'd hit back for much less , but c'mon - ca n't have your easy anti-christian argument without using the crusades , am i right ? 
  silly me , i thought it was the direct result of the battle of manzikert , where the seljuk turks destroyed the byzantine army and flooded anatolia , prompting the emperor to plead the pope for help against the next chapted in a 4-centuries continuous invasion of the islamic world , which had already occupied half of christian civilization 's lands , including the best and most important ones . 
  turns out they just woke up one day and decided to go pillage in the name of god . 
  as it seems you do when you are religious ... whew , 4 years of studying history at uni down the drain , thank god for edgy anti-theist revisionists to open my eyes ... 
  i agree they are wrong in excluding you from the state you built and claiming it all as their past , or even more so projecting a `` belarussian '' nationality on these people , at a time neither `` belarussian '' , nor nationality itself existed as concepts . 
  i also believe however there 's something similar coming from lithuanians , who entirely exclude the ruthenians as anything more than a demographic factor in the later dutchy , when in fact they were an active factor - not just a ruled populace , but with their own nobles , mayors , armies and hetmans . 
  yes , it started as a lithuanian medieval state , like the british in their empire , but ended more-so like yugoslavia ( again for lack of a better example ) , where it was created by a croat called tito , but ended up with a majority serb populace , army , generals etc. 
  and a largely balanced relationship between the two nations until the eventual breakdown . 
  the british empire comparisson was very far fetched - the slavs of the grand dutchy were n't a colonial population , ruled directly and with zero chance of breaking free . 
  they had a large percentage of the nobility ( unlike any african lords in the upper chamber of the empire ) , as well as from what i understand were the majority of the armed forces , since those came in feudal fashion from the entire dutchy . 
  ( again unlike britain , where colonial troops were just auxiliary ) so if the slavs wanted to break the dutchy they easily could 've done it against the small baltic component of lithuanians . 
  they did n't , because it became simply their state as much of the lithuanians - with their nobles , their army formations , their mayors of towns etc. 
  what was a lithuanian-baltic land conquered in the middle ages gradually became a co-lithuanian/co-ruthenian state within the commonwealth . 
  thus they have zero claim on the medieval dutchy - built and ruled by the baltic lithuanians , but equal claim on the commonwealth dutchy of lithuania . 
  i do not see how eu officials are any more succeptible to lobbyism than national ones . 
  particurarly when corruption is involved , the eu is far ahead in fighting it than a substantial percentage of member states , particurarly southern and eastern ones . 
  the eu comission is , indeed , the place that requires the most reform , but at the same time it 's the one where each member states appoints its chosen commisionair , which in turn has to approved by the parliament - thus the commission is the product of two bodies directly elected by the people - national parliaments and eu parliament . 
  it 's not a bunch of appointed out of nowhere burreaucrats with zero accountability . 
  i am not enthusiastic about the eu in its current form . 
  it 's not doing `` wonders '' for bulgaria - it 's filling the pockets of a few local oligarchs whilst making life more expensive for the regular people and sucking the country dry of capital through the monopolies of major western corporations that became possible only after the state 's protectionism and support for local businesses became illegal as part of eu rules on the common market .

i know of a village called \u0427\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 ( chibaovci ) , which literally translates to `` go away sheep '' . 
  i 've seen a sign about it while on the road to sofia . 
  we had german for two years in high school but it was n't taken nearly as seriously as english was . 
  all i remember is how to count to ten . 
  most people were using google translate on their phones to pass the tests . 
  they were compulsory classes . 
  not a chance , the state goes bankrupt tomorrow . 
  my region :( the northwestern region of bulgaria is the poorest region in the european union . 
  it is very common . 
  in a small town like mine most people park their cars on the sidewalk , while pedestrians usually walk on the road . 
  even on the main road there is a car passing only once every 2 minutes on average , so you can just get out of the way when it gets near . 
  in bigger cities you have to use the sidewalk obviously , but there are still a lot of cars parked there , so you have to go around them quite often . 
  bulgaria 's population has decreased by almost 2 million since the 80s , so emigration is certainly a problem . 
  i 've read several in english . 
  mostly science fiction and based on games or movies , like the mass effect books . 
  i also read a page or two from robinson crusoe in serbian once in a while , but i find myself having to google translate words every few sentences . 
  never studied the language , but it 's close enough to bulgarian where most words are either the same or very similar , and i can sometimes guess the meaning of others based on the context . 
  we have a military parade on the 6th of may , but our military is not in a very good shape compared to what it was during the cold war . 
  - romania we have the best relations with them . 
  we are always grouped together in eu matters , because of how similar the situations in our countries are . 
  however , they 've pulled ahead of us lately . 
  people started asking when will we reach the romanians . 
  they 're seem to be tackling corruption better than us . 
  - serbia i think they are the most closest culturally and linguistically , if we exclude macedonia . 
  they seem to be a bit overly nationalistic at times , but we live in the balkans after all . 
  serbian turbo folk music is quite popular here . 
  i enjoy listening to their language , because it sounds funny sometimes , due to the same word having a different meaning . 
  for example i know the serbian word for theater is '' \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 '' , but in bulgarian '' \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440 '' means disgrace/shame , so '' \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 '' sounds like a place for public shaming . 
  - macedonia people consider them bulgarians , but they insist they are n't , which creates some tensions . 
  their language is the closest to ours , it sound like a dialect of bulgarian . 
  - greece they 're in a lot of debt , yet still a lot richer than us . 
  many people go on vacation there , or to work due to wages being a lot higher . 
  their ancient history is very interesting . 
  - turkey only country we need a border fence with , due to all the migrants passing through them . 
  turks are a significant minority here , there 's even a turkish ethnic party . 
  actually there are two now , since one half was pro-erdogan while the other was n't , so they split into two parties before the last election . 
  thankfully the pro-erdogan party could n't gather enough votes to get into parliament . 
  a lot of people feel uneasy about turkey and dislike it , because of the ottoman occupation in the past . 
  erdogan 's islamist and authoritarian tendencies are n't helping their image either . 
  the nonexistent kind . 
  my town is too small and poor to have trams . 
  well in my town almost everyone is growing some kind of food in their garden . 
  it would be more surprising if you did n't grow anything . 
  we grow tomatoes , cucumbers , apples , cherries , raspberries , lettuce and garlic in our front yard . 
  it 's a small yard though , so it 's just a little bit of everything . 
  also my grandfather has a small vineyard where he grows grapes to make rakia for home consumption , and my grandmother has another garden on the outskirts of town with potatoes . 
  my thermometer shows 30 degrees inside my room and its 7 pm . 
  i shower several times a day to cool off . 
  yes , i want more integration . 
  we 've been trying to join the euro and schengen for a long time . 
  a small town somewhere in switzerland . 
  wow !, 
  i had never heard of that before , but to my surprise i can understand it !, 
  that 's pretty cool actually . 
  seems like the creator knew what he was doing . 
  most likely because the load on the network is much less in that small town , than in prague . 
  there are too many people using the internet in a big city , which results in throttling due to limitations of the network infrastructure . 
  i usually have faster internet at night than during the day , same reason - less people are using it then and i get all that bandwidth for myself . 
   internet is a basic commodity like electricity and water by now . 
  as such the government should be in charge of it . 
  offtopic : wait a minute , you 're from czechia !, 
  is n't electricity privatized there too ? 
  there are 3 big private electricity suppliers in bulgaria , each controlling a different region . 
  in my part of the country , the electricity supplier is \u010cez , that 's a [ czech company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%8cez_group ) !, 
  i am somewhat on the left , and i support more border control with turkey and reduction of immigration from outside of europe , especially from unstable countries where people have grown up in an environment of perpetual violence . 
  but our left wing is also in favor of that , so i guess there really is n't anything that only the right wing supports here which i like . 
  maybe lustration of people affiliated in any way with the communist regime , but i am not even sure most of the right would support that , seeing how our centre-right prime minister used to be a body guard for todor zhivkov , the communist dictator of bulgaria ... 
  nationalizing internet providers sounds like it will result in much slower speeds . 
  competition forces isps to offer faster internet , so that users pick them over another company . 
  plus it would make it really easy for the government to censure the internet and blacklist websites they do n't like . 
  and let 's not forget about being able to collect literally all of your data and monitor everything you do . 
  i am for self determination . 
  if a group of people that are the historical inhabitants of a place no longer wish their homeland to be part of another country , they should have the right to secede peacefully and become independent . 
  if you try to stop them by force , you 're basically saying that they are prisoners in their own land , and you are their occupiers . 
  i am bulgarian , so i can partly understand some other slavic languages , like russian and serbian . 
  obviously not anywhere near 100 % , but i can usually get the gist of what is being said , depending on the complexity of the sentence . 
  i want more countries to join , do n't want to kick out anyone . 
  we used to put '' \u044a '' at the end of words until 1945 , dunno why that was even a thing . 
  it makes it kinda hard to read old texts , because when we use '' \u044a '' now , it is much more pronounced , the word actually contains that sound , and it puts me off when every word ends with it . 
  sound like a caveman speaking when i read it in my mind . 
  we also had a few extra letters , whose sound was a combination of two others , so i guess they thought that 's unnecessary and got rid of them too . 
  speaking is hardest , because i do n't practice it . 
  people say i sound like i have soap in my mouth . 
  i 've had people think i 'm russian , happens quite often online . 
  they see cyrillic text , and assume it must be russian . 
  same when they hear an eastern european accent . 
  it happens sometimes when there 's a very strong lightning storm . 
  like once or twice a year . 
  and it 's always just my side of the street , houses across still have electricity while i sit in the dark : /, 
  not that often . 
  you can usually see them parked somewhere beside the road outside town , stopping random cars to check documents and stuff . 
  in bulgarian you can say '' \u043b\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0436\u0435 '' or '' \u0431\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438 '' , most commonly used when you hear something absurd or ridiculous , or when you 're frustrated . 
  people just say `` omg '' when typing online though . 
  france is good at making movies . 
  lots of french movies are loved here , like asterix , taxi , and anything with louis de funes . 
  we consider them bulgarians , but they refuse to admit it , and both sides get angry . 
  then they provoke us further by distorting history , which is a big deal in the balkans . 
  well killing terrorists is good , but who 's going to pay for all the property damage ? 
  i heard civilians saying the blast broke all windows and caused cracks in their houses . 
  it 's better to use smaller precision guided missiles that wo n't cause so much damage .

  is nothing . 
  like a dot on the map of it , hence you are being ridiculously pedantic with our correction in this context . 
  by the same logic you can never really say x country is as big as y , because they never actuall are . 
  context matters , otherwsie you ' r just trying to be a smartass . 
  you do n't need to go to other countries to enjoy [ this ] ( http://www.bulgariainside.com/images/galleries/th_641x426/_w_7e5e12d59508e644c07936373df6a024.jpeg ) when it * is * your country . 
  ( pic , sveti vlas resort here in bulgaria . 
  my grandma went there for 5 days last summer . 
  i prefer [ this ] ( http://web-tourism.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5.jpeg ) - bansko . 
  you can vacation on average bulgarian sallary on our seaside and mountain resorts , that have no less of a quality than medditeranean or alpine ones where westerners spend thousands ), 
  lol , that was really fun . 
  i compare the population of bangladesh to that of russia - that it has 20 million more people despite being only a very , very small country , for which i used austira . 
  you give the sound argument that no , actually , it is 1.5 times bigger than austria . 
  :d the fact you don ; t realize how hilarious this is makes me giggle . 
  160 million people in teh size of austria makes my argument for overpopulation work . 
  160 million in 1.5 the size of austria it seems does n't . 
  first hand , yes . 
  my second hand iphone 5 was never used , some brat didn ; t like her birthday gift , and i got for 190 bgn - 98 eur from a pawn shop . 
  have i complained that foreign companies should pay more to bulgarians ? 
  then why mention it ? 
  and empathy has nothing do with what we talk of . 
  you make companies pay more to those people - the companies move to one of the other highly overpopulated and poor countries . 
  you stop buying their products - they close their factories . 
  which of these two proposals i ' v read here will make the lives of these employed better ? 
  here goes the `` muuh colonialism '' argument . 
  will be used for ever and ever it seems . 
  before you address the effect of overpopulation in third world countries , it 's pointless to talk . 
  everything boils down to it , and yet we have to go back in history to justify it somehow . 
  a worthless comment . 
  you sound like a dumbass for it . 
  if prices are low enough to get you on 1500eur as much as 3500eur would elsewhere , why not ? 
  a cab fare here costs 0.45 eur a kilometre and a fist-class sushi uro-maki combo meal at the restaurant next to my place - 5.50 eur . 
  on 1500 eur you can certainly live like an upper-middle class person does in the uk or france . 
  hence why just as big a percentage of our population earns that much as those who earn 5000 eur + in the uk/france . 
  people are n't suffering because companies made them work fo 23p an hour , they are suffering because they overpopulate their countries to the point where the rise in the economy , development and real wages does n't cope with the creation of new workforce . 
  making it cheaper and cheaper . 
  they take 23p , because if they demand more - there 's 3 billion other people on earth right now ready to take their place . 
  why is there 3 billion people living in abject poverty ? 
  there were only 4 billion on earth quite recently and many parts of the globe have n't increased substantially since then ? 
  well , because other parts have . 
  by a lot . 
  by an uncontrolable population boom . 
  ** this ** is what causes the poverty in these regions . 
  not companies that go there to employ people . 
  it 's both hilarious and pathetic to see deluded western leftists blame the suffering and poverty of people in countries like bangladesh on the western companies that have went there to invest , or even more so on the western customers who buy the produce of these companies , rather than on the people who ' v made a country the size of austria have a population larger than that of russia . 
  ( by 20 million more ) if you want to help them , not buying the products they produce is n't the way . 
  it will just make the jobs already scarce there even scarcer . 
  you wann help ? 
  send them contraceptives . 
  bangladesh is a country the size of austria with the population of russia ( actually 20 million more than russia ) . 
  regardless if their fertility has been dealt with now , do n't tell me it 's not an example of a country having low standards precisely due to overpopulation . 
  it 's ** the ** prime example of overpopulation in the world , which is why those people working for 23p an hour have tens of millions of others ready to take their jobs . 
  their education is n't my responsibility or that of the companies that bring jobs to their countries . 
  once again it 's their own responsibility . 
  stop treating third world countries like children that need to be taken care of by the west . 
  why are you asking me if i 'd overlook toxicity in my clothes ? 
  what does that have to do with my post ? 
  toxicity affects me negatively , hence i would n't be ok with it . 
  paying as low as possible to workers ( who have chosen to work there ) is affecting me positively . 
  why should n't i be ok with it ? 
  because i 'm supposed to pay out of my own pocket for the better life of people in the third world , whilstthey keep increasing by the billions ? 
  grow up . 
  a company is supposed to do all it can to decrease it costs , as long as it is within the law . 
  if the law says 23p an hour is legal , there is zero reason to pressure a company to pay more . 
  you want to pay more money out of your pocket ? 
  then there 's plenty of charities for you to send your money to in the third world . 
  just do n't force everyone else to pay more as well . 
  i did n't understand what you wrote . 
  be a bit more clear please . 
  did you even address what we are talking about ? 
  stalin made a common border with hitler and carved eastern europe with him . 
  he 's to blame for ww2 as much as hitler is . 
  be as clear in your response as i am in these sentences , because vague , poorly constructed words i do n't get . 
  maybe it 's my english , sorry . 
  but why should western customers demand better conditions for the workers in these countries ? 
  would n't that make it more expensive for the western customers ? 
  and is n't it the work of people in those countries to demand better conditions for themslves , not that of the customers in the west ? 
  why are people working for less than a dollar a day ? 
  are they forced ? 
  they would be fired and replaced easily . 
  why ? 
  because labour is cheap . 
  why ? 
  because they are breeding like rabbits , so the economy and internal companies ca n't cope with increase of people , hence leaving a constant large supply of people rady to work for any money . 
  when people in poor countries stop breeding like that , unemployment will fall drastically , labour will become more expensive because there wo n't be substantially more extra poor people with each generation . 
  western companies and consumers do n't owe them shit . 
  of course every company wants to pay as little as possible to people . 
  there are those willing to work for so little ? 
  great !, 
  i 'd hire them too . 
  the question is why are there hundreds of millions willing to work for close to nothing on earth , and the answer is because we ' v got 3 billion people more than we did a couple of generations ago . 
  those are the cheap labour - the extra billions of people as result of uncontrolable breeding by those least capable of giving their children a secure future . 
  according to the un africa is set to ** quadruple ** to 4 billion people by 2100 . 
  that 's another 3 billion just in africa ready to work for close to nothing . 
  you think companies won ; t use that ? 
  or that they should n't use that ? 
  that we should insist paying more for our goods ? 
  fix your own damn country do n't insist consumers elsewhere pay more to fix it for you .

  poroshenko was n't in office during the first battle of donetsk airport , when the interior of the terminal was destroyed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_battle_of_donetsk_airport nice pointing the finger tactic though .

  not only that , but i guarantee that form the 27 countries and [ 38 parliaments ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/21/eus-national-regional-parliaments-get-brexit-deal-veto/ ) , at least few will think that destroying uk is the most important thing and will work actively to give uk the worst possible deal . 
  why would they think uk destruction is priority # 1 ? 
  few reasons : - if brexit is a success story , other countries will leave too . 
  - historic grudge with uk and now is time to have revenge . 
  - if uk collapses , they could take their place in some markets . 
  - to take revenge for recent arrogance/stuff uk showed/did . 
  - to serve some internal political agenda , flexing muscles , going for a blackmail to get more form uk post-brexit . 
  i am almost certain that uk will be crushed at the end of the exit negotiations . 
  it takes just one of the 38 parliaments to say `` fu '' and the deal is gone , the 2-year period is over and uk is left out alone in the cold , in a desperation to get deals with the whole world . 
  and the world of business is not a charity , they will rough up uk as hard as they can to squeeze the pennies out of uk . 
   i think a lot of people look at hitler and his government as sort of a surreal personality that is so bad it wont happen again . 
  exactly that 's the problem . 
  a hitler is always around the corner . 
  always . 
   i just do n't get it how people seem to completely ignore the lessons of history . 
  to quote a brit :  human beings , who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others , are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so . 
  douglas adams, 
   the uk has become the tipsy , tweedy uncle , who after too much christmas sherry has tipped over into drunkenly abusive bore . 
  that sums it up pretty nicely . 
   only if the remaining eu members agree to it . 
  i very sure that from the remaining eu members , at least few will laugh all the way to their parliaments to vote `` no bloody way ! '', 
   if the uk is ahead of france economically for the next french presidential election ( 2022 ) , be sure that france will leave the eu . 
  an excellent point !, 
  sadly ... 
  i do n't know about trumpistan , but if they go with the attitude shown so far , they will get such a deal that eu might need to drop humanitarian aid for one of the coming christmases ... 
   good and well-balanced text ** from verhofstadt . 
  ** just saying , the name is verhofstadt, 
   i 'd take the same amount of time to leave eu , maybe even longer . 
  not really . 
  after article 50 trigger there are 2 years to reach an agreement . 
  if it is not reached , uk leaves with nothing . 
  if all countries agree on the agreement , but one is slow or votes against - again - uk leaves with nothing . 
   our history got ta re-read that one ... 
  realism is for the poor to handle ...

  the opposite is more logical . 
  if you are a victim of a far-right hate crime you should be protected by being moved as far as possible away from the threat .

  netherlands tax authorities are notorious for giving special tax deals to the rich and famous . 
  so , it is a `` richist '' tax haven . 
  as long as the dutch can make a buck , discrimination is a non-issue ... [ starbucks ] ( http://nltimes.nl/2015/10/21/dutch-forced-collect-eu20m-extra-tax-starbucks-cabinet-surprised-europe ) [ rolling stones ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/stones-paid-just-16-tax-on-163240m-royalties-410232.html ), 
  actually , they have to be neutral . 
  that 's what they decided themselves and put in their code of conduct/charter . 
  that 's the official rules of the game by which the primaries had to be conducted . 
  by these rules sanders tried to beat clinton . 
  and clinton and dnc cheated him and their whole base . 
  this is not a crime according to usa law , but i do n't see how it can be disputed , or characterised as a trying but cheating/rigging . 
  please , read the linked charter . 
  i even pointed the paragraph . 
  is it still hard for you to find it ? 
  [ now for the rigging ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_democratic_national_committee_email_leak ) :  `` many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine bernie sanders 's presidential campaign . 
  sure , that 's what i said - it 's kind of a law . 
  nobody is going to jail , but being labeled as crook/cheater - for sure . 
  well , the charter is kind of a law . 
  it 's there for a reason and to be followed , not to be fucked at any opportunity ... 
  we elected boyko borisov ... 
  so , it 's not a very long shot ... 
  it is generally agreed that `` to rig '' means `` to manipulate dishonestly for personal gain '' . 
  and that 's what dnc did - they broke their own charter in various ways and manipulated the whole process to work against sanders . 
  there is no question about it . 
  edit : here is the proof [ article 5 , section 4 of the dnc charter requires that the chairperson and all officers be impartial and evenhanded with democratic candidates for president ] ( https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2989759-impartiality-clause-dnc-charter-bylaws-art-5-sec-4.html ) - see second paragraph from the top .

  yeah , i know this mantra . 
  but it has little merit . 
  sanders had better chances than clinton vs trump . 
  the more exposure he had the bigger his influence grew , if we ignore the obvious primary rigging . 
  you really underestimate the storm that he could have created having honest primary and the full length of the main election . 
  just replying about the destination , not condoning using it . 
  for example all moroccans have by birth moroccan nationality which can not be renounced . 
  so whatever they do they can go ( back ) to morocco and live there without any legal issues whatsoever . 
   by condoning racial profiling to be precise this was behavioral or/and even cultural profiling , not racial . 
  if it would be racial , the police would be banging doors and handing out badges with obligation to be worn at all times for all residents of the city .

   you are presenting your points , specifically the transition from 3 to 4 , as if there are no alternatives . 
  there are , in fact . 
  this means you do not agree already with point 1 : `` historically and psychologically it is proven that you can make a large group of people to do/not do something in 3 ways - fire up their enthusiasm , or make it ( near ) impossible , or force them by fear or violence '' let 's address that : what other ways are there to make a large group of people to do/not do something ? 
  i will , if i may ... 
  i set the argument point by point , please rebut on th epoints that you dont agree 1 . 
  historically and psychologically it is proven that you can make a large group of people to do/not do something in 3 ways - fire up their enthusiasm , or make it ( near ) impossible , or force them by fear or violence . 
  do you agree so far ? 
  here you can not fire any enthusiasm to anybody not to come - these people are far , scattered , do n't care to listen to you , probably do n't understand you and most importantly are fired up to come to you . 
  do you agree so far ? 
  3 . make it impossible to come - with greek geography and turkey on the other side - this is out of the question . 
  you cant build a new chinese wall over the sea . 
  do you agree ? 
  what is left , logically , is fear and force . 
  do you agree ?

  be brutal if needed . 
  once in the camps , tell un that there is humanitarian crisis going on and they better bring food , water and tents . 
  jam pack the camps and start applying the eu law meticulously - register , fingerprint , process refugee applications . 
  do n't let anybody move out of the island . 
  give means for them to go back to turkey if they wish ( inflatable boats ) . 
  do you agree ? 
  the alternative is that the whole greece becomes a refugee camp and the whole tourist industry collapses . 
  so it is either point 5 or greece is finished . 
  do you agree ? 
  you may think point 5 is not realistic . 
  it is . 
  it is just a military logistical operation that was done many times in the history . 
  [ reading original article advised ], 
   `` european leaders are pushing to develop the industry 's moral compass . '', 
  this is where they lost me - first line below the title . 
  free market eats ethics for breakfast . 
  especially if it is sitting beyond the big water . 
  you get downvoted for no reason . 
  it will save a massive amount of bureaucracy . 
  according to the proposal that you are going to reject - can you take the money and move to live elsewhere ? 
  let 's restate the obvious until eu is completely in ruins . 
  then we can start the blaming . 
  that is not that hard . 
  just move all fleets there , launch some drones with infrared cameras and start arresting smugglers . 
  once you get 20 and sentence them for max sentence , the rest will back down . 
  i am sure this is much cheaper than 3 billion euros that turkey now upped to 5 and want them in bulk ... 
  now i have to go to talin !, 
  not really . 
  life has thought me that the power hungry idiots would not mind putting the world in ruins , including their own country , if they could make some profit and/or stay in power . 
  but how do you know what will he be doing - terrorism , tourism , nudism , etc if you do not stop him at the border to check and verify ?!, 
  mind reading ?!, 
  individual tracking by drones ?!, 
  using spy satellites form a james bond movie ?!, 
  tell me , tell me , i am dying form the suspense !, 
  what if the power-having palestinians just sabotage the talks just to get recognition and not get peace ? 
  back then the law was the law . 
  just or not - it was . 
  what you suggest is to scrap all laws and use own moral compass . 
  that gon na work out great !, 
  there was even a word for that ... escaped my mind ... 
  so if the petry asked the law to be followed , and the german vice chancellor finds this wrong ... seems the german vice chancellor is inciting law disobedience . 
  will this be tolerated ?

  well , eurostat shows a curious picture - [ romania and bulgaria are , and have been , worse off for decades already ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=bookmark_ds-127829_qid_-71e33b61_uid_-3f171eb0&amp;layout=age,l,x,0;geo,l,y,0;unit,l,z,0;sex,l,z,1;time,c,z,2;indicators,c,z,3;&amp;zselection=ds-127829unit,pc_pop;ds-127829sex,t;ds-127829time,2014;ds-127829indicators,obs_flag;&amp;rankname1=time_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname2=unit_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname3=indicators_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname4=sex_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname5=age_1_2_0_0&amp;rankname6=geo_1_2_0_1&amp;ppcrk=first&amp;ppcso=protocol&amp;sortc=asc_-1_first&amp;rstp=&amp;cstp=&amp;rdch=&amp;cdch=&amp;rdm=true&amp;cdm=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=rolling&amp;time_most_recent=true&amp;lang=en&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2c%23%23%23.%23%23%23&amp;lang=en ) . 
  and nobody gave crap about that . 
  i will not be totally shocked if it would create the opposite effect . 
  well , that 's ... creative ... 
  so , give me an estimate : how long would it take to see every single place in this album using local transportation ? 
  what is the average price to live for a day in gerogia for a tourist , if i take low-middle class hotels . 
  btw , the next time someone says switzerland has beautiful mountains , i will tell them georgia just lol-ed . 
  a-m-a-z-i-n-g !, 
  if you set things right and straight , millions will not come . 
  that 's the whole point, 
  because turkey has the obligation to stop people without proper authorization/papers/permission to enter other countries . 
  well , if you want to get so anal-ytical then be aware that :  in some jurisdictions , the offence of blackmail is often carried out during the act of robbery . 
  this occurs when an offender makes a threat of immediate violence towards someone in order to make a gain as part of a theft . 
  for example , the threat of `` your money , or your life ! '', 
  is an unlawful threat of violence in order to gain property . 
  blackmail is not only about revealing a secret . 
  not a greek , but here is what needs to happen , and eventually will : greece needs to sacrifice a piece of their beautiful , tourist cash producing land . 
  the islands that are flooded by migrants already anyway need to be written off . 
  the billions you give to turkey can be used to compensate the locals and move them elsewhere . 
  then move all migrants to refugee camps on these islands . 
  if they do n't cooperate use the army . 
  be brutal if needed . 
  once in the camps , tell un that there is humanitarian crisis going on and they better bring food , water and tents . 
  use the billions for turkey to set up the camps . 
  start applying the eu law meticulously - register , fingerprint , process refugee applications , grant asylum to the proven refugees , sent back the rest to turkey or offer them to stay in places with no access to free movement in mainland eu . 
  do n't let anybody move out of the island . 
  give means for them to go back to turkey if they wish ( inflatable boats ) . 
  this will be needed for the next 100 years to cope also with the climate migrants . 
  and i got down voted on this before , because `` but the locals love their land , but the human rights , but you nazi '' .

  also note that turing machines are not actual machines . 
  turing machines are a mathematical model to describe the limits of computation . 
  think of turing machines of a mathematical definition similar to that of a function . 
  in math you say that you have f ( x ) which is a projection where each x is mapped to exactly one y and so on and using that definition you prove theorems and invent shortcuts . 
  the turing machine is a similar concept for cs . 
  it is so important because it is remarkably simple but turing has proven that whatever this simple machine can compute is the most any machine ever can compute . 
  so if we prove that a certain thing can not be computed on a turing machine this means that we do n't need to try to compute it on any other machine . 
  interestingly this purely mathematics concept is easily explains through a physical device which makes it even better because it makes it easier to understand . 
  yes turing is the greatest and the father of cs but he did not build the first computer, 
  ok you have to tell me this - are you kidding or you want my computing history lecture in the form of a reddit comment ? 
  ooops ... my bad, 
  so are you english , italian or german ? 
  all of these have a reasonable claim to having built the first computer for some definition of computer . 
  there is no ukraine homophobia involved only the guardian 's stupidity . 
  which as we know from russian media means mandatory gay sex . 
  can confirm . 
  it is actually better now at least for people willing to work for their success ( as opposed being assigned somewhere and waiting there till retirement ), 
  so stalin is not a communist or representative of the soviet union ? 
  we only count trotsky as a true communist now ? 
  sure but it was russia who sent their army to help communist revolutions in ee countries . 
  it was n't like this for bulgaria and i am pretty sure it was n't like this for poland and the czech . 
  i suspect for many more countries . 
  without the red army the communist could never get the power in most ee countries . 
  of course he is blaming russia for annexing a couple of countries and appointing puppet communist governments in some more countries supported by the red army ( or they would be wiped out by the corresponding nations ) . 
  ee as a whole does n't love russia and hate the us ( well at least not more than the rest of the world hates the us ) . 
  the best description for attitude of ee towards russia is best described as polarized . 
  there is a minority ( large but still a minority ) that claims that russia is great and communism was fine and a majority that sees the west as far better option . 
  yeah , that 's the guardian - pathetic . 
  uhm ... what country ? 
  boza and airan require some time getting used to . 
  a lot of bulgarians hate them too if they never started drinking them as children for some reason . 
  i want to add [ sandanski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sandanski ) to your list of tourist destinations, 
  well i assume the law will have to be changed to allow shooting of people who illegally cross the border . 
  i do n't know why this law was removed in the first place . 
  net neutrality laws restrict the free market so i am against them . 
  can i cheer now ? 
  somebody call for a referendum on porn filters . 
  lets see how this turns out !, 
  totally not obvious to me . 
  yeah sure . 
  now go cry to your government for more regulation on the free market . 
  i know . 
  it is a restriction on the free market so that isps are banned from offering me a cheaper or faster service that is restricted to the services i want to . 
  they will be forced to make me pay for services i do n't care about because they must be neutral . 
  if i only use facebook and reddit the isp should be allowed to offer me fast and cheap access to facebook and reddit without the need to provide me access to say google + . 
  use your slow internet that was slowed down on purpose so it could be neutral . 
  the golden age of the internet when nobody wanted net neutrality laws and the market was regulating internet speeds not bureaucrats . 
  yes . 
  if it gets abolished we wo n't have state regulation on the internet like net neutrality . 
  just for the record - i wanted this . 
  or more precisely i think this is less damaging than the strict version . 
  ideally there would be no state regulation on the internet including net neutrality . 
  net neutrality is for socialists who want to stop competition . 
  here is how it works - i have worked with russians and know some russians . 
  i like them as much as any other europeans ( in fact there are some european peoples i actually dislike ) as long as they do n't start talking about friendship between bulgarians and russians and how great your country is . 
  i do hate your country but i actually like russians up to the point where they insist to be one with their country . 
  clearly i can like a person and not like his political decisions , ca n't i ? 
  i mean i am as libertarian as it gets but i have friends who are communists and i can drink with them and work with them and even discuss politics without getting into a fight . 
  my impression is that ordinary russians are not concerned about the lives of ordinary russians . 
  first of all the attitude of russians seems to be one of `` our country before our lives '' . 
  more importantly the disregard for human live seems to be part of the culture in almost suicidal ways . 
  alcoholism is much more of a problem than any other country reducing life expectancy significantly and almost all of the insane almost suicidal videos i see on the internet are made in russia . 
  i mean those people walking on skyscrapers and similar . 
  there are also pictures of russians doing dangerous things with various guns and cars . 
  i know that these people are a minority but they do n't seem to exist in any other country so i kind of extrapolate from there . 
  well 4 channers call everything a shithole . 
  if i write on 4chan i would call everything shithole too , 
  if you see a brit saying this ask him about his internet speed , 
  btw what is the plan for the secular people in turkey ? 
  what are you gon na do when the laws erdogan creates are no longer a joke but a real problem like who knows ... ban unmarried sex or making it illegal to miss a prayer ? 
  do n't you need to be a direct descendent of mohammad to be a caliph ? 
  i do n't know guys . 
  just sort it out between yourselves and do n't torture us with all that remembering . 
  american ? 
  to be honest you probably have worse , 
  you can use this for reference - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtga0jvhp2a, 
  to be honest you and the romanians should do something about these confusing names !, 
  i can take you to dirty , unfriendly and criminal places if you want me to , 
  you really believe medvedev had any real power ? 
  he just switched with putin because of the requirement of russian constitution . 
  that was just putin 's policy at the time . 
  also they believe other people somehow love them and respect them for that . 
  who considers romania a shithole ? 
  sure it may look like this from western europe and the usa but come on people most people in the world are living in quite a bit worse situation and most countries are actually worse . 
  how is a country above average a shithole ? 
  probably spain . 
  i love how easy , almost lazy the spanish people seem to be and it is warm . 
  yes , but sometimes i get to vote . 
  sure but they would be even less corrupt if they were right leaning and also the argument was that a poor country can not afford to be left leaning . 
  ok go ahead experiment . 
  i prefer to not be the rat lab for the endless experiments trying to make the left work . 
  empirical evidence suggest that works better than anyone who got the power by promising equality and fair redistribution . 
  a country under right-wing rule can not suffer as much from corruption because right-wing means more private things , less taxes and less redistribution . 
  if the state does not get a lot of money and property the corrupt politicians can not steal a lot of money and property . 
  even if that is true they get there using the votes of left leaning people . 
  the conclusion is that poor countries with left politics just get poorer . 
  proven empirically in many places around the world . 
  that does n't stop countries with less intelligent voters . 
  i agree to disagree . 
  nope .

not a good argument when they got elected fairly and are still leading polls, 
  juncker should be pressured to step down , idiocy like that can be disastrous, 
  i mean , it makes it even more amazing to have that approval rating . 
  we had exactly the same transition and zero politicians who have a net positive rating . 
  or , the populist wave wins in europe too and the exact opposite of what you talk about happens , and i think that is more likely, 
  the same is coming to europe , and as trump and brexit showed us , smugness will lead to surprises, 
  trump has said he wants to take down russian planes that fly too close to us military . 
  on a side note , why are so many people angry that trump may not recognise the results ? 
  every ` anti-establishment ' politician here complains how the whole world is rigged against them and nobody really cares, 
  it is outrageous that these scammers were ever offered anything other than going back . 
  i agree , we ca n't even blame any politicians for how we fucked this up , we voted for it just because it 's something new , despite having no idea what it leads to . 
  he 'll probably win the runoff too . 
  i do n't like him but i am not surprised , gerb really dropped the ball this time . 
  although with mandatory fptp voting , which we also voted on in a retarded referendum today , they still win edit : although with confidence in them constantly decreasing , and losing elections for the first time since they exist , it may shake them up quite badly . 
  he probably loves it too, 
  well our cars are all second hand imported from germany and italy after 10 years of being driven , so they 're exactly the same cars , we just drive them 10 years later, 
  except they are all shitty as any local companies that would compete have died, 
  here we 're in a permanent state of election campaign , when there are no elections opposition parties just try to force one, 
  solidarity does not exist in the eu and it never will . 
  or egypt, 
  i 'd love to, 
  honestly , none . 
  there are no such parties here, 
  only the big ones decide in that scenario, 
  almost all use both, 
  this really is n't good for the eu either, 
  we 're all fucked if this happens, 
  judging by the reaction my comment got and reading it again , yes , ` dead ' was certainly not the right word to use . 
  also , it is 38.7 % of public investment , not 25 , | i 'm not denying how much we rely on a well functioning eu , and not just when it comes to money . 
  i 'm just worried it may fail to progress further while the world moves on, 
  yes , it 's one treaty , with a small and very wealthy country . 
  imagine what the reaction will be when the us talks about decreased regulation or india mentions easier outsourcing . 
  in theory , this deal should n't be particularly controversial , but it is, 
  seriously though , there are many ways in which it can improve , but you cant federalize and integrate a lot because there are too many eurosceptics , and you ca n't scale it down , because there are too many federalists , especially among the politicians . 
  any eurozone reform , which is badly needed , will be met with heavy resistance , either by people who think it goes too far or by those who think it is not enough . 
  not to mention anti- eu parties are getting bigger every year , increasing their influence, 
  did n't a belgian local parliament already vote against it meaning belgium has to use the veto ? 
  bulgaria and romania will sign it as canada promised what we wanted and just has to put it on paper to guarantee it , but does it matter ? 
  i hope you 're right though , i like the eu, 
  the eu is dead , it 's mainly a trade treaty , yet it completely fails to negotiate and sign any trade deals , making it useless . 
  the uk was right to leave before it gets worse and fails at its other duties too, 
  no , it is federalism , as in more regionally devolved government , and opposed to centralism, 
  meat raised with too much antibiotics needs to be banned from consumption , or millions may die, 
  it is dangerous to two eu members , as it includes bulgarian cities too . 
  actually yes , which is why nordstream 2 is untouchable and that would hurt much more than any other sanction, 
  knowing how elevators are here , and assuming they are the same or worse in ukraine , it probably exploded on its own, 
  also belgium and ireland , are n't they both much wealthier than cyprus per capita ? 
  and in bulgarian the word currently means ugly, 
  we 've had a mass exodus since the day the iron curtain fell and is is still going on, 
  russia refused because it would n't be worth the paper, 
  russia would love to do this in mexico , but with competent diplomacy , and hundreds of billions of dollars in trade with the us are a much better deal for mexico than anything russia can offer, 
  the eu will be blamed no matter what happens . 
  no , i 'm not against the german industry , as a part of the supply chain , bulgaria would lose a lot if german companies fail to adapt in a ttip/ceta environment . 
  all i 'm saying is , that it is more about protectionism and keeping the status quo over more competition , than consumer protection and such, 
  yeah , german corporations owning everything in europe is good , free trade with canada and competition is death to consumer protection laws , how convenient, 
  was n't nyc a very shit place at the time though ? 
  no east european country was ever as bad as north korea got, 
  while i am pro-choice , if you consider abortion to be the killing of a child , it is expected to be you most important issue, 
  i do n't care the romanians are still savages unlike us compassionate enlightened bulgarians, 
  so because russia went to war one time for its own interest and bulgaria benefited from it , i should eternally agree with the what the russian government says ? 
   also on monday , president putin submitted a bill ( in russian ) to parliament setting a series of pre-conditions for the us for the agreement to be resumed , including : reduction of us military infrastructure and troops in countries that joined nato after 1 september 2000 lifting of all us sanctions against russia and compensation for the damage they have caused fuck off russia, 
  trust me , while i agree with this ban , this reasoning is far more thought out than the actual reason the ban passed , which is either ` shit , they 'll accuse us of wanting burkas in the country ' or ` what nonissue can i brag about when i run for president ', 
  but they did lead a brutal war against the ottomans , that 's how their country was created, 
  those four countries are proud central european just like austria and germany , bulgaria for example is eastern and wants full solidarity ( admitedly because we are a border state , but still ), 
  and putin himself said that crimea is part of ukraine and that they respect its integrity but that is not the case now is it, 
  not sure about cornwall , but scotland has a much higher deficit than the eurozone would ever allow , all compensated by london, 
  what does the free market think ? 
  he 's also leaving in a few months and is far more pro-euro than the general population so i do n't expect us to join soon, 
  but the uk accepts that an is unlikely to seek single market membership, 
  this would be difficult for poor people though , and they are more likely to get an unwanted pregnancy, 
  sorry but my eu appointed master told me to downvote you . 
  but they 'll get deported back at some point, 
  fuck , we 'll never get in the visa waiver program, 
   `` the funding comes from the emergency pocket of our two migration and border funds ... the funding covers border management , the necessary technical equipment and the construction of reception centers , '' natasha bertaud , eu spokesperson for migration , home affairs and citizenship , told a news conference . 
  so instead of a fence , the eu funds reception centers, 
  russian bond yields are very high , it 's not a good option, 
  chevrolet bolt and opel ampera-e ( the same car ) are what you 're talking about, 
  better than an actual eu army, 
  looks like it 's a good idea to invest in eastern uzbekistan, 
  they do , and they also raise taxes all the time , but i think you do n't understand how stubborn people here are, 
  visa or visa free travel will certainly be a part of the exit negotiation though, 
  the problem is that the next republican candidate might be like trump , except not an idiot, 
   burn rome down typical german mentality, 
  even funnier when they can send hundreds of thousands of people at any moment your way and crash your country, 
  when it comes to chips , i hate how all brands have oregano flavor in greece , and none in bulgaria except some imported from there in small quantities, 
  most eu countries have a history of being invaded and conquered, 
  do n't worry if those indurstries are closed they will then complain about taking jobs from black people, 
  in a tiny part of germany *, 
  even then , the issue is for the government institutions to handle , not vigilantes, 
  frontex forces do not secure the border , they only make sure everyone is registered and forced to stay in greece if eu law was lactually followed, 
  and ? 
  every big economy has large debts, 
  canada and australia do n't , the us does n't pretend to lead the world in commerce because it actually does . 
  you realise street view has people on foot too right ? 
  original imgur is horrible on mobile . 
  exactly, 
  lol at how uncultured greeks and romanians are, 
  this is actually a real problem , when digging for the subway and for roads around the country the project is always slowed down because archeologists have to come and examine artifacts . 
  how yellow are those bananas though ? 
  we need to legislate that too .

  almost all cities , towns , castles and churches in locations where swedish troops were stationed were destroyed ; and as prof. rottermund says this can be seen even today , as in guides to many polish towns and cities one will find a note that says `` object destroyed during swedish invasion '' . 
  from the royal castle in warsaw the swedes stole app . 
  200 paintings , a number of carpets and turkish tents , musical instruments , furniture , chinese porcelain , weapons , books , manuscripts , marbles , even dresses of maids and door frames pulled from walls . 
  [ 22 ] huber kowalski of the university of warsaw institute of archeology says that swedes stole anything they could lay their hands on - windows , stairs , chimneys , sculptures , floors , doors and gates . 
  most goods were loaded on boats and transported along the vistula to the baltic sea , and then to sweden . 
  in november 2011 , archeologists of the university of warsaw found app . 
  70 items ( total weight five tons ) , which probably come from the warsaw royal castle . 
  they sank in the vistula while being transported to sweden . 
  according to the estimates of polish scholars i. ihnatowicz , z. landau , a. m\u0105czak and b. zientara , the invasion by the swedish army and its allies ( brandenburg-prussia and transilvania ) , resulted in the loss of 25 % of the population in four core polish provinces . 
  lesser poland lost 23 % of population , mazovia 40 % in villages and 70 % in towns , greater poland 50 % in villages and 60 % in towns . 
  royal prussia lost some 60 % of its population https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history ) #destruction _ of_the_commonwealth, 
  why has it been accused of that ? 
  what 's wrong with giving employment in factories to unemployed people in third world countries ? 
  what 's exploitatory about children working in bangladesh for western companies ? 
  africa will quadruple its population this century to 4 billion people in 2100 , at the same time as experiencing the world 's worst soil degradation process of its most fertile lands , as well as the worst effects of climate change . 
  one has to be delusional not to see this as the perfect storm for conflicts and wars as well . 
  if they do n't drastically reduce their fertility , like right the fuck now , they are fucked big time . 
  and we might be as well if waves of millions from them come this way . 
  imposing their idea of [ `` gender neutral speech '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gender-neutral-pre-school-accused-of-mind-control-2305983.html ) on others . 
  [ especially when on kids . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/02/swedish-schools-gender-alien-concept ) bbc : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14038419, 
  `` we '' should n't compensate anyone for anything that we did n't do to him . 
  there is no such thing as ancestral or communal guild . 
  no `` blood debt '' . 
  every individual is born with a clean slate and is responsible for his actions only . 
  and even if we accepted the idiotic , stone-age idea of ancestral guilt , then the europeans would by far not be only ones having to pay to someone else . 
  pretty much every person on earth has ancestors who conquered , enslaved or invaded others , at some point . 
  it 's a sign of `` pop-history 's '' prevelance in modern culture that swedish aggression/warfare is associated almost always with the vikings ( who were actually more famously danish and norwegian ) , when in reality the swedes did enormously more pillaging , killing and fighting in the 16th and 17th centuries . 
  the extend of the swedish destruction in germany and poland in the 1630s and 1640s-50s alone outshines all viking conquests by their ancestors combined , yet people always refer back to the vikings due to pop-culture history atm and romantization . 
  compassion becomes a doubled edged sword in the case of sweden and the current `` progressive '' wave of politics . 
  ashamed of what ? 
  yes of course no one is worried , my question merely was why * did * romanians even have a claim on southern dobrudja at all , which to my knowledge never ever had a significant romanian population of any kind . 
  that 's why i compared it to us having a claim at some point in our history to , say , cyprus . 
  or bavaria . 
  it just makes no sense even from a nationalistic point of view so i was interested what its genesis was . 
  they are . 
  at least the vast majority of the slavic population there used to identify as such and speak bulgarian before the yugoslav nation-building process . 
  which is what/where ? 
  if half of portugal was founded by those same spanish and theirs longer than the portoguese , who only happened to arrive in the late middle-ages-early renaissance there for ~ 4 centuries . 
  europe is n't the world 's refugee camp . 
  they are muslim and close to you culture - you take them . 
  we 'll take ukrainian refugees and such closer to our culture . 
  peace for all . 
  it 's not our problem most wars keep getting fought within muslim countries . 
  [ serious ] what is the claim the romanians have of it ? 
  at what point did they inhabit southern dobroja even at 20 % of the demographic ? 
  to me it sounds like bulgaria claiming cyprus . 
  depends which ones . 
  some were captured . 
  others were bought . 
  and still others were [ literary made by hand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=finrqcocwge ) or manufactured once they captured land and wealth . 
  it is equally idiotic to believe the world can be rid of all weapons and we can live in a stateless society of disarmed and peaceful hippies . 
  you have no idea of the kind of people that populate this planet . 
  i am sure the parents of the children being raped and murdered in iraq and syria because the local militaries were underprepared to protect them from isis and the other jihadist militias would spit in your delusional anarchist face if they could . 
  the delusions and idiocy of anarchists like you are not just stupid , they are dangerous and cancerous in a world where military threats are still very much a reality . 
  it 's part of nato and as such has obligations to help militarily any nato member who triggers article 5 . 
  if it comes to that having modern and advanced equipment can : 1 . 
  provide better support in that conflict , wherever it may be . 
  save danish lives . 
  i clearly meant it as a continuous cultural-identity group . 
  you do not identify the same way ethno-nationally or state-wise as your ancestors did 2000 years ago . 
  the armenians , however , do . 
  from the 1,153,465 square kilometres we lost . 
  imagine spain reduced to castile alone after a century of occupation and genocide and then asked to be grateful for that . 
  armenia is one of the few truly ancient people who have survived till this day . 
  i 'm polish , we did lose a lot in the 20th century , macedonia is not part of it . 
  come back if you can actually refute any of the facts i laid above . 
  nope , they did n't . 
  they lived in pella and all over what is currently northern greece . 
  [ this was actual ancient kingdom of macedon ] ( http://geonetia.ru/proekt/slov_proect3/images/img_206238.jpg ) - in modern day northern greece . 
  the lands of modern day fyrom were known as paeonia and were neither where alexander and phillip lived/born , or at all where their kingdom and people resided . 
  these slavs in fyrom today , whatever nationality they choose , have nothing to do with the ancient kingdom of macedon or its rulers , yet they build them monuments and call stuff after them . 
  they even [ dress themsleves as alexander 's warriors for plays and such ] ( http://vek21press.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/big_tn_370719macedonian-falanga-2005.jpg ) or go as far as to invite some afghan royalty or whatever and claim he is a descendand of alexander returning to `` his people '' . 
  it 's a circus of a country really . 
  if it is a proof of their recent national creation and utter lack of any separate national history - is up to everyone to decide for themselves . 
  by having offical statues of alexander the great , names of the airport , names and statues of phillip , and other such commemorations regarding ancient macedonia is n't the republic of macedonia effectively claiming that ancient state as its historical predecessor ? 
  the soviet occupation of bessarabia , bukovina , eastern poland , latvia , lithuania , estonia , invasion of finland or hungary is `` dirty insinuations '' . 
  to use so desperately whatever my nationality you believe is against my argument here means you believe in ancestral and national guilt that should dictate what rights they have to speak today based on what their ancestors or members of their nations did , correct ? 
  actually in polish history it is remembered as the best of the 3 empires that partitioned it - with prussia and especially russia being far more brutal , oppressive , backwards and illiberal . 
  austria championed what was known as `` enlightened absolutism '' as opposed to prussia 's military absolutism ( later prussian constitutionalism ) or russia 's samoderzhavie . 
  the poles were the least oppressed and the least assimilated in austria of all the empires , and the same applied to the other nations within austria . 
  it certainly was n't as bad as others of it 's time , and `` prison of nations '' in fact was far more relevant for russia . 
  bulgaria was [ indeed much larger than shown here ] ( http://thewaythetruthandthelife.net/map/european-atlas-500-929_files/ce893-927_tsar-simeon-bulgaria-by-todor-bozhinov-519px.bmp ), 
  not in the [ 13th century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/bulgaria_under_iwan_assen_ii.jpg ) it certainly was n't , and yet still much larger than shown here . 
  i am not bulgarian , i am polish , the very idea that you can dismiss an accusation towards the red army on the grounds of someone 's nationality is pathetic . 
  even if i was bulgarian i did n't commit the above crimes , did i ? 
  i am an individual who is responsible for his crimes only , so it would only be hypocrisy if i were a rapist who accused the red army of rape . 
  i am not , so i have as much right to accuse it as anyone else in the world . 
  individuals do not carry ancestral responsibility or national one for the acts of other individuals . 
  because of the above 2 points there is absolutely no need for me to defend or excuse bulgaria to have the right to criticise the red army . 
  but i will still do it because you are also factually wrong : - bulgaria participated in the second world war only to reunite with its ethnic lands that were taken from it in the balkan and first world war . 
  it did n't declare war on the soviet union and remained the only axis power to keep diplomatic relations with it and not send any army to help hitler in his conquests . 
  at what point in russian history was all private enterprise , private capital or private wage labour abolished ? 
  i graduated history and still ca n't think of such examples in russia , and for the world i can only think of extremely short lived examples when it comes to prior the 20th century . 
  all such examples in world history that lasted for more than a few months/couple of years , were marxist soviet-style regimes of the 20th century . 
  the marxist nature of the ussr is in my view ridiculous to deny , regardless of its other - imperialist , despotic and colonial attitudes . 
  if anything , the presence of the latter merely show marxism can easily coexist with them , instead of being the liberatory force in some people 's minds . 
  i nowhere disagreed it was imperialism as well . 
  but society itself absolutely * was * subjected to numerous marxist economic and social elements , such as the above mentioned ones . 
  were the people robbed of their land in collectivisation ?

  people believe it increased , because they think those in power had/have direct access to steal from multimillion funds on top of the national ones . 
  at least , that is what i 'm reading in comments in various forums . 
   grain of salt i need to note here that the communist party that ruled bulgaria until 1989 was just renamed to the socialist party . 
  until all of them and the few other parties that , left it and formed other ( small ) leftist parties , are either in jail or leave the political scene for good , people would still believe russia is not-so-visibly-anymore dictating the country . . 
  i tried . 
  thank you for the compliment !, 
  yes , of course . 
  here 's some insights on both current and past events this year : 1 .

  i will leave the conclusions to you . 
  `` shock '' ) ` newspaper ' has them all !, 
  erm , this might sound rather egoistic , but / u/cnthlpbtmknwaccnt asked * me * , hence the voting on your comment . 
  thank you for sharing your views , but your lack of flair makes me feel suspicious about your comment a little and i assume the others do as well . . a few sources would be great !, 
  i 'll respond to him/her once i get home later on as i 'm currently at work ( having a break right now and on phone ) . 
  i also called it * stupid * , but apology accepted . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  did you miss the part where i call it a ** nonsense ** ? 
  quoting the article here :  ' 90 % of the media in bulgaria work for russian masters ' so , seeing as the media are the ones spilling conspiracy theories all over the place , how could they even consider spilling a theory as the one you mentioned , which assumingly noone ever wrote about ? 
  thoughts ? 
  i see . 
  good . 
  thank you !, 
  please , read the article i linked . 
   document was removed from the defense ministry 's website yesterday should i assume the removal was decided on the meeting of the security council at the prime minister yesterday ? 
  or did they remove it before that ? 
  do you know ? 
  genuinely interested . 
  [ so did we for almost 2 years ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_bulgaria_during_world_war_ii#initial_neutrality_.281939.e2.80.931941.29 ) !, 
  it was then that we got southern dobrudja back . 
  however , today there is no massive bulgarian population outside the current borders of bulgaria in contrast with the situation back in wwii , so neither nato nor russia can incite us in taking their side with territorial gains for bulgaria on the table . 
  also , it is stupid to think about such things as eventually gaining territories , because seeing as ** we can barely take care of the population we have in the current territory ** , how could we even think we 'll be able to provide care for the eventual `` additions '' ?!, 
  i call nonsense on that and that is why ( but not only ) i see no better option than try to be neutral in these matters . 
  edit : ** tl ; dl : ** ** no wars or territorial gains are ** and should * not * be ** sought by bulgarians ** in my opinion . 
  this article speaks so many truths i can not deal . . what i think would be best is to advocate ** neutrality ** in these matters , alas i find no will for such from any of the politicians although it is evident from polls we , the people of bulgaria , hold such a will . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  thank you for sharing your story !, 
  oiii , i ai n't gon na be the driver !, 
  plus , i have no intention in going on a trip and getting drunk * alone * .

  i know this may not have much to do with the questions asked , but some day i would like to visit the [ taraclia district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taraclia_district ) just to hear how those [ bulgarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bessarabian_bulgarians ) there speak and live . 
  i 'm very curious to find out if their bulgarian has got any sensible influence from the romanian ( moldavian ? ), 
  language that is predominant in the country . 
  on a much related note , i 've been told that i could take a bumpy ride to soroca town in northern moldova , through chisinau ( and a few wineries ^ lol ) , and explore the [ soroca fort ] ( http://laspalmas.md/wp-content/uploads/yootheme/widgetkit/gallery/soroca/cetatea%20soroca_4.jpg ) there . 
  that 's exactly what my mother says in relation to my great grandmother . 
  but , but that might make americans [ healthy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_yogurt#health_claims_for_bulgarian_yogurt ) and , and there will be no more `` fat america '' jokes ! 1 !,

  okay , thanks !, 
  latest data is from 2012 or am i doing something wrong ? 
  is there specific data for each region , for males and females , not for the average of the two for the regions , somewhere ? 
  i looked for the past 20 minutes and can not find anything like that . . 
  yes . 
  i noticed where the decimal was standing in the data . 
  to think it could 've been much worse . . 
  i guess we 'll see where it will be heading , but with the war next door i 'm in doubt for a positive ( short-term ) result .

hmmmm , slanina , now that 's something i have n't had in a long time . . 
  honestly , this is a fantastic development . 
  people bitch and moan about how much they hate the government under any government , but this guy actually did really illegal , really creepy shit . 
  let 's hope the justice system holds up in the appeal , 'cause he really needs to be behind bars , at the very least to serve as an example for assholes who feel they 're above the law and above reprimand . 
  itt : op has no clue what he 's talking about , starts flame war anyway . 
  vienna for sure . 
  it was the political and cultural capital of the continent for over a century , and as such influenced every part of europe , even those under ottoman occupation . 
  the city still has that vibe about it - it 's classy , powerful , romantic , everything you could ask for . 
  architecture , food , historical sights and friendly austrians are just the cherry on top of an already amazing place . 
  ** bulgaria ** most notably , university students in sofia renewed their [ occupation ] ( http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=157556 ) of the main lecture hall of sofia university st. kliment ohridski , again demanding a resignation from the oresharski government . 
  i think we 'd all be pretty well-off if we reunited with west bulgaria ( a.k.a. 
  macedonia ), 
  ` mutri ' in bulgarian . 
  actually , for the most part , bsp supporters could afford to rent busses because local party offices used part of their collected membership dues , while dps chartered trains . 
  also , many of the anti-government protests were/are funded by gerb , so they 're on equal footing . 
  correction - ataka ( the fascist party ) never actually voted in support of the oresharski government , but their refusal to vote lowered the quorum size , making it possible to pass legislation with 120 votes , and no , there is no economic evidence that bulgarians were living on $ 3 - $ 4 / month in 1997 - certainly , people were poor , but you 're grossly exaggerating . 
  that was the last one . 
  we elected a new one in may , and the current protests started about a month after that . 
  yeah , well leaving the country is n't gon na make the situation any better , is it ? 
  good riddance , i say . 
  the population of bulgaria is actually not genetically slavic . 
  proto-bulgarians may have adopted the slavic language and customs , but remained very much a separate entity . 
  in fact , recent genealogical studies found that slav dna makes up less than 3-4 % of the normal bulgarian genotype , much less than what you 'd find in poles , ukrainians , and even serbs . 
  well , comonut already mentioned levski , but i 'd have to say berbatov . 
  he 's probably the only bulgarian most people can name off the top of their head , and damn if he is n't glorious on the football field . 
  the capture of [ adrionopole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_adrianople_ ( 1913 ) in 1913 was an incredible military feat . 
  also , the fact that the alphabet invented by two bulgarian monks is today one of the major writing systems in the world . 
  damn you , irish !, 
  that title was rightfully ours !, 
  fact . 
  awh , hardly anyone has tried bulgaria yet . . 
  this is definitely the better of two shitty possible outcomes . 
  i 'd prefer to see the socialists ( bsp ) and the turks ( dps ) form a government , because the alternative would be a coalition between the conservative ( gerb ) and the fascist ( ataka ) parties , and that would be no good at all . 
  wow , for once bulgaria is winning at something . . 
  you do n't sell rakia by the liter , you sell it by the [ kilo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmacwtjftk0 ) , obviously . 
  i can offer you 20 leva for 6 kilos ? 
  de jure , you must be 18 to purchase both tobacco and alcohol . 
  in reality though , not a single establishment i 've been to has ever carded me , or even feigned an interest in my age . 
  they 've tried to push for enforcement of the legal smoking/drinking age , but right now you can be twelve , and walk out of a corner store with a carton of cigs and handle of liquor , no questions asked . 
  smoking is pretty much universally accepted . 
  there 's been some recent legislation to try to prohibit it in bars and public places , but again , most establishments skirt the law and allow it anyway . 
  heavy taxes have been levied on ready-made cigs lately , in an attempt to raise prices to the eu averages , which has prompted a large portion of the population to buy cut tobacco and roll their own , which is much cheaper . 
  beer is consumed as freely as coca-cola , and is actually cheaper , most of the time . 
  most households distill their own strong drinks ( rakia , predominantly ) and wine . 
  weed is illegal , of course , but very easily available , and cops tend to turn a blind eye to it 's usage , at least in my experience . 
  psychedelic shrooms grow many places throughout the country , and have become almost as popular as weed . 
  other drugs , also illegal , are less common . 
  history begs to differ . 
  [ here ] ( http://i626.photobucket.com/albums/tt347/lantonov/karta_bg_migracii.gif ) is a demographic map of the balkan peninsula from the end of the 19th century . 
  it matches the treaty of san stefano nearly perfectly . 
  the distribution of land was correct , but yes , bulgaria would 've served the interests of russia , which was bad for western powers . 
  furthermore , the treaty of san stefano was later completely destroyed thanks to the treaty of berlin . 
  san stefano declared liberation and planned out a grand bulgarian nation , which both bulgarians and russians preferred . 
  the treaty of berlin , created by bismarck and the great powers a while later is actually the one that established the new borders , and the one that screwed us over completely . 
  compare bulgaria under [ san stefano ] ( http://www.promacedonia.org/en/dr/dr_map_34.jpg ) to bulgaria under the [ treaty of berlin ] ( http://seriesofhopes.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/800px-southeast_europe_1878.jpg ) . 
  that 's why we celebrate on the 3rd of march . 
  bad shit is happening right now . 
  massive protests , a broken government , foreign monopolies , wage/pension stagnation , and to top it all off - parliamentary elections in the summer . 
  ca n't wait to see how this plays out , but i 'm betting it wo n't be good . . 
  this unicorn is completely correct . 
  let me add to your list . 
  shumi maritsa - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tfet0f8sha koi ushi bairaka - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpnhscs9myw voda - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjqogtpyfnw, 
  the fact that your ruling party named itself after vmro , a bulgarian organization created to free macedonia , is in itself an insult . 
  bulgarian turks have every legal right to vote , as long as they live in bulgaria . 
  his party , however , ( the movement for rights and freedoms ) relies in part on the vote of turks living in turkey , who do n't live in bulgaria , nor speak bulgarian . 
  this is possible because bulgaria considers you a citizen , or at least eligible for citizenship , based on heritage . 
  these people claim bulgarian ancestry , get paid to vote , then go back to turkey . 
  ok , here 's what 's up - first off , the guy staring down the barrel is ahmed dogan , a bulgarian of turkish ethnicity . 
  he got his start in the late 80 's and early 90 's as more or less a domestic terrorist . 
  at the time , the bulgarian ( communist ) government was doing some pretty dickish stuff to the turkish population of bulgaria , including changing their names and threatening/otherwise harassing them . 
  this guy , dogan , in retaliation to the regime , blew up a fuckin ' train , full of women and children and everything . 
  he was thrown in jail , and later sentenced to 10 years . 
  however , as the communist government in bulgaria crumbled apart in ' 89 , he was pardoned , less than a year after being sentenced , and he immediately founded a political party , and entered the newly-democratized government structure . 
  here 's what you need to know about his party - it is completely ethnically-based . 
  they win seats in parliament because 100 % of the turkish minority in bulgaria is behind them . 
  they gain even more seats through election fraud - bussing non-bulgarian turks into the country to vote for them every election . 
  dogan has gone on to do even more scandalous stuff , which he was acquitted of recently , and his party is actually pretty influential - their support is in the teens , and they were part of the ruling coalition for 8 years , until 2009 . 
  this is why this assassination attempt matters - dogan knows that the fate of his political influence lies in the hands of ethnic turks in bulgaria . 
  any threats on him , or any sort of violence against turks will be seen as ethnic aggression , and gain him much support , and many more votes in the upcoming parliamentary elections . 
  ideally , these aggression would come from ataka - bulgaria 's nationalist , right-wing , insane fringe party . 
  they have had their sights on this guy ( metaphorically , of course ) for years . 
  that is not the case , however . 
  this is what does n't make sense about this whole scenario - he was attacked by another turkish-bulgarian , wielding a non-lethal gas gun ( maybe lethal at this range , i do n't know . . ) . 
  this means one of two things - either this was just a super-shitty assassination attempt , the motives behind which are murky and uncertain , or , and i feel this is the more likely case - he was hired by dogan 's party to carry out that botched attempt , with the sole purpose of gaining support in an election year . 
  of course , it 's confusing why they would hire a turk instead of a racist bulgarian , but i 'm sure the next few days we 'll find out more about this guy and his motives . 
  honestly though , was anyone actually surprised at france ? 
  did n't think so . . 
  it 's offensive ? 
  eat a dick , plz . 
  i suddenly see germany in an entirely different light . . 
  due to the bgn 's peg with the dm during the late 1990 's , that 's still the exact exchange rate of leva to euro !, 
  can i have one ? 
  wow , the audience really does n't want russia to win , huh ? 
  there is actually no real evidence to suggest that stalin , or any of his top guys , we 're actually planing on attacking the third reich . 
   dressing black today finally !, 
  the perfect occasion to wear my new grill , do-rag and bulls jersey, 
   german nudist sea lol . 
   love love peace peace eurovision in a nutshell . . 
  at the end of bulgaria 's performance : `` i do n't know that she was saying , but it sounded like ` buy me a loofah . ' '', 
  - `` and who does n't love a good loofah ?? '',

  same for bulgaria . 
  most people use bulgarian trackers . 
  this is bullshit , i was watching the air traffic live at the time . 
  there was no other civilian aircraft in the air at the time . 
  flights to istanbul were cancelled all over . 
  this was the only civilian plane allowed to land . 
  it 's not difficult to figure out who is on the plane . 
  shit , even i knew which was erdogan 's plane then just by following skyscanner at the time . 
  pretty much the whole world knew which was his plane . 
  i also remember that bulgarian live tv showing the skyscanner website as his plane was approaching the airport . 
  sure , then there will be a terrorist attack and he will add a few more months . 
  then another one and a few more months , etc. 
  so just like france . 
  this is happening much faster than i thought it would . 
  most of the grunts on the ground during the coup are conscripts , right ? 
  the whole thing was just really sad for me to watch . 
  so much death , on all sides and all that so that erdogan can become even more of a cunt . 
  now , there 's lynchings , beatings and total dehumanization , even against the conscripts who did n't even want to be there . 
  next thing up : fire medical doctors for providing medical assistance to the coupers and gulenists , because this clearly that makes them complicit . 
  erdogan fired 36 % of all judges in the country yesterday alone and 5 judges from the supreme court . 
  i am guessing the constitution would n't get in the way . 
  when they declared martial law and curfew on the tv , they explicitly stated that they `` wo n't hurt civilians '' . 
  i refuse to believe that the military is so fucking dumb . 
  there were definitely jets flying over istanbul as erdogan was landing . 
  i remember that very well because i was watching sky 's livestream and the reporter had to pause because of the jets flying over her . 
  the helicopter downing was confirmed false i think . 
  i think this was confirmed false , they did n't shoot down any helicopters . 
  but we know for a fact that a helicopter was shooting up the parliament . 
  if the f-16s were n't allied with the coupers , then why did n't they shoot down the helicopter which was firing on the parliament ? 
  if they were allied with the coupers , then why did n't they shoot down erdogan 's plane as he was landing in istanbul ? 
  it seems like somebody got set up . 
  but then again low flying jets will definitely wake up people and alert them that something is up . 
  looks like erdogan is the one doing the coups from now on . 
  cnn turk taken over by soldiers . 
  wtf is going on ?!, 
  bulgarian tv is reporting that a helicopter was shot down by a military jet !, 
  no idea what the primary source is . 
  bulgarian tv is reporting that a helicopter was shot down by a military jet !, 
  no idea what the primary source is . 
  helicopter gunfire , shit 's getting real !, 
  well , that 's been a pretty eventful week ... 
  pretty obvious this is deliberate and not an accident , 100 % terrorist attack . 
  how can i help ? 
   cameron goes back to downing street and puts all his stuff in the removal van you are obviously well-informed so i have a very important question . 
  do you know what happens to [ larry the cat , the chief mouser of the cabinet ofiice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larry_%28cat%29 ) ? 
  will cameron take him ? 
  i am very concerned here , please answer . 
  yes , this is precisely the part which you made up . 
  everybody here is talking about the news and you are going on attacking some strawman . 
  you are saying the new rightists are using the phrase in some specific context . 
  i was thinking the specific context is what we are actually talking about and not something you made up . 
  i just went over to breitbart and checked all articles related to the festival . 
  no mention of regressive left . 
  who exactly are these new righters who are using it in the specific context ? 
  you are claiming that only the new right is using this , i am showing counterexample . 
  the term regressive left was introduced by maajid nawaz who is a liberal democrat , which is probably not part of the new right , but i am not very good with the latest labels . 
  he is not a war criminal because he did n't actually commit any war crimes . 
  people are pissed at him for starting the war , but that is not something which he can be charged with because this was n't codified as a crime at the time of the invasion . 
  he can not be tried under a law introduced with retroactive effect , so he will not be charged with anything in the hague . 
  simple as that . 
  what you hear from politicians about how they will hold him to account etc. 
  is just populist bullshit . 
  tony blair is not going to jail , he wo n't even be charged with anything in the hague . 
  the only way to charge him with a crime is some bs ambiguous law like misconduct in office under british law and even then there are very slim chances he will be found guilty of anything . 
  he basically figured out how to invade iraq without breaking any laws personally . 
  i know . 
  but corbyn and friends seem to think they have some magical powers which would somehow put tony blair on trial . 
  blairite has become a derogatory term which has lost almost all meaning now . 
  i do n't even know what it is supposed to mean anymore . 
  the way i interpret it is `` not left-wing enough '' . 
  his approval rating is still lower than that of ed milbiand under whom labour got anhilated in the last general elections . 
  labour is also polling very badly right now . 
  how exactly will tony blair be prosecuted ? 
  blair can not be tried in the hague . 
  this has been stated multiple times already by the court itself . 
  which court would take care of tony blair and under what charge ? 
  this is excellent news , job well done for everyone involved with this . 
  this news is also very encouraging because there 's been push for more electronic governance in bulgaria . 
  it 's good to see actual results and i am looking forward to seeing what will be done in the future . 
  the author of the blog post also has a blog in bulgarian where he talks a lot about this kind of stuff . 
  you can tell he is passionate about this and i wish him the best of luck . 
  i am talking about the times article you moron , not youtube . 
  the times . 
  this is precisely the part which i am saying is idiotic . 
  if you want to attack the source , go ahead , i do n't care . 
  what i am saying is that your first reply in this thread is absolutely ridiculous -- you are making excuses for his reported drunken behavior by presenting it as some sort of diplomatic trick . 
  very well said . 
  hahahahah , i am jumping to conclusions ? 
  we only know that guy gets drunk while doing business , you are the one doing mental gymnastics trying to paint this as some sort of wise move . 
  there 's also a difference between `` calling out the meeting on its lack of legitimacy '' and being drunk , so cut the crap . 
  next time he gets so drunk , gets his dick out and pisses in a plant that would probably be some cunning political move as well i suppose . 
  he is so smart !, 
  seeing that not even historians can agree on this , this seems like a poorly thought out law . 
  so if someone denies that holodomor is a genocide and he is charged , then the judge will have to decide whether that is a genocide or not ? 
  so the courts will provide a list of genocides ? 
  or how will this work ? 
  i have no idea . 
  article 7 is the closest you get to kicking out http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu, 
  this should be done by their government , not by the eu . 
  otherwise the political consequences will be severe .

  even if we have to go bankrupt , it will still be worth it to just once shove it so far up their asses , that in the future they actually start to think twice before trying to manipulate us in petty ways and not prioritize our needs first . 
  and a tl ; dr for all those unwilling to commit a few minutes : this year bulgaria has seen the most intense national uprising in decades . 
  protests started in february and you can read more about them here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_against_the_borisov_cabinet . 
  the most shocking events in the protests were the series of self-immolations by desperate citizens https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_bulgarian_self-immolations . 
  the resignation of the borisov cabinet led to preliminary elections which resulted in a `` hung parliament '' . 
  more on that here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_parliamentary_election,_2013 . 
  public outrage reached its height after the appointment of delyan peevski , ** a very controversial ** political figure , as the head of dans - the bulgarian state security agency . 
  after the constitutional court allowed peevski to return to parliament , students occupied the sofia university , being followed several days later by universities accross the country . 
  more on that here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_against_the_oresharski_cabinet in more recent news , the socialist and * centrist * parties bsp and dps are shipping people from around the country by the busload to form counter-protests in favor on the current government .

  you 're making it too easy . 
  the problem with the dispute is that by maintaining their current stance on the matter ( not just the name ) , they 're sparkling very big controversies among academics regarding historical inaccuracies , which macedonians refer to as facts . 
  in bulgaria it is the turkish party pandering to them for years for their votes . 
  i 'll be very impressed if someone manages to dig up something that looks like an academic paper with another explanation . 
  some people have a hard time believing this . 
  if you are retired and do n't have a job or a family to take care of you , you pretty much barely have enough to eat . 
  people were really sad when he renounced his bulgarian citizenship . 
  but i am happy for him because he would have never made the best of his talents if he had n't left . 
  there are so many legends in sport who did not want to go further and stayed behind . 
  and i thought it was ancient aliens .

  not to mention all those dangerous toilets people do n't know how to use and keep falling into . 
  twenty years `` africans bitching about chinese neo-colonialism '',

  wow , that 's huge compared to sofia !, 
  mine is 60sq , 1 bedroom for 250euro/m and pretty far from the city center . 
  average for something decent is 200euro/m . 
  always thought that athens was expensive . 
  very impressed . 
  same reason why you do n't hear your friends talking about it . 
  they think it 's not important . 
  very surprisingly , people forget these things . 
  just talk to your average person about the early stages of the conflict , before isis and russia started playing major roles in it . 
  they say one of the blasts was his body bursting out of the mausoleum and hurling itself at the grand national assembly building . 
  that 's understandable . 
  it 's the same here . 
  we 've been doing this eu dance a couple of years now and people still think commission and parliament are two words for the same thing . 
  do n't worry , people will start trusting the commission a lot less when you join and see how it works . 
  those who keep up with the trend will benefit . 
  those that refuse to adapt will not . 
  the replies under this comment are gon na be interesting . 
   red bull first they drop people from the stratosphere and now this ? 
  [ we 're both kinda wrong . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro_banknotes#statistics ) looks like there are about 15 countries that print them . 
  still , there 's costs to the state . 
  state 's central bank has to report to ecb for oversight and cover transporting fresh new euro bills from the printing country 's central bank . 
  i 'm pretty sure they have to get from a to b in an armored vehicle , then be accounted for and then distributed to local banks , etc. 
  yeah , we save on conversion fees when making transactions . 
  but then there will be new costs with having euro bills imported because we ca n't print them here . 
  no one in their right mind will ever remove the peg , but i guess they said the same about britain leaving the eu . 
  they were indeed , not arguing with you . 
  i am only making a point about building up industry . 
  almost everything built at that time has now been abandoned , demolished , or sold off . 
  i do know that . 
  it was exactly because of technology from east germany and czechia that weaker states could catch up . 
  comecon nearly abolished intellectual property rights in 1949 . 
  this is what i refer to as ** acceleration ** of industrial development . 
  not trying to disprove anything else that has been said so far , but people here give them credit for contributing to the acceleration of industrial development in bulgaria . 
  we were never in cccp though, 
  i like how people in turkey are taught that they 're all high ranking government officials , while in bulgaria and romania we 're taught they were all slaves lol . 
  most unbiased sources show that slaves/officials were rare ends of both spectrums and the majority were just soldiers . 
  we are doing ** salty ** now . . why have n't you been paying attention ? 
  where do you guys find all these witches to burn each year ? 
  were n't we supposed to refer to the czech republic as czechia now by their request ? 
  guys , the title is a link to the thread that happened over at / r/iama . 
  thanks for clarifying that . 
  i was n't even going to click it before i read your comment . 
  yeah , i read your comment a second time and edited mine . 
  dealing with sales people all day here as well . 
  love it when i get calls regarding how they imagine some metrics should be interpreted and how statistics fails to recognize their potential . 
  i think their head of marketing was equally pleased with both of them, 
  i think there is a misunderstanding on my part regarding different forms of headscarves .

  first step ... what are you gon na do with all the mexicans ? 
  i 'm 1.60 and going to maastricht for me was like stepping into narnia . 
  dutch girls also were n't super into me wanting to climb up them btw, 
  stay here , russia will be coming to us soon : ^ ), 
  meanwhile , bulgaria is actually trying to get there, 
  touch\u00e9, 
  i completely agree with you . 
  restoring these buildings , which some are already at least a hundred years old , would have been a beautiful sight .

  you ' r the one playing `` what ifs '' with `` the war would have played out completely differently '' . 
  the defence of moscow would be the same if it happened before winter came , as long as the syberian divisions were there . 
  they stopped the germans , not the winter . 
  you can now answer this with a 5th post in a row that says `` winter helped '' or actually get this conversation going somwhere , cause it 's getting tedious to just tell you it was the syberian divisions that stopped the germans and you ignoring that with `` but the winter helped ... '' . 
  you ' r stubbornly denying to either admit you ' r wrong or address the point here - the syberian divisions , and that gets the conversation stuck . 
  you are because you are merely describing the negative effects of winter on its own , without the context , which is that the wehrmacht was only immobile during the 2 weeks of autumn rains , but as the ground hardened it was making rapid progress towards moscow again . 
  the winter alone would n't stop it from taking the city if the siberian divisions had n't arrived in the last moment . 
  meaning it was their arrival the wehrmacht was effectively racing against , not the winter 's , since the divisions stopped it , whilst the winter merely slowed them . 
  we ' r not arguing if winter had a negative effect on the wehrmacht , that 's a given , but rather what stopped them from taking moscow . 
  which was the divisions from the far east , not the wheather . 
  because modern warfare does n't kill anywhere near enough people to actually make a difference . 
  in a world of 7 billion , it would take the death of at least tens of millions of have an impact on the environment . 
  warfare itself , however , consumes a lot of resources , pollutes , and diverts investment from development that could take countries closer to sustainability . 
  it destroys infrastructure and consumes raw materials only to create a greater need for raw materials and resources later on at reconstruction . 
  how much oil is wasted to rebuild a city after it was blown to bits ? 
  how much metal and stone excavated ? 
  war is essentially a huge waste of resources and that increases the environmental pressure thousands of times more than the deaths of a few thousand relieves it . 
  the regular soviet soldiers ( not syberian divisions ) had equally no preparation or equipment for the winter as the soviet supply system had all but collapsed . 
  the tens of thousands frozen in the moscow counteroffensive shows that . 
  do n't divert into straws , the original argument still stands - the arrival of the syberian divisions stopped the wehrmacht from taking moscow , not the winter . 
  no , decisions that lead to the syberian divisions of 800,000 to arrive in time to defend moscow - the key transport hub that connected all railways of european russia , political , demographic and economic centre . 
  winter or not winter they would ' v defended it , so the rush was for the germans to get to moscow before the divisions did , not before winter did . 
  sure winter had a negative impact , but it was equal to both sides - the russians suffered huge casualties due to the temperatures during their january counter-offensive . 
  volleyball . 
  and he was right . 
  they had all the chance of taking the leningrad-moscow-astrakhan line that would effectively render the ussr dead . 
  they failed not because of winter , but because of strategic decisions in the middle of the summer . 
  the two panzer groups of army group centre were capable of taking moscow in late july , but did n't due to the kiev pocket . 
  it was n't 1812 in any way shape or form . 
  isis gives russia the perfect opportunity to get the west off of its back over what it did and does in ukraine . 
  `` cmon guys , forget about it already , we ' v a new common enemy now '' . 
  if the west falls for this and waves the sanctions or abandons ukraine it will be a clear message to the kremlin that their strategy works and they can get away with expansion this way . 
  same as after the georgian war , which made them bold enough to go for ukraine . 
  you let ukraine slide and they 'll go for something else next . 
  also , minimalizing and trivializing words like queen into `` queenie '' '' * does not a point make * '' either . 
  why not just stay in burgas as it is ? 
  we need tourism money too , do n't go give them to kebab ... :(, 
  took me a while to figure out it was sideways . 
  i imagine structure of urbanisation plays more of a role than population density . 
  wallachia has the same population as bulgaria , yet it 's extremely densely red here , because its low urbanisation rate means thousands of large villages and small towns of a few thousand people , whereas in bulgaria half the entire population is concentrated in just 4 red dots - sofia , plovdiv , varna and burgas , with a few dozen large towns of tens of thousands people hold the rest of the population . 
  same with serba , which has almost the exact population and territory as bulgaria , yet is more white here , and greece , which has the same population density as romania , yet is far white here due to concentration of people in athens and thessaloniki . 
  default naming choices for selected countries : `` charles de gaulle '' , `` ataturk '' , `` kenedy '' . 
  can bulgaria pls ? 
  taxes are n't `` socialism '' . 
  the public ownership of the means of production is . 
  impose quotas on immigrants to the eu with a categorization system . 
  people from islamic societies at the bottom of the list , with close to no chance of being allowed to migrate to europe , lest they are highly valued and proven experts in some fields . 
  then return to the idea of state assimilation , which built nations like the french in the first place , making it an aim of the state to uproot completely and thoroughly any foreign culture ( including foreign religion ) from children born in the country . 
  rather than cherishing the growth of parallel communities and foreign exclaves as some misguided , artificial `` diversity '' , europe should cherish nation-building through assimilation and the reinforcement of certain non-negotiable traits of the nation . 
  islam being part of those traits in no european countries other than a few balkan ones , and thus considered incompatible with a full belonging to any of the other nations . 
  `` hey this right here is threatening to burn our house , but do n't look at it !, 
  look at this over there which is threatening to too . '', 
  how is the presence of right-wing extremists in any way negating the fact we are also growing islamist extremists by the thousands in europe ? 
  or how is it even relevant to this thread ? 
  i do not quite follow which is not an intellectual reaction but based on fear - the distates and dissagreement people have with the cultural traits and ideological messages of islam . 
  or the perception muslims will indefinitely continue increasing as a percentage in society due to immigration and high fertility rates , versus european negative rates . 
  which one do you disagree with ? 
  do you consider islam and cultural traits of the societies that are marked by it acceptable and in no way contradictory to european ones . 
  or do you disagree the percentage of muslims will continue to increase if left unchecked ? 
  or both ? 
  it 's radical to not want large waves of migrants from a particular , alien religion and cultural background in your state ? 
  i ' v always wondered - would people like you , the educated and progressive turks presumably from the western part of the country rather have that state split , with a large chunk of the backwards east going to a kurdistan , so that your more enlightened type in the west become a more substantial percentage of the population and exhibit a greater force in the modernisation of the country ? 
  guys this project is based entirely on the voluntary work of a few very bright and passionate young people here , who invest their time and money into it completely out of love for traditional folklore and tales . 
  please be so kind to give them a hand by sharing their project or kickstarter campaign on your facebook page so they can make this thing happen . 
  it is n't paranoia if every extensive research ever done shows the new generations of muslims largely either preserving their parents ' islamic values or getting even more trenched into them . 
  it is rather you , who focus on the little exceptions to say to yourself `` it 's all going to be allright , no need to worry '' that are acting like us republican climate change deniers , who will accept no ammount of big-picture research and instead just focus on the small exceptions to prove there is `` nothing to worry about '' in the long term : `` overwhelming percentages of muslims in many countries want islamic law ( sharia ) to be the official law of the land , according to a worldwide survey by the pew research center . '', 
  http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/ furthermore : while only a very small fraction of muslims actually go on to commit terrorist acts , a significant percentage of the muslim population have favourable attitudes towards terrorism , violence in defence of islam , sharia , and oppression of women , homosexuals , and basic human rights . 
  even the `` moderate '' muslims are still vastly socially backwards compared everyone else in a secular , liberal democracy .

  your rationale is that of a conqueror/imperialist . 
  we do n't * need * to take something they have . 
  we need to * reunite * our country and nation divided by the serbo-yugoslav nation-creation experiment . 
  all of your ancestors , all of them , are rolling in their graves from the existance of this made up nation stealing our history and brainwashing our former bulgarian co-nationals . 
  increasing the german defence budget from 1.29 % to 2 % means a transfer of massive ammounts of money . 
  they have to come from somewhere so regardless if they would cut the healthcare and education , or say their eco subsidies and infrastructural projects , they would have to cut * something * that they can currently enjoy thanks to the us footing the bill on nato . 
  so my point stands - it 's not europe that is a `` slave '' of the us if the us provides europe with a free service that innevitably benefits it rather than exploit it like happens with a slave . 
  i 'd love to see bullfighting if it actually * was * bullfighting or a sport . 
  as in - one healthy bull , one man with whatever cold-steel weapon and armour he wants , one arena . 
  they actually fight to the death , if the bull wins he gets comfy life somwhere until natural death . 
  if the bullfighter does , he gets a ton of money and goes up in the ranking . 
  there will be a rank list , bets , even teams . 
  proper sport . 
  not the current , boring as fuck , cruel and unfair ritual slaughter of a weak and confused bull by a whole bunch of guys over a long period of time , with zero chance of the bull winning or any excitment , competition or anything that would actually classify it as a sport . 
  our golgotha . 
  a slave provides you with stuff/services for free whilst you just enjoy it . 
  like the us does with their military to europe whilst we spend meager ~ 1.4 % of gdps on the armies and instead brag about our free healthcare and education . 
  considering the huge fuss it made here that they are `` taking money from pensioners to comply with nato `` dictate '' when rich countries like germany barely spend anything '' - i am pretty sure they did , to some extend at least . 
  still my point stands - eastern europe spends far more of their gdps than western , with few exceptions like the uk . 
  so it 's obvious the arrogant dude up there was whining against e.europe merely as an excuse for not wanting it in nato to begin with , because if he really cared that much about expenditure , it 's states like germany he should be most angry at . 
  not really , it needs a clerical body in control to be that , like iran 's guardian council . 
  turkey is moving more towards pure , simple old authoritarianism through the usual route of a dictator supported by a large mass of populists and reactionaries . 
  old data , bulgaria 's [ new programming period for the military from 2014 ] ( http://www.investor.bg/biudjet-i-finansi/333/a/razhodite-za-otbrana-dostigat-2-ot-bvp-do-2016-g-181060/ ) introduced an increase to 2 % by the start of 2016 and planned 2.4 % by 2020 . 
  meanwhile , germany is spending 1.29 % despite being the absolute strongest , healthiest economy in the eu with a huge surplus . 
  basically the poorest in nato pay their fair share and the richest do n't . 
  a bit like in society . 
  at the same time , the bulgars are recorded by byzantine chronicles as the second largest tribe inside the hunnic confederation and the tribe that led the remaining horde back east when attila died , yet we neither use the name attila , nor does anyone associate us with them . 
  perception of history is strange , really . 
  you mean albania , right ? 
  shiptars will be the majority in fyrom long before all bulgarians are gone . 
  whereas we ca n't even count how many times more politicians you have in prison , because our 0 ca n't be multiplied by any number to reach your hundreds . 
  it 's the one where glorious defenders of europe strike back at the invaders and retake the heartland of christianity that was ripped out by the aggressor . 
  so does estonia ( 2 % ) , bulgaria ( 2 % ) , romania ( 2.1 % ) and poland ( 2.2 % ) , whilst lithuania and latvia will reach the 2 % by 2020 . 
  your entire premise in this comment section that e.europe does n't `` deserve '' to be in nato because it does n't pay its share is simply the product of your lack of information mixed with arrogance . 
  in reality , western europe is where the countries with the lowest military expenditure as % of gdp in the entire world are concentrated . 
  they are the proper nato free-loaders , yet you whine about eastern europe . 
  it 's a tad bit dishonest to make up arguments like these rather than just admit your personal bias towards that part of the continent which is the real reason to not want them in nato , not made critera about spending that would actually first kick western europe from the alliance , not eastern . 
  macedonia , here we come again !, 
  naaah , i just think you did n't realize that many countries in europe sounded like that before people started pointing it out to you . 
   it 's ok to be wrong dude , chill . 
  so , pretty much all of europe ? 
  in english : austria , latvia , estonia , russia , croatia , slovenia , slovakia , bulgaria , romania , serbia . 
  in latin and slavic languages : germania , anglia , italia , francia , dania , norvegia , svecia , hollandia , belgia , ispania , portugalia , polonia , hungaria , czechia , finlandia , grecia , turcia , irlandia ...

  dude , you have to be joking if you think any sort of ideology is what makes gerb successful . 
  it 's boko 's personality cult ( fitting for the level of the average bulgarian ) plus the wealth and power of the bulgarian oligarchy and mafia behind him . 
  no one gives two fucks what gerb stands for , it is a completely devout of ideology or political leanings party . 
  boko himself makes zero actual strong stances on either russia or europe . 
  it 's a hollow political project that operates like a business . 
  inside it you have hard-line communist nomenclature people like cecka cacheva or cvetanov on high ranking positions , plus hard-line europeans like andrey kovachev . 
  it 's a circus of all ideologies and parties , merely in power through populism and the strong corporation-like model of the party . 
  outside of it , the actual ideology-driven parties on the other hand are as follows : pro-kremlin ones : bsp - 14 % dps - 14 % ataka - 8 % abv - 4 % pro-western ones : reformators - 10 % that 's it . 
  the russophilic vote gets you far more than the liberal or pro-western one . 
  and combining both in the most neutral , populist manner like gerb does gets you the most . 
  i think the opposite - russophilia used to be contained with the left , bsp and old soviet nostalgics . 
  then , however , in the past few years with putin 's hybrid warfare and turn to the far right , it transfered onto the nationalists and populists . 
  10 years ago i communicated a lot with young nationalists , fascists and neo-nazis - they all hated russia for being previously communist and slavic . 
  ( untermensch to them ) today - they all love it for the social stance of putin and being supposedly `` against the jews , west , bankers and nwo '' . 
  so russophilia exploded by becoming not just a vestage of the old soviet generation , but a political force of all who are part of the `` anti-globalist '' movement , all who are anti-vaccers , who believe in chem trails , haarp , nwo , who talk of bilderberg , rothchilds , zionists , who hate capitalism , the west , the banks , and all who are hard-line racists . 
  basically russophilia dominates the lower 50 - maybe even 60 % of the social spectrum in terms of education and earnings . 
  the populist masses who look at the west as decadent , capitalist and decaying . 
  what makes you think bulgaria has a `` great '' relationship with turkey ? 
  the country is divided ideologically and politically in a very harsh 50/50 between russophilic/soviet nostalgics who hate turkey out of nationalism and the current moscow-ankara split , and the other 50 % are pro-eu , pro-western liberals who hate turkey for being authoritarian , leaning islamist , and also mildly out of nationalism . 
  i see no support for turkey here . 
  maybe they come to our ports so we can double the fleet ? 
  `` one bird does n't make spring '' :d 99,999 % of what the communists build is disgusting in its style and idea . 
  no , i am not a photographer , just found it one net and wanted to share , i believe the source is on the far left corner if you 'd like to check out more of their work . 
  to me it kinda looks like a giant bunker . 
  something about the simple , sturdy , massive round flat-top shape . 
  even if not disgusting as most commie buildings , i 'd definitely not call it beautiful . 
  well here it 's the opposite , we have a very strong `` going to the park '' culture . 
  the only reason sofia has so many large parks is because they planned for already at the start of the 20th century . 
  we have two very , very large parks in the centre and a ton of small ones like the one on the pic . 
  one good thing the communists did was they at least preserved them and did n't build them up , like they did with the rest of the city . 
  on this map you can find the above thread picture showed in the very centre with a little black icon . 
  see how tiny the park showed in the pic is compared to the large green spots on the city : http://www.orangesmile.com/common/img_city_maps/sofia-map-0.jpg, 
  yeah , there 's no denying communist architecture was horrible . 
  but they kinda try make it look nice [ with lights and fountains ] ( http://www.vsekiden.com/uploads/2015/11/14/8b5e678f37c809a41a6501ef7ee22048.jpg ) . 
  the park in front of it looks quite good at the moment ( original thread pic is the back ) : https://s31.postimg.org/nn174dauj/13100731_1746595185598846_6294999301868736743_n.jpg https://s31.postimg.org/lo8hcmn3f/12670926_1002694299817079_562193151448335407_n.jpg, 
  yes it is a minority , but the majority is n't entirely made of `` communist monstrosity '' - the past 25 years have experienced a huge building boom and the city is filled with modern business centers and entire neigbourhoods . 
  everything around the southern ring-road , along bul . 
  bulgaria and much of mladost begins to look like that : http://www.businesspark-sofia.com/uploads/backgrounds/1.jpg http://www.businesspark-sofia.com/uploads/backgrounds/3.jpg, 
  the preserved old parts in the center are very beautiful actually . 
  to be fair , pictured is our version of your `` communist monstrosity '' - the `` palace of culture '' , so definitely not the prettiest of sights in sofia , but i liked the lights . 
  an entire 30 % , a 1/3 of our nation , outright wants us to immediately leave the eu and nato and join the eurasian union . 
  that 's not `` regular likeness of russia '' , that 's last-stage political putinism , and it is expressed by every third bulgarian for christ ' sake . 
  that 's collosal - forgive my godwin 's , but hitler came to power with 32 % of the * voters * . 
  the more mild pro-kremlin people do n't want us to outright join the eurasian union , but that we stay in europe as a sort of `` troyan horse '' - sponge off of their funds but generally aid russia . 
  and this is expressed by 61 % of the people who opposed the eu-wide sanctions on the eu . 
  so we have 30 % who are hard core putinists and want us to joint the eurasian union , and another 30 % who are `` moderate '' putinists , wanting us to stay in the eu to benefit from it , but be russia 's voice inside of the it as in the case of sanctions . 
  that 's 60 % people who are moderately or hard-core ( even divide 50/50 ) pro-kremlin and hate anyone who talks against russia . 
  this is more than enough grounds to consider bulgarian society to be very , very pro-kremlin in comparisson to the rest of europe , and in this case - to romania , where the above numbers of support are in the single digits . 
  over 30 % were the people who outright said we should leave eu , nato and join the eurasian union . 
  that 's the final stage of pro-kremlin people , it does n't get more russophilic than that , and it applies to an entire 1/3 of the nation . 
  the more mild pro-kremlin people do n't want us to outright join the eurasian union , but that we stay in europe as a sort of `` troyan horse '' - sponge off of their funds but generally aid russia . 
  and this is expressed by 61 % of the people who opposed the eu-wide sanctions on the eu . 
  so we have 30 % who are hard core putinists and want us to joint the eurasian union , and another 30 % who are `` moderate '' putinists , wanting us to stay in the eu to benefit from it , but be russia 's voice inside of the it as in the case of sanctions . 
  that 's 60 % people who are moderately or hard-core ( even divide 50/50 ) pro-kremlin and hate anyone who talks against russia , like our president does . 
  boyko knows very well about that 60 % and does n't want to anger them , hence why he is * always * as mild , vague , balanced and neutral on all things related russia and putin . 
  i live in sofia , on blvd vitosha , right in front of raffy - the most central place in the country , and when i go to the national theatre they have almost routinelly a stand with flags next to fountain , which sells exclusive bulgarian and russian flags .

  i moved here for an adventure . 
  how amazing would that be . 
  get all the shitty people off this planet and allow it to finally breathe . 
  yes , canadians are invading bulgaria with 26 of us moving here permanently/year . 
  you 're doing what ? 
  i am canadian living in bulgaria . 
  you want a bulgarian baby ? 
  you are correct , that 's why i moved here from my cushy life in canada . 
  i fucking love it here . 
  or not have them at all . 
  easily the best choice . 
  i got married at 38 , which is about right . 
  waiting was the best decision i 've ever made . 
  not having kids is the second best . 
  scrap all visa requirements globally . 
  keep em ' in line . 
  ohh . . i have walked down this street countless times . 
  so sad . 
  or you can just get the same pair for $ 6usd on ebay including shipping . 
  of course it will . 
  why are they complaining , then ? 
  looks like millions of dollars of very modern tractors . 
  doubt any were ` handed down ' or inherited . 
  wow , these guys must be really wealthy . 
  these tractors cost more than supercars . 
  where do they get the money for these beautiful tractors ? 
  cheers from bulgaria . 
  yes , people still use horses and donkeys to plow fields . 
  turkey is awesome . 
  i go shopping to istanbul at least once a year . 
  it 's like going to another planet , love it there . 
  the russian girls in sunny beach are all used up , have kids and smoke cigarettes . 
  they 're dumb , superstitious and religious . 
  bad . 
  to make a long story short , i wanted to retire early ( before 40 ) and travel the world , living in one of the most expensive places in the world made that impossible . 
  everyone speaks english here , sadly i have n't learned bulgarian . 
  love you , too . 
  i 'm a canadian who moved to the coast about 5 years ago . 
  sunny beach is a ying and yang kind of a place . 
  a total , peaceful ghost town in the winter and a madhouse in the summer . 
  in the winter we travel ( in sweden at this moment ) , in the summer we spend our days dancing on the beach till sunrise . 
  it 's heaven on earth here , just heaven . 
  ohh and i 'm married to a beautiful canadian girl from montreal . 
  if i was n't , i would rather spend time with a forest gypsy in a tracksuit than a russian . 
  awesome . 
  sunny beach is my home , i live in one of the resorts year round . 
  really sucks , care to elaborate ? 
  ... maybe it 's time to move ? 
  budapest is beautiful . 
  its politics and politicians do n't affect me at all . 
  my wife is part hungarian and has a huge family in budapest that we have visited a couple of times . 
  does that count ? 
  i 'm sticking it out . 
  hopefully one day we can all come to a conclusion . 
  i 'm a canadian and i 'm going back to sunny beach today to hrm : drink beer on the beach in the warm sun . 
  eat some shkembe feed my cats . 
  eat my leftover pie that 's sitting in the fridge . 
  hopefully finish witcher 4 , hopefully . 
  need to find a contractor to put new tiles in on my deck , they finally arrived from spain . 
  get an oil change for my van . 
  etc. . . edit - prejudices about romania ? 
  what are you talking about . 
  i visit romania yearly and have probably explored more of it already than the average romanian . 
  i have lots of friends there , macedonia , too . 
  do what where ? 
  please elaborate . 
  i 'm currently in sweden enjoying valentine 's for the weekend . 
  that 's what i 'm doing . 
  what is your question and why the down vote question . 
  why would i down vote you ? 
  sorry , i 'm confused . 
  yeah , i have a little loft on the black sea , heading there tomorrow . 
  took a trip trip to sweden for the weekend and it 's freakkin - 3 right at this moment . 
  yep . 
  i have been to 35 countries now , mostly in europe ... all over north america and even asia and i have never heard anything of this sort ... 
  i have lived in bulgaria for 4 years , explored most of it and made plenty of bulgarian friends and have never , ever heard such horseshit . 
  why is this funny ? 
  is your post meant to be a joke ? 
  my 12 year old niece uses lol when she talks about her cats . 
  could you elaborate please ? 
  i am a canadian living in bulgaria always considering it a european nation . 
  have i been misinformed ? 
  why is this funny ? 
  lol means funny , i am assuming . 
  i think yak is just a blanket term for shitty russian aircraft . 
  please leave the conspiracies to stupid people where they belong . 
  nothing happened except the very obvious . 
  i love bulgaria because it 's cheap enough that i do n't have to work anymore and spend my mondays drinking beers on a beautiful beach . 
  i 'm doing that now . 
  and bulgaria . 
  i am certain that you are incorrect . 
  because it was . 
  russian communist influence is still visible , even today . 
  ca n't wait to go back . 
  yea , saw this with my own eyes . 
  why the apostrophe ? 
  if you guys have n't been to bucharest , i suggest you do . 
  the architecture is staggering, 
  i sat in that square just a few months ago . 
  in english it means ` angry ' .

  i for sure agree with her being overrated and its not that she is n't hot , but a lot of people rate far higher than i would . 
  ofc , at the end its all subjective . 
  are n't those fake ?

  did you just say no country would ever dominate the same way as the us ? 
  lmao . 
  that some ahistorical laughable garbage . 
  i ca n't even imagine the chinese military budget 100 years from now when they would have 2-3 times bigger economy then the us . 
  yea we do . 
  many are archaic tho and used only by the older/rural population .

  its about anarchy , communism , looting and so on . 
  given the fact that you posted this , you seem to be . 
  in any case , anything further will be a waste of time and brain cells . 
  there is not much to say here . 
  maybe you should look around the post of this discussion one or two more times to get the general grasp of the topic . 
  no , i do n't . 
  how is that relevant ? 
  we are in a thread about calling europe an asian peninsula , the point being made is that it would be euroasian , because the existence of the term asia is dependent on europe . 
  yep , it would be a peninsula of euroasia , not asia . 
  as for the name , that is what we call it now , if people have some problem with euro being at the front , i have no problem with a new name that would be fine by everyone . 
  they never had a good reputation here , so nothing has changed . 
  he is technically wrong . 
  the continent would be called euroasia , since the definition of both europe and asia depend on each other . 
  nope . 
  if you do n't count europe as a separate continent you ca n't do that with asia . 
  would have been fine if he said euroasian peninsula , but now he is just wrong . 
  i think it 's football , volleyball and tennis , both in played and watched .

  there were some problems at the shelters in past years but i have n't heard much in 2017 . 
  they are definitely noticeable in center of sofia and around the mosque . 
  my work was in close proximity and i used to see them daily , but i have n't been in the city for like 6 month , so idk about the current situation . 
  first , its not really 10 % , its more like 8 % . 
  second , its mostly ethnic bulgarians and turks , not arabs and lastly , they have been here for quite a long time, 
  yogurt/banitsa/skara ( grilled minced meat ), 
  east asia or canada .

  lol , you are delusional . 
  not at all . 
  we are probably the least religious ones among the orthodox and the church is pretty much non existent in politics . 
  you do n't know what ethnicity means ... 
  pancakes , french toast and other sweet stuff . 
  and you think those are `` free '' ? 
  i guess they have a good pr . 
  i would like to not be a part of it . 
  lol , we do n't even like each other.the idea is a joke . 
  no , i do n't have any interest in it either . 
  id i had to , probably czech republic . 
  no country is worth dying for , my family and friends are worth dying for and if they are in that country when shit hits the fan i am willing to do everything in my power to save them . 
  i would look for a way out . 
  there can be no structure without hierarchy and there can be no hierarchy in an anarchist society . 
  try being more condescending commie . 
  sure thing mate . 
  except for being the closest thing to the imaginary society you are asking about in this thread ? 
  pretty happy with both . 
  for the [ world ] ( http://imgur.com/a/hpvep ) , read switzerland as swaziland and missed georgia from clicking like mad on the small islands . 
  for the [ states ] ( http://imgur.com/a/htxvw ) , got 39 states from the first time , west virginia was a dumb miss . 
  anarchists are the biggest morons on the planet , as far as i am concerned , so i would have to go with option a. 
  no one owes the west anything clown . 
  you have not helped anyone , you are part of a mutually beneficial union , even if it is more beneficial to the west , which got to own the eastern markets and use their cheap labor . 
  superiority complex is something westerners struggle with , not us . 
  nothing , or in other words , my poor and small country did as much as yours . 
  zero . 
  whatever mate , you are free to think your country is helping if it makes you feel good . 
  of course it is nothing , harsh words do n't mean shit in the real world . 
  we are talking about a war and you think some platitudes are in any way relevant ? 
  i do n't expect anything in the case of ukraine , you are the one to bring it up and call germany an `` active side '' . 
  there were no active sides from the west . 
  active side , lmao . 
  do n't know what you think you are doing , but yea , its not going anywhere . 
  there is a line and its enforced by the west , not the east . 
  feel bad ? 
  lol , no one cares if you feel bad about it . 
  this is all about practicality and simple logic . 
  everyone knows the germans wo n't move their fingers if eastern europe gets invaded , no need for delusions . 
  i am very much in the present . 
  maybe , but the far future is not something i care about . 
  your history is irrelevant . 
  the fact is that western europe has never helped the east and there is no reason to believe that his will change . 
  a bet on the us is far safer than one on france or germany . 
  there can never be a close relationship between unequal sides and westerners have never and will never see easterners as equals . 
  there wont ever be a pull towards each other . 
  well , the big fans of the us have become such from necessity . 
  they know that relying on western europe would be their doom , as history has proven time and time again . 
  very american .

  special prisons ? 
  why are the normal ones not good enough ? 
  i think we all know where this is going ... 
  burn the ~ ~ witch ~ ~ g\u00fclenist !, 
  the key thing here is that a new court house will be build , which will be turkey 's largest , specifically to try the putschists , as well as a new prison for them . 
  the court will be in the same place where a `` post-modern coup '' took place in 1997 which was bloodless . 
  so where 's the evidence all slav nations have the same mindset about peaceful and friendly actions ? 
  because your post only touches that with serbia . 
  and for serbia those were n't just mindless attacks , they were meant to facilitate the creation of yugoslavia . 
  wtf is your point ? 
  as if all the other countries in europe and the world have n't waged war against their neighbours ?!, 
  but when slavic nations do it it 's cause they have the same backward mindset ? 
  no , i read it before commenting and i \u00b4 ve read it two more times since then . 
  maybe i 'm thick but i do n't understand what the problem with my comment is . 
  it 's the russian way . 
  but i did read the article and i 'm still angry that it 's the eu making concessions to get britain to stay in the single market rather than the other way around . 
  grow a spine , eu . 
   this was more of risk of who is in power when brexit is enacted . 
  i was a bit worried at first , however i am actually quite happy with our new pm , she is showing herself to be a strong leader but also one who is keen to working with the member states of the union we are leaving . 
  funny , to me it looks like may is willing to concede to an eea deal . 
  she 's been talking a lot about access to the single market which is incompatible with the kind of independence that you want . 
   oh god this again . 
  to be honest i 'd accept some loss of gdp so that we 're not apart of the ever-federalising eu . 
  the mistake is to think that the referendum was a purely economic decision - it was n't , it was an ideological one . 
  this is one of the few legitimate reasons to vote for brexit . 
  while i do n't think like you i can certainly understand and admire wanting sovereignty and valuing it higher than the economy . 
  one of the risks of the referendum however is that because leave won only narrowly there may not be a true brexit . 
  the uk could leave only halfway and eventually join the eea which would mean taking an unnecessary hit both to your economy and sovereignty . 
  i think the referendum should have required something like a 60 % majority to avoid this . 
  or it could have asked about the single market not the eu to make it clearer to politicians what the people want . 
  of course they were vocal . 
  it 's good pr and they have no obligation to follow up on their words . 
  grumble , grumble , foiled again !, 
  but wait ... western countries are more on the non-rentagular side . 
  so does this mean ... it 's good to be circular ? 
  does this mean we won ?!, 
  and by a massive 0.002 points of circularness too !, 
  was just about to post this but i was trying to find a more detailed article in english . 
  according to bulgarian media a letter informing of the ban has been sent to all universities and research institutes in turkey and abroad . 
  it also says that cooperation in the exchange of specialists is suspended until further notice and urges turkish academics abroad to call back home if they have n't done so recently . 
  germany got today \u00b4 s equivalent of $ 13 billion . 
  [ hisssssss ] ( http://www.neonnettle.com/feed/images/royalreptileworth1000com.jpg ), 
  and thankfully these 4 survived . 
  with our luck i would n't rule it out :d, 
  yeah i agree . 
  people either hate turkey because of past history or do n't give a fuck about it . 
  we do cooperate but imo there 's an element of fear behind it . 
  having turkey as a neighbour is like having a big country like germany as a neighbour , except more unpredictable , militant and unapolegetic . 
  supreme sultan erdogan ? 
  true , and in an ideal world these politicians should all face consequences but in the real world one of these politicians is all that stands between trump and the presidency . 
  would you say every second american sacrifices children ? 
  half the us public supported that at first . 
  what they did n't confirm that clinton was a long-tongued reptilian creature that is selling america piece by piece to saudi arabia and she sacrifices children ? 
  i do n't know what people expected . 
  even if the emails implicate her in something immoral she would probably have acted under government policy . 
  please already be in cern , please already be in cern ... 
  yes !, 
  yes !, 
  take that romania , we did one good thing before you !, 
  do n't get tired of upvoting and signing these because corporate interests will never get tired of pushing for such detrimental legislation . 
   `` this means that some of the economic benefits of brexit will materialise even before the probable formal departure from the eu around december 2018 , '' he sure does !, 
  i was just joking with how horribly i misspelled it :( but really what i wrote sounds nothing like czechia . 
  [ listen ] ( http://howjsay.com/pronunciation-of-dyschezia ) . 
  czechia sounds way different and better !, 
  nice . 
  hope you did n't get offended , i actually love czechia 's new name . 
  there you [ go ] ( http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/-chezia ) . 
  ah that nz number is from 2013 when the dollar was worth less . 
  this is an easy to read list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita australia is also quite expensive . 
  in ppp they 're the same as germany . 
  where are you getting those numbers ? 
  i find both nz and sk to be just below in ppp . 
  in nominal nz is just ahead but sk drops to 24k . 
  and australia is nowhere near that in nominal or ppp though higher than the eu . 
  the us is about right . 
  less rich countries do grow faster but the difference in growth rate with everyone but the us is too great for this argument to work here . 
  all fair points . 
  but i do n't think they cover the whole picture . 
  let me explain : for one thing migrants need not be poor . 
  but even if they are they still bring a kind of investment when they set foot in a country . 
  when they arrive they immediately need to start paying for housing , maybe new clothes if the climate is different than they 're used to and other one time expenses that you do n't usually think about . 
  so many people save a decent sum before changing countries which is then quickly spent . 
  they also save less of their income than than the native people and the more money circulates the better it is for the economy . 
  this is obviously not good for the individual but thye do n't have much choice . 
  migrants do get more governmnet support but they usually bring in more than they get . 
  at least that 's true for the uk i do n't know if it 's the same with more generous goveernments like sweden 's . 
  there are also lots of well educated people coming from poor countries looking for better opportunities . 
  even if their employer can afford to pay them less than they 're worth they still create great value . 
  also the `` benefit '' of a migrant does n't just stop with them . 
  you have kids of people who 've migrated a generation ago . 
  they 've managed to climb the social ladder a bit , hopefully gotten better education than their parents and so can contribute more . 
  so i 've these countries had higher migration in the past they would be feeling additional beneficial affects now . 
  i agree that in the end the average migrant does n't contribute as much as a native but as i 've said in the op not all population growth is due to migration . 
  these countries have higher birth rates than in the eu and quite importantly younger populations . 
  you can kinda measure that trough the death rate - for each older person dying you have another retiring . 
  so aging is indirectly reflected in the rate of population growth/decline . 
  uhmmm , that growth gave me a nosebleed . 
  no , really , i 'm a bulgarian born after 1989 , any kind of population growth would give me a nosebleed . 
  there are huge differences of course but i commented on the whole . 
  but even in western europe the increase is n't guaranteed .

  radical islam and the burqa are non-issues in bulgaria , and the present coalition between gerb and the far are using them to distract attention from their own utter failure to pass meaningful reform that the country needs so desperately . 
  there are perhaps less than 50 people in bulgaria that wear the burqa , and there is a single radial mosque in pazardzhik which is funded by saudi arabia . 
  these people can be addressed on an individual basis by the state security services under the existing legal framework , rather than wasting the resource of the entire parliament to pass useless laws . 
  islamists also do n't attack randomly . 
  typically they target `` decadent '' people . 
  they target venues where alcohol is served , concerts where music is played , homosexuals , etc. 
  is n't canada part of the nafta project ? 
   turks called it `` infidel smyrna '' they still do . 
  politically it is considered the bastion of the secularists . 
  also do n't forget the [ gagauz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauz_people ) . 
  it burns down through flesh , and pouring water on it makes it only worse . 
  it should n't be too hard to do with homo erdoganicus . 
  his devotion to the dear leader knows no bounds . 
  it forces people to be devided into two clear distinct gender roles . 
  trans people are considered to have transitioned to the opposite gender and do not violate any sexual stereotypes and cultural norms . 
  gays people , on the other hand , do not fit these norms . 
  poland - the taliban of europe . 
   workforce immigration should ideally have people working just as they land . 
  incidentally this is the kind of immigration that is worst for the country of origin . 
  that country shoulders the cost of educating and training the person , and instead of staying and contributing back to the country , that person leaves and work in a completely different place that gets all that for free . 
  to be honest , i do not think this kind of situation will go for much longer . 
  brain drain is a very destructive phenomenon . 
  eventually countries like bulgaria or turkey will create matching incentives and offer competitive salaries to prevent their brightest and most capable from leaving . 
  i get the same feeling as well . 
  his recent actions reek of desperation . 
  what was especially revealing was the letter he sent to putin , where he was almost pathetically begging to restore ties . 
  he even sent an [ appeal to zhirinovsky ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-appeals-to-flamboyant-nationalist-zhirinovsky-for-softening-putins-stance.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=100629&amp;newscatid=510 ) , the very same guy who threatened turkey with nuclear annihilation . 
  when you marry politics and islam that is what you get . 
  i guess this must be the turkish equivalent of the us birther movement and the `` show us the birth certificate '' people . 
  they used gas and water cannons against the lgbt parade last year . 
  this is terrorism - plain and simple . 
   however the links between the pyd and pkk are tenuous . 
  the same could be said about al nusra and al qaeda . 
  they have different names , but in the end they are the same organization . 
  the follow the ideology of bin laden , whereas the above two follow that of ocalan . 
  are you saying that turkey is now comitting genocide against kurds ? 
   it 's not your country i was born here , so it is as much my country as it is yours . 
  deal with it . 
  no , you only care about russian interests . 
  as somebody else pointed out here , most of the supporters of gerb ( borisov 's party ) are pro-eu and pro-nato . 
  even the name of the party implies that it is a party for european development . 
  borisov made a huge mistake today , as this move could be seen as pro-russian and anti-europe , and it is likely that he will see huge loss of support as a result . 
  the romanian president just made this clarification . 
  because it does not control its entire territory . 
  if southern cyprus enters schengen , then the border with the trnc will effectively become an external border , and the eu does not recognize it . 
   even you admitted that dps was an ethnically oriented party and so is dost . 
  yes , but then all parties that are composed solely of ethnic bulgarians are also ethnic parties . 
  are you going to ban those too ? 
  so should there be ethnic turks in parliament according to you ? 
  or should it be composed only of pure bulgarians ? 
  as for the constitutionality question . 
  you have to look at more than the ethnic composition of the party to prove that it is ethnic . 
  and the bulgarian constitutional court did make a ruling on that question already , and you know what that ruling was . 
  even the dost party , which is being denied registration so far , is denied for other reasons , and not because of that constitutional clause that you are citing . 
   and mestan is the next piece of shit that will spin the turkish vote against the nation dogan was a kgb project to encapsulate the turkish minority and to be able to utilize their political influence for the benefit of russia at crucial moments . 
  if the bulgarian parties had opened up to the minorities and allowed them to fully participate in the political process , dps would have never emerged in the first place . 
  you are allowing an ethnic party when it serves the russian interests , but when all of a sudden it is an authentic turkish party it becomes a problem . 
  it is this kind of bias that clearly shows that you are not being neutral , that you have a clear bias for russia . 
   have 3 parties in the parliament i am glad you are admitting that . 
  ahmed dogan 's dps is one of them , even though no bulgarian turk would support russia . 
  you realize that russia has subverted bulgarian democracy by undeermining the democratic process , and by installing its agents in key positions , and yet you advocated a position that we should kneel down to russia and let them have their way . 
  please , grow a spine . 
  bulgaria does not have to be a vassal state to russia . 
  what assets does russia have ? 
  a bunch of kgb agents , and being the main supplier of natural gas . 
  besides a conflict is already happening . 
  russia is in a full scale hybrid warfare against europe . 
  i am not rooting for civil war . 
  all i want is for the eu to survive and thrive , and for bulgaria to remain a member and not be dragged back into the russian sphere of influence . 
  bulgaria is a member of the eu , and it should be a loyal member . 
  most of the people rooting for russia on the ohter hand believe that the eu will disintegrate , and that the country will go back to the russian sphere of influence . 
  nobody imagined that they would so brazenly annex territory and untilaterally change the political map of europe back then either . 
   this is literally a no brain choice on neutrality . 
  when you try to stand on two chairs at the same time , usually you end up falling . 
  bulgaria made a lot of historical mistakes in the past , and it looks like it is bound to make another one . 
  it is delusional to think that russia can come out victorious out of this confrontation with the west . 
   have the russians done anything recently ? 
  the annexation of crimea was not so long ago . 
  i doubt that . 
   the bulgarian populace loves russia . 
  speak for yourself . 
  if this man wins , the usa will become the laughing stock of the world . 
  think of the damage that bush did to america , and multiply it by 10 - that will be the result of a trump presidency . 
  that 's because our prime minister is a servile putin lover . 
  nominally before his electorate he pretends to be pro-eu and pro-nato , but behind the scenes he does putin 's bidding . 
  bulgaria and russia are not in good terms at the moment . 
  one indication of that is the cancellation of the south stream project that russia wanted to build through bulgaira , but fortunately they were not able to get their way . 
  how is he a dictator if the people voted for him ? 
   open genocide of kurds you ca n't be seroius with this . 
  dependence on russia i presume . 
  only russia can service these types of soviet reactors . 
  i know . 
  my uncle is a turk from macedonia . 
  muslims here do n't wear burqas . 
   there were rumors of gypsy women being paid to wear them . 
  a [ bbc documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojrgc8pmqu8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9m19s ) recently covered gypsy women wearing islamic gowns on the streets of the uk in order to get sympathetic muslims to pay them money . 
  it just seems like a tool to make easy money , rather than one of indoctrination . 
  if there is no real danger of indoctrination , i do not see what this ban is really going to achieve . 
  there was a documentary by the bbc about romanian gypsies wearing islamic gowns on the streets of the uk in order to get sympathetic muslims to give them money . 
  when one of them realized she was being filmed , this is how she responded .

  not to mention that the opposition in usa is way more influential than the one in turkey . 
  how is it more fair than trump tho ? 
  you seem a bit mad and also never is pretty big word . 
  the decree is being challenged in the constitutional court right ? 
  how is it going ? 
  i hope you guys win your fight with corruption !, 
  that too , but that 's it . 
  i do n't understand do you have problem with camps or do n't . 
  because i do n't if people there are treated ok . 
  oh sorry my mind just skipped the 1/4th part of the statement . 
  because you owe eu money ? 
  from what i 've read assad was pro secular and the protesters were sunni muslims ( assad is not he is from a small denomination ) and a large chunk of protesters were from sa or were paid by sa , because sa wanted oil pipe passing from syria on it 's way to europe , but assad supported iran who wanted build a pipe too . 
  in what world 2,5 million more than 3,5 % of 325 million ? 
  sa gave money to some protesters groups who later became the `` opposition '' and usa started backing them in the hope that they will take out assad , one of these groups is now what is called isis , from what i 've read most of these groups are religious fanatics unlike assad 's government but that did n't stop usa and sa to support them , which is only in interest of sa , who are involved in a couple of proxy wars in iran everywhere they can . 
  putin started his military intervention way after that . 
  if they can act as a sovereign country and also go against un decisions for refugees , why should we europeans take them while they are not to be considered refugees in europe but illegal immigrants ? 
  obviously no ? 
  build closed camps in our borders with only basic human necessities there and wait for the war to finish ? 
  why should we be taking them ? 
  google syrian neighboring countries google how many of them are in a civil war and come back telling me how we ca n't make camps there and help them with food , water , shelter, 
  maybe just maybe if he does n't sell weapons to `` moderate '' rebels the civil war would end and the refugees can go back ? 
  also maybe he should stop helping sa military ? 
  you do n't have to kill them you just have to put them in closed camps and only give them food water and sanitation, 
  nordstream did n't win out over southstream , southstream was stopped because of crimea invasion, 
  good , now we should persecute them, 
  totally altright states bro , it 's written in their constitution right, 
   the brits were n't trying to convince saddam to invade . 
  they merely saw an opportunity to exploit and did so . 
  if they had n't , someone else would have . 
  not an excuse, 
  which king of england exactly is danny ? 
  the guy who started the hundred years war ? 
  and which one is john ? 
  will read thank you, 
  thank you for your response now it makes more sense but where is danny coming in all that ? 
  maybe magic is hiding the similarities, 
  or maybe they face prejudice because they are overrepresented ? 
   the common denominator is more often education levels and socioeconomic status than any one particular religion . 
  is it ? 
  is by any chance muslims overrepresented there, 
  they are death penalty for the person who is going to be kill no matter if they are illegal or not, 
   not in every eu country it is n't does n't have to be legal to be done , there were some muslim girls killed by their fathers because they were going out with non muslims, 
  can you give more info , i 've read the accursed kings long ago and dont feel like they are the same, 
  they overlap they are not exactly the same thing but are very close, 
  got ta sell them more weapons, 
  what about them ? 
  religion is part of a person 's culture, 
  time to change some laws then, 
  no did you ? 
  mother russia, 
  yes, 
  do n't you know any left wing politician which is corrupt or fucks up badly magically becomes right wing , because being left wing means you are the perfect human being, 
  religion is part of a persons culture, 
  religious state vs apartheid state, 
  well r/europe is not on the far right , it 's just right, 
  the far spectrum of left , which is dominant these days, 
  does n't mean it ' not especially if you consider how politicized science is, 
  only if you are leftie, 
  if russia abstain from taking territories maybe we can trade, 
  yeah their fault they did n't gave anglos free oil and the anglos block their country and then usa made a coup against mossadegh , installed a tyrant and that way created the path for the islamic revolution, 
  sane people, 
  iran is being sanctioned if it 's not and is in free trade deals their gdp will increase quite a lot, 
  why are you asking me ? 
  does n't it ? 
  is it because usa was supporting saddam invasion of iran , or maybe because uk and usa made a coup against mossadegh ? 
  or because usa is supporting ksa , which is funding isis ? 
  i do n't really blame them for not acting in good faith, 
  wrong , iran is responding to the regional instability created by usa/ksa/israel . 
  it 's aways funny when an american is talking about countries creating instabilites , when usa is the biggest risk to world peace . 
  why the fuck would anyone want to drop iran for israel, 
  do n't use logic it 's not fair !!, 
  leftist ? 
  sorry i was replying to the guy you were replying . 
  missclicked or something, 
  what 's wrong with being anti-sjw ? 
  it 's pretty positive trait, 
  but they are banning elections now, 
  but it shows his real character, 
  what is a tankie ? 
  genuine question, 
  but did it show he was pro paedophilia before ? 
  because corbyn was supportive of the socialists in venezuela, 
  it is cowering , just saying that he condemns the violence on both sides he tries to equalize them and that 's wrong, 
  what values ? 
  in the beginning of the year he said  if you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor . 
  now he is cowering from condemning a government which is becoming a dictatorship . 
  but both sides are not equal one is banning elections the other wants elections, 
  yeah last time someone tried communism/socialism failed and killed a couple of millions it was n't actually communism/socialism but now my special type of communism/socialism will work so we should try again, 
  jeremy corbyn january this year  if you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor . 
  jeremy corbyn august this year  not condemning the injustices of the socialist regime oh boy the irony, 
  because europe is choosing neither atm and we are getting wahhabism in europe, 
  better hezbollah than isis, 
  not really we should force them to disarm, 
  well by your logic we should work to unarm israel nuclear arsenal, 
  absolutely , especially if you sell weapons, 
  why are you dodging his question ? 
   or , you know , be a proper democratic country and arrest them . 
  not turn into north korea . 
  maybe but sadly it 's very costly to keep prisoners in europe , we should probably create some prisons in some me country and outsource prisoners there, 
  we should make a petition,

  but the when a state is created on lands where people already live as majority with a different ethnicity , it 's not up to the state to force them to assimilate . 
  newcomers should assimilate into states , not new states assimilating already existing people . 
  kurds exist as early as the 7th century , when arabic sources mention them . 
  in the lands they live today they have been before the creation of the turkish nation-state . 
  so why should they change ? 
  that 's called conquest and assimilation . 
  it does n't matter how you want the turkish state `` to work '' . 
  if you wanted a pure turkish homogenous nation state you should have made it on ethnic turkish lands exclusively . 
  but you wanted as much land as possible , so you included the ancestral lands of the armenians that then became kurdish after the armenians were killed/deported . 
  too bad , should ' v aimed for ethnic turkish lands only and then you 'd have your `` pure only turkish nationality country '' . 
  now you have to deal with the fact you have included the lands of a non-turkish population and accept a non-homogenous country with other national identities besides turkish ... or release their lands . 
  you ca n't have all , cause colonialism and foreign assimilation is n't accepted in the 21st century . 
  nor can you actually do anything about it considering they breed positively and you have negative fertility rates . 
  kurdish percentage rises and turkey is becoming less turkish , not more . 
  i suppose because `` turkish '' and `` kurdish '' is about identity , not blood ties . 
  their identity existed as much as yours , has its own language , has customs and as much right to be as the turkish identity . 
  i could ask you `` why ca n't turks in bulgaria just be bulgarians ? 
  people here are n't pure , but are all bulgarians , so are they `` special '' ? '', 
  unfortunately , least of all the fyromians themselves , who have had a hefty few decades of yugo propaganda how they are `` the totally unique and separate nation from the loins of alexander the great , which is somehow also slavic '' . 
  the most important factor in their nation building was insisting on proper bulgarophobia , teaching them we are `` tatars '' ( people who appeared first in 13th century ) , so the connection can be severed completely . 
  today no fyromians believe we are one nation . 
  serbs , you see , did a real good job to make sure we never fight for that region again . 
  if they put slavic they break the ancient connection . 
  which is the only connection to an independent macedonian nation . 
  without it , they have to face the fact there never actually was a separate , slavic nation within macedonia , which was since the slavs there came merely part of bulgaria for the most time , second to it ottomans , second to it serbia and finally byzantium and yugoslavia . 
  by the start of the 20th century the slavs there overhwelmingly considered themsleves bulgarian , so if they remove the ancient macedon kingdom connection , they have to face that tought reality . 
  because the entire nationhood of theirs is based on assotiating ad hoc any history and people from the region of macedonia with their nationhood . 
  if they remove the name , they lose their entire historiography and have to face the fact they were simply bulgarians before the yugoslav process of nation-building on the grounds of `` macedonian '' being connected between the region and the new nation . 
  they would become `` cheese eating , world-wars loosing monkeys '' . 
  exactly how big is the support for pkk among kurds ? 
  any stats from someone ? 
  and is there another , perhaps peaceful alternative for the kurds who want to rally behind a secessionist cause ? 
  edit : why would people downvote a genuine question ? 
  tell me it 's stupid if you think it is and why , at least . 
  lol , suddenly not much left to say , eh ? 
  :d happens every time turks get confronted with the reality of their history . 
  well i do n't know what the reasons are . 
  i just think they predate religion and have been imposed on it , rather than religion doing it . 
  when you take religion out homophobia still remains . 
   first of all , eu cross-border cooperation funds do not work that way . 
  this is not a fund for improving infrastructure in your cities . 
  second , it is not turkey problem that bulgaria and bulgarian cities are poor . 
  turkey does not have any responsibility to care for bulgaria . 
  if your city is poor , go ask more for money from sofia . 
  no one asks turkey for help - turkey bitches to bulgaria that edirne region gets flooded from our rivers , so a cooperation begins with eu funding . 
  stop pretending like bulgarian regions go begging turkey for smth . 
  it 's turkey doing this to bulgaria for years now , every time edirne gets floods coming from our side . 
   partnership ... 
  if you want to be a partner with someone , you need to have common goals , common interest . 
  i will not date with someone , who keeps insulting me , who is hostile towards me . 
  if you ask me for a date , i do not have any responsibility to accept your offer . 
   if you want to be partners with turkey , then be nice to turkey . 
  if you do n't like turkish terms , then do not become partners . 
  it is that simple . 
  why pretend like bulgaria is insulting or being hostile to turkey ? 
  what kind of bullshit attitude is it to say recognising a proven historical fact is being hostile to a country ? 
  is a country hostile towards germany for recognising the holocaust ? 
  or towards rwanda for recognising the genocide there ? 
  history is history , it does n't express attitudes , you ca n't pick and chose from it . 
  bulgarian municipalities have named a park , a single park , to some of the victims of a slaughter against armenians 100 years ago . 
  somehow this makes turkey butthurt and is considered hostile from bulgaria ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  how increadibly full of inferiority complex must one be to consider the recognition of crimes done by people inside his country a century ago `` hostile '' ? 
  it 's like this - my great grandfather killed someone . 
  today , if you recognise this fact or mention it , i will hate you . 
  how increadibly stupid must i be to do that ? 
  to hate someoen for recognising a fact from 100 years ago , that was n't even done by myself ? 
  pathetic . 
  psychology today : [ ** treatments ** ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/gender-dysphoria#treatments ) ** individual and family counseling is recommended for children , and individual or couples therapy is recommended for adults . 
  sex reassignment through surgery and hormonal therapy is an option , but severe problems may persist after this form of treatment . 
  a better outcome is associated with the early diagnosis and treatment . 
  ** when something is talked of in terms of `` early diagnosis and treatment '' , does that sound to you more like an accepted , normal human state/lifestyle or a disorder ? 
  my point is it goes the other way around - homophobia is extremely natural to people , especially to macho men , so they end up imprinting it onto religions . 
  when you take the religions out the homophobia stays , simply because it was there before the religion as well . 
  i 'm polish and i ' v no `` asian '' roots that can be traced less than 2000 years . 
  even if that was n't the case though , bulgaria does n't have a native population that is older here than bulgarians . 
  the thracians are all gone . 
  the armenians , however , were n't . 
  they lived in their old homeland still 100 years ago , so you were their invaders , into their motherlands , not they into yours . 
  you murdered people in their lands , so that you can call them then `` your home '' . 
  controling a land does n't make it your ancestral homeland . 
  nor having a minority on it does . 
  or else the british can call zimbabwe their land . 
  only having a majority in some land , and for centuries , makes it yours . 
  turks never were a majority in the lands of eastern anatolia where the genocide happened . 
  the armenians continued being , then tehy were replaced with kurds . 
  it 's not yours and never has been . 
  at least the kurds will soon have a state there so you wo n't even be occupying it . 
  it 's what you ridicule above . 
  what the current preffered treatement to a disorder or a dysphoria is does n't make it any less of a disorder or dysphoria . 
  it just means they currently chose certain treatment , which can be caused by political and cultural factors as much as actual science . 
  trans is a disorder . 
  a mental one . 
  it 's how it 's officially termed and what i wrote . 
  how you chose to treat it is a different topic and i have no answer to that since i have n't dealt with that disorder . 
  but do n't tell me i 'm full of shit for calling it what it is and what the scientific community classifies it as - a disorder . 
  according to your own article , between 1683 and 1922 - 2 million muslims were either deported , expulsed , or killed , and that includes military personnel . 
  that means , that for more than 200 years , those who invaded the balkans lost 2 million people - of which msot certainly most were deported not killed , and a large percentage included military personnel . 
  not only is this laughably low compared to 1.5 million armenians being killed in just a couple of years . 
  or the millions of balkan christians killed during the conquests and subjuations of various uprisings .

  and then they dump all the other ones for the quota distribution . 
  the real problem is the eu is painfully incompetent and ineffective at handling the refugee crysis . 
  they ca n't come up with any viable solution or a sustainable plan , so all that is done is addmit more refugees and chant the ultra leftist solidarity anthem . 
  states should start monitoring all donations and deduct aid accordingly . 
  aomeones 's hard earned taxes are going to be used to purchase food , watter and clothing , because these people refused the ones given freely . 
  the uncinvinient truth - even if you can distinguish beween refugee and immigrant - there is fuck all the authorities can do about it . 
  the only difference is some silly paper and oft it is more enterprising to avoud refugee status . 
  a simple solution track this inflow of people would be to rfid them when entering the eu , the same id would be used for receiving food and registering into a state . 
  no , it was n't . 
  30,5 tonnes of gold from the national reserve had to be sold , just to cover the foreighn debt . 
  the outrageous spending continued and in the 70s the country managed to bankrupt twice . 
  that sort of thing happens , when the supreme leader did ' t finish highschool . 
  naturally , the trade ballance and foreign debt were some of the closest guarded state secrets . 
  as far as the people knew , the 5-year plans were performed two-three fold and they shoukd n't even bother with such silly things as numbers . 
  this new saudi kind is being very naughty . 
  looks like the country might need some democracy . 
  i 'd say let them go , just do n't let them back in . 
  seriously , un the us , if you and someone else rob a bank and that someone else has a shootout with the cops , kills a cop and dies , both murders are on you by association . 
  with the same logic , if you willingly join an organisation that commits crimes agains humanity , you should be gulty of those as well . 
  well , let a thousand flowers bloom ... 
  yes , they were . 
  so were a lot of decent people , bit then bbc show themselves for the assholes they were . 
  they did have an appealing outlooks at firat , but at least to me they somehow seemed rotten . 
  anyway better to vote for someone , even the wrong one .

  my die is yet to be cast , but probably vmro ( patriots party ) . 
  atack - cheap knock off nazis , openly putinsexual bsp - communists ; openly putinsexual , but they totally deny it dps - agents of turkish national interests , also , proxy putinsexual rb - not putinsexual ; now if they can retract their collective crainial extremity from their rectum for two seconds , they might acheive something . 
  gerb - the `` right '' wing ; somewhat closeted putinsexuals . 
  pf - also patriots , not really putinsexual , but 60-80 percent of the members are relics , not exactly fit to lead a country . 
  how about the part where that peaceful lybian leader was threathening to execute five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian doctor , for eight years , over make-believe charges of intentionally spreading aids among children . 
  on a completely unrelated note lybia had a 1980s 20 million $ ( 80s $ ) debt , accrued over bulding materials , logistics and specialists , food deliveries and military hardware deliveries . 
  payments stopped in 1989 . 
  in 1999 , 2 years after the currency board was implemented and bulgria was about to start knocking on debtors ' doors , the case against the nurse was put forward . 
  dude , let 's not forget the spillover effect - more bp needed , overtime for cops , construction companies get to build walls . 
  immigration is downright dandy . 
  the new pope took it .

  our spy ships are completely undetectable , they are masked as oceanograplic vessels studying whales , complete with all the documentation and legal works . 
  there is no way to tell them from real ehale studying ships and no reason whatsoever to raise suspicions . '', 
  on the tv : `` of cource we do , what do you thik all those ` oceanographic ships ' are doing , studying whales '' `` god fucking damn it , cyril . '', 
  * due to copyright restrictions the islamic spirit is unable to say `` love thy neighbour '',

  maybe in us ... actually no , not even in the us , the deep south maybe . 
  views do n't change overnight . 
  also , this is hardly the first , or most disturbing picture . 
  balkanite perk ( racial ) - +95 % immigrant repulsion . 
  you 'd imagine africans and middle-easterners of all people would not be refusing watter . 
  the picture implies that the man is shielding his wife and child from a cop , who is about to hit them with a batton . 
  in reality , the man threw his wife and child on the tracks , because he wants to go to germany , not a refugee camp . 
  my bad , 6:5 vessel ration , only one carrier . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-deploys-admiral-kuznetsov-carrier-2013-6 ), 
  gadaffi was eliminated in 2011 . 
  the refugee crysis started 2013-14 , right around the time daesh popped up . 
  besided , the colonel was such a modern leader , the west just hated him . 
  let 's forget about that part where he threated to execute 8 foreighn nationals to avoid paying the country 's debt . 
  this is not a well desighned poll . 
  actually russia caused the refugee crysis . 
  when the us was about to set boots in syria , they went ape shit , sent 6 aircraft carryers ( us deployed 5 ) and basically threathened ww3 . 
  without them - assad gets dethroned , syrian economy is destroyed , recovers in 10-15 years , no daesh , no refugees , europe does n't take a ton of economic migrants along with the refugees .

  during the brief year of the unfortunate coalition there came a news article about the bulgarian ministry of educationa and the north korean one . 
  the article stated our long history of partnerships and how they were going to exchange culture and education practices and etc. 
  it was also acompanied by a picture of some flabbergasted officials from the ministry and their equally stunted korean counterparts . 
  it was quite humorously written and boud to make one lol hard ... until realising that it was not posted on one of the newly minted onion-like sited and it was for real . 
  rebranding would be bad for business ?

  yeah , everyone gets so uppity about exotic foods , but the thing is they do n't taste so great . 
  take cannibalism it 's such a complex topic and yeat humans do n't even taste good , they taste like horse meat - source idi amin ( while he never admitted to eating humans , he did comment on human meat and sort of cut up and kept his enemies in refrigeration . ),

  way more cute .

  fuck the gold . 
  any documents found will be far more valuable . 
  at this point , bot the west and the east have been editing history to their whims . 
  any writings found there will most likely be an unalterd account of evens and give how this train was probably hidden by high-ranking officers , they are bound to be jucy . 
  the ones that we actually want to stay will most likely go , and the ones that we do n't rreally want will not want to leave . 
  that 's a rational first responce , but it 's a far more tactical move to grant the visa . 
  first , the rich rich obviously show they do not want to be treated by their native `` so much better than the evil capitalist '' doctors . 
  second , politically this goes against everythin he says and does . 
  thirdly , the `` west '' avoid getting bad rep as - look , they want him to die , and at the same time shows how disconnected from the peoplebthe rulers are . 
  nobody likes us !,

  but yeah i should n't have said golden age its more of a stability and centralisation . 
  i dunno band of brothers always portrait it as one of the worst places to empty your head hmmm . 
  now imagine living without it and your tourism based economy collapsing . 
  venice would become a ghost city in a decade . 
  if you do n't like it move , without the tourism and jobs they would have to move anyway . 
  putin is 64 . 
  russia in its current state is a bunch of oligarchs being submissed into control by putin . 
  the moment he steps down or dies or becomes unable to control the country due to age or illness the whole russian state will collapse . 
  that 's why countries like the us take their democracy super seriously , with a strong democracy you make sure that no one can do too much harm and that no one can become so vital to the state that his/her absence would cause it to collapse . 
  with russia what we are seeing is what we have seen hundreds of times during the medieval era and afterwards . 
  a strong leader leads the country to a golden age only for it to collapse immediately after his passing or gradually over a generation or so . 
  guys it is impossible that 100 % of any police force will be perfectly reasonable . 
  we are not talking about a policeman doing something illegal or threatening anybody , the fine was justified by the law . 
  lets just be glad that the council removed it and that they will apologise . 
  in my country we have to beg our police to do their job at all ( though it 's not their fault-they are badly trained and paid ) . 
  i mean i am not refuting your previous comment because its factual . 
  my point was that we were n't blameless . 
  and in the end we were the ones who made the decision and the ones who ruined it for ourselves , the world is n't fair imo we 've got only ourselves to blame . 
  well technically we were the ones who attacked and we were the ones that were viewed as the aggressors and baddies in the region , a reputation that marked bulgaria as the backstabber for the whole first half of the 20th century and which greatly influenced the outcome for bulgaria for the 2 world wars . 
  i just thought you were being sarcastic and found it funny . 
  like 100 % of the wars named as such . 
  fucking worth every time . 
  but it was bulgaria who stabbed its allies in the back and attacked them ? 
  best in the world . 
   they smoke like crazy . 
  it 's one of the countries with the highest cigarettes consumption in the world . 
  actually not anymore . 
  well , yeah people still smoke like crazy but we went from top 3 to top 40 due to some good anti-smoking laws . 
  we are just in front of germany in average consumption . 
  lem me dispel some of that ignorance . 
  john atanasoff did n't invent the computer , alan turing did . 
  john atanasoff invented the first digital computer in the us and also is n't bulgarian as in he only had and only wanted a us citizenship . 
  born in the us worked and achieved all his successes in the us and died in the us . 
  now onto the first post . 
  modern day bulgarians have nothing genetically common with the proto-bulgaria . 
  why ? 
  because the proto bulgarians were 30k whilst the population of the peoples that lived in the lands the bulgarians settled numbered 2 million . 
  the bulgars formed the ruling elite and the warrior class and after centuries of war and interracial mixing they withered away . 
  close to 1 of every 5 bulgarian is of slavic ancestry do n't know where you pulled that bs out of but google it and every reputable source will say the same . 
  it is debated whether or not plovdiv is the oldest continuously inhabited city but argos and athens are generally regarded as older . 
  much much older . 
  we are talking about 500bc compared to 6-4k bc . 
  bulgaria defeated the byzantium empire in some wars , never fully , unlike what the byzantines did to bulgaria . 
  bulgaria never had any colonies and controlled limited greek lands for limited time spans and the farthest bulgaria conquered into the western balkans is belgrade . 
   because of the cold war , bulgarian history is largely unacknowledged and unstudied , many of their inventions are falsely contributed to greece instead . 
  nah because of the cold war such chauvinism like yours is seen all throughout the country and we still struggle in being able to look towards our history with reason instead of emotion and anything that gets discovered that goes against the idea that we were the good guys gets ignored . 
  when talking about history i see western sources as much more factual than bulgarian ones . 
  the eu and member states are doing exactly that but it is taking very very long . 
  the eu being excruciatingly slow is a valid critique , i am sure they will find a way to deal with the ngo smugglers and will be able to achieve some progress with the na countries but do n't hold your breath . 
  well that is a valid argument though you phrased it kind of like you do n't value their lives . 
  but it is true that the rescues are driving more people to go for it but italy and the eu do n't want to let those first people die as well . 
  it is a pretty difficult situation it is not as simple as `` let them drown '' unfortunately . 
   rubbish . 
  if they came on a boat from libya , then pick them right up and tow them right back where they started . 
  i mean it is rubbish but it is how it is we ca n't legally do it and i mean i am glad that we do n't so nonchalantly break international law like some other countries * cough * russia * cough * . 
   we do n't have an obligation to these people - if libya does n't want them , then they should try harder to keep them out instead of wilfully letting them through . 
  we do n't have an obligation but we do n't want to have people drown when we could have done something . 
  and the eu or its members do n't have any authority over libya and the eu does n't want to be seen as a bully and as a rule breaker . 
  i am sure they will figure something like germany did in afghanistan where they are literally building a new terminal for the kabul airport so it can handle all the deported migrants . 
  that sounds like a precedent for erdogan to be jailed for 30 consecutive life sentences . 
  good point . 
   stop mass immigration to europe there is no legal mass immigration to europe . 
  there is illegal one through the mediterranean which is very hard to stop because we have to either let them drown or save them and bring them into the eu because returning them to the african coasts would be breaking international law . 
   and i 'm denying that . 
  they are n't worried about a few thousand . 
  they are worried about a few million . 
  exactly , they are worried about nothing because there is no reason to be worried about a few million . 
  its the media and populist politicians who sensationalised fear which is making them be worried about things that are never going to happen . 
   let 's keep it polite please . 
  how is that impolite ? 
   and establish a very dangerous precedence . 
  a precedence that will lead to far greater problems in the future . 
  that is what this is about . 
  not a few measly refugees now . 
  its only a precedence if there are more refugees that would be eligible to the plan which there are n't . 
  these refugees are the ones who arrived before the eu had a plan of action . 
  redistribution of any refugee that arrived after will have to be negotiation from the ground up . 
   what do you think the plan would have been if this resettling plan had worked ? 
  do n't you think the eu would have tried it again ? 
  and again ? 
  as i said above no it would n't . 
  there is no more again and again since the routes have been closed and all the people that have arrived since are illegals and have legally a very different identity than the ones included in the relocation plan . 
  and do note that in order for any person to be relocated he/she has to be legally regarded as a refugee and to have been granted asylum . 
  so any host country will be able to deport any of these people the minute reputable sources deem their home regions safe . 
  the only way those refugees stay in their host countries post the crisis is if the host country itself chooses to let them stay . 
  so there is a very high possibility that a majority of these refugees will be back home in 5 or 10 years . 
   of course . 
  noone cares . 
  noone is remotely worried about that . 
  i did not say that . 
  i said that in my opinion the reaction is not equal to the problem and that people are letting their emotion run wild instead of being rational about it . 
  so yeah people are worried , but they are like way overreacting . 
  because we 're not talking about a couple of thousand refugees . 
  do you think with africa 's population going from 1 billion to 4 billion people combined with global warming is going to result in a couple of thousand refugees ?? 
  this is what i am talking about , you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  you talked about the eu resettling refugees in eastern europe which is the eu 's redistribution plan . 
  the plan is to put very little refugees in eastern europe . 
  about 1,6 k in bulgaria , 4k in romania , 10k in poland , even taking away refugees from hungary as well as paying a flat amount of euros per refugee monthly . 
  in bulgaria they will give 60 euros which will be more than enough to cover their expenses . 
  the plan is in regards to only the refugees who have been in europe since the start of the crisis some even before isis was a thing .

  it will be great . 
  just think about is all i 'm saying , ok ? 
   there has been a little discussion on time to time that we should make finlandia for our national hymn . 
  you definitely should . 
  finlandia is one of the best pieces of classical music i 've listened . 
  that and sibelius ' 4th symphony . 
  clearly you 've never had the dubious honour of reading the garbage most of the bulgarian media spews on a daily basis . 
  as far as i know the third energy package is applied on onshore infrastructure . 
  blackmailed ? 
  south stream was in direct violation of the eu 's third energy package . 
  meaning that companies building pipes on eu territory no longer have monopoly on said pipes . 
  gazprom being the unique and special snowflake that it is , was of course against said rule and instead forced a new law via our idiotic socialist government that tried to change the status of the pipes to some bullshit . 
  the whole thing was corrupt . 
  it was 4 + billion euros we do n't have for 500 km of pipes in bulgaria , for what ? 
  the promise that maybe sometime in 10 years we would perhaps get transit fees on the condition that the pipe 's capacity was over 50 % ? 
  right , yeah , shrinking consumption of natural gas combined with russia 's lack of technological ability to transport said gas totally guarantees that our local useful idiots would have to scramble for even dumber and more moronic ideas as to how to blame the us and eu and nato and whatever for every stupid decision they themselves make . 
  fuck that . 
  putin cancelling south stream was the best thing that happened to this country in recent years . 
  about time  . 
  the us should definitely consider sending more tanks over here just to troll the crap out of our local pro-russian traitors . 
  from a maple tree i think . 
  took my son out for a walk and some pigeon chasing , then he tried to eat a leaf . 
  it was glorious . 
  come to plovdiv , you 'll love our no wind feels-like-you 're - standing-in-an-oven summers . 
  we share a lot of history , a lot of culture , sibiu is beautiful . 
  romania has a strong it sector , is fighting corruption , sibiu is beautiful , i like the people , the carpathian mountains , the castles , the habsburg architecture and it is close enough i can drive back to bulgaria to visit relatives . 
  mostly because i do n't want my son growing up in a country content with nepotism , corruption and a ruling elite supportive of the status quo . 
  also i believe i mentioned that sibiu is beautiful . 
  as someone who is considering moving to romania - nah . 
  you guys are doing fine . 
  just keep jailing the corrupt assholes and as u/glennznl said in another 10 years or so and all those issues will be resolved . 
  why ? 
  did the us also capture an estonian security officer on estonian soil and then sentenced him in their home courts on fake charges ? 
  also you do know that we do n't have a land border with the us , right ? 
  furthermore most of the eu countries are part of nato and thus allies . 
  on the economic side we would lose a lot more by cutting trade with the us than russia , since most of the us 's exports are manufactured goods , whereas the only thing we get from russia are raw materials , which can be bought elsewhere . 
  thanks for the link . 
  will give it a look . 
  of course . 
  ice wall guarded by the night watch ... errrm ... nato is what i meant . 
  it 's things like these that make me wish we would cut all diplomatic and economical relations with russia and build a giant fucking wall on the land borders . 
  as soon as they reset their calendar to dear leader 's age . 
  russia is fast on track on reaching north korea levels of autocratic idiocy . 
  bulgarian football has been garbage for a long time . 
  that is assuming the us considers russia as a potential or valid rival at all . 
  which , judging by russia 's gdp , i would say is highly improbable . 
  he is tied with barekov , who is , as we all know levski 2.0 . 
  did n't they disintegrate , i have n't been following recent events as much ? 
  even before that i would hardly call them a party at all . 
  their platform was nonexistent , just random bullshit proclamations and barekov describing himself as the new levski . 
  so umm ... 
  i guess i would say their alignment leans more towards oligarchic idiots rather than the conventional left-right political spectrum . 
  thanks for reminding me of that interview btw . 
  recently i did n't have much reason to facepalm at anything other than posts from r/niceguys , now i feel is a good time to relive some nostalgia starting from that and then moving into `` sometime win , sometime lun '' territory . 
  from left to right : ** socialists ** - the communists after rebranding themselves in 1990 . 
  second biggest party , though rapidly declining in number . 
  a highly corrupt , economically incompetent and feudal group with a strong tendency to do whatever the russians say . 
  ** abv ** - sixth biggest party . 
  same as above ** gerb ** - center-right . 
  biggest and current ruling party formed by our former communist dictator 's bodyguard . 
  corrupt , populist , lacking in any strong opinions . 
  our glorious pm has an ego the size of the country , has expressed admiration for orban and putin , but in reality will do whatever merkel and company say ( and thank god for that ) . 
  sort of pro eu and nato . 
  ** reformist bloc ** - a loose coalition of right and center parties . 
  fourth biggest party and a minority member of the government . 
  not as corrupt , anti-communists who are pro eu and nato . 
  ** dps ** - pretend liberals . 
  third biggest party . 
  former communists , now turned oligarchs , they own most of the media in bulgaria . 
  they buy most of the gypsy vote here . 
  ** patriotic front ** - a coalition of two nationalist parties . 
  fifth biggest party . 
  minority member of the government . 
  kind of two faced , with one side being pro eu and nato while the other is a russophilic circle jerk . 
  ** ataka ** - russian nationalist party masquerading as a bulgarian nationalist party . 
  smallest party in parlament , has neo-nazi tendencies . 
  financed by russia with an impressively xenophobic attitude to to whatever russia says . 
  can confirm . 
  a few years back i parked and locked my bike on a fence 5m from my university 15 minutes later it was gone . 
  psh ... we recently replaced guard dogs with polar bears . 
  greece is so far south it can practically into nordic . 
  that would explain all the penguins in my backyard . 
  out of all the social media sites which popped out in the last 10 years twitter is the one i find most perplexing . 
  you have a 140 char limit and ca n't string a decent sentence together . 
  and then there is this hashtag bullshit . 
  i mean , what is the appeal ? 
  oh well i 've been thinking of buying a leica laser ruler for a while . 
  i guess now is a good time to do it . 
  here , have an upvote you statist kiwi you . 
  i would hazzard to guess the weapons were intended to be delivered to the [ free syrian army ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army ), 
  i do n't think he really cares about facts . 
  considering that , based on data from 2014 , bulgarian exports to russia were about 2.5 % of our total export income of which only a fraction is composed of agricultural products , i would say the effect of the russian imposed embargo on us has minimal to no effect . 
  our biggest export partner is naturaly the other eu countries with a combined total of over 60 % followed by turkey with around 8.6 % our local communist and pseudo-nationalists tend to inflate how important russia is to bulgaria when in reality excluding our reliance on gas there really is n't that much going on in terms of trade . 
  because we are totally the ones responsible for them starting a war against ukraine , the rouble losing half its value and their travel agencies going bankrupt . 
  thank you turkey for delicious kebap and efes beer and for all the great moments i had in istanbul , izmir and mersin . 
  thank you greece for delicious kebap ... umm . . gyros . 
  oh and for the lovely islands , good resorts and cultural heritage . 
  i hope you guys will get back on your feet soon . 
  thank you romania for the way you 've been clamping down on corruption recently . 
  can you send a few thousand of your prosecuters down here ?

   nearly all water in europe is used for something and turning millions of cubic meters of it into waste water is n't an option . 
  chevron wanted to frack and pollute the most fertile region of bulgaria . 
  that is never going to happen . 
   instead , we should isolate them along the same lines that was done with south africa 30 years ago why do n't you start with israel and saudi arabia ? 
  they have far worse human rights issues . 
  it 's a pretty good assessment of the situation in the eurozone .

  i 've also read it . 
  while they were arguably right about the bsp 's goal to appease voters by screwing over evn and cez , the mail talked about a coordinated anti bsp position from all of his media outlets . 
  his letter called for a mass mobilization of effort of containment of the event and a counter offensive involving the european commission , european ambassadors and opposition parties . 
   his `` action plan '' was telling his editors to look into stuff so they can report on them . 
  the leaked letters were advising his journalists to trash the government over anything energy related and call barroso 's office for comment that can be used against the government . 
  if you go back and read some older euractiv artices about bulgaria you will see that it 's always dnevnik and kapital that shit on the whole country in order to get political gains against the bsp . 
  this is why they used the picture of volen siderov in this article . 
  they makes the whole country look like assholes infront of the eu . 
  why not ? 
  they buy property here and invest in local business . 
  funny how their sources belond to ivo prokopiev ( owner of dnevnik and kapital ) who was caught distributing an `` action plan '' to discredit the current govenment before the election . 
  this is just the latest episode of the dirty smear campaign going on before the election where the oligrachs fight eachother and smear the whole country with shit . 
  their blood tax ? 
  their jizya tax ? 
  their ethnic cleansings ? 
  their forced conversions ? 
  most bulgarians are pro-russian . 
  ever since russia freed us from the turks . 
  even when we joined the axis we refused to declare war on the ussr and send soldiers to the eastern front . 
  hitler was pissed . 
   their developing country gets free money we did n't get anything during the first 3 years while in the eu ( mainly due to stanishev 's government at the time but still ) while paying our share of contributions ( 360 million euro a year ) . 
  this free money myth needs to die in a fire . 
  at first i wanted to argue against your post , but you are basically correct . 
  eastern europe was rural and behind the west even in the late 18th century . 
  we missed the age of imperialism when britain and france got their industrial boon . 
  but the same was true for japan and south korea who managed to find a niche . 
  their high tech manufacturing , born out of necessity and lack of resources allowed them to advance and surpass a lot of european countries . 
  the main problem that held eastern europe back was the lack of competition . 
  everything made here was ugly , clunky and took a shit ton of resources to make . 
  our country had heavy metal manufacturing that relied solely on imported materials which was incredibly cost inefficient . 
  everything was doomed to collapse from the start . 
  ** bulgaria ** bay ganyo balkanski . 
  sadly over a century after the book was written in an attempt to ridicule our oriental mentality it still holds true . 
  escpecially the later part that deals with the political process in bulgaria where roma votes , bribes , fraud and intimidation are the only way to get into power , sadly still the case . 
  ;( video is funny though, 
  our interior minister commented on these reports and called them outright lies . 
  he says that our border protection agency keeps all cctv footage and interested parties are free to look at it . 
  our border is one of the best surveyed in europe so i believe him . 
  he also dismissed the accusations from people in turkey who claim that they have been tazed , our border patrols do n't have tazers . 
  the human rights watch report that is sensationalist and blown out of proportion to further some unknown agenda . 
  there is still a lot of animosity between us and serbians . 
  we allowed nato to bomb them and they had a bit more freedom during the cold war than us which pissed off people at the time . 
  also every time serbians are mentioned in our history books we are at war with them . 
  the few i have met around sofia have been fine guy and girls . 
  here the semen for artificial insemination is imported from denmark for that reason . 
  do n't drink that . . 
  it 's basically poison . 
  better tourists than the cheap germans or drunk british , that is for sure . 
  or maybe the bullshit that foreign policy and the daily beast spew does n't deserve a better response ? 
  then how did the eu manage it in the last 5 years ? 
  what next daily beast ? 
  was putin responsible for september 11th as well ? 
  when we applied for eu the nato membership was like a conjoined twin that we had to accept as well . 
  nato is clearly trying to encircle and intimidate russia + it 's operations in the last 15 years have been extremely questionable . 
  just because bulgarians are n't hellbend on revanchism like poland or the baltic states does n't mean that they suffer from stockholm syndrome . 
  most people have seen what the eu and usa have to offer and are not interested . 
  only as , because europe does n't have the balls to say `` no '' to the usa . 
  stuff like the nsa , drones , cia torture houses in poland , petrodollar and much more are just allowed to continue while the eu does n't dare to say anything . 
  i would call that anything other than genuine partnership . 
  what is so bad about a multipolar world ? 
  i am sure people in cyprus , bulgaria , greece , spain , portugal and others will disagree . 
  some evidence would be nice though . 
  i also want to see europe freed from the us dollar and nato . 
   and russia , is the same imperialist russia that is based on the superiority of the russian ethnicity and the supremacy of tsar the same russia went to war in 1877 to stop the ethnic cleansing of bulgarians and lost a lot of people to free the balkans . 
  this is why , for the majority of bulgarians , russia will always be put before any other country . 
  also , your whole infomercial type presentation is embarrassing to read . 
  the only thing missing was a crying bald eagle . 
   ethnic bulgarians have been deported to siberia and bulgaria is repopulated by ethnic russians such rational arguments . 
  i am now convinced that fracking and ttip are the way to go . 
  estonia and latvia had some of the worst recession and austerity during the euro crisis + one of them needed bailout . 
  all 4 of those countries have lost between 5-10 % of their population due to emigration since 2004 . 
  what i was asking is `` why should more countries be paranoid and revachist towards russia like them ? '' . 
  out of the 10 former east bloc countries only these 4 have been excessively anti-russian + far too pro-us which is a bad thing . 
  poland even had cia torture houses and what not . 
  why should they ? 
  i am almost certain that the article is a joke , but who knows . 
  i was gon na say . 
  the atricle itself is also great . 
  i absolutely agree with amnesty international ^ for ^ the ^ wrong ^ reasons, 
   bulgaria is cheapest , but rapidly catching up bulgaria 's growth has more to do with exposing the grey/shadow economy and increasing productivity by laying off low skilled workers and keeping better paid workers , but with more responsibilities . 
  quite the misleading title and article . 
  the pictures do n't show much . 
  that 's because we are lean and good looking by default ... 
  so i guess the romanian and bulgarian hate rhetoric ran it 's course and wilders decided change up his act ? 
   progressively escalating economic sanctions . 
  and who will compensate our losses ? 
  we suffered from the yugo-embargo and the 2009 gas crisis . 
  now we will suffer again by losing tourists due to visa and other issues , south stream was put on ice by the ec and our property market depends on middle class russians who buy houses for their retirement homes ( the rich buy houses in spain/italy ) how will the eu compensate us ? 
   why do n't they deface the shipka memorial as well ? 
  lots of russians died there too .

  the inspection party will not have access to any sensitive information and will be accompanied throughout . '', 
   he saw that ukraine was in fact the nation he wanted russia to become , ** open , free , democratic ** , and part of the west ... hihi, 
  lets see how far back we can go !, 
  the us , they have some pretty catchy songs . 
  ehh , too much cultural difference and history between the two if you ask me . 
  impossible , ukraine was too important to let go . 
  and while russia is certainly not the ussr , the ussr was never destined to last , in the long run it will be for the best . 
  thats the thing , maybe 100 are fully functional , maybe 1000 ? 
  it doesnt matter , unless russia flat out declares ww3 , nobody will take the chance . 
  except they still have the ability to ( as people on reddit love to say ) glass half of the inhabitable world . 
  and nobody wants to take that risk . 
  yet here we are , russia 's back in business and we are poised for another cold war . 
  no , that would counter their interests . 
  but thats what russia would have wanted . 
  dont you see , neither side cares about freedom , democracy and all that crap . 
  power , influence , control - this is the moto of every super power . 
  thats the thing , even after the ussr fell , russia retained a huge amount of territory , man power and thousands of nuclear warheads ( lets face it , that matters ) . 
  and on the other side nato also stayed very much alive and even grew considerably . 
  you missunderstood me on ukraine , while i think the current goverment is not legitimate , i also dont agree with russia 's intervention in the east . 
  that started it , but russia only intervened after the goverment got thrown out . 
  russia will always have a its own sphere of influence . 
  the us simply took advantage of their weakness after the fall of the ussr and expanded nato as far as possible . 
  sure , countries arent forced to join , but russia undeniably sees this a threat . 
  and here we have the clash the of interests , culminating in the recent ukranian crisis . 
  whats happening there right now is wrong on a moral basis , but sadly fairly logical from a geo-political view . 
  you could n't and thats understandable , yet thats exactly what you are trying right now . 
  they protected a certain sphere of influence , the rest were left on their own . 
  hehe , beef would be the last i think of . 
  nobody is going to give a fuck since its in english . 
  its gon na be a huge shit storm and rt will have a field day anyway , i have my popcorn ready . 
  somebody has to be the shield , guess who its gon na be . 
  at least its a very good one . 
  the cgi was a bit wanky , but decent overall , 7.5 / 10, 
  so you mostly feel european because a bunch of people got killed ? 
  uh , to each their own i guess . 
  hahaha, 
  for anybody else wondering the buk is a soviet era aa missile platform . 
  pretty much , yes . 
  there was some shaky theory it got downed by a jet , but that was dismissed quickly . 
  oh yea , if that what they said . 
  i get that . 
  but i digress . 
  im just wondering since `` ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 '' would sound strange in russian . 
  something like `` ura '' would make more sense . 
  can you re-translate that part ? 
  `` after the speech captivated the audience shouted rbk channel location of the supplier to have been `` very seriously '' the slogan of `` ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 , crimea is ours , annapas poland and finland . '' '', 
  its a bit confusing , is rbk a tv channel or something ? 
  there is a very interesting ( well tragic ) occurrence in our recent history . 
  a young man and his wife were murdered near a gypsy settlement in plovdiv ( they wanted to mug them ) . 
  the police could n't find the suspects . 
  turns out the man was a nephew of certain general . 
  his name was gen. stoyu nedelchev , former partisan and then commander of the armed forces in the stara zagora area . 
  he traveled to karlovo where an armored brigade was stationed . 
  an order was given and two tank battalions headed to plovdiv ... stolipinovo , the settlement/neighborhood was surrounded by armored vehicles and police officers . 
  some tried to fight back with axes/shovels etc. 
  but they soon gave up seeing the heavily armed police officers . 
  all houses were searched and any kind of weapon confiscated . 
  withing a week 9 gypsies were given over to the authorities . 
  greek minister of ... 
  exactly what you read . 
  also beating people to death every now and then . 
  and changed china for bulgaria ... 
  just gloomy to me . 
  its pretty clear from the way he wrote his question . 
  russia has been attacked numerous times by islamist terrorists in its recent history . 
  one of the worse ones being beslan . 
  well yes , they actually got a license to name it like that . 
  i was just giving you the backstory   after launching japan 's first plain yogurt in 1971 , we obtained naming rights from bulgaria -- the birthplace of yogurt -- culminating in the release of meiji bulgaria yogurt in 1973 . 
  for over 40 years , this genuine yogurt has attracted a wide and loyal following . 
  because of the lactobacillus bulgaricus , a bacteria used to make yogurt . 
  from the name you can guess it is found in bulgaria . 
  our yogurt is different from others as it tastes a bit sour/bitter . 
  that is why in bulgarian yogurt is roughly translated to `` sour milk '' . 
  it is popular in some countries and especially japan . 
  typical sailor . 
  there is just something strange about saakashili ... i do n't know how to describe it . 
  reading the title hurts if you know cyrillic . 
  the internet has finally been freed from western oppression , enjoy . 
  waiting for a `` little green men '' flair tovarish .

  thank you friend , always happens to me . 
  eh , it 's all in good spirit nowadays . 
  to be fair being a dick to your neighbors is a national pass time for the balkans \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  yeah , it 's annoying from time to time , but does n't bother me on a daily basis . 
  not really , they can think whatever they want , for me it 's a lost cause by now . 
  macedonia , i ca n't be bothered to pronounce the whole acronym and fyrom sounds retarded . 
  technically yes , but that is a slippery slope to go down . 
   i am saying that i will go to russia only when the question of independence of my siberia arises . 
  originally i am from there . 
  i have a bit of a different attitude to siberia , i do not consider it as a part of russia . 
  i believe that it also was occupied by force , and at that time there were no russians ; only indigenous peoples lived there . 
  ironic . 
  got ta keep those dingoes out somehow . 
  yeah , but that 's a slippery slope . 
  austria and australia , lithuania and latvia , swaziland and switzerland etc , 
  it sounds nothing like chechnya to be honest . 
  we are on reddit , nobody reads the articles \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  too cold for crimes . 
  putin is literally hitler etc i guess .

   beating gays ' did n't happen in serbia for a long time , and extreme corruption is a problem but it 's being solved , you two are arguing with extremely different viewpoints lol . 
  i was n't saying this was happening in serbia ( i mean it sometimes it might but that 's not unique to serbia ) . 
  ahwhatever11 said that wanting to be in russia 's camp was not about money or living standards but values . 
  so i mockingly asked what sort of values made russia that much more desirable than europe . 
   eh . . every countries interest is self-serving , ca n't agree with you here mate . 
  that 's true but there are differences between countries . 
  the eu is incredibly altruistic , if i remember correctly a little over half of all the aid in the world comes from european countries . 
  and it 's not like this is done just to influence countries . 
  as we 've found out after the migrant crisis the eu is terrible at leveraging its aid . 
   this is where i agree but i think russia ca n't really threaten serbia , we are far , faaar away from them , and in a ring of nato states . 
  it ca n't attack it like its neighbours certainly but there are other dangers . 
  like the attempted coup in montenegro , the support russia gave gruevski , things were close to getting very ugly in macedonia , election meddling from which some eastern european countries have been complaining long before the us made it mainstream , spurring protest like it likely happened in bulgaria in 2013 ( do n't get me wrong the protests were genuine and needed but there we 're some indication russia was fanning the fire ) . 
  stuff like this . 
  latvia 's and lithuania 's population decrease is due to russians leaving for the motherland , right ? 
  is it young or old russians who are emigrating or both ? 
   well not to the bulgarians . 
  i never did understand serbian whining about some `` backstabbing '' . 
  not like you have n't done the same and worse or just about every country with more than a century of history has . 
  but i guess you have no arguments so you resort to insulting my nationality . 
   but ... they literally did annex some serbian lands have they not ? 
  the west opened this pandoras box , now play in it so you think there 's nothing wrong with that just like with crimea . 
  got it . 
  anyway i think there 's no point in talking with you . 
  have fun with russia , i 'm sure you 'll love their no string attached help like in ukraine , belarus , moldova , etc. 
   i made you a list of thing . 
  first and chief among them is mutual respect and friendship . 
  more valuable than any money . 
  mutual respect and friendship are just subjective words that do n't mean much . 
  russia and turkey keep talking about mutual respect and friendship while sanctioning each other and accidentally killing the other 's citizens . 
  if russia respected you so much why are they selling you russian gas at one of the highest prices in europe ? 
  russia 's enemies further away from them than serbia enjoy cheaper gas . 
  if russia is your friends why are n't they contributing development aid to serbia like so many western countries do ? 
  the money you get from russia are loans while europe , japan even the us provide free funding for serbia . 
   they can recognize kosovo right now if they wanted to . 
  they have zero reason to . 
   yeah and we never though montenegro would join nato , does that mean our relationship was n't sincere ? 
  are you comparing joining nato to annexing land from your supposed friends ? 
   yes . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  yes , there is . 
  it 's funny to hear this from a serb . 
  the crimean annexation is similar to kosovo except much worse . 
  i guess if albania annexed some serbian land now there would be nothing wrong with that ? 
   whatever floats your boat i guess . 
  then what are these better and more important things in life ? 
  simply not recognising kosovo ? 
  which broke off much earlier than crimea happened so russia could n't have been thinking about that , assuming it even cares whether the world recognises its annexation . 
  a few years before 2014 russians considered ukraine one of their top allies , what makes you think your relations are more sincere ? 
   serbia has volunteers in ukraine now , on crimea , in the east . 
  for real ? 
  that 's disgusting . 
  did you actually check it out ? 
  it 's mostly positive coverage of serbia . 
  if you have links to better serbian newspapers in english , post them , i 'd be happy to see them . 
   because there are better and more important things in this life than money or living standards . 
  like what , beating gays and extreme corruption ? 
  i think you 're being naive if you think russia 's relations with serbia are anything more than self-serving and wo n't turn the minute russia decides the stick is more effective than the carrot . 
  interviews with two people are n't really representative of what the general population thinks . 
  i think it 's very deceiving when media does that . 
  i 'd love to see an actual study on who serbians perceive as their friends , would probably be russia over the eu but still . 
  when i open the front page i 'd much rather see one bridge , one church , one war propaganda poster , etc. 
  than 20 of a kind . 
  when they 're so much none really stand out . 
  plus some are blatant attempts at karma whoring , like posting a picture of an endangered species and not even saying what that species is !, 
  does anyone else hate the `` x of europe '' trends ? 
  foreshadowing . 
  angela will be undergoing hormone replacement therapy and grow a mustache . 
  it 's not ? 
  does n't mean it ca n't be discussed . 
  this speech was probably written for him by aides so i do n't think it meant somehting special to trump . 
  the sentence can obviously be interpreted from many points of view but i 'll focus on the migrant crisis and islam since they 're quite relevant at the moment . 
  i do n't mind muslim people being muslim in europe , but there needs to be a limit to how much their beliefs can influence society . 
  european values and freedoms should supersede the freedom to be a religious fanatic . 
  if you 're tolerant to intolerance soon you 'll be left only with intolerance . 
  why is europe letting saudi arabia spread their wahhabism ? 
  it has no place in europe , or really anywhere , and is not even genuine . 
  saudi arabia literally pays for people to practice it . 
  why is the uk doing so little to stop female genital mutilation ? 
  why is n't the burka banned in all of europe ? 
  why are child marriages increasingly common and not stopped in the uk ? 
  why is sweden and other nations welcoming back isis fighters and even trying to find them jobs ? 
  that 's not being tolerant , that 's being stupid and letting people be harmed just not to appear islamophobic . 
  the whole refugee crisis contains a lot of ridiculousness . 
  if europe wants to help people from warzone countries then stop accepting migrants from safe countries so that there 's more space for real refugees and try to take people from syria itself . 
  the people who most need help ca n't even get to here because they do n't have the thousands of euros a refugee 's path to europe cost . 
  we 're taking the least vulnerable and forsaking the ones that need help the most . 
  if this is about europe wanting additional workers to fuel its economies well then there are hundreds of millions of qualified people around the world wanting to come to europe and contribute their skills . 
  why are we in stead taking the ones that have no qualifications and do n't even appreciate the countries they get sent to ? 
  it 's like europe is n't even trying but just going with the flow . 
  it ca n't assert itself to the ngos ferrying migrants from the libyan coast or to turkey threatening to unleash a migrant wave or to numerous countries who refuse to take back their people while taking in billions of aid . 
  europe is letting itself become overtaken by un-european people ( not saying you ca n't be muslim , foreign and culturally european , just that too often that 's not the case ) and while yes their influence and number is small today they can grow rapidly and turn the continent into a bad place . 
  if they do n't do it then the far right 's reaction to them certainly will . 
  i hate trump and want bad things to happen to him but he raised some valuable points . 
  `` the fundamental question of our time is whether the west has the will to survive . '', 
  is something that needs looking into . 
  huh , we 're the fifth least homophobic nation in ee + caucasus ? 
  that 's way better than i expected . 
   he does n't he blames serbs themselves and the opposition . 
  you might wan na read up on what he says . 
  he does n't now , what i 'm saying is he probably will once serbia has been in the eu for a while .

  i am not saying that there isnt an issue with islam as a whole , if so many acts are happening there definitely is but putting everybody together is a mistake , as were those german jokes generalising poles as they offended everybody especially those who were not criminals . 
  i see you are unfamiliar with / r/the _ donald . 
  it is not just about trump , it is a political subreddit which discusses many topics . 
  they are far-right ( though they say alt-right ) so when i said what i said it was calling out this thread for being far-right as well . 
   the majority of refugees in bulgaria are in closed camps away from the major cities and there have been problems with them . 
  thats not true . 
  they have a camp in northern sofia a there are others nearby , i even went there to give them diapers and other supplies when they first came . 
  i even see them walking about at times . 
  its hard to say what exactly it is because its not racism or xenophobia , its irrational hatred based on religious differences . 
  i thought islamophobia was the closest term describing that . 
  you are absolutely correct . 
  the socialist years in bulgaria completely screwed everything up . 
  public opinion was not pro-russian as bulgaria had worsened relations with russia and the end of the 19th century , and had went to war against russia in both world wars . 
  but the regime mind-washed everybody ( a regime put there by the soviets during their occupation of bulgaria at the end of ww2 ) . 
  not deathly afraid of migrants but of muslims . 
  like in poland people are way too polarised by an issue that hasnt touched them . 
  poland has close to 1 million ukrainian refugees have you heard anybody from poland complain about them ? 
  same time relocation plan has 4k migrants that are supposed to go to poland and they are making an international crisis out of it . 
  its islamophobia and most of eastern europe has it . 
  yet bulgaria went to war with russia twice during the last century in both world wars after abandoning the russian sphere of influence in the late 19th century . 
  the love for russia does n't come from the russo-turkish war it comes from the socialist years when russia 's actions were idolised and when monuments for an invading and occupying army were built . 
  its cause of all the muslims , oh wait nothing has happened in bulgaria a country with more refugees than the uk and a 10 % muslim minority . 
  maybe we will have to look more deeply into the problem instead of jumping emotionally on the convenient scapegoat and generalisations . 
  ** edit - ** i just want say that i expected for all my comments in this thread to be heavily downvoted but i am pleasantry surprised they have n't been . 
  it further proves to me that / r/europe is a mature subreddit where we can rationally discuss issues and its what makes it my favourite subreddit . 
  because of the way most people say it . 
  why do we have to have a thread after every such event that belongs more in / r/the _ donald than in / r/europe with generalisation and talks about how europe is turning into this and that when uk especially saw much harder times during the late 20th century at the hands of the ira ? 
  10 years ago people were saying the same about the polish criminals who stole every car and tractor in eastern germany . 
  how does it feel when people make a joke about poles stealing cars when you have never done so ? 
  does n't happen in bulgaria either and we have close to a 10 % muslim minority . 
  i dont agree that `` rapid growth '' which is actually what you said is and should be an important checkpoint for joining the euro . 
  and rapid growth isnt synonymous with stability since any underdeveloped country in the world that does something right is able to achieve such growth , not to mention all the help the eu is giving bulgaria . 
  but do note i did not disagree with you on whether bulgaria was ready to join but rather about rapid growth being the deciding factor . 
  its not about growth but about stability and being responsible enough . 
  diverging from his country 's official opinion ** a hundred years ago ** , nevertheless . 
  not to mention all the genocide . 
  yep i sometimes catch myself remembering the price as 9 instead of 10 when it was 9.99 . 
  it definitely works . 
  you have gone so deep into the pit of sarcasm and trolling that you are close to going 180 degrees and becoming a normal person instead of a pathetic little troll . 
  its not different in bulgaria unfortunately . 
  remember what people were saying about plevneliev or why people voted for radev ? 
  most bulgarians see trump and putin as the `` real leaders '' and people like trudeau and plevneliev as weak ones . 
  bulgaria has only to gain from wavering public support for russia . 
  what 's the point if we are already pegged to it and have been for a couple of decades ? 
  surely there is no financial debate , a referendum would be a populist shitfest of equating currency to national identity . 
  4/4 that is some top notch guessing . 
  yeah and why i said `` in the present '' . 
  i do n't think the technology for efficient storage of such quantities is here yet but tesla is doing miracles in that field so who knows what we will have in 5 years . 
  i do n't think it will be possible to go completely 100 % renewables though , at least not in the present because renewables are unpredictable and do not put out a steady stream of energy . 
  i agree that we should eventually drop other methods of harvesting energy but for the time being we will need to have a reserve that can be turned on when necessary . 
  the best outcome i see is having the capability to cover a large chunk of your energy needs from non-renewables and to use them to cover the fluctuating clean energy . 
  but the advantage is that the waste can be controlled and gathered up and stored away from the environment ( if done properly of course ) . 
  cant do that with coal . 
  i ca n't understand why go after nuclear power though . 
  its clean and cheap and its a good foundation to grow your renewables from . 
  even if you buy into the bs that nuclear power is unsafe what are you , expecting a tsunami in switzerland ? 
  the only reason you guys do n't want to join is because of your fishing industry is n't it ? 
  iceland like norway has the advantage of being in the best location in europe to be forgiven being isolationist so i think that plays a factor as well . 
  nevertheless , i hope you do join . 
  i see the eu as a way for us insignificant countries to survive this century ( though i would be a federalist because of fraternity anyway ) and i am seriously doubting the us 's friendship so maybe nato wont be enough in 50 years who knows . 
   these countries getting rich to me is n't a threat , but an opportunity . 
  i want these countries to get rich . 
  its not a threat until their national interests get mixed up with yours . 
  china is a totalitarian regime with no civil rights and lots of censorship . 
  their values are so much different from the uk 's or italy 's or finland , etc. 
  you cant trust them the way you trust france . 
   ensuring that as much of the world as possible moves towards democracy is to me the challenge of our times then i dont see how you can support closer relationships with countries like china . 
  i am not worried about inter-european ( excluding russia and its neighbours ) issues in the coming century though i am certain that the status quo of friendliness will violently change in the future expedited by events like nato and/or eu breaking up if they were to happen . 
  but the threat i see in this century is from the outside . 
  like russia or china or many of the developing countries with massive populations that just need to get an economy going to completely blast past any individual european country like nigeria , brasil , indonesia , india , etc. 
  some of these sound laughable but lets not forget where china was not 60 not 50 but even 40 years ago . 
  and i think that is a valid thread to peace and independence in europe . 
  they are a country with a 300k population with an economy the size of kosovo . 
  they will have no influence over what happens to europe , they will have no choice but to `` go with the flow '' and like switzerland in ww2 their only saving grace would be that the allies ( eu ) will save them from the bad guys in the world in a war that may not even involve soldiers but influence and political power . 
  i like how you put the uk with iceland because by the end of the century both countries will be insignificant islands somewhere to the east compared to the ones who will actually have a shot at seizing any such opportunity like the eu , china , india . 
  they do , preferably at the local bar . 
  you know it is funny how the people the farthest away from terrorism and migrants are the most paranoid in all the polls and statistics . 
   it 's not islamophobia , we have muslims in poland and have had them for hundreds of years, 
  you are the ones trying to prove to me that you are tolerant by saying `` look weve got muslims already '' which is the equivalent of saying `` im not racist , look i had a black friend in kindergarten '' . 
  the reality is that poland is extremely islamophobic , if it wasnt you wouldnt be creating an international crisis over * nothing * because 4k migrants even when not compared to the million ukrainians is * not news worthy * if it wasnt a matter of religious xenophobia . 
   it 's our country , and we want it to stay polish and be for poles first from the start my argument has been that you have said nothing about the million ukrainians but are fanatically afraid of 4k migrants . 
   even a single polish woman raped or a single person run over by a truck is a cost too high to pay . 
  dude i swear are you taking this from le pen speeches ? 
  again 1 million ukrainians 0.5 of them criminals  than 4k migrants . 
  no shit given about ukraininans no rapist accusations no criminal accusations but when it comes to 4k migrants who are muslim suddenly the world is over and your dear motherland has lost its national identity . 
  * thats * irrational hate towards a different group of people and you are free to do that but you should know what you are when you do . 
  nah i am saying that the xenophobia and in this case islamophobia that is making it that way is . 
  poland is the most homogeneous country in europe with only about 1 % of your population being immigrants if you have like 2000 muslims already that is not proof of tolerance . 
  even if 100 % of those 4k migrants are lazy assholes you need 0.5 % of the ukrainians to be the same to beat that number . 
  your problem is not with immigration or lazy people its islamophobia . 
  edit : poland you deserve your government . 
  seems like its the same way in poland if you are having protests and overwhelming public opposition to 4k migrants but nobody gives a shit about the million from ukraine . 
  i saw this on r/videos and was wondering what / r/europe thinks since it happened in the netherlands . 
  people in the / r/videos thread are overwhelmingly displeased with the sentence and are saying how much better the us legal system is because the driver would have gotten +30 years in prison . 
  this is the court 's position :  ` it is not certain that he was driving too fast . 
  moreover , speed does not have to be the cause of the accident . 
  with his car , the suspect could have taken the bend at 130 kilometers per hour , according to research . 
  furthermore , he was not drunk or stoned or busy with his phone . 
  he also has a blank criminal record . '', 
  well it was * built * as a castrum but castrums are very basic and have wooden walls .

  it was a nice attempt to push your turkophobic stereotypes though . 
   europe being hard on turkey has nothing to do with it . 
  what 's happening is that , turkey 's leadership sees the financial troubles plaguing europe . 
  they thus consider europe to be weak . 
  the two are not unrelated . 
  given the diminishing benefits of membership , the cost of joining europe may not be worth the price . 
  so it may well be that the terms the eu is asking for are too hard in exchange for what it is offering in return . 
  and by this i do not mean the conditions for better human rights , which i think turkey should respect , but the concrete political concessions that they are asked to make . 
   so , they suck up to those whom they consider powerful . 
  welcome to international relations 101 . 
  countries do what is in their national interest . 
   turks only understand `` power '' . 
  how is this not true for every single country in the world ? 
  can you cite any country that does not understand power ? 
   `` turks do not aspire , they do not hope , they ... fear '' another one of your stupid stereotypical quotes no doubt . 
  turkey is the only country in the middle east that successfully fought the wester war of colonization and successfully won [ its independence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_war_of_independence ) , and avoided becoming the mess that the arabs have been turned into . 
  it seems like some people in europe still suffer from this colonial complex of seeing themselves as superior where they `` aspire '' and `` hope '' for higher goals , while their colonial subjects are two dimensional animal like characters that can only be pushed around by `` fear '' of punishment . 
  well , i can assure you that is not the case . 
  turkey has great aspirations , and through this move it is telling europe it wo n't wait forever to realize them . 
  it takes two to tango . 
  turkey ca n't meet every whimsical term that the eu comes up with in order to keep it forever waiting at the door . 
  especially when the double standards are becoming glaringly obvious . 
  see the exceptions granted to s. cyprus during its admission for example . 
  what do georgia or armenia have in common with europe other than being christian ? 
  i can see how this can backfire mightily as more and more countries begin to adopt the technology . 
  so does every ethnic group living under a different country , such as the turks & pomaks in western thrace , for example . 
  i am sure you would support their claim to their own country as well then ? 
  how about northern cyprus , why should they be forced into a unitary state with the greeks instead of having their own country ? 
  let 's just keep dividing existing states into smaller and smaller components . 
  it makes them easier to rule , does n't it ? 
  oh the glorious bulgarian flag flying north of the danube . 
  romania , we have finally conquered thee !, 
  the [ great bulgarian empire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/bulgaria-%28893-927%29-tsarsimeon-bytodorbozhinov.png ) has awaken once again . 
  i wonder what could possibly lead a seemingly liberal european to be attracted to radical islam . 
  as a muslim that is growing more agnostic with time , i find it hard to understand why anyone would move in the opposite direction . 
  huh ? 
  i did n't get the part about the first cousins at all . 
  is there a link to the full interview ? 
  i spent a year in the uk some time ago , and to be honest i really did not like it much . 
  somehow i think i do n't relaly `` fit '' in the culture there . 
  but that could just be me . 
  europe is beyond the austerity limit , and it has long reached the breaking point . 
  mr barroso needs to upgrade his austerimeter . 
  no , thanks . 
   decency you make the mistake of attributing human qualities to inanimate objects . 
  corporations are simply profit making machines , they have no such human attributes as decency . 
  and yes if monsanto can get their claws around the european food supply , they will , because there is nothing that maximizes your profits more than controlling the food supply , as demand for it is quite inelastic . 
  unlike other sectors of the economy , people always need food no matter what how the economy is doing , and that guarantees these companies their profits . 
  i also find the income tax monumentally stupid , but government need taxes in order to feed their bureaucracies . 
  if you ask me , it is better to increase the tax burden on the bankers and decrease their bonuses , than shift all of it onto the ailing middle class . 
  you used the word ` annexed ' . 
  turkey does not claim the north as part of its territory , it recognizes it as a separate state . 
   both sides are civilised and we can work things out on our own you are only saying that because the balance of power today is not in your favor . 
  back in the day when turkish cypriots were crammed into little enclaves and raided by the eoka thugs of [ nikos samson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikos_sampson ) you were singing a different tune . 
  in a free market economy , this would lead to a drop in home prices until the market clears the excess inventories . 
  but of course the banks ca n't let that happen because they would loose their bets on rising prices . 
  reminds me of [ greenspan 's ( chairman of the us central bank ) assertion that burning homes would be better than letting the prices fall ] ( http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000050025 ) . 
  color me surprised . 
  divide and rule, 
  given that serbia is landlocked inside the eu , i am not sure how they plan to place those facilities there without asking the eu for permission . 
  i thought he was speaking english with a very strong irish accent . 
  it took me a while to figure out he was not speaking in english in the beginning . 
  the [ first one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/quaterionenadler_david_de_negker.svg/544px-quaterionenadler_david_de_negker.svg.png ) has way too much detail . 
  kind of reminds of the coat of arms of the [ ottoman empire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/osmanli-nisani.svg ), 
  does n't spain also offer residence to anyone who buys a house there ? 
  when the public threaten the existing power structure they become terrorists . 
   is governed by puppets of the eu not so much puppets of the eu , [ as much as of goldman sachs ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/what-price-the-new-democracy-goldman-sachs-conquers-europe-6264091.html ) . 
  otherwise that governments are puppets must be quite obvious by now . 
  a disorderly default in any eurozone counry would financially hurt the big and powerful banks , and they have ways of making sure it does n't happen , or at least not while they are exposed . 
  greece came really close to defaulting in april of last year , and as their democratically elected prime minster threatened a referendum on the bail out terms , he was promptly forced to resign , and replaced with a banker friendly technocrat . 
  portugal will not be allowed to default for the same reason greece was n't allowed last year . 
  a default would pose systemic risk to the entire euro area , and might lead to a breakdown of the euro-zone . 
  why ca n't europe have its own search engine rather than having to rely on an american company ? 
  russia has [ yandex ] ( http://www.yandex.ru/ ) , china has [ baidu ] ( http://www.baidu.com/ ) , what about europe ? 
  for the eu to become federal , it first has to do away with the concept of the nation-state . 
  nationalist politics based on the idea that states should be based on ethnic lines are still quite powerful in europe . 
  i do n't think you understand the point of media freedom . 
  i do n't understand the priorities of the turkish president here . 
  there is a terrible humanitarian tragedy happening next door in syria under his nose , and yet he is trying to deflect attention towards a fictitious holocaust in europe . 
  why do n't you just quit bitching ? 
  direct your anger towards the murderers that are on trial there , not the media that is trying to cover the event . 
  i am sure that 's what the jews that stayed in germany thought right before the holocaust . 
   and greeks are very passionate about these things greeks are sensitive on this issue because they are standing on thin ground . 
  my impression has been that the people in the north of greece look very balkan , and are quite distinct from the people that live in the south . 
  given the history of the region , especially the forced hellenization and ethnic cleansing of the slavic population after the second balkan war , that 's not too surprising . 
  independent in doing what exactly ? 
  the powers that central banks had historically was to set interest rates , lend fiat money through the primary dealers , or directly monetize government debt . 
  the cypriot central banks has none of those powers at the moment , so its independence is meaningless . 
  what about regions with mixed populations that have coexisted for centuries ? 
  what you propose would be a recipe for ethnic cleansing . 
  so if the cyprus central bank can not print euros , what exactly is their role ? 
  what is meant by threatening their independence ? 
  thanks for the info . 
  i remember that the bulgarian lev and the turkish lira were roughly equal when the denomination of the lira first took place . 
  the last time i checked the lira was lower than the lev , but maybe i got that wrong . 
  the lev is tied to the euro through a currency board mechanism , so the exchange rate must follow exactly the one with the euro . 
  how is this relevant to this subredit ? 
  what about georgia and armenia ? 
  perhaps the serbs are betting on the eu ending up like yugoslavia did in the 90s - mired in debt , with resurgent nationalism , and constituent states bickering over who will control the central bank . 
  i personally hope that wo n't happen .

  i for sure dont want and wont live in a eu-less europe . 
  lol at the one with the sheep jumping off the cliff . 
  turns out you just need to completely fuck up your country 's financial situation for decades in order to save yourself . 
  good job greece , you did it !, 
  it was the same for religion and absolute monarchies . 
  we should always strive to make our world better . 
  i just think that nationalism and state need to be separate like religion and state are . 
  governance and administration should be based on values not nationality . 
  so everything is everything ? 
  :d im not sure i like that distinction . 
  how is that fearmongering ? 
  brexit would cause the uk to leave a bunch of treaties and the remain campaign focused on what severing those treaties would do . 
  if they didnt focus on that they would have only presented 1/5th of the issue to the people . 
  basically nothing has and nothing will happen until the first reports of the deal they will get surfaces . 
  what lies did the remain campaign say ? 
  i am genuinely interested . 
  arent the right and left wing also separated by authoritarian and liberal ? 
  fascism is based on authoritarianism and nationalism which are both seen as right wing while their counterparts like liberalism and socialism , communism are seen as left wing . 
  we all know that the wing system is flawed and confusing as fuck but it is established as such that fascism falls under the right side of the spectrum . 
  you will always find experts to quarrel over probably most types of government . 
  such is the case for hitler 's national socialist party and others . 
  i believe in multi-culturalism and all , but that requires willing participants . 
  knowing how nationalistic the balkans are how the fuck is montenegro going to survive the next several decades ? 
  i knew bosnia was a clusterfuck but didnt think montenegro would be as bad . 
  history of poland or `` and then the russians and germans came '' . 
  the reason was desire to explore . 
  if china or the caliphates had been as interested they would have achieved the same outcome . 
  harder to dominate the world when its not filled with people who live in huts and havent even researched animal husbandry . 
  really ? 
  cause people calling on nationals to be more patriotic because their openness is shameful is so right wing . 
  i am ok with this . 
  whether my example was good or not doesnt matter . 
  did you really not grasp what i was saying ? 
  the recent failures of poor immigration policies are not an argument against multi-culturalism . 
  it worked pretty well for decades within europe . 
  hence a failed capitalist state is not an example of how capitalism is inherently bad . 
   multi-culturalism is failing in most countries , with a few exceptions . 
  multi culturalism worked in europe for decades . 
  your issue is not with multi-culturalism its with the muslim immigrants who refuse to integrate . 
  there was no issue with inner-european multi-culturalism and i wont allow you to force us to segregate ourselves because of poor immigrant policies . 
   multi-culturalism is simply a huge failure . 
  this shit again . 
  then i point to greece and say capitalism is simply a huge failure . 
  multi culturalism is based on equality . 
  this is racism . 
  when a person says they are pro-nationality ( like pro-german ) it sounds like they are xenophobes trying to hide it with a more socially acceptable term . 
  that is what i was responding to not the actual immigration issue . 
  i think we can all agree against uncontrolled immigration , in fact i have been for the australian solution since i heard of it at the start of the whole crisis . 
  this is different than xenophobia . 
  xenophobia is what many people in the uk have against eastern european immigrants who do honest labour and pay their taxes . 
  it is an unreasonable fear of outsiders . 
  wanting good citizens as immigrants is not irrational . 
  yeah the real term is xenophobic nationalists . 
  weird eastern european view of morality strikes again . 
  keep the homos away from the kids so they dont grow up to play pokemongo in church . 
  lovely . 
   recently , he spoke with ten young syrians . 
  `` two of them spoke german , were doing well , and reminded me of myself back then , '' he says . 
  `` the other eight were telling me that ` allah gave us germany as a refuge , not the germans ' . '' most syrians and other muslims , he now thinks , will never integrate , instead retreating into misogynistic , anti-semitic and anti-democratic worldviews and segregating themselves in radicalised enclaves . 
  this is how i have felt about the refugee crisis from the start . 
  20 % will assimilate the others will radicalise . 
  either we find a way to distinguish between the two groups or non of them should be allowed to enter the modern european societies . 
  yeah that makes sense . 
  i get scared when people talk about eu-wide taxes because bulgaria has a very weird relationship with taxes where we have low wages but also we have top 5 lowest taxes in europe ( lowest in the eu ) . 
  so even polish taxes would greatly destabilise our economy . 
  i dont know about this . 
  why would anybody choose bulgaria if not for the 10 % corporate tax ? 
  i dont know the situation in other countries but ive personally not had any issues with the migrants nor have heard that someone has . 
  and ive always been against the current plan , but the media has created 70 % of the problem themselves . 
  shame is a far-right party will win an election sooner or later just because of their anti-immigration policies but everything else they offer will be shit . 
  how dare you question the hive mind ? 
  refugee crisis is the worst thing to happen since ww2 . 
  historically russia and life for its people have always been best after they lose a war and spending gets redirected to stuff rather than the military . 
  thats until the next warlord becomes in charge and the whole cycle starts again . 
  sometimes i wonder if even the people would trade military might for economic stability . 
  russia has lots of resources and just a couple of good governments can turn the tides . 
  but people will continue voting for putin and people like him will continue to get 90 % approval ratings because the people prefer to annex crimea rather than better their civil rights . 
  i wasnt saying that we shouldnt question this . 
  rather that people should be less receptive to the trash that russia throws at the west . 
  people in russia are so blinded that they are mind-washed by the government controlled media to blame the west for anything which only worsens their chances of finding a solution to their oligarch problem . 
  its very important that western people dont start doing this as well . 
  i bet youve hear people say `` i wish we had a real leader like putin '' . 
  the west and russia arent judged on the same level by either side . 
  the west is always expected to make no controversies whilst putin 's political enemies are being found with bullets in their heads and nobody bats an eye because `` its just russia '' . 
  i wasnt talking about the issue but rather addressing what op was saying . 
  they do in all the institutions . 
  laws are made with the whole eu under consideration . 
  sometimes you get the short stick but overall we all benefit from the cooperation . 
  dont you ? 
  a peninsula is a piece of land surrounded on 3 sides by water . 
  the cia map seems pretty good to me . 
  doesnt make sense to carve out land in the middle of it . 
  that would be like saying madrid or zaragoza arent in the iberian peninsula . 
   anyway , we have to be responsible for our actions , i hope the attackers will be prosecuted in poland , and jailed in polish prison that makes no sense . 
  the attack took place in another country with other laws and punishments . 
  you say the origin of the victim is not important but then want to send the guilty party to the victim 's origin . 
  very interesting . 
  i knew there were new factories opening in plovdiv yearly but in my mind i still felt it was stagnating . 
  i think we always knew that the winning side would get blamed for every little thing no matter if it was derived from the vote . 
  but until we actually learn what deal the uk will get its just throwing shit at each other with each side having its own threads where the opposite opinion gets downvoted .

  a system is legitimate or an illegal rigging based on what it does , not on my or your opinion . 
  and yes , i do want to negate as much as possible the votes of those who do it by being paid or coherced . 
  them voting is n't democracy in the first place - they do n't make a choice , they fulfil an obligation so they will keep their work place or get 50 levs . 
  democracy is a concious , informed society chosing how it is run , not rich people buying elections . 
  if the particular circumstances of my country make proportional system favorable for the latter , then it is the less-democratic choice . 
  all is context , in this country a majoritan system will allocate more seats to the places where people do n't vote by cohercion or vote buying , but out of a citizen 's choice to participate in a democratic system . 
  hence the end result would be more mp 's chosen for their ideas rather than money . 
  which in turn breaks the back of the oligarchy and mafia . 
  a majoritarian electora system is n't rigging the system . 
  it 's not gerrymendering or voting fraud . 
  it 's an entirely legitimate option for voting systems , practiced in many countries . 
  the fact that i or someone else considers it less of a representation of the direct plurality of voters , does n't mean this is a consensus . 
  in fact , many argue for it being a more democratic option as it negates the dominance of hard-electorates , who usually consist of people with little rational decision on whom to vote and more often a blind , ingrained loyalty to a party , or as is in the case of my country - economic dependance on the parties of the local oligarchs . 
  if the end result is a more democratic representation of the overall population at the cost of the those 3 dependent hard-line voting groups , then it is the right thing to do . 
  and i 'm being very theoretic with you here , the practical side of things on the ground is that everything done to free the country from the grip of the oligarchs and mafia is a good step , no matter if doing the same in other countries would n't . 
  ( almost as if each state is a unique case of its own ), 
  which was at more than a quatre of a million , with the commonwealth big 4 taking up the majority . 
  you now claim the new government has stopped that so i just want the raw facts on that for me to update my knowledge on the situation . 
  what laws have been put in place by them to stop or severely restrict this more than quatre of a million non-eu , commonwealth majority migration . 
  you seem to take this argument very emotionally and perhaps for that reason refuse to answer any of my points , instead quoting separate words taken out of context and fight them . 
  it 's a dishonest way of debating - we are n't here to `` win '' something , so why do this ? 
  if having a talk about this historical issue is what you want , then do please go back to my post and try to address the actual points i made in their entirety , which i ' v already repeated a few times . 
  if not , and just `` winning '' is what you look for , have at it . 
  here 's my points that prove he should be called `` polish historical figure '' again , i 'll even put them in separate paragraphs , feel free to argue them in their entirety rathe than single words out of each , or do n't bother at all . 
  i have no interrest in a nationalistic banter . 
   `` you seem to put the horse before the cart - eu is the political identity of the place we all live in , `` german , french , czech '' is the identity we have based on the mother tongues we speak at home and cultures we carry .

  so it just seems logical the poles should claim him today . '', 
  i understand , so why would they be acting this way ? 
  interesting , care to share the data that indicates this or the laws passed by the new conservative majority that specifically restrict commonwealth migration ? 
  let 's keep it to the other comment-thread . 
  i ' v answered there . 
  you seem to put the horse before the cart - eu is the political identity of the place we all live in , `` german , french , czech '' is the identity we have based on the mother tongues we speak at home and cultures we carry . 
  `` litvin '' and `` litvak '' were the political identities of the people ( slavic or jewish ) who lived in the grand dutchy , whilst rhuthenian , polish , russian were the ethnic identities based on culture and language . 
  if you spoke rhuthenian at home and adhered to the culture you were rhuthenian , if you did polish you were a pole , but both of you were also litvin 's because you did that as slavs inside the grand dutchy . 
  there is the overreaching political identity of the people living inside the dutchy , and then the smaller , ethnic-based identity of each of them based on the culture and language they had . 
  since the dutchy no longer exists the `` litvin '' part is just historical now , no one identifies with the the way he did . 
  but since polish language and culture still exist , there are those who can claim kosciosko based on that , and that is the poles . 
  modern lithuanians and belarusians have nothing to claim kosciosko by - they do n't speak the language he did , nor identify with the state he did as `` litvins '' . 
  so what 's the connection ? 
  what does a lithuanian from somewhere in kaunas have in common with him ? 
  not the political identity as litvin , not the language , not the culture ... meanwhil , a polish person from anywhere in the world has a lot in common with him - the basics actually , language and culture . 
  so it just seems logical the poles should claim him today . 
  i fail to understand what has this to do at all with the description of kadyrov above . 
  it seems you have political ( geo-political to be precise ) interest in not discrediting kadyrov , whereas this article simply mentiones facts about him and his type of authoritarianism . 
  facts are facts - you can disprove them if they are false and i very much encourage you to do that in this case cause i do n't want to be misinformed , but if you just do n't like that certain facts are mentioned because the person they address is `` useful '' for your geo-political goals then you are the biased and politically-vested one . 
  i 'm making an objective statement here , i truly have no horse in this game and would just like to know the reality on the ground there . 
  so you have problem with it being used by nazis and antisemites ? 
  which makes sense , unlike your original statement . 
  and yet you neither do stop it nor do you seem to have any social problem with that . 
  a few times more indian people moved legally to the uk in 2014 than bulgarian , yet the hysteria was all about bulgarians and how you should leave the eu because of it . 
  in the past 2 years the migration has even reversed from some eu countries like poland , whilst staying the same from commonwealth ones , yet still the voices are against eu migration , with no worries at all that aprox 2 billion people in the commonwealth 's big 4 ( india , pakistan , nigeria and bangladesh ) represent an inexhaustible source of migration towards your state that continues to flow . 
  no i mean why not just polish . 
  he was born into a family that only spoke polish and identified with polish culture . 
  he never spoke ruthenian or lithuanian , he never identified with their culture , hence he 's not part of their ethnicities or culture . 
  we also have turkish historical people born in bulgaria but do n't consider them anything but turkish and part of their history . 
  ataturk was born in thesalloniki , but greeks do n't call him `` greek-turkish '' . 
  what your mother tongue is and with what culture you identify matters , so kosciosko was just polish . 
  living in lithuania made him identify as `` litvin '' , but this is n't an ethnic term , it means any ethnicity living there and identifyin with the dutchy - ruthenians could be litvins , russians , poles etc. 
  he was one such pole . 
  from what i ' v come to understand litvin means any person of any ethnicity or culture who lived in the lithuanian dutchy and identifies with the land . 
  ethnic rhuthenians there could identify as litvins as well , ethnic poles , ethnic russians etc. 
  same as russki and rossyjski today means russian in two senses - ethnic and identifying with the state . 
  a person speaking chechen language and identifying with the culture can call himself `` rossyjski '' because he lives in russia , but is n't ethnically `` russki '' . 
  kosciosko only spoke polish and identified with polish culture , hence he was polish by all means as there 's really not other criteria for one to be part of a nation . 
  no dna or blood tests or whatever , ancestry is irrelevant when your family has for centureis adpoted the language and culture of some group . 
  he was a polish person ( meaning one who speaks polish and identifies with the culture ) living in the grand dutchy of lithuania and hence identifying with that land as `` litvin '' . 
  i have no previous knowledge on that particular newspaper and its vested interests . 
  i just read the article and what it states corresponds with previous things i ' v read on kadyrov . 
  so where was i wrong ? 
  which part of what i read above is untrue ? 
  what 's wrong with them using it ? 
  i do n't get it ? 
  something against the symbol or something against nationalism ? 
  why polish-lithuanian , is this information wrong : `` ko\u015bciuszko , however , did not speak the belarusian language ; his family had become polonized as early as the 16th century . 
  [ 21 ] like most polish-lithuanian nobility of the time , the ko\u015bciuszkos spoke polish and identified with polish culture '', 
  is this incorrect and what 's your version : `` ko\u015bciuszko , however , did not speak the belarusian language ; his family had become polonized as early as the 16th century . 
  [ 21 ] like most polish-lithuanian nobility of the time , the ko\u015bciuszkos spoke polish and identified with polish culture '', 
  millions have already entered the uk through the commonwealth , and will continue to do so as there does n't really seem to be any push towards restricting commonwealth ties , on the contrary , they want to streangthen them as they leave the eu . 
  why is no one in the uk talking of the millions of previous and future pakistani , bangladeshi , indian , nigerian etc. 
  immigrants , but poles , romanians , bulgarians and syrians are a huge scare ? 
  there 's 20 million syrians alltogether in the world , 38 million poles , 20 million romanians and barely 7 million bulgarians . 
  bangladesh alone has 140 million , pakistan 200 million , nigeria over 200 million , india over a billion - those are no problem cause they are commonwealth though ? 
  coming thanks to `` our glorious past empire '' as opposed to the `` henious eurocrats '' !, 
  how come ? 
  the constant comparisson with greece is entirely faulty . 
  bulgaria suffers from none of the indicators greece had and a similiar collapse is impossible . 
  the country has a very , very healthy macro-economy , with one of the lowest debts-to-gdp in all of europe ( 27 % ) , aboslutely none of the huge wellfare the greeks had , none of the subsidies or bloated burreaucracy with large salaries and 14 payments a year . 
  hence why the country 's population is also considerably poorer - price for a healthy economy and stability when you ' r not yet developped . 
  but in the end the country simply has no weight on the budget or the economy like in greece , no debt to default to , and a good export and tourism to bolster what little is carried by the state . 
  ( greece has a labour force of 4,811,049 and $ 237.970 billion gdp = $ 27.2 billion exports ; bulgaria has only 3,533 million labour force and barely $ 57.6 billion gdp = $ 29.25 billion exports ) you just ca n't compare the health of the two economies , they are diametrically opposite . 
  one has a good life for its citizens paid for by an unstable economy , the other has a very stable economy paid for by poor life quality for its citizens .

  good grief . 
  you forgot cyprus . 
  my point is simply that chp supporters resent that #s 2 and 3 are even an issue , and the rest of them also resent # 1 . 
  but everyone else will eventually become eu members , short of russia . 
  it 's pretty much guaranteed . 
  why am i getting downvoted ? 
  the most common argument against turkey 's membership in the eu is , it will allow millions of turks to live in other european countries , and that is bad because `` they do n't share our values . '', 
  the general sentiment when eu membership is brought up is , `` hordes of turks will invade . '', 
  how is that not insulting ? 
  bulgarians and romanians got the same treatment in the uk press , and it 's ridiculous . 
  western europe looks at turkey and all they see is erdogan , kurds , armenian genocide , etc , etc. 
  for 99 % of turks , they have no control over these issues . 
  meanwhile , bulgarians have retreated back to hibernation . 
  that 's very true . 
  i have rarely met a turk who does n't say , `` i have georgian heritage , i have bulgarian heritage '' etc , etc. 
  not even a year ago , i was deeply worried about what increased turkish-russian cooperation might mean for small countries like bulgaria that have often been in the shadow of these two nations . 
  now , i am less worried , as long as this does n't turn into full scale war . 
  there was a saying that went something like , `` when your enemies fight amongst themselves , be happy . 
  when they are of one mind , be afraid . '', 
  i do n't think the secularism of western nations is what caused them to ` play games ' in the middle east . 
  probably hunger for power and control , greed , and a fear of the soviet union . 
  other than that , your comment is on point . 
  i think most people seriously underestimate poverty in bulgaria , and youth unemployment . 
  it 's why a lot of people emigrate . 
  corruption plays a secondary role - people want well paying jobs . 
  us first !, 
  what does tsipras mean greece is a bastion of stability ? 
  let alone the last bastion of stability in the area ... 
  is it bad if i think that the first picture looks better ? 
  i mean look at the church right on top of the cliffs . 
  in 1910 it had walls and was beautiful , now it looks derelict . 
  not to mention the countryside looks so much cleaner and healthier . 
  i think the first picture was taken from the church in the foreground of the second . 
  thank you !, 
  so you can be poorer than bulgaria per capita !, 
  yes , and israel is not poorer than moldova . 
  for gdp ppp : bulgaria -  romania -  croatia -  hungary -  latvia -  poland -  lithuania -  greece -  estonia -  slovakia -  cyprus , and on and on . 
  i just grabbed the world bank data from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  edit : to give some perspective , that 's about the same gdp ppp as iran and iraq . 
  however , a better index to check out would be the [ inequality adjusted hdi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi ) . 
  here we see europe pretty much far outstrips the rest of the world , except for the obvious commonwealth nations and rich east asian countries ( japan , s korea ) . 
  however , even in this list , moldova is ranked 67th , around mexico , while the poorest eu member bulgaria is ranked 39th . 
  in bulgaria it was 2-6 , 2 is failing , 6 is excel . 
  not sure how it is now , and not sure why it started with 2 and not 1 . 
  the most powerful nations that have emerged in the past 2 centuries have been the usa and the ussr . 
  neither based its existence on ethnicity . 
  the most stable and good thing for the middle east would be for the kurds to be included in the political process in turkey . 
  this process is already well underway , with the hdp performing really well in the past 2 elections . 
  the more kurds feel they have representation , the less support the pkk will have . 
  thank you !, 
  can you explain the meaning of schaffen to me ? 
  i see it pretty frequently , but still have n't quite grasped the nuance . 
  whoa - here we go , now you changed your argument . 
  an independent kurdistan will positively affect stability , safety , and prosperity in the middle east !? 
  border changes * never * make things more stable . 
  this is why they have been taboo in europe since wwii . 
  i guess having an independent croatia and bosnia really made things stable . 
  yes . 
  you would be taking away from free movement and commerce privileges from at least 50 million turks for the affected region . 
  and that 's just one example . 
  this decision would have consequences for turks as well . 
  what about the turks that live in those regions ? 
  what about the turkish military bases that secure the country that would have to be relocated ? 
  it 's not so quite clear cut as you seem to think . 
  just let the pkk ones leave , and keep the hardworking ones . 
  most of turkey does n't want an independent kurdistan , therefore it is undemocratic . 
  you do realize that the vast majority of bulgarian turks do not profit from the dps position , right ? 
  in fact , many hate them , because all of the money goes back to dogan and a few towns where he grew up . 
  i would say bulgarian turks have it worse in this setup . 
  the dps encourages their isolation so they can rely on the votes . 
  this isolation causes bulgarian society to mistrust them , especially in sofia . 
  this is not good for them or for the country , both in the short and long term . 
  afaik the turks were invited to train the kurds * with * the central government 's permission 2 years ago . 
  still , if the central government is now revoking permission , then the turks should leave . 
  let 's not drag nato into a war . 
  cross border trade ftw !, 
  i just looked it up - apparently [ 9 % of all bulgarian exports ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/bgr/ ) are textiles . 
  that is n't solely finished products though , apparently we export a lot of yarn . 
  that only comes out to 2.66 billion dollars a year , but it 's not insignificant . 
  edit : and another 1.1 % footwear and headwear ( $ 332 million ) and 0.4 % animal hides . 
  plenty of clothes made in bulgaria . 
  not sure if they are only available in bulgaria though . 
  as far as i know , turkish citizens can get the visa at the border, 
  erm , she sounds like she has better things to do . 
  belgrade more expensive than sofia !? 
  poor serbs . 
  basically there is a little north korea in the russian caucus region . 
  a strongman funded by putin , who has built a cult of personality . 
  what does it mean ? 
  further indoctrination and isolation for the region 's population , economic growth dependent on russian federal money . 
  when russia runs out of money , we might see kadyrov even go his own way . 
  yes , the millions upon millions of chp and hdp voters all cried out in one voice and suddenly vanished . 
  i was about to ask if it was a play on zeitung , but loan word seems much more probable . 
  not really . 
  what 's happening is that the anatolian masses finally got their say in government . 
  typical counter-culture swing . 
  meanwhile the young are getting more and more progressive , despite all this . 
  you realize that istanbul and sofia are more than 1.5 hours apart by car , right ? 
  this thread is so empty . 
  glad no one was hurt .

  united and working together doesnt mean doing whatever one member wants for the sake of the others . 
  it means doing the best for the whole union . 
  the greeks are solely responsible for what happened to them ( apart from the world crisis ) and blaming the eu for not coughing up large amounts of cash and giving them to a country that has proven their financial irresponsibility is unreasonable . 
  the eu currently is still just a union where members voluntarily give parts of their powers to it . 
  the countries are still massively in charge of everything they do . 
  the eu didnt have the power to stop greece for irresponsibly getting into debt and i can only imagine what the people would have said if the eu tried to meddle in what was happening . 
  as the eu we are currently united insignificantly because there lacks a central government . 
  so you are basically blaming the eu for the powers in does not have . 
  the eu is working towards unity but we havent achieved it yet . 
  the eu cant `` deal '' with any of its members , worse thing it can do for greece is do nothing and it has already done more than that but the fact that people like you are viewing the bail-outs or even doing nothing as eu being unfair to greece is to me preposterous . 
  are poles not resistant due to the plague not affecting them ? 
  what bending of the rules , are you talking about when the greeks lied and covered the real state of their economy in order to join the eurozone , oh that wasnt bending that was basically fraud ? 
  and greece 's democratically elected government has always been free to do whatever they wish to , but when you threaten the economy of others because of your own doings you will be expected to deal with the problem . 
  i am not sure about that , i think that completely destroying your economy and damaging the common currency due to the awful decisions that the country made is not really working towards a better future but stupidity and selfishness for the sake of the others . 
  you care about humans so you want them to divide themselves further and continue trying to out-manoeuvre each other and to hinder each other instead of uniting and working together for a better future ? 
  sounds to me like you actually care about preserving a broken status quo rather than improving the lives of humans . 
  it was in dupnitsa though its very hard to find any info on it ( i have a feeling the communist regime moved quickly to cover as much of it up as possible ) . 
  it was not used for exterminations but as a ground from which the jews were sent to other camps . 
  we werent genocidal but we did go out of our way to capture serbian and greek jews for nazi germany . 
  we even had a concentration camp . 
  we have to deal with the same things here in bulgaria . 
  just recently we had a school teacher who is also a public figure and a politician talk about this at a tedx talk . 
  people went crazy calling him anti-bulgarian and it didnt help that he is not of bulgarian origin and his name is emil jassim . 
  dont forget austria . 
  that plus the number of parties running so closely is a good indicator of a highly functioning democracy and country . 
  ah good thats actually a very good turn out . 
  with a 33 % turnout i think we can throw all polls in the garbage and expect anything . 
  dunno , unfortunately i remember that video of that baby penguin that got slowly disembowelled and eaten to death by a seagull for like 20 minutes . 
  nature is scary . 
  well now we just have to scale it . 
  i feel like the netherlands have been a trend setter for europe historically so i really hope they dont get a populist in charge . 
  apparently as fascist as possible . 
   1 ) because some non democratic systems are worse than democracy and some are better than democracy . 
  what a coincidence then that all the best countries in the world are liberal democracies . 
   2 ) because people should be more concerned about the well being of their countries than their own well being . 
  moving anywhere because you think you would be better of there instead of trying to improve your country is ultimately selfish . 
  i disagree but then that has nothing to do with liberalism unless you are saying countries should imprison their populations . 
  you saw how the late 20th century was for our countries , or maybe you havent and thats why you are looking into repeating yesterday 's mistakes . 
  yeah who needs civil rights and shit . 
  north korea has 0 liberalism why dont you go there ? 
  no i know there are issues in turkey especially since erdogan but people vote against their interests even in fully functioning democracies so the effect is doubled in turkey . 
  with brexit and trump as potus i dont need to question whether the people would vote against their interests . 
  the irony of ending democracy with a vote . 
  this is basically a i < 3ny t-shirt but on the legs of pretty girls . 
  its genius . 
  when i think about the main characteristic of the regime on city planning i think about needless destruction in order to fulfil some symbolic nonsense . 
  the building is beautiful and you are lucky to have gotten away with only that compared to our palace of culture . 
  now that american corporations will truly own your government i am sure that you will do fine . 
  haha to be honest we have literally fought against the serbs in absolutely every war we have fought since liberation except the first balkan war so its easy to get mixed up . 
  oh thats actually the serbo-bulgarian war of 1885 where the serbs attacked bulgaria to challenge the unification with rumelia . 
  yeah the way the second balkan war was taught to me was that it was totally serbia and greece 's fault that bulgaria attacked them . 
  the second balkan war was started because the bulgarians were very disappointed and even insulted over the treaty of london-1913 especially because bulgaria and serbia had a treaty signed of how to split the macedonian region before the war broke out which the serbs ignored after the war and instead just annexed all the territories which they had occupied . 
  bulgaria and ferdinand were furious and a month after the first balkan war ended bulgaria attacked both serbia and greece who in the meantime had sighed a defensive pact against bulgaria . 
  bulgaria even knew of this treaty before engaging which makes the decision to attack even more puzzling . 
  serbia and greece repulsed the attack and were joined by romania and turkey ** and ** montenegro . 
  the war lasted 39 days which became bulgaria 's second contribution to the top 10 shortest wars in history the first one being the serbo-bulgarian war of 1885 which was even shorter . 
  so why do i think this was the biggest mistake of modern bulgaria ? 
  bulgaria entered a massive national crisis which affected its economic industrial and military capabilities for ww1 . 
  bulgaria alienated itself from ** all ** of its allies , back then bulgaria only had the balkan league as allies as relations with russia had worsened ever since the serbo-bulgarian war and ever before that . 
  bulgaria 's ambitions for macedonia became an obsession akin to a drug addict and his drug . 
  this was ** the ** reason bulgaria joined the central powers during ww1 and even ww2 . 
  what did the central powers promise bulgaria ? 
  macedonia + greek territories . 
  also bulgaria and ferdinand were really looking into some revenge for the embarrassment they had suffered so joining the entente would have meant peace with serbia and neutral ( and buzzing with entente troops ) greece plus all the bulgaria claimed foreign territories were part of greece and macedonia ( plus the newly ceded southern dobrudja to romania which was also neutral ) meaning there was nothing for bulgaria to gain from going to war with turkey who were the only central powers in the region ( with germans and austro-hungarians still having issues in serbia ) . 
  starting the second balkan war labelled bulgaria as traitors and as untrustworthy , i dont remember the source for this but i remember reading the statement of someone from the great powers who was very adamant in punishing bulgaria as much as possible at the end of ww1 because of that . 
  and they did bulgaria was very severely punished losing the territory it had at the aegean sea plus some minor parts of its western border to serbia . 
  there were also reparations and this completely crippled bulgaria which suffered another massive national disaster . 
  so after the aftermath of the second balkan war and ww1 bulgaria was ally-less , penniless , stripped out of more territory than it gained from the first balkan war and internally very unstable . 
  the position that bulgaria was in during the inter-war period can be blamed for why bulgaria joined the axis in ww2 . 
  now the events surrounding bulgaria joining the axis are way more complicated than just saying it was due to ww1 and the second balkan war but imo it was the position bulgaria was in after those wars that resulted in the bulgaria that would join the axis . 
  bulgaria had a chance to escape communism if it had n't started the second balkan war and fought twice versus the western powers minus germany . 
  if bulgaria had instead sided with greece and the uk during the 20th century i think there was a high chance that churchill would have fought against bulgaria falling under the influence of the soviet union . 
  this is the most cloudy and baseless hypothesis i make but just imagine this - bulgaria does not start the 2nd balkan war which means it does n't lose dobrudja , it does n't join either side in ww1 in turn keeping its territory in the aegean sea becoming much more strategically important and without having any of its bad anti-western powers reputation there is a chance for bulgaria to have remained independent and capitalist especially since the soviets would n't have had the excuse of bulgaria being axis to do whatever they please as they passed through creating a coup and a communist government though that certainly did n't help poland . 
  i hope this was n't too confusing i am very bad at writing cleanly but i did my best considering how much i wrote . 
  it was mainly completely untrained conscripts and many died from poor logistics and disease . 
  but yeah bulgaria was the driving force of the first balkan war and fought the most and lost the most men . 
  speaking as neutrally as possible bulgaria was pretty much snubbed though , bulgaria got less territory than both serbia or greece ( serbia effectively doubled its territory ) while they got areas with bulgarian ethnic majority especially in modern day macedonia which was completely given to serbia . 
  so one can even come up with another similarity to the germans , both countries were heavily disappointed in a treaty which resulted in more instability and another war ( ww2 and 2nd balkan war ) . 
  though i believe that starting the second balkan war was the dumbest move bulgaria has ever done in its modern history effectively deciding its future for the rest of the 20th century . 
  large army and wannabe conqueror king ferdinand i. 
  during the first balkan war bulgaria fielded 500k soldiers which was about 12 % of its population at the time . 
  havent seen one protest about 1.3 million ukrainians , how many were there for the 4000 muslim ones that the eu never sent ? 
  uhm yes it is and the least its not an issue that can be discarded as ridiculous as you have . 
  at 2:18 that whole section which i assume is a party quickly decided their stance . 
  majority of the voting ones and those ones are the ones that matter . 
  the biggest one imo is the division between western and eastern values . 
  especially the older people , many of them armed with nostalgia think that everything was so much better during the socialist regime years . 
  we have so many people that like trump and putin because they are `` strong '' leaders and thus we have a very strong radical nationalist faction that would have us fight against the world because bulgaria is so much better than everybody while the truth is we are a small poor nation-state in between two continents and value systems . 
  so geo-politically we are all over the place which to me just sounds like massive problems in the future when the world isnt as stable as it is now . 
  internally we have so much corruption that has infected absolutely every institution . 
  who isnt corrupt ? 
  one can never tell , everybody promises to fight corruption and then we have a basically non-existent anti-corruption bureau . 
  socially we are as divided as ever . 
  homophobia and racism run rampant where casually hating lgbt and jews/turks/blacks , etc. 
  is perfectly acceptable . 
  our school system is a joke , literature and history classes are basically patriotism classes , a remnant of the old hyper nationalistic socialist regime and its system so even our young people are coming into the world as institutionalised turk haters who cant think rationally . 
  i have 2 siblings , i remember when each one of us came home one time after kindergarten and declared how we hate the turks because they hanged one of our freedom fighters during the 19th century i am sure almost every child has to go through this , thankfully my parents taught me better but what about those that didnt ? 
  currently its taboo to even question the historical status quo . 
  our ex-ex education minister was forced to resign because he stated a historical fact and the people went crazy because it was lessening the martyr role of bulgarians during the ottoman rule which is how most people in bulgaria like to think it was . 
  we are poor we are divided we are small and weak .

  how is it that for over 200 years conservatives have n't destroyed democracy and never wanted to , but now they do ? 
  and how is he going to make it difficult for blacks to vote ? 
  how is he going to endanger democracy ? 
  and the protests are a danger because they want to oust a democratically-elected candidate . 
  then the germans deserve to live in the shithole they create . 
   european, 
  trump is literally hitler mussolini bad guy racist man and he 's going to endanger democracy , it does n't matter that he got elected democratically and there are protests which have a primary goal of endangering democracy by deposing him, 
  loool, 
   but is afghanistan really a safe place ?

  how you ** feel ** does n't matter and never will in a debate .

  rumen `` anyone but tsetska '' radev,

  there 's that word again . 
  hate the country , love the nation . 
  actually i was supporting trump , still ca n't fathom that this is actually reality though, 
  fuck you . 
  though i should n't really expect more from someone who 'd rather be represented by an eu flag than his own nation 's flag . 
  after trump winning something does n't seem right . 
  it feels like we 've been transported into an alternate reality . 
   if they 're born and grow up in france with a french passport , they 're french just because a mouse is born in a stable , does not make it a horse . 
  because you love your family , does it mean you hate all other families ? 
  in the ile-de-france region , the percentage of non-french ( people with immigrant parents ) is 37.1 % . 
  in paris , 41.30 % of people under 18 are of foreign origin . 
  18.10 % of people under 18 in france are of foreign origin . 
  these numbers are increasing . 
  nationalism is the support and an undying love for your own people . 
  keep in mind that does n't mean you hate other people . 
  see it like a family , you love your family and want their best interests , but you do n't hate other families . 
  if other people can be helped , that 's fine , but it must never be at the expense of your own . 
  nationalism is also about wanting your own people living , thriving and being in charge of your country . 
  i want bulgarians to rule over and live in bulgaria , upholding bulgarian interests , just as i want the same for any other country around the globe , whether it be france , sweden , germany , egypt , iran , congo etc. 
  what 's wrong is that the french ( and mostly in paris ) are becoming a minority in their own country . 
  you have the same situation where the british are a minority in london . 
  `` everyone i do n't agree with is an idiot ! '', 
  how many people are convinced to change their mind after being insulted ?

  generation z in the west is going to be the most conservative generation in over 80 years . 
  there is nothing to celebrate . 
  bulgaria would have been better off if they never entered the war . 
  there is no such thing as democratic communism . 
  karl marx did not intend that . 
  well , i 'm glad at least a few people are optimistic about france 's future .

  this sentiment originated before wwii . 
  bismarck rustled a lot of jimmies in his time . 
  in fact hitler made very good use of anti-german propaganda and turned it in his favor . 
  that 's why it 's never a good idea to attack an entire nation . 
  for example , if individual politicians in greece had taken the hit for the country 's mismanagement i think the crisis could have gone smoother and without the rise of golden dawn , anarchists , and communists . 
  i 've always imagined that the lannisters were based on a typical spanish or italian noble family like the borgias with all the incest , intrigues , and gold . 
  also is n't dorne inspired by persia ? 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about boy . 
  greece was wealthier than any country which joined the eu in 2004 like the baltic countries , poland , hungary , czech republic , and slovenia as well as some of the older members like portugal and cyprus . 
  it was more or less at the same level as spain and italy . 
  in other words : greece got a lot poorer due to the economic crisis . 
  we did n't get billions and billions of dollars from sugar daddy us and had to go through 50 years of communism . 
  do n't worry . 
  we 'll be fine as soon as we find the bastard selling combustible vodka !, 
  bank deposits in cyprus are 800 % of cyprus gdp . 
  the average citizen has benefited a lot throughout the years from living in a tax heaven . 
  when your banks make 8 times the amount of products and services your country does , i really do n't think a one time 6-10 % tax is all that much . 
  nevermind , better blame germany for your faultily structured economy . 
  i guess no one is untouchable . 
  strange . 
  i 've always considered the king to be spain 's best politician of the 20th century . 
  no , i am not opposed as long as you can locate their remains . 
  i see . 
  you do n't know the difference between a memorial and a cemetery . 
  a war memorial is a monument to those who died fighting for your country . 
  you wo n't find a turkish memorial in shipka just like you wo n't find a japanese memorial in pearl harbor . 
  a cemetery , on the other hand , is where the dead are laid to rest . 
  the dead man is not your enemy . 
  if you destroy his grave , you wo n't hurt him . 
  you 're only making yourself look stupid for letting something which happened a hundred years ago shape your life . 
  the ones who died at war must be respected . 
  to do otherwise would be a breach of the geneva convention . 
  absolutely sickening . 
  the current king has done a lot more for spain than a lot of spaniards would like to admit . 
  just saying . 
  you 've been reading too many little red books : ), 
  a nation of trolls . 
  i do n't think that a country in which every right wing populist is branded a neo-nazi and a criminal is a good example of dealing well with the `` nazi heirloom '' . 
  we still saved 50,000 jewish people . 
  i guess the bbc has to put a negative spin on everything concerning bulgaria . 
  may be if we had slaughtered more of our minorities we would be worthy of schengen . 
  fewer `` welfare tourists '' --  fewer problems dat western european `` culture '' . 
  wow , what a dumb cunt . 
  just because they were massacred in romania and not sent into a camp does n't mean it was n't holocaust . 
  in fact the einsatzgruppen killed more jews than the concentration camps did . 
  if that story is true it seriously pisses me off that there are academia members like him in europe . 
  everything changed when the firefox nations attacked . 
  from one extreme to the other . 
  what an idiot . 
  let 's not put the entire country in one basket . 
  i 've met people from ohrid and strumica who 've told me that people there are not too hot about populist nationalism and think that skopje 2014 is an extremely stupid idea . 
  the most ridiculous part is that actually the public does n't know how much everything costs because the construction contracts are kept `` secret '' . 
  happy baba marta from me to all redditors , too !, 
  be upright and healthy !, 
  we sad bro . 
  yep , we were about 9 million in the mid eighties and right now we are about 7.3 million population . 
  that about a 20 % decrease in so much years . 
  while i respect people 's choice to seek a better living abroad , i want to go back and try to do something home . 
  i be damned if i leave my country to die without doing something . 
  a small part of me wants him to win the elections so that he can go back to these big leader meetings in the eu and say : `` i 'm back bitches ! '', 
  i just want to see merkel 's face when if that happens : ), 
  i did n't expect that from you sweden . 
  what is happening to our european utopia ? 
  yes , and you will always be a dumb polack . 
  what now ? 
  sounds like a worse version of kultur shock . 
  this tune sounds familiar even though i think that 's the first i 've listened to it ?? 
  btw , do n't you think it 's ironic that half the anthem is about the sa when it was the nazis themselves who got rid off them ? 
  the police here actually beats people only for important stuff . 
  like football . 
  get rid off the belgians . 
  no retarded image macros in this subreddit please !, 
  i do n't know if they are more violent , but i fucking hate far-left scum . 
  but do n't worry even though they may outnumber the rightists , the majority of germans still hate their commie guts . 
  ah , yes the curious case of the rising electricity bills . 
  meet the new boss , same as the old one . 
  hide your wives , hide your kids , we are going in strong , baby !, 
  there are no brakes on the migrant train !, 
  choo-choo uk and germany, 
  the ironic thing that i have n't seen any major news media mention is that the bulgarian driver who was among the dead was muslim himself . 
  there is a lesson to be learned about radical religion . 
  bulgaria may be lacking in a lot of ways , but at least we have been mostly free from this disease . 
  not when it 's personal . 
  that speculating fucker should hang himself . 
  we were your biggest friends for the last 20 years . 
  we were the first to accept your independence and to help you in the first days of statehood . 
  we even provided military support to help you with your conflict 2000-2001 . 
  yet you have constantly shat on the relationship between our two countries . 
  you bully everyone who considers himself bulgarian . 
  the most notable example , lubcho georgievski , your ex-prime minister who you now call a traitor and try to find a reason to keep in jail just because he has a bulgarian passport . 
  i am not saying that we are paragons of human rights , but what your media is doing is disgusting . 
  most people in bulgaria really could n't care less about what you call yourself , what you call your language , and what you call your giant ass statues in skopje . 
  they care mostly about the political repression in your country . 
  do n't try to make us the villains in all this . 
  we have kept quiet about your shit long enough . 
  and do n't worry when it comes down to the voting on your membership we will again vote in your favor just like we have always done , but i 'm sure it will again be forgotten in a few years . 
  i love stories like this . 
  very well written too . 
  or may be even hungary ? 
  actually russia has a lot of 4 lane roads , but without a central divider or a shoulder and hence they are not motorways .

dude in western world greek yogurt is more popular than bulgarian one . 
  however there is a difference between the two . 
  bulgarian one is more sour as it contains more live bacteria , in fact according to bulgarian state standard a product to be called yogurt must contain enough amount of live bacteria . 
  greek one on the other hand has milder taste , it is strained and has longer expiry , the amount of live bacteria , if any , is very low . 
  in asia , russia and some other countries bulgarian yogurt is popular , in fact i think if you show them greek one they will be surprised that there is another country famous for that product . 
  lol , i really enjoyed that . 
  bulgaria - against russia . 
  the other thing on the map is in how many countries the name russia is present . 
  people of belarus are still very connected with their eastern neighbor and determine countries according to their affiliation/relations with russia . 
  well ... stupid article in politico . 
  i bet the language issue will be the least problem if brexit happens . 
  let uk leave the eu . 
  they 're always complaining and always want to be treated exceptionally . 
  if after all brits think they are better on their own - be it . 
  the greek debt crisis will end up when eurozone cut greece loose , not before that . 
  the other option is - endless bailouts and debt write-offs . 
  if greece leaves the currency union and introduces drachmas , it will become way too expensive to buy foreign goods , which in turn will boost domestic production . 
  that is the way . 
  in the foreseeable future the hellenic state can not suddenly start producing high added value goods and services simply because it lacks infrastructure , educated and skilled workforce . 
  as euro is a strong currency , you must have strong economy , hence - drachmas are better for you . 
  dude , i have a lot of experience with greeks , even speak , but not write , greek language . 
  modern day greeks live for the now , not for the future . 
  they are opportunistic and often change their minds . 
  i think it is because good times in contemporary greek state are over and people are scared of what follows . 
  greeks are well aware that future is not bright . 
  i read all data and can not understand what is this all about . 
  explaining the difference between the eu societies ? 
  some sort of ranking ? 
  after all everybody knows that different countries have different cultures . 
  i am not optimistic about greece . 
  they are the most self-pity and self-righteousness individuals i 've ever met . 
  one percent increase will make life not affordable . 
  dude ... you need to move to eastern europe or asia and work as much as they do for peanuts in order to see what `` unaffordable '' means . 
  russian grammar is awful . 
  you 've kept the tenses and combined them with verb tenses , and there can be a sentence without a verb . 
  the word you typed sounds like `` ipologistis '', 
  europe as we know it can not continue existing for many years . 
  it will either disintegrate or go for sort of federalization . 
  at the moment european institutions are inefficient , not elected by people , very wide gap between brussels and common europeans and lose a lot of time for abstract theories and things . 
  if you talk about numbers , then short scale trillion stands for the word \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d in bulgarian language as we use long scale . 
  if you talk only about the word `` trillion '' without its mathematician context then yes we have a word \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d . 
  you will not hear that in bulgaria , but outside bulgaria in western or northern europe , and as i point out it is prejudices and ignorance . 
  yeah ... lol means funny . 
  ok i 'll try to explain in a few words . 
  western europeans do not consider the balkans as part of europe , but as part of the orient . 
  i am bulgarian myself but i do not live in my home country . 
  very often people in europe mix up bulgaria and hungary , or they mistakenly point at bucharest as being the capital of bulgaria . 
  all above of course is prejudices and ignorance to some extend . 
  hahaha ... dude , rest of europe do not consider bulgaria as european nation . 
  and as you can see , almost no comments from our part of the word named balkans lol . 
  yeah , right . 
  eurozone is waiting for us . 
  dude ... i guess it 'll take ten years before bulgaria adopts euro . 
  i must admit i have never visited vratsa . 
  will have to do that some day . 
  ok , nice lecture about ancient greek history . 
  and it points at solving contemporary problems with ancient methods . 
  looking at different point of view - people and civilization did not change much during the last 3000 years . 
  lol ... it was fun watching the video . 
  and it portrayed what we think of each other with humor . 
  but it got close to reality , did n't it ? 
  well i am getting fed up a lot with all these articles of brexit . 
  if people vote `` yes , we leave '' - so be it . 
  do n't see anything devastating for eu and uk . 
  if after leaving the eu , britain experiences any economical/financial difficulties - it will be their own problem and they will be free to deal with it in ways they think are more efficient . 
  yeah , right . 
  significant portion of the greek debt was written off some years ago . 
  now greece is lobbying for another debt relief and after that will ask for more money and after that for another debt relief and so on . 
  let them default and cut them loose of the eurozone , after that they 'll be free to print as much drachmas as they want and their average income would be in millions drachmas with almost zero purchasing power parity . 
  lol ... old gods sounds funny . 
  i did not see any cabins or huts on the lake 's shores . 
  and how come people do n't drill holes on the ice and try fishing . 
  i do n't see anything devastating if the uk leaves eu . 
  if people vote `` yes we leave '' so be it . 
  if after that uk experiences any economical/financial downfall or crunch , will be their problem . 
  how can isis be defeated without operation of ground forces is beyond me . 
  and when isis was created some years ago , western countries neglected that fact . 
  now it spread itself like an octopus throughout iraq , syria and libya . 
  the ones who think iraqi or any other arab ground forces can manage with isis , my answer is - if they could , they would . 
  where was the picture taken ? 
  was it at a refugee camp or at some border ? 
  i personally think that the current asylum seekers crisis is over exposed . 
  eu has about 500 million individuals , and 2 million refugees can not cause as many problems as media is trying to suggest . 
  yes some of the migrants are violent , some can not cope with european-christian life style . 
  there are other problems as well , but main problem is - nationalistic european mindset . 
  why on earth muslims do not have as many problems in the states and canada as they have in europe , specially the west part of it ? 
  and to my opponents i wan na point out - in my home country there is a significant muslim minority left over the time when we were part of the ottoman empire . 
  we 've almost never had problems with them . 
  hmm ... interesting . 
  some countries over contributed , others did almost nothing . 
  when will the madness in syria stop ? 
  when will isil be defeated ? 
  great , so if russians residing in bulgaria ask help from putin , he 'll start bombing and raiding . 
  the russian attacks of georgian territory without declaring a state of war or without a request of legit georgian authorities were just as unlawful as attack on ukraine . 
  really ... south osetia as well as abkhazia were within georgia , ai n't that correct ? 
  westerners may not know much about the conflict in abkhazia , but in the balkans we do . 
  and is n't there a russian military base in abkhazia these days ? 
  or you wan na say that someone invited russian troops on georgian soil ? 
  that could be done only by the legitimate georgian government . 
  and as far as i know , georgian authorities did not request russian troops on their soil .

  keep in mind we 're not exactly swimming in money over here . 
  i actually think the president 's point of it not being in the budget is reasonable . 
  edit : or , yes , you could downvote me , that 's also an option . 
  you 're mentioning crimea . 
  we 've had reports of russian paramilitary in ukraine since late 2013 . 
  crimea is annexed in early 2014 . 
  the plan for the development of the armed forces is from late 2015 . 
  when i said `` recently '' , i meant in relation to that . 
  i do n't see how the annexation of crimea makes the romanian request any less untimely . 
  exactly . 
  and they also use this to excuse their laziness or incompetence . 
  this is more or less the price we pay for not living under an authoritarian government . 
  take away the excuse and they 'll find a new one . 
  the actions of the predecessor . 
  the opposition , the coalition partners , etc. 
  scapegoats are , by definition , replaceable . 
  if you believe your government is dishonest with its citizens and hides behind other institutions , you should be more afraid of removing these institutions from its path and remaining at the whim of said government . 
  hey , i like assange as much as the next guy , but this logic is ridiculous . 
  `` our politicians are using eu as a scapegoat . 
  so let 's get rid of ... the scapegoat ! '', 
  my point still stands . 
  you ca n't call the annexation by a regime that 's responsible for a genocide `` a good thing '' , because it contributed to independence . 
  there was a very good comment somewhere in this thread that compared this to being grateful to hitler for israel . 
   i have to admit that the soviet union 's annexation of western ukraine ended up being a good thing . 
  what the actual factual fuck ? 
  look , i 'm not usually one to abstain from jumping on the russophobia-bandwagon , but could we please not bash russians for being evil and imperialistic on a day that celebrates them becoming slightly less evil and imperialistic ? 
  let 's not make it any harder for the ordinary russians , that 's what the \u041a\u0420\u042b\u041c\u041d\u0410\u0428 !!,

  happy russia day , by the way !,

  he 's part of our folklore and a frienemy to our own sly peter . 
  well , here 's a relevant tale of mulla nasreddin :  one day , nasreddin entered a village and viciously declared , `` my bag is lost -- and if you people do n't find it , you 'll find out what happened the last time my bag got lost ! ``  the villagers , quite terrified , frantically began searching for the bag . 
  minutes later , a man found it and and presented it to nasreddin . 
   out of curiosity , one of the searchers asked nasreddin , `` i was just wondering , what would you have done if we did n't find the bag ? ''  nasreddin responded , `` i would have bought a new bag ! ``, 
  never in my life have i seen a witty cartoon that has needed every element of it tagged and named .

  please make sure your [ opinion ] ( http://youcan.fixcopyright.eu/limesurvey/index.php/591338?lang=en ) on this is heard . 
  [ you see orhan , ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/753/ivan.png ) when swing sword like me , warhorse is never the battle-scare , for not having ears to hear the battle . 
  i know . 
  i was so happy to find the original version after [ i thought the bastardized version was catchy . 
  vomit-inducing lyrics aside , the melody is stolen from [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypsuxllev1e ) . 
  same awesome melody , 100 % percent less erdogan . 
  compare the video to the dances from the newest [ allahu trapbar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfu7aql3eqc ) .

  this is why you do n't let [ mc vagina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc03hms1brk&amp;t=2m32s ) into the clergy . 
  seriously though , this has to be the funniest thing i 've learned this week , thanks !, 
  well , yeah , `` even post-coup , erdo is scarier than gulen '' is an unpopular opinion , i had it saved because of its `` told you so '' - potential . 
  not disputing that the battle for the kurdish majority is long lost for erdogan , but do you think mhp will play a big role in their decision ? 
  to the best of my knowledge there 's a rift between the mhp electrorate/lower levels of the party and bahceli & co. 
  i do n't think the nationalists themselves will be swayed by the akp-mhp alliance , much less the kurds . 
   have criticized erdo\u011fan 's regime , ** or ** have ties with the g\u00fclen movement why i 'm sure these will not be interchangeable . 
  i 'm just going to [ quote myself ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4wk4fg/how_the_west_once_again_fails_to_grasp_the/d681odi/?context=3 ) from 8 months ago , because i 'm narcissistic like that . 
  and a stupid excuse it is , no argument from me . 
  if the article was about gun control not preventing terrorism , i 'd be fine with that . 
  hell , i 'd add it 's a way for the government to appear like it 's doing something while ignoring the cause of the issue : self-segregated , self-radicalized minorities . 
  it makes sense to ignore the excuse in the context of the alarmist tone of the article and the alarmist comments in the thread . 
  like :  slap in the face of the so-called european democracy  with its vote , the european parliament decided that democracy and justice in europe do not exist , and that not all european citizens are created equal . 
  broken watches still show the correct time twice daily . 
  aaand you 're down the emotional-drivel-rabbit hole . 
   people kill people . 
  if a person wants to kill someone he can easily use a machette or a butter knife for all i know . 
  i 'll type this very slowly for you : `` a machette and a butter knife '' : 1 . have uses other than killing 2 . ca n't kill people en masse these are the things that make firearms different from knives , or cars , or anything else you compare them to while spewing nra-rhetoric . 
   yea regulate our bourbon . 
  regulate our cars . 
  people are stupid . 
  they are irresponsible . 
  only a parent like figure like a government bureaucrat is illuminated and responsible enough to put our lives in order eh ? 
  smh shhh , it 's ok . you can calm yourself now . 
  tell me , do you want to open google and type in `` drunk driving fatalities in greece '' , or should i do that for you ? 
  the definition of `` regulation '' is `` something that makes other things illegal '' . 
  if no one owed anything that would be illegal after the passing of the new regulations , what would be the point of them ? 
  you can still own firearms . 
  just not ones you can easily mow down a classroom with . 
  because , uuhhh , guns kill people ? 
  it 's wise to regulate them , like a lot of other things that can be dangerous to others , like alcohol , tobacco , pharmaceuticals , motor vehicles , etc. 
  they 're not , though . 
  they 're making the regulations more strict , it 's still possible to own guns legally , no one 's `` taking the guns away '' . 
  ok , because the article was overly emotional drivel , i need to ask : disregarding the uselessness of gun control in reducing terror attacks , why is tighter gun control bad , exactly ? 
  next day edit : shit , late-night shitposting attracts triggered americans . 
  yes , please , more !, 
  more nra talking points !, 
  cars kill people !, 
  stairs kill people !, 
  criminals do n't care about laws !, 
  why , you do n't sound retarded at all . 
  ah , upper-middle class american youth . 
  hard to pin down exactly what they stand for .

  is it also due to you guys having a very strong intelligence service ? 
  we are talking about present and future not what it was in the past . 
  we have a multicultural society in bulgaria as well , with a big turkish minority . 
  they are still discriminated against but its not their fault , they are good people . 
  so here the issue is the racism of the native populace , not the muslims . 
  multiculturalism is not impossible to achieve . 
  but people need to understand that some aspects of some cultures are not acceptable for the modern world . 
  women obeying their men in muslim countries is unacceptable and it should not be condoned in the eu even though its part of their `` culture '' . 
  multiculturalism is not just about we accepting their culture , but them accepting ours . 
  if they cant then they are not able to live in a developed country and should go back to theirs . 
  so i dont care if you 're muslim or christian or whatever , if you dont respect the pinnacles of the modern western ideology like human rights , gender and race equality , etc. 
  you cant and shouldnt live in the eu . 
  :d lol . 
  is this satire ? 
  except when speed limits are pushed extremely low to meet the budget . 
  a 6 lane road ? 
  better make it 50km/h to save the children . 
  the issue is that the germans have some bad memories of putting people in camps and forcefully keeping them there . 
   brussels ` has no right to redraw europe 's cultural and religious identity ' obvious try to tickle the nationalistic bone of the hungarians . 
  as if the eu is n't giving asylum to refugees but trying to ruin its identity . 
  very sad orban is trying to influence the people by abusing their xenophobia instead of discussing the real issues of the migrant crisis . 
  for example , saving them doesnt mean we need to let them into our societies . 
  just do it the australian way . 
  put them in refugee camps and keep them there until their country is stable . 
  plus we should not accept people who are not from syria , eritrea or yemen . 
  we do what we must for the good of the eu . 
  i hope we never build it , europe needs to find an alternative , russia is not a reliable partner . 
  it proves that western morality is superior compared to the eastern world . 
  no lichtenstein or luxembourg 's in the east . 
  ( macau and hong kong were protected and run by western countries till the end of the 20th century ), 
   first airplane to be used as bomber during balkan war of 1912 thats actually incorrect , the first aerial bombing occurred during the italo-turkish war in 1911 . 
  bulgaria did produce the first bombs created specifically for aerial bombardment in 1912 though . 
   often been ganged up on by greece and serbia goddamn do i hate our history lessons in school teaching us we were the victim when we basically decided to attack our allies and ended up at war with every neighbour we have . 
  i am living in bucharest currently and the prices are higher than in sofia . 
  if youre romanian its 20 % also , you just have more exceptions that go for 9 % or even 5 % ( social housing ) . 
  nah i was just doing him a favour since he doesnt speak bulgarian lol . 
  but seriously , cheap booze . 
  we pay only 10 % income and 20 % vat tax though , plus goods prices are very low compared to even romania . 
  most people love westerners too . 
  i was working with a belgian who came to bulgaria and helped him a bit with the local government , the officials were saying how they trust him because he is western european and were much nicer to him than the bulgarians . 
  it does kinda haha . 
  come skiing in the winter too !, 
  the cheap alcohol and girls transfer to the ski resorts during the winter . 
  a two-speed eu is always a possibility . 
  good for them . 
  i wish we had people from the eu coming to bulgaria . 
  also if you believe in the eu dream of uniting europe , which is why i want them to stay . 
  `` multiple countries '' - turkey . 
  of course they will want to go to the best and most stable region that is close-by . 
  do n't blame the syrians for leaving a country with no future which is currently in ruins . 
  and yeah , as far as i know isis has not yet conquered europe , so that does stop the nutjob with the ak . 
  the syrians are not at fault , it is our fault we cant stop them , at least humanely , nobody should be harmed in the process . 
  yep , it was a lawless oligarchy . 
  so i cant comprehend how people think we have regressed . 
  fix the corruption with the help of the eu like romania did , create a more efficient bureaucracy especially for business and we 're off . 
  with our economy taking off everything else will be easily fixable . 
  nah more like you train the dog so that when the guy running away from a lunatic waving an ak and jumps in your lawn you can send it over to rip him apart . 
  fuck that guy . 
  i disagree with you , this is just what we as bulgarians like to do . 
  `` everything is going to shit we can never fix anything qq qq qq '' just saying we have regressed in the past 10 years shows how little you rely on facts and how much you rely on public assumptions . 
  life in bulgaria has never been better . 
  we can fix the system , the same way romania did , and in romania things were worse 10 years ago . 
  so dont go around spreading pessimisms because people will believe you and give up , we can do this . 
  not enough potatoes in mousaka ? 
  if they meet the eu 's requirements then why not ? 
  we gain another country to do free trade with , everybody wins . 
  xenophobia is fear of foreigners and outside entities , not the systematic hate towards one ethnic group . 
  no it was the bulgarians . 
  first after liberation ( after the war ended ) and then after reunification/balkan wars there were massive deportations and massacres , it was done in order to create a bulgarian majority and just out of hate . 
  it is okay for us to oppress their culture but when they did it to us during the ottoman rule it is suddenly an outrage ? 
  if having respect for all people and finding them equal is wimpy ass shit then i am proud to be a wimp . 
  i do not condone hatred and continuing the feuds of our ancestors . 
  what i want for me and for my future children is that we create a fair , peaceful and more prosperous future . 
  we dont want to let them learn their language beside ours at school , also they are looked down upon . 
  you can be racist towards ethnicities as well , not only races . 
  you speak about their crimes as if they have done them themselves . 
  and how dare you judge them since bulgarians massacred hundreds of thousands of turks after liberation . 
  if we dont stop hating eachother for stuff that happened 200 years ago how can there ever be peace . 
  as gandhi said an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind . 
  it seems the blakans have a infinite supply of eyes though since there are still people who think like you . 
  we need to find a way to live together . 
  i am sure all of them speak bulgarian , so who the f cares if they speak turkish to themselves . 
  you call the massive deportations and massacres that occurred after liberation not doing anything ? 
  bulgarians were the minority in many many man regions then . 
  sofia was almost entirely turkish . 
  and then during communism when we made them change their names to bulgarian ones , and repressed their culture . 
  nobody cares about that . 
  because they are turks and they did that to us too . 
  no / s. 
  they are a productive minority , unlike the roma , and are discriminated against just because they are turks . 
  racism against turkey is widely accepted and people are not ashamed to say they hate them just cause something something 200-700 years ago . 
  not to mention we go batshit crazy when they dare teach their language side by side ours , while we are proud there are bulgarian schools in ukraine and mfing brasil that teach bulgarian . 
  we have made them lose hope with the government , and have made them segregate into their own communities and with that comes political parties . 
  so do n't / s me . 
  until we accept them they cant shake their ties with turkey . 
  oh no , peace and prosperity , hide before they give you more rights and liberties !, 
  i think its also a bit of us in there too , thinking every politician is part of the money-grabbing group . 
  our president , for example is in my opinion the best one we have ever elected , and people are not realising that . 
  he tries to rally bulgaria with reason and logic instead of nationalism and cheap populist tactics . 
  but people will curse him and spit on his name just because he is a politician without knowing anything about him .

it does n't matter what it is if it works . 
  because they do n't want to solve the problem . 
  the moment we started to follow the eu requirements for joining it our economy went to shit and 8 years later after joining the eu we still ca n't recover [ economic growth in bulgaria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:wiki_economic_growth_in_bulgaria.gif ) . 
  all people are shit , some people are just less shit than others . 
  i hate to disappoint you , but i never claimed that this dude was any better . 
  what i am saying is that we should probably look into the reason why this happened and try to prevent it before it becomes a regular thing . 
  please tell me how much worse and bad we are compared to the middle eastern , asian and american countries . 
  if my country gets in such situation i will fight to my last breath like my ancestors did . 
  we never received any help from the west and i do n't expect you to help us in the future . 
  humans are animals , even with a higher level of intelligence we are still animals and we obey many of our instincts in our daily life . 
  you are really naive if you think that everyone in the world is understanding , honest and tolerant . 
  please , be realistic because this act of horror only confirms my thoughts . 
  i care about facts and positive gains and benefits to the eu society . 
  sorry , i am a narcissistic sociopath . 
  so , please answer my question using facts not your personal opinion . 
  it might be worth for them but is it worth for us ? 
  what were they expecting endorsing mass emigration ? 
  human history teaches us how protective we are of our habitat . 
  what about saudi arabia ? 
  is there any information about the attacker ? 
  ** google translate : ** new reporter veronika dimitrova received brutal threats made by the president of a political party `` solidarity '' and leader of the national meshere hristo mladenov . 
  they come a day after the broadcast of a report in which veronica revealed that connected with petty mafia in ignatievo is a candidate for municipal councilor from the list of `` solidarity '' . 
  as revealed by investigative reporter nominated councilors vasil stoyanov and his wife eugenia live on thefts carried out mainly in varna mall . 
  with foreign money and his family constructed a real palace in ignatievo . 
  `` for six months will get worst , the lord sends him on top . 
  you know i can judge from my unwritten laws `` mladenov said in a telephone conversation with a journalist from nova . 
  it continued : `` we have big problems . 
  i do not threaten . 
  people call me and say : `` this will be lynched in roma neighborhoods . 
  which came from nova tv , and will go past you and other journalists . '', 
  mladenov warned that after reports of veronika dimitrova `` can become a revolt in bulgaria may become a civil war . '', 
  `` you know that i have access to all judicial authorities in bulgaria and in europe , '' says the leader of `` solidarity '' . 
  veronika ivanova revealed that it had received several similar calls wednesday . 
  moreover , people from ignatievo warned her that `` her cook something . '', 
  party `` solidarity '' was founded eight years ago . 
  it is assumed that major political parties have used it as a donor of votes . 
  first agreement with `` solidarity '' signs bsp . 
  now the leader mladenov argued that their support will receive gerb . 
  on the subject of violence and threats against journalists in recent years in the studio of `` hello , bulgaria '' vasil ivanov visited anna and zarkova genka shikerova . 
  watch the whole conversation in the video . 
  ** `` for the next six months god will give you the worst troubles sent from above . 
  ** it 's the usual gypsy cursing . 
  ** `` you know i can judge you with my unwritten laws . 
  '' ** they have their gypsy court `` meshere '' it 's like the `` sharia law '' for the muslims just not so extreme and this court is illegal according to our laws but since they do n't follow the rules and law it 's not a big deal for them . 
  ** you will have big problems . 
  ** you will have a lot of problems typical gypsy threatening . 
  ** i am not threatening you . 
  ** i do n't think i have to explain this . 
  ** the people call me and say : this journalist will be lynched in the roma ghettos . 
  if anyone form nova television enters the ghettos , because of you other journalists will be gone . 
  ** it 's death threats to all journalists from nova television . 
  ** mladenov ** the gypsy party leader ** warns that the news report of veronika dimitrova could start a uprising or civil war in bulgaria . 
  ** do you know that i have access to all court/law institutions in bulgaria and europe , said the leader of `` solidarity '' . 
  ** if you watch the video and understand bulgarian the threats and cursing are really colorful and you can hear additional things which are n't mentioned in the article . 
  i completely agree with you and i think their argument is ridiculous . 
  international and domestic animal rights activists and organisations . 
  have you studied about the lebanon civil war ? 
  there is a lot of difference and when you have a child of your own you will know what i mean . 
  sorry , i do n't like old people . 
  i 'm an atheist as most of my friends and acquaintances . 
  i 'm tolerant of religious people as long as they do n't try to push their religious nonsense on me . 
  if i expected you to agree with me i would n't post in the `` unpopular opinion '' thread . 
  why is this even a topic ? 
  if you do n't like the food at school bring your own lunch or go out and buy something else to eat . 
  you are playing a dangerous game . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pbhn2/reurope_what_is_your_unpopular_opinion/cw4zcm3 ) . 
  how much is the human population at the moment ? 
  extract 95 % of the human population , how many are left ? 
  do you think the humans left wo n't be enough to cover everything they need and self sustain as a society ? 
  focusing on technological advancement i am sure we can automate the menial tasks . 
  also humans do n't need fashion , generic practical clothes for both genders would be enough . 
  they make it sound like they are doing it for free . 
  just because the planet does n't care for anything does n't mean you should n't care about it . 
  it needs to be maintained and renovated just like your house . 
  your argument is ridiculous . 
  this is n't about personal preferences but for the greater good of the human species and the planet . 
  no one will force you to live if you do n't want to . 
  you do n't have to fake it you just have to be stabbed in the right place so you do n't die . 
  for thousands of years females managed to survive without pads or tampons . 
  i would prefer medicaments to be tax free or better completely free rather than anything else . 
  i should have worded myself better . 
  we could have this without purging anyone we just have to implement sterilization with which we can get the desired population density and birth rates . 
  i 'm not some crazy mass murderer . 
  the only thing i want eradicated is religion we should study it only as fiction literature like egyptian and greek mythology etc. 
  why ? 
  if your contribution helped other people then you are one of the best . 
  it would be more like slavery , i hope you are n't a slave ? 
  sorry for your daughter . 
  if you are one of the best in the world in your field you have nothing to worry about . 
  no , no one will destroy the knowledge , art and all the other achievements of the human species , on the contrary they will be preserved so the new generations can learn . 
  farming is n't just the process of planting the crops and gathering it there are a lot of external factors , knowledge and experience needed to have maximum productivity . 
  the people remaining should be the best of the best and the smartest of the smartest so we can secure the best possible future for the human species . 
  with the reduction of the population we will remove the energy , and economical oppression so humanity can focus on technological , scientific and cosmological expansion . 
  also consider the ecological benefits for the whole planet . 
  this much more complex to explain but i hope you can get my point . 
  is there any particular reason why people hate them ? 
  yes , sadly . 
  i prefer to let the criminals to work until they die . 
  edit : the ones that deserve a death penalty not all the criminals . 
  the others can work until they serve their time .

  ok , i 'll be totally honest in sharing an opinion i 'm too sure is n't horrible . 
  i kinda ... want putin to start a war with an eu or nato country . 
  i kinda want him to invade openly , proper , just so we can shatter once and for all the idiotic excuses and lies about moscow 's involvment in the war in ukraine and intentions . 
  then i 'd like to see their army crushed by a united eu or nato effort , which will not only disspell the myth of russia 's invincibility and `` world power status '' , but also serve as a much needed unification boost to the rather shaky eu and nato relations . 
  it might be super cynical , but the reality is nothing unites people like a common goal/war/enemy , and a defensive war against such could be the push we need for a common eu army and more integration . 
  a united europe would n't need one country to be `` the heart '' . 
  that sounds like an uneven union . 
  a united europe 's `` heart '' would be the best of each nation . 
  but not the union 's capital , which is either the political in brussels or the financial in frankfurt . 
  btw , why is a finnish describing berlin as his capital ? 
  if you go by `` financial '' capital as opposed to the political one in brussels it 's rather frankfurt . 
  wherever it is there should definitely be a lot of harmless physical competitions and games organized for the balkan people to channel their annimosity and competitiveness towards eachother or else it will pile up and turn ugly . 
  podemos is certainly a text-book far left . 
  a representative of their was saying women who are grossed out to eat their periods are not true feminists . 
  another one was describing the eu and the us as `` the worst things to have happened in all of human history '' . 
  that truly surprised me . 
  was n't spain experiencing a far-left wave ? 
  are n't those usually sort of anti-globalist , anti-western and by association - pro-anyone-who-is-against-those ? 
  like putin ? 
  i 'd love seeing the rebels crushed , ukrainian army completely in control of the region and then ... organizing a referendum for independence or joining russia . 
  a brazen reinsertion of how things should be done - peacefully , and hopefully a ukraine unburdoned by that war-torn region . 
  let the russians rebuild what they ' v destroyed and carry the burden of the region for decades , whilst ukraine unifies more and heads for integration with the west . 
  reality . 
  the confusing part is serbs use both alphabets . 
  in bulgarian however it 's just like serbian - all written exactly as it is pronounced , one letter for one sound only , no `` silent '' useless letters , but also only one alphabet , so it 's streamlined to perfection . 
  you do n't need to learn any exeptions to read every word you encounter correctly - just the alhpabet , but also need to learn only one alphabet . 
  not sure why certain war heroes should n't be glorified . 
  when they defend their state from aggressors , especially ones as genocidal as the nazis , there 's little room left for the usual cynicism that 's so popular nowadays . 
  they kinda * were * heroes . 
  your second sentance makes no sense , elaborate . 
  as far as i know the `` death camps '' were around krakow to the south and around the eastern polish cities . 
  unless germans now consider all of poland , not just silesia and pomerania , as `` stolen '' ... 
  besides , even if the camps were on land that was later given to poland , are you actually claiming the polish should take the responsibility for those entirely german death camps because they now control the land the camps were on ? 
  what kind of fucked up logic is that ? 
  the one who set the camps up , operated them and killed millions , including poles , is to be blamed 100 % , ergo the germans . 
  not the one on whose land those camps were built . 
  turkey has been proven again and again to support isis , so i 'd rather ask where the eu and nato are when one of their member and candidate-member is supporting a genocidal rogue state . 
  you know what 's even more worthy of respect ? 
  not attacking your neighbours . 
  why are germans always so annoyed at formats spreading the awareness it was n't `` polish death camps '' , but german ones ? 
  ( no , not `` nazi '' , german camps ), 
  kudos for the us secret service if it was true . 
  did n't see the of when i read your comment. , thought you called them `` made up countries '' as so many have done before . 
  my mistake . 
  and i do n't blame you . 
  i just ca n't see it as this monster party city `` rio of the balkans '' when there 's roughly as many clubs per capita as other capitals , but far fewer choice in types . 
  zagreb was pretty cool in that regard . 
  you are trying to make sense of it or show that we use the same word as so many other countries have . 
  that 's not the question here - `` hey guys , how would you call it in your language '' , it 's a question how we do call it and in bulgaria the words shum and statichen shum ( noise , static noise ) are used , regardless if you like , if it makes sense or if you 'd like it we used the same word `` snow '' as other countries do . 
  we do n't , accept it . 
  census would take care of that , as would tax , employment and consumption statistics . 
  poland certainly has n't lost 5 million people already , or it would harshy feel it . 
  ( like we do ), 
  who the hell uses that ? 
  never heard it once in my life . 
  we use `` shum '' or `` statichen shum '' - static noise in my city . 
  first time i see polish regurgitating russian national propaganda . 
  should n't you be impervious to this ? 
  i ' v heard the term used far too often for the baltics , slovakia , ukraine or romania in regards to them not existing with such names and borders for long , so naturally made me think of this first . 
  `` made up countries '' ( i guess you refering to the baltics or belarus ) as opposed to what - `` nature-made countries '' ? 
  `` god-made countries '' ? 
  bismarck-made countries ? 
  cuba of the balkans . 
  krakow old town is like a medieval fairytale . 
  for a historian like myself it 's one of the best places in europe to be . 
  unfortunately 90 % of the parties are turbo folk . 
  could n't escapte that when i was there . 
  i much prefer the more diverce choice of the party scene in bucharest , athens or sofia . 
  it pisses me off to se something like that happening in the only axis country that managed to save its jews during ww2 entirely through the social pressure of the people and the church . 
  we have two objectives - get the continent energy independent through renewables and nuclear ; and get deeper integration that will make europe capable of collectively defending its position , interrests and borders in this rapidly changing world . 
  it will actually have 5 million people less . 
  courtesey of whom ... ? 
  vitoshka and the nearby streets do n't look worse than the shopping street i saw in prague right in front of the national museum and the monument . 
  neither does the area around the national theatre or the palace , or the russian church and military club , or the alexander nevsky cathedral - all places on par in their outlook with other european capitals . 
  calling them a dump is either hate or arrogance filled , and if you ' r a czech i 'd say it ; s probably the second , since as a pole i ' v dealt with plenty of you guys and you demonstrate the same attitude to poland and the rest of the countries surrounding you ( one even called my city , krakow , shitty when i was at uni , and the guy was from fucking olomouc ) . 
  something about calling other places shittier than bohemia , but i ca n't right put it down to arrogance or lack of confidence ... 
  i work and live in the closed surburb that surrounds my office building next to the mountain . 
  there 's a whole bunch of other suburbes along the mountain range all the way to dragalevtzi . 
  they are all brand new , gated and look pretty much like my neighbourhood in leuven , belgium , when i studied there . 
  pristine , new and much nicer than anything i believe is in skopje . 
  ergo , you are either lying or have no idea about the city . 
  it 's a shame you live in some run-down part of town , i am sorry things did n't work out for you in life , but being filled with anger and regret towards the city is n't going to make it better . 
  find a better job , move to a nice neighbourhood or a new suburb round the mountain of which there are plenty , and you wo n't be as bitter and hateful as you are now . 
  i know , but at least an albanian from vardarska and someone who actually lived in the region . 
  unlike greek alexander who was born and lived outside of modern fyrom and has a huge monument in a city he never set foot in . 
  or a bunch of bulgarian rulers and people that would laugh at the idea of being claimed by a `` macedonian nation '' . 
  you only realise how unimportant your country is when you find yourself hoping to see it mentioned in a thread about the worst cities in europe . 
  `` might makes right '' - the fundamental principle of the russian mentality . 
  or - `` the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must '' . 
  you truly are stuck in the middle ages . 
  `` and why are you beating the blacks ? '', 
  so maybe you should ' v remained under the mongols , since you had a `` separatist revolt '' against the integrity of the golden horde . 
  pffft , are russians seriously still as daft as to call people fighting against foreign occupation `` separatist revolts '' . 
  sofia 's outer neighbourhoods look as any other communist blocks concrete jungles . 
  i ' v seen such in bucharest , warsaw and even prague . 
  i bet skopie has them as well . 
  the [ centre ] ( http://bow.bg/uploads/attachment/filename/sofia_bulgaria.jpg ) on the other hand of sofia is quite [ nice ] ( http://blog.radissonblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/21809579_l.jpg ) , it lacks kitch bronze statues or fake marble monstrosities . 
  it has a lot of pre-communist [ buildings ] ( http://whata.org/images/1858.jpg ) that give off a distinct `` austrohungarian '' [ vibe ] ( http://novinar.bg/data/2006-03-11/11230112.jpg ) , as they were built in that style . 
  it also has some of the highest concetration of large [ parks ] ( http://212.73.128.12/pictures/athletic/pic_big/gallery/stadioni/ariana.jpg ) of any european capital , which are well maintained . 
  many of the [ outer neighbourhoods ] ( http://www.olympicwanderings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sofia-view.jpg ) are also starting to get modernized .

  for many bulgarians the existence of macedonia is only possible because of bulgaria 's grudging compromise . 
  bulgaria lost wwii and the ussr decided to solve the `` macedonian issue '' by `` appointing '' a macedonian state within yugoslavia with the `` approval '' of the bulgarian communist party . 
  that is one of the last strong universal bulgarian feelings . 
  bulgarians may be polarized on anything but the idea that macedonia is ~ ~ a fake ~ ~ an artificial country possible because of circumstance rather than because there should really be such a country . 
  do n't get me wrong , most modern bulgarians do n't really care about the territorial silliness - nobody in their right mind believes macedonia would dare touch [ pirin macedonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirin_macedonia ) but this dumbshit macedonian nationalism is really rustling our jimmies , really . 
  we do n't give a shit about how they want to handle their existence but it is not going to be at our expense . 
  jimmy savile, 
  googled that name . 
  that 's probably one of the most horrible pedophile cases i 've heard . 
  a friend of mine is * trying * to be an archaeologist in bulgaria . 
  it all started when his great grandfather found a thracian tomb on his land with gold and silver artifacts that cost 11 million euros today . 
  his family got a few food stamps back then . 
  he says looting is so rampant and chaotic that the criminals themselves have driven the prices so low it actually makes zero sense for them economically . 
  nonetheless they still do it , just destroying what is practically undiscovered european history . . and no one really wins . 
  imho best part of it all are the various religious temples that get discovered all the time . 
  my favorite artifacts are from the orphic mysticism that has a central deity , son of a zeus and a mortal woman ; who appears on a cross on some depictions . 
  there 's so little known about this cult , yet it is so interesting . 
  near it is also the [ varna necropolis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varna_necropolis ) where the oldest golden artifacts of humankind were discovered back in the 70s ; including a `` a gold penis sheath '' . 
  some nice dicks , actually . 
  countries join the eu because they make it possible , not because they they already can . 
  a prospect for turkey 's membership would make resolving issues like cyprus possible . 
  i do n't see what else we could offer to be able to split the differences . 
  for all those who hate everything the eu stands for - it 's now or never . 
  throw as much of their shit as they can . 
  exaggeration is the least they can do . 
  at the beginning of it all , personally i thought we were going to finally have some real talk about a reform of the financial industry . 
  guess i 'll wait till the next crisis 5 years from now . 
  yeah , that will never work . 
   left wingers like to represent the poor , and since a large proportion of muslims in europe are poor no . 
  and no . 
  you could make a statement about minorities ' traditional left orientation but the `` poor '' logic is just retarded . 
  read the article . 
  it 's about israel for the most part . 
  the left are critical of imperialism ( even though it 's an old concept ) and the existence of israel through the us has made it very clear on which side they stand . 
  this may sound illogical today but it decided a lot of pacts back in the cold war and things follow their path . 
  the aggressive way israel acts in gaza does not help . 
  most people on the left want peace and cooperation in the east and ultra pro-israel support sees this as leaning towards the muslims . 
  so you say we should all convert to catholicism ? 
  what makes a lithuanian assassin a good choice for the sicilian mafia ? 
  do you know this first hand or is it just something you 've heard ? 
  i 've heard it , never happened to me . 
  i 've had a lot of different jobs , read a lot of offers . 
  not a reality . 
  i know mcdonalds pay about 6 % on sundays but that 's because they are too big to duck . 
  and 6 % is laughable . 
  i once worked at the frankfurt airport . 
  a raise and weekend additions were promised after the first 6 months `` you know , to see if everything works out well '' . 
  after 8 months i asked for it and they were n't very happy . 
  after a couple more months i started calling every week . 
  was eventually fired for accumulating 3 consecutive 1 hour lateness after i got a specialized working plan that tricked me into making those 3 hours lateness . 
  that 's about all the `` double pay '' you 're gon na get in germany as far as i 'm concerned . 
  would never ask again , you know , i 'm a smart lab rat , i learn from patterns . 
  the best thing was receiving 12 cent raise once . 
  after 5 years of student jobs i 've enough experience . 
  you 'd be amazed how much effort they spend to avoid paying a few cent more . 
  nah i 'm not angry at all . 
  this lifestyle is mostly a choice , as i truly could start doing something else when i first noticed it 's going to be this way . 
  it does however bother me when people assume everything is going great for everybody , when it 's working out for a few . 
  when you say `` it 's about protecting the family '' and i know it not even close to being so simple , i just need to tell my story . 
  my point was more about the fact that the system does n't really care about people being with their families as it seems to you . 
  i 've this impression from my life in the system and i know how it treats me and others . 
  the system does not care for people being with their families - be it a wonderful thought - it only cares about prolonging a tradition that has become irrelevant . 
  the main argument you and many more germans make is just planning ahead for that one single day of rest . 
  i love planning . 
  a bit of planning can make * everything * work - even having to work on sundays ( like many others ) and still be able to spend more time with your family . 
  i think it should be a free choice , free from tradition and pesky states deciding this for you or for other people . 
  if it turns out to be super unfair , we should then plan even better . 
  there are millions of people who have to work on sundays . 
  from airports through hospitals to the light industry . 
  bakeries in germany have to be up at 5 am on sundays to deliver br\u00f6tchen when you get up to go to church , right ? 
  the idea that our world can just pause and go into stand-by is utopia . 
  as a poor student i have to work and study all the freaking time . 
  i also have a hobby and stuff . 
  plus i need some social life to keep me sane . 
  they do n't even offer me 2 cents for working the whole weekend . 
  nobody gives a shit if i have n't had a day off in 6 weeks . 
  so i do n't buy it when people come up with `` it 's a more fair world this way '' argument . 
  to me it 's just pretending and living in a perfect bubble . 
  i do n't think it 's that bad . 
  at most it will be like 50-100 thousand people over a couple of years , then it would settle down like everywhere else . 
  most of them will seek education and a paying job , looking for better life for their families . 
  romania and bulgaria should be the ones shitting bricks here because 90 % of their talent is slipping away to benefit your fucking country and society . 
  forgive me if that sounds racist but the uk has millions indians and pakistani . . maybe our romani folks can finally reunite with their ancestors . 
   god bless turkish workers and kebab !, 
  ironically , `` god '' is also the reason why sunday is the most boringestest of week days . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6j5pu7gq-k ) is how i felt on one of my first sundays in germany . 
  it was so weird to me . . the idea of not being able to buy anything anywhere ( but the good ol' d\u00f6ner bude ) . 
  almost as weird as it was to germans when i suggested shops should be opened on sundays . 
  i am saddened that my joke was n't as * original * . 
  they give him raging boners . 
  the ultra nationalist parties have become mainstream in europe generally in the ex-eastern bloc is n't excluded . 
  welcome to democracy . 
  buckle up to discover what percentage of society is poop . 
  i do n't know why greece 's golden dawn have become the poster boys for that movement ( probably because of the cool name ) but it 's pretty common in europe . 
  i say conquer them and steal their riches !, 
  france , germany and italy should share the new territories . 
  the european integration is a good thing and eu expansion is the way to go . 
  eu 's doors should always be open for peoples and countries to be able to strive towards them if they want to . 
  all countries that commit to the copenhagen criteria and fulfill its economic and political plans , and are democratically accepted by the community should be able to be admitted . 
   [ ... ] turkey [ ... ] i predict a shitstorm in 3 . . 2 . . 1 ...

  read some of my other comments where i am getting grilled over saying that other cultures should adapt to our modern values the same way our cultures did . 
   which you would have noticed if you did n't blind yourself with certain ideologies . 
  im sorry i am not the nationalist or patriot . 
  i think you got things turned around . 
  people choose which parts from christianity to believe in and which ones to not believe in . 
  most of eastern europe hates homosexuals ( most stating leviticus 18 22 ) and most of them say its because its against christianity but at the same time will eat pork and wear clothing made from multiple fabrics . 
  we have disregarded some aspects of our religion and cultures for good . 
  we should expect the middle eastern immigrants to do the same and we are not bad people for thinking that . 
   but when importing some culture , diluting it ( and possibly local culture too ) and praising it as some kind of diversity . . 
  but this is not what i am calling for . 
  as i said , in europe it has taken us centuries in order to adapt our beliefs and traditions to what they are now . 
  nobody stones women ( except in the netherlands ) for having premarital sex or for being in a leadership role like a teacher or politician and traditionally we ought to put women down and rule over them . 
  this is no longer the case . 
  the same way immigrants have to follow the law they need to follow our values . 
  if you are a muslim working in a store and you refuse to sell pork or alcohol then you dont belong in our modern society . 
  christians arent supposed to eat pork either , but who cares ? 
  its not like our culture and beliefs were destroyed because we ate or sold pork . 
  most things have a natural evolution-like function to it , so usually the simplest and easiest thing that works is the one put in place . 
  i think people are being very pessimistic , but that is our nature , we always view bad news as more important that good news . 
  fact is the situation is much better than it was 20 years ago . 
  the over-kill of pc culture is also a good example of the people 's desire to change . 
  but things are getting better . 
  60 years ago nobody would even challenge an unlawful killing of a black person . 
  i see the current events as a natural progression towards a better world and as long as people dont fall for the `` our culture is in ruins '' narrative we will be fine . 
  absolutely agree . 
  but i feel like those issues and divisions are caused by the parties unwillingness to change and fix rather than some universal flaw of multiculturalism . 
  that is a horrible way to live though . 
  the beauty of europe and the world is to get to experience and enjoy all the awesome parts of other cultures that humanity has created . 
  fact is people want to come to europe , i see no problem with that as long as they uphold the values i mentioned and meet the immigration requirements.and maybe they want to come in because they believe in the european values and want to live by them . 
  this 100 times . 
  the situation in the us is an amalgamation of many complex factors that only a fool with a desire to push an agenda will bring down to `` diversity is the issue '' . 
  no , and this type of view is exactly why some people perceive multiculturalism as impossible . 
  in the modern world we have gotten used to ignoring the bad parts of our religions and cultures . 
  it is a prerequisite of having a fair and equal society . 
  the same way bulgarians dont put wooden spikes through random people and then bury them in reinforced coffins and burial grounds , muslims need to accept and tolerate people drinking alcohol and eating pork . 
  we have all changed our beliefs and traditions in order to achieve the liberties and societies we have now in europe , immigrants from outside of europe will have to do the same . 
  every aspect of their cultures and religions can be accepted , except for those that violate europe 's values of equality , justice and liberty for all . 
  this exactly . 
  muslims arent the issue . 
  its that the majority of `` bad '' muslims are from the middle east and north africa . 
  i wish people would understand that . 
  edit : wow so many trump supporters in europe !, 
  if police are killing innocent black people there will be riots . 
  i hate blm but they do have a point . 
  their problems dont stem from diversity but from racism . 
  yeah removing all blacks would fix the racism problems but in a final solution kind of way and nobody wants that . 
  also you got ta note that the us has a landmass and population almost as big as the eu . 
  there are many riots in europe as well , especially in france where they just randomly go off and burn a bunch of cars for no reason every couple of weeks . 
  edit : i dont care about the downvotes , but i am interested in knowing what you dont agree with from my post . 
  do hit that reply button and tell me . 
  diversity is a good thing . 
  and multiculturalism is also a good thing . 
  you know whats bad ? 
  defending certain aspects of some cultures and religions which are not adequate for the modern world . 
  i have no issue living with afghans or chinese or whatever as long as they follow the rules of our modern societies and respect the law . 
  so no burkas but kebabs are cool . 
  i disagree with you . 
   american government and society forcing assimilation on immigrants , sometimes with oppressive means which is the opposite of so-called multiculturalism aye , in the past during war time . 
  fact is currently anybody can go to the us , become a citizen and be regarded as an american . 
  if you immigrate to a european country you would never be accepted as one of their own . 
   the whole ` state multiculturalist ' approach is a very recent development . 
  my point was about the present . 
  well thank god your ancestors werent nationalistic patriots or the present version of your nation state and culture and traditions would never have been formed . 
  canada is not dysfunctional , it is in fact improving quite well . 
  oh so the usa is a dysfunctional society ? 
  fuck that world where we segregate ourselves into cultures and nationalities . 
  okay , its just important to note that some people do not view bullfighting as barbaric as you and most of reddit . 
  even though i am more against banning it also have moral objections to it , but more importantly i believe there are much more important animal abuse issues that need to be addressed first . 
  banning bullfighting wont be more than a symbolic gesture with minimal actual consequences . 
  of course , but then your battle is against meat eating and animal slaughter , bull fighting is an atom compared to the meat industry . 
  that should do the trick , even then who orders a beer at the end of a flight . 
  i usually get a couple at the start so i fall asleep and forget there are 20 strangers in my personal space . 
  but they didnt mention how they will keep the beer cold without the cooling part except that the beer will be delivered cold to the airport . 
  i prefer to go out like the bull than being held in a cage all my life before finally being shot with a gun to my head . 
  oh how easy people lose respect for human life . 
  i would advise you to study up on the actual situation and try to assess it without putting too much emotion into it . 
  youre acting as if the eu is your enemy forgetting who your real enemy is . 
  the eu is not a military organisation and until it becomes one you cant criticise it for being a shitty one ... 
  the people who wanted to be european became refugees which poland mostly accepted . 
  the path to eu ascension requires full cooperation from the country 's government and standards that need to be reached . 
  the eu cant just say `` ukraine is eu now '' ... and what ? 
  the eu failed to have a voice ? 
  there still are sanctions and there have been for a long time since the annexation of crimea !, 
  eu leaders have made it clear they do not support the annexation and russia 's actions . 
  where the fuck are you getting your opinions from ? 
   nato is us . 
  europe is basically a bunch of freeriders with an arrogant attitude . 
  so , expect your salvation from us , not eu . 
  now i know . 
  you get your opinions from the `` head in the sand '' pub where everybody makes up criticism just for the sake of criticism while being heavily drunk . 
  how are you betrayed by europe ? 
  it seems you are refusing to think about all the different aspects of georgia joining nato . 
  i personally think nato should accept georgia , but obviously there are many complex political consequences that could destabilise the whole region and make everything much worse . 
  but europe is not some angel that is supposed to save everybody from the baddies . 
  we can do more , yes , but dont blame us for not saving the world . 
  well some germans were also dickheads . 
  but i agree , the people who are paying for this have nothing to do with what was done . 
  cool , so we can just try to out-shit each other ? 
  i learned my english from cartoon network , discovery channel and books , so i just go by what sounds the least weird . 
  dont know why but it makes sense to me to use `` it '' in this case .

  we asked first !, 
  yup , it 's channel number 518 with me here . 
  oh , and there 's etno tv right after it at 519 and then there 's na\u0219ul tv right before the xxx channels . 
  let us know when taraf ^ tv hd is bankrupted , please ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls, 
   postings are often in both english or french you mean both in en and fr , as in the ad is in both languages ? 
  or they 're either in en or fr ? 
  in any case , you should submit a cv in the language the job ad is written in . 
  the logic being that it was the hr manager of the company that posted the ad and they may not be fluent in the language they look for an employee for and that is why they wrote the ad in the language they master . 
  seeing as that would be the person that 'd be skimming through the sent cvs it is best that you facilitate the process . 
  the hr manager can invite/hire someone to check the fluency of the candidates at the interviews . 
  [ my best try so far ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uw0rm0c.png ) the bulgarian and greek words are the easiest . 
  also , i think the lithuanian and latvian words are interchangable/the same in the game . 
  good luck to everyone !, 
  this . 
  it does n't make sense to apply to a job ad , written in , say , german , wherein they look for someone fluent in german to work in , say , poland , with a cv in your native portuguese ( for example ) even if the company is based in portugal . 
  it 's simple logic , at least to me . 
  i fixed it now !, 
  got mixed up between republic of and republika . 
  plus , it was like 2:30 a.m. when i wrote it . . 
  i googled the producer 's name and it seems they have other such stuff like [ ( 6 slices of ) english bread , written on a flag of republi ~ ~ c ~ ~ ka srpska ] ( http://www.kudopan.co.jp/products/bread_01.html ) . 
  edit : fixed a spelling mistake , noted in the comment below . 
   13 may 2015 at least they could 've updated the article with a link to the report . 
  here it is ( pdf !,

  wishful thinking . . 
   leave it up to macedonia ~ ~ n ~ ~ 's * government * to do dumb shit ftfy . 
  the citizens of neither skopje , nor the country were asked about this . 
  it 's all a governmental decision and the citizen should n't be blamed ( entirely ) for it . 
  just checked [ one of their posts ] ( http://redd.it/3dis2i ) and you 're right . 
  in the comments s/he said s/he would assume full responsibility , but then s/he did n't post the iceland thread scheduled for this week . 
  on the other hand s/he also said that s/he does n't want the mods to be worried about this , so maybe that is why they have n't stickied it ( yet ) . 
  let 's wait and see what 's going to happen . 
  this is n't the first time a series was started and then discontinued . . 
  not a mod , but i think it is because it is too early to un-sticky the ` what happened in your country this week ' thread as the ` country week ' thread , which was posted on monday ( 20th of july ) , last/the first time replaced the ` what happened ... ' thread of the previous week ( posted on sunday , 19th of july ) . 
  so , if the iceland country thread was posted on monday it would replace the ` what happened . . ' thread from the previous week . 
  thus , here we are now that both posts are posted on the same day . 
  so , maybe they will wait until tomorrow morning to sticky this one for the whole week . 
  this is just a possible idea , though , so let 's wait for a mod to say what they have decided to do . 
  and just so this is n't entirely meta : icelanders , would you like the thread be stickied now or tomorrow morning ? 
  also , how sunny is it right now in your area ( what , with being summer and stuff ) ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ tried ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  here you are given the freedom \u2122 to decide in what way you want to write as teachers teach both at the same time/class . 
  it is absolutely up to the pupil to decide how it wants to write as it goddamn should be . 
  noone is in a position to tell anybody that their handwriting is formal or informal .

  * adam and eve - as their names suggest by themselves , the first macedonians in the world .

  edit : formatting . 
   my understanding is that the media has a large part in keeping these beliefs in the air as well ? 
  80 % of the printed newspapres in the whole country are owned by a single person/company ( [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delyan_peevski ) ) . 
  just let than sink in . 
  there were [ protests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%e2%80%9314_bulgarian_protests_against_the_oresharski_cabinet ) when the then pm appointed him to become the chief of the national security state agency . 
  an [ add-on for mozilla ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/danswithme/ ) has been created to warn people when they incidently try to open a website that is part of his media empire . 
  as for the youth , baby boomers ( a term that is non-existant in bulgarian media , not even on academic level ) are still 3 ( three ) times the young in numbers , so possibly with time and boomers ' death ( 6th highest crude death rate in the whole world as of right now ) plus the more and more growing influence from eu/western media and politicians , things just might become a lot better . . so somewhere around when 90 's kids and millenials ( this is also non-existant here ) are in their 40s . 
  i made sounds i never knew i could make when i saw it the first time . 
  it is very much / r/cringe , indeed . 
  well , they did ( i think ) , but ( unfortunately ) their mps still vote in parliament so they should still be up there . . and you 're welcome !, 
  just so this is complete , what would you say about that bdc ( \u0411\u0414\u0426 ) or whatever they call themselves today , with their '' '' '' `` fluent-in-english '' '' '' '' party leader barekov ? 
  compared to your [ -1.8 % gdp growth last year ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00115&amp;language=en ) , it 's not much really as you 're not gon na cover that loss . 
  if you could repeat the +2.6 % from 2013 , now that 'd be good . 
  though , if you continue with 1 % growth , serbia 's economy will most likely recover from the crisis of 2009 in 2018 . 
  because it * is * an [ isolated ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/indoeuropeantreedielli1.svg/1500px-indoeuropeantreedielli1.svg.png ) indo-european language with [ its own branch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_language#classification ) , comprised solely by it . 
  yes . 
  it comes from the church slavonic * \u0431\u044b\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044a * , which is an old loan word from proto-slavic * byvol\u044a * that came from vulgar latin * b\u016bvalus * ( [ source in bulgarian ] ( https://bg.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d0%b1%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%bb ) ) . 
  edit : and to add '' \u0411\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044a '' are independent investigative journalists , whose editor in chief was the leading nomination of the bulgarian greens party ( the legitimate one ) for their eventual seat in the european parliament , which they did n't win at the elections last year . 
  they also partner with wikileaks and are part of the [ occrp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organized_crime_and_corruption_reporting_project ) 's network . 
   it analyzes the frequency with which words on this sub occur in any comment and saves that based on the user 's flair . 
  op , can you , please , share if this is true or not : considering my flair , which barely mentions bulgaria , does that mean that none of my comments are in those tables ? 
  are users ' comments , whose flair is blank or not mentioning their country/region/province / city , included ? 
  bulgaria will be between france and slovenia with 22.90 % taxation , broken down like this : \\ - `` pensions '' fund - 5.70 % \\ - `` common diseases and maternity '' fund - 1.40 % \\ - `` unemployment '' fund - 0.40 % \\ - `` supplementary mandatory pensions '' fund - 2.20 % \\ - `` health security '' fund - 3.20 % \\ ------------------------------------------------------ monthly securities total - 12.90 % \\ ------------------------------------------------------ personal income tax - 10.00 % -- total : 22.90 % * 380 bgn ( or 194.29 eur ) = 297.88 bgn ( or 152.31 eur ) per month now since july , 2015 . 
  i 've been to finland and i 'd anschluss all their ( young ) men , if i could , but alas ...

  it would be absolutely devastating if this coup fails or leads to a turkish civil war . 
  [ sources ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_macedonia#kingdoms_of_serbia_and_yugoslavia ) following the two balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 and the dissolution of the ottoman empire , most of its european-held territories were divided between greece , bulgaria and serbia . 
  [ 57 ] the territory of the modern macedonian state was annexed by serbia and named ju\u017ena srbija , `` southern serbia '' . 
  ** following the partition , an anti-bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under serbian and greek control . 
  [ 58 ] as many as 641 bulgarian schools and 761 churches were closed by the serbs , while exarchist clergy and teachers were expelled . 
  [ 58 ] the use of bulgarian ( including all macedonian dialects ) was proscribed . 
  i was replying to his snarky `` threats '' to the eu . 
  i was n't talking neither about irish borders , nor northern ireland . 
  besides ireland is n't in the shengen area , i 'm pretty sure they can do whatever they want with their borders . 
  my point was that countries that have greatly benefited from the eu ( ireland , the czech republic , hungary ) follow the brexit narrative . 
  this is just one of the many cases that are regularly on bulgarian tv - defiled bulgarian graves , banned celebrations and what not . 
  some of them might be criminals , some are caused intentionally by bulgarian ultra nationalist retards , but there are real ones . 
  you know it 's right . 
  serbian propaganda was strong , but it 's virtually impossible to not have a bulgarian minority without active suppression . 
  after the serbian de-bulgarisation of macedonia we might have been invaders , even though despite all your experience you 're not very good in ethnic cleansing are you ? 
  so i 'm sure there were a lot of bulgarians who saw the `` nazi '' ( lol ) bulgarian army as liberators . 
  that 's all besides the point , which you find hard to grasp . 
  so let me spell it out for you - you do n't bite the hand that feeds you . 
  if you hate bulgaria , do n't come here for education and work . 
  even coming from an ex-communist country you have a very weird democracy really . 
  regarding the arrests , just off the first page of google : [ link1 ] ( http://btvnovinite.bg/article/svetut/obiski-i-arest-za-shestima-makedontsi-s-balgarsko-grazhdanstvo-v-strumitsa.html ) [ link2 ] ( http://www.dw.com/bg/%d0%b4%d0%b0-%d1%81%d0%b8-%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%bb%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bd-%d0%b2-%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f/a-5540709 ) we have no disagreements . 
  like i said every bulgarian government in the last 25 years lends our ass to fyrom . 
  you have a disagreement with history and i 'd love to visit ohrid , but i wo n't because i do n't want to spend a cent in fyrom . 
   i 'm just saying no matter what the eu decide , we wo n't allow a border to go up across our island . 
  you 're the eu smarty . 
   if you ignore us , we will ignore the ruling . 
  this sounds like a children 's tantrum . 
  hopefully your politicians are better than that , but that 's not how contracts work . 
  so you 're going to get out of the eu too ? 
  lol you 're delusional if you think that the recent growth of ireland 's economy was anything but because of the free access to the huge eu market . 
  oh you 're perfectly fine being a tax evasion haven for huge corporations . 
  good luck with that . 
  what 's even funnier is that they also stole medieval bulgarian history ( tsar samuil and clement of ohrid ) and some 19th century bulgarian freedom fighters ( gotse delchev , dame gruev ) . 
  so they 're ancient macedonians , medieval bulgarians and imro actually fought to restore ancient macedonia . 
  in between they also colonized egypt and the moon . 
  it would have been funny if they did n't actually teach children this bullshit . 
  sad . 
  and i though only the us can be so ignorant . 
  lol !, 
  and there you have it folks - classic modern `` macedons '' . 
  fun fact : cleopatra was a macedonian as well !, 
  good job , romania !, 
  economic results show how bad corruption is for the economy . 
  some years ago bulgaria and romania were equal , but look at you now - romania is way ahead !, 
  you should build statues of the prosecutors/judges that made this happen . 
  not a single politician has been convicted in bulgaria ... and the justice system is the most corrupt place of them all !,

  gypsies are called that because it 's black . 
  nothing to do with the mongols . 
  meanwhile bulgaria is almost the least happy country in europe at 105th place , just above sierra leone . 
  fuck you albania for taking even that achievement from us !,

  looks like things are decided ... 
  our spineless politicians have been sucking on erdo 's dick any chance they have - handling over political refugees without question .

  turkey has made constant threats to greece and with the way things are going nothing stops them from going beyond that . 
  erdogan has called part of bulgaria rightful ottoman territory . 
  there are almost a million turks in bulgaria just waiting for jihad ... 
  things are fucking peachy . 
  i think they should be more . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.mod.bg/bg/tema_missionsoperations.html ) a map of foreign operations of bg army . 
  orange are still active . 
  read this in bulgarian media , but could n't find a more credible english source . 
   `` putin just wants these territories to be demilitarized again , '' le pen stressed . 
  this is quite frightening . 
  french people please !, 
  i like your optimism , but it sounds too good to be true . 
  erdogan holds all the power as it is - puppet pm , puppet parliament , puppet judges , puppet media , puppet army , puppet police . 
  all the referendum will do is legitimize his power . 
  if it does n't succeed things will just continue like they are now . 
  only thing that will bring down erdo is a huge economic crash , which is still years away . 
  it might be sooner if the eu isolate him . 
  edit : forgot to mention that it 'll probably be a puppet referendum too . 
  that 's the first thing dictators do - take control of the election process . 
  is ok , prime ruski tourists are back this year . 
  all hail supreme leaders putin and erdogan and their divine alliance !, 
  they just restored the street . 
  it 's probably the most expensive commercial street in sofia . 
  lower your expectations .

  because bulgaria has the biggest natural decrease of population in europe . 
  and the statistics are counting gypsies which have a median of 5 children or something like that . 
  ethnic bulgarians are dying off / immigrating .

  you sound like quite the racist for constantly blaming my country for the information i give here on ngo 's smuggling people into italy . 
  like you think we live in north korea and all we say or think is put there by the government . 
  in reality , these are the sources of my claims , feel free to keep ignoring them out of embarassment and attack my country instead : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/27/ngo-rescues-off-libya-encourage-traffickers-eu-borders-chief http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/23/italy-prosecutor-says-rescue-boats-contact-people-smugglers/ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-boat-rescue-charities-medicins-sans-frontieres-save-the-children-mediterranean-sea-migrants-a7699571.html https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/are-we-helping-desperate-migrants-or-just-people-smugglers/ http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-eu-libya-idukkbn1881cq?feedtype=rss&amp;feedname=worldnews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed%3a+reuters%2fukworldnews+%28news+%2f+uk+%2f+world+news%29&amp;utm_content=google+uk, 
  lol now you ' r getting pathetic mate . 
  i already acknowledged asking for quotas could be legal , and made points that it nevertheless means you are asking other countries to help solve your own unwillingness or inability to do something as simple as enforce your own sovereign borders . 
  you are being crass at the ukrainians to `` sort their own problem '' - which is a foreign army of a global power , but you yourself ca n't sort your own problem - a bunch of pathetic ngo 's and boats . 
  that 's the point you are now in panic mode to avoid so keep repeating the link you put on the dublin treaty . 
  edit : stop changing your original posts and add sentences after i answerd to them . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  this was your entire post when you first submitted it :  what ? 
  i provided documented evidence that your points are nonsense . 
  you made no point nor refuted any of mine with this statement . 
  the reality is that the eu is not a country , but a set of sovereign states . 
  each state has the responsiblity to guard its borders . 
  if you fail , that 's your fucking fault and by any standard , moral or legal , you should fix your own mess . 
  you are n't an open yard for all to walk into , you are a state . 
  it 's about time you act like one instead of whine and bitch for others to help you , but the hypocritically yourself tell the ukrainians they should `` take care of their own problems and not drag others into them '' . 
  you are doing the exact same thing with your inaction against the ngo 's ferrying thousands of migrants to your shores - a much , much easier problem to solve than a russian-backed army occupying part of your country . 
  and yet you would bitch to other states for help with such an easy problem like a few dozen ngo boats smuggling people , but have the audacity to tell the ukrainians they ca n't ask for help with a much serious problem ? 
  pathetic , truly . 
  precisely said union has an agreement which italy signed , called the dublin accord , by which all illigal migrants are returned to the country of first entry . 
  it is you who are trying to wiggle your way out of this agreement by forcing `` migrant quotas '' through brussels on the rest of the members , who do not want them nor should they pay for your inability to guard your own borders or stop the ngos that ferry migrants on an industrial scale from the libyan coast to your borders . 
  hence the comparison is quite valid - a country asking for help with a border problem it is unable or unwilling to solve itself , despite no legal requirements of those others to help it . 
   please solve your ** migration crisis ** yourself italy and do n't drag the rest of us into it . 
  you like it like that ? 
  who is `` the us '' and `` russia '' ? 
  people ? 
  biological objects or geo-political structures who have varying leaders at the head ? 
  how reluctant or not `` russia '' or `` the us '' are depends on who is the current leader . 
  there has n't yet been a leader in both these countries to jeopardize the nuclear deterrent by saying they are `` reluctant '' to use it . 
  logically , since it would make the respective nuclear arsenals useless . 
  i will play devil 's advocate . 
  the point of having nuclear weapons is as a deterrent against other nuclear powers or powerful militaries , not to use it in a nuclear holocaust . 
  however , it can only actually work as a deterrent to said potential enemies if they think you are willing to use it . 
  if they know you would n't , it 's as if you do n't have it . 
  hence for the leader of a nuclear power to say he is reluctant to use it equals him basically scrapping the geo-political and deference/deterrence potential of the nuclear arsenal . 
  people saw these remarks by corbyn , a potential leader of a nuclear power , as dangerously eroding the deterrence capabilities of the uk should he come to power , for the sake of left-wing , populist virtue signalling . 
  i believe this alludes to him wanting to surrender the british nuclear capabilities , not `` to surrender in a nuclear war '' . 
  i do not comment on corbyn himself , i am a right winger myself and oppose marxists like him quite strongly . 
  i just comment on the utter trash the sun is , which is something that should make right wingers like myself rather ashamed if we ca n't criticize pathetic marxists better than this . 
   you mean better than getting flooded by bulgarians ? 
  like western europe ? 
  yes , 1 million bulgarian immigrants in the entire world out of the tiny 7 million nation have flooded countries . 
  :d it 's precisely the same as 1 billion africa quadrupling in population by 2100 , according to the un . 
  you are a pathetic troll that posts nothing but weak attempts at offending eastern europeans cause you think it is somehow a good argument for mass african and muslim migration into europe that you seem fond of . 
  you ' v been called out numerous times and always just run away immediately like a rat . 
  like with me again only a few days ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fflmq/refusing_islamic_migrants_is_only_way_of_ensuring/diiu2kh/, 
  true , but the millionaire ca n't force you to buy and read it , so unless society willingly eats that shit up it 's nothing but wasted money from the millionaire . 
  the british certainly eat it up to give it such a high circulation over all other papers . 
  the level of media in a free , capitalist society is indicative of the level of the public . 
  if no one would buy this garbage in the british society then no one would produce it and be forced by the hand of the market to offer higher quality content . 
  instead , it 's the most sold british paper ... 
  better them than us . 
  because there is no such thing as `` a fair share '' - those are people not fucking potatoes , they do n't want to stay in poland or hungary , they want to go to germany or sweden or france . 
  and that 's precisely what all refugees taken by the eastern states have done - packed up and left . 
  it would be hilarious if western liberals ended up , in their great compassion and love , advocating for locking people up against their will so a quota can be fulfilled by a given country . 
  why should i stop complaining about muslims moving into europe ? 
  give me a single good reason making europe worse is something i should n't complain about . 
  that 's great then , problem solved . 
  2000 migrants a month is nothing . 
  give em all to germany even , it 's like a drop in the bucket for a country of 80 million people . 
  why is the picture being painted of `` an overflowing '' eu with refugees that is being abandoned by the vishegrad 4 ? 
  obviously there 's only a tiny number of circa 2000 migrants coming to greece , surely large liberal countries like germany , france or spain can take them all in without having to force any onto the vishegrad 4 ? 
  no , they ca n't travel to europe because it takes far too long , they are only capable of doing so because they are being ferried by ngo 's who pick them up a few kilometres from the libyan coast . 
  without these ngo 's not 95 % of them would be able to get all the way to lampedusa or sicily from the libyan coast . 
  outlawing the criminal ngo 's that work directly with the african smugglers and sending the fleets there will put a permanent stop to any mass migration and flow of people from africa . 
  assistance does n't equal ferrying people to europe and keeping them there . 
  put those sinking on the military ship , ferry them to the libyan coast and off you go . 
  they will quickly stop trying if the eu keeps doing this . 
  instead they know they will be picked up by ngo boats and ferried straight into eu coast , from whence taken over with open arms . 
  are greece and italy pushing the eu towards such a solution that ensures a common push of the wave out of europe , or are they just pushing to relocate the entering migrants further into the eu ? 
  why should europe choose between hurting its common , overall good and geo-political strenght by either accepting millions of muslims or by appeasing russia ? 
  why ca n't it have a harsh , independent stance on both issues - deter russia from continental expansion as well as close borders to muslim migrants and forcefully return them to the coasts of lybia or syria using its navy ? 
  you ferry them right off to the coast of libya the vast majority came from . 
  i assure you there is not `` sovereign state '' of libya to send a navy to prevent that . 
  if they choose to . 
  every country belongs to those who are a demographic majority inside of it and they decide whom to welcome into their lands . 
  definitely . 
  and regardless if the religion they follow is islam , christianity , buddhism , or antifa , marxism , neonazism etc. 
  do you disagree that a basic pre-requisite to belong to the christian faith , and therefore a christian church , is to consciously accept jesus christ as god ? 
  do you claim that a majority of the swedish population consciously accept jesus christ as god ? 
  i already asked you if most swedes believed in christianity or they did n't . 
  you said they did n't ( most swedes give a rat 's ass about religion . 
  ) , now you say most of them are `` secular protestants '' . 
  you keep contradicting yourself . 
  i did n't count `` the fundamentalists '' towards the protestant church of sweden , i count the regular , believing christian . 
  the one who says christ is his god and the bible his teaching . 
  if that is fundamentalist to you and a person who `` gives a rat 's ass about religion '' is a regular christian , then you have some very , very misguided idea of what a religion is and who its adherents are . 
   lol but all the poor eastern europeans can come in ? 
  your entitlement is bizarre come into their own countries ? 
  yes , they are born there . 
  your trolling is moronic . 
  why should they be ? 
  with a quadrupling population of africa untill 2100 and horrible climate change effects there might as well be up to half a billion people in need of help there this century . 
  it does n't mean europeans should fundamentally let their continent be transformed demographically because of it . 
  are you trolling ? 
   `` most swedes give a rat 's ass about religion . '', 
   `` i 'm just saying the swedish church is n't practically non-existent demographically . '', 
  these two are contradictory statements . 
  from what i understand from swedes the church autmatically puts you as its member and people do n't bother singning out , but in reality the churches are all but empty and probably less than 10 % of those members are actively part of the church , same as in england .

  people that do n't vote for them lose their jobs or cant sell their produce . 
  they are a criminal organization , not a party . 
  they have around 350 000 solid voters which is why they dont want high election participation . 
  * ataka who are far right by name only . 
  they are political corpses . 
  they have supported the current government for over a year and their voters dropped them for other populists . 
  the current government will fall next week . 
  if we are lucky there will be compulsory voting and barekov ( the new populist actor ) will lose his funding . 
  the least tainted party is the reformist bloc , but they are not that clean either . 
  there are a few reasons why the protests are picking up speed again . 
  * delyan peevsky who was the catalyst for the #danswithme protests was ** elected for european parliament as part of the turkish party ** which was a smack in the face to every normal person in the country . 
  * the election results were a sound defeat for the socialists which made them uneasy * the socialists decided to switch ministers around and demand bigger representation in the government which made the turkish party unhappy . 
  the turks threatened that they would leave the coalition . 
  * the socialists called the bluff and said that they want new elections and compulsory voting which would make the turkish party one of the worst performers since they have a solid but small voter base of illiterate and controlled constituencies . 
  * these `` power games '' pissed off a lot of people since they represent everything that is wrong with the oligarchic system which the protesters marched against . 
  * ** peevski was supposedly the target of attempted murder by his long time partner in crime tsvetan vasilev ** . 
  people believe that the whole thing is a circus act aimed to weaken vasilev who had a falling out with the turkish party and started his own project - barekov . 
  all of this motivated people to come out again . 
  the article has a point . 
  it 's really tiresome to see the eu institutions and media constantly trying to tarnish hungary and present it like some authoritarian hell hole , just because they dislike the elected majority . 
  good for austria . 
  too bad no one here has the courage to do the same when davutoglu visits demanding mosques and claiming that the 16th century was `` the best period '' for our and other balkan countries . 
  then it would be historically accurate . 
  him pissing is a bit crude . 
  they should instead have a statue of lenin taking money from the keiser to fund his `` people 's revolution '' . 
  nope . 
  the embassies of france and the netherlands are regular two story houses here . 
  have n't stolen any british jobs yet . 
   china made a much better/cheaper deal with russia !, 
  china has a lot of cheap alternatives . 
  we do n't . 
  http://www.novinite.com/articles/159077/bulgaria%27s+court+finds+13+imams+guilty there were 13 imams who were prosecuted for spreading religious hatred and being funded by salafist/wahhabi organizations from saudi arabia . 
  they got slaps on the wrists . 
  we 've had turks for the last 600 years and they still `` do n't feel appreciated '' nor speak the language . 
  it 's not germany 's fault . 
   ** romania ** shouldnt be in the european union you ca n't even name the correct country in question . 
  and other countries will veto the common gas market . 
   more like with lack of balls exactly . 
  the eu cut the funding for 4 programs and threatened to start punitive actions against bulgaria for building south stream + mccain came to `` talk about diversification '' and now the project is stopped . 
  instead of 380 $ we will continue to pay 500 $ + next time ukraine stops paying will blow it . 
  it 's a year too late for this . 
  the current government beat people and lied it 's way until the eu elections . 
  they borrowed a lot of money and screwed up a lot of projects . 
  the ethnic turks played the socialists like a fiddle and are now going to discard them . 
  all of the problems started with the appointment of peevski who is part of the dps . 
  the next elections will likely be just as inconclusive . 
  gerb will barely get over 30-35 % so they will need to form a coalition , but no one wants to work with them either . 
   at least they 're not meant to aggravate anybody that is the biggest problem of this subreddit . 
  every step away from the circle jerk will be viciously down voted . 
  this is why most people do n't bother, 
  the ngos operating here are full of shit . 
  they even wanted the release from prison of a repeat rapist , because `` he could n't get good enough treatment in prison '' . 
  http://www.bghelsinki.org/en/publications/obektiv/stoiko-stoikov/2011-08/counting-macedonians-bulgaria/ they also have all kings of stupid and worthless campaigns where they slander the country and launder money . 
  if these ngos are like the ones that operate here then good job . 
  dozens of pedestrians were hit by this cluster bomb . 
  most of the killed had nothing to do with the building . 
  get your head out of your ass and stop chewing washington 's bullshit . 
  the hit the park and street . 
  they killed 15 civilians . 
  they ca n't sanction france or germany , because they would fight back . 
  they can only push their rules on the weak members . 
  is this the onion ? 
  that plumbing money goes a long way . 
  i do n't see how them electing oligarchs will bring them closer to europe , but most of these articles are so biased that reading them is a waste of time . 
  every big politicians in the last 20 years deserves at least 5 years in jail and a lifetime ban from holding public office . 
  kostov for the shady privatisation , the king for the forests and national properties , dogan for tsankov kamuk , stanishev for everything and borisov for his deals as mayor of sofia . 
  sadly this is only the first instance and tsvetanov is likely to avoid prison by the end . 
  can we focus on the rest of his speech ? 
  this guy continues to block recovery efforts for southern europe and demands austerity . 
  he suggests that europe should lower it 's social and safety standards to compete with usa and china . 
  he wants to strip countries from their power to control their own budgets . 
  if he wants the anti-eu vote to stop growing he should shut the fuck up for a few years . 
   he russians want to restrict south stream for transport of russian gas only , which is against eu law . 
  that is why eu is opposing it . 
  the same was true for north stream , but it was build . 
  the commission is playing politics with russia while we continue pay the second most expensive gas in europe , because we pay transit fees to ukraine and romania . 
  we do n't want them as enemies , but they will never be our friends either . 
  especially with the shit the turkish minority party pulls here . 
  not going to happen when the turkish foreign minister calls for pan-ottomanism and their geography books claim lands from all of their neighbours . 
  they were n't . 
  your own wiki link says that they assimilated other cultures instead of spreading their own . 
  i suggest you follow op 's advice and learn more about the balkans . 
  what advances did the ottoman bring exactly ? 
  they held the balkans back for centuries . 
  why is that good exactly ? 
  turning ukraine hostile to russia which is it 's biggest trading partner will leave the country in an even bigger mess than it already is . 
  they wo n't be offered eu or nato membership either . 
  just empty promises . 
   22 % of the ep the ep is the weakest part of the eu institutions like the article clearly states + common sense . 
  the fact that junker and schaeuble have called for an eurozone parliament controlled by france and germany . 
  means that it will likely happen . 
  well , it looks like more and more politicians are openly talking about the `` two tier europe '' where a franco-german core will make most decisions while the rest just follows along and provides a source of cheap labor and markets . 
  small town next to the greek border . 
  most of the tourists are greek people that come to shop all kinds of stuff . 
  more and more every year . 
  half the advertisement signs are already in greek . 
  no thanks . 
   `` there is not one europe but two ... 
  in the euro zone , we must stop believing in the myth of equal rights between all members . '', 
  glad someone finally adimited what we already knew .

  simple , efficient , working . 
  if you want to go help the rest of the world and take care of people - i admire you . 
  please go do it . 
  do not demand the rest of europe or other countries do it by opening their borders to ~ 6.5 billion people . 
  who is `` they '' ? 
  eastern europe is very , very different . 
  bohemia has historically been one of the richest parts of the continent and in 1939 definitely * was * as developped as the richest parts of europe . 
  no reason why this would n't continue and czechia today be as rich as austria or west germany . 
  poland would be poorer , on a south france/northern england level . 
  romania and bulgaria would be on the greece/portugal level . 
  instead , thanks to the red army and marxism the entirety of eastern europe is below or barely on the level of the poorest non-communist states like greece and portugal , with romania , bulgaria , ukraine and russia much , much poorer per capita . 
  what is worse , they missed the opportunity of post-war europe when growth was huge and no comeptition from the other continents allowed the free market societies to monopolize entire world markets and reach economic miracle levels . 
  the devastating effect of lenin 's legacy in europe is quite visible . 
  eastern european nations under communism are much poorer today than other eastern european nations who avoided it . 
  bulgaria and romania had the exact same gdp per capita , literacy and development as greece in 1939 . 
  today they are 4 times poorer than greece even after the massive crisis there . 
  eastern germany is ruined compared to western - and it actually was better off historically before 1939 . 
  bohemia was one of the richest parts of europe , much richer than ireland , spain or greece , yet poorer after communism . 
  compare south and north korea , estonia and finland , eastern and western germany , bulgaria and greece etc. 
  - wherever communism touches places that were relatively equal become vastly different , with the communist ones much poorer . 
  so yes , [ it absolutely is the fault of communism and moscow for the devastation in eastern europe ] ( https://s30.postimg.org/96od56b01/1660711_10209118438827848_8887755968067137605_n.jpg ), 
  you seem to have a form of paternalistic , eurocentric attitude , probably deriving from the racist `` white man 's burden '' type of mentality back in the 19th century . 
  other nations and peoples around the world are n't your responsibility or under any kind of need for you to take care of them . 
  a border exists . 
  the people who enforce that border have no responsibility towards anyone but the people who hire them to do so . 
  their job is to enforce the border . 
  their job is n't to be a humanitarian organisation . 
  their job is n't to become a charity for anyone who breaks that border . 
  their job is n't to decide the futures and wellbeing of those people . 
  a border exists . 
  a border is to be enforced . 
  if people are willingly deciding to try and break that border they ca n't be angry that they are returned from where they made the attempt . 
  actually i 'm pretty sure this will aaaall be over by christmass . 
  i hear he also understands german pretty well . 
  that is correct . 
  it 's also the place where most migrants in the med come from , hence should be returned there by our border force . 
  i do n't understand this reply - no lybia is not a fantastic place to visit , how does that correlate with returning people who are trying to illegally enter europe to lybia ? 
  it is n't of our concern how `` fantastic '' or not lybia is , it is of our concern to enforce our borders and decide who we want to come in , for which there is a legal process . 
  are you implying anyone living in a place that is bad has automatically the right to come to europe ? 
  what i described to you are people in this country who quite literary die every winter of cold or/and starvation . 
  i am not exaggerating , just a couple of days ago i read another article of a couple , ~ 70 year old people , living in a village , in a big house with no heating since they receive each 75 euro pensions a month , enough for very , very little food ( 1 meal a day ) and some life-saving medication . 
  nothing more . 
  so they live in cold when it gets minus 10 degrees here , eat once a day and do n't move from their beds . 
  they literary withered away and died - first the woman and exactly one day later the man . 
  such stories are not uncommon . 
  the extreme poverty level in some balkan and eastern european countries quite literary kills people , and yet those same people are considered much wealthier due to nominal calculations from people in the third world who do not die of poverty as they have at least heir basic needs - shelter and food , always satisfied . 
  unliked the `` much wealthier '' poor in eastern europe . 
  sorry , but if someone dies from lack of heating and food , whilst another person has these necessities satisfied , then the former has worse quality of life than the latter regardless of nominal calculation of their earnings . 
  those two pensioners were probably in the `` top 30 % '' of the world with their 75 euro a month pensions , and yet it was n't enough for them to eat more than once a day . 
  someone in the bottom 30 % on the other hand eats 3 times a day and lives longer - so he had a better quality of life regardless of nominal value . 
  this is a very subjective comparisson as it merely does a nominal comparisson rather than the purchasing power or standart of life . 
  in our poorest region people get around 300 euro a month net . 
  yes , this does put them in the top 20 % and much above the average person in ghana , but only in nominal terms , not in quality of life . 
  someone in ghana might need many decades to earn as much as this annual income , but with what he earns as a poor farmer he has a home , clothers , regular food and something on the side . 
  in the meantime , the `` much richer '' bulgarian cleaning lady who lives in our poorest region and earns 300 euro a month can not afford heating bills , eats only the cheapest food she prepares at home , has n't had new clothes in years and is lucky if she owns her home , because if she does n't - she 'd either be living with relatives , in a social home ( state-privided ) , or be homeless . 
  so basically a poor person in a developed economy in eastern europe might in fact live much worse than a poor person in an agricultural society , despite his nominal wealth being much larger . 
  it just does n't buy you anything in your country is the problem . 
  the entirety of eastern europe begs to differe . 
  the poorest countries have the lowest birth rates , and within those poor countries - the poorest regions have the lowest , as here in bulgaria the north-west is both the poorest region ( africa-level poor ) and the one with the lowest fertility rates . 
  culture determines birth rates , especially female participation . 
  some parts of ukraine and moldova with 1.4-1 .5 fertility rates are as poor as places in africa and asia with upwards of 3-4 fertility rate . 
  you are very much right that homophobes who harm others are horrible people . 
  like all people who harm others . 
  you are not right to call `` uncivilized '' anyone who has a distate for homosexuality or has n't fully embraced it as a social norm like the romans and greeks , thus equating `` civilization '' and `` full acceptance of all sexual deviations '' . 
  especially not in the context of greeks and romans , who also were accepting towards incest and paedophilia , so i fail to see how their sexual norms equals `` being civilized '' that we should emulate . 
  on one hand , homophobes - leave people alone . 
  on the other , homo-progressives stop equating championing sexual deviations of all sorts with `` being civilized '' . 
  it 's neither civilized nor uncivilized . 
  it 's a preferrence . 
  and if one has a different - one of distaste or disliking of such , he is n't `` less civilized '' from you . 
  ( unless he is being violent about it ), 
  you do n't objectively consider the middle east and africa to have a considerably larger percentage of prevailing attitudes and norms that are very , very backwards , or rather - regressive ? 
  above 90 % of women suffering genital mutilation in egypt for example does n't seem to you as a reason to call the people there more backwards than , say , people in belgium ? 
  well i did say assimilation and by definition that means shedding any past notion of foreign culture/identity and adopting fully into that of the country you live in . 
  names are perhaps the first and strongest emblem of which culture/identity you belong to , so naturally one ca n't assimilate if he does n't change or give his children local names . 
  at least not in `` ethnic-based nations '' like those in europe or east asia . 
  based on what criteria would people still see you as different if you go to holland and fully assimilate by adopting ( or giving your children ) a dutch name , becoming either christian or atheist/agnostic and celebrating the dutch identity and traditions ? 
  people have been doing that across various nations and ethnic groups in europe for centuries with no trouble . 
  french hugenouts in england who are indistinguishable englishmen today ( like farage ) , germans in poland , italians in spain etc. 
  but not assimilate into dutch . 
  not if you ' r muslims , simple as that . 
  come to bulgaria : same as the above described in quality , but cheaper than medditeranean or caribbean destinations whilst being safer than turkey or egypt . 
  they expanded in : podolia ( very briefly ) and hungary that 's it for europe outside of the balkans . 
  they waged wars with poland , a smaller country for 100 years and could n't expand substantially . 
  they waged wars with austria - a much smaller country , for 200 years and could n't expand at all . 
  they waged wars with russia - a comparable , but much poorer country , and were beaten back every time . 
  so , yes , the ottomans had very , very limited success against european powers outside of the almost depopulated balkans , and were much more often beaten by them then won . 
  even tiny maritime states like venice and the order of st. john posed considerable difficulties for the porte . 
   it is obvious that private healthcare does n't prevent obesity . 
  nor is it meant to do it . 
  healthcare is there to treat ilnesses , prevention is a personal choice of lifestyle , diet , excersice . 
  it has nothing to do wth healthcare nor should it . 
  you might as well show statistics that the fattest people in the us live in the hottest areas and say it 's obvious that `` hotter temperatures do n't prevent obesity '' . 
  as i already wrote , how fat you become is your own personal choice - it depends neither on the healthcare plan you have , nor is it up to the government to take care of your condition . 
  but if you ruin your health willingly and have public healthcare - who pays for your mistakes ? 
  just you ? 
  or the others as well . 
  i do n't want to pay for other people 's choices , so why do you ? 
   and fairness is a matter off opinion . 
  is it fair for persons with chronic diseases to have to pay a lot of money because of it ?

  was your country more famous back then ? 
  after all one of the greatest drivers died in your country . 
   you should post this in ** notmebutiknowsomeonewhoknowssomeone ** , you would get many more responses i imagine ftfy, 
  the guy because of whom reddit is kinda blocked in ru is the top tifu thread over at / r/tifu right now and the thread is even in the top 10 of all time of the sub . 
  for some britons romania and bulgaria apparently are a single country with two names . 
  that eu is deliberately making life worse along with the us so we should get the fuck away and get back with russia . 
  being placed as bulgarian among europeans is such a pride . 
  we are not a part of the archaic eastern bloc heavily influenced by the damn soviets or linked to the ottoman traditions . 
  my hometown is right across the border . 
  we always used to make fun of the poor ugly gypsy romanians who had nothing to eat ( literally , about 1981 ) . 
  then we laughed at them when they flocked in rousse to shop in kaufland and the tech stores . 
  now they are digging themselves out of the dirt . 
  too bad bulgarians are too near-sighted to see that romania is going ahead of us and still laugh about the same old jokes ( dacia-gypsy-gib bak klay ) . 
  actually the main reason for the forests to grow here is that there are not so many people in the rural places ( at least not as much as they were back * then * ) so there 's no one to actually get in the way of a forest to grow . 
  i choose my own country . 
  i am already used to with all the shit , why should i bother trying somewhere else to fit in with all the different shit ? 
   i never really understood people who go to clubs for their vacations . 
  we both know what kind of people go to clubs for their vacations here and we both know they are not a bit interested in the universe . 
  afaik they think the universe rotates around them . 
  soo reverse light polution ? 
  do n't worry . 
  our bike lanes are useless since if you have a bike that is more than 500 $ it will probably get stolen .

  you mean finland . 
  finland is n't real . 
  poor switzerland , not properly accepted anywhere :(, 
  you 're missing your flair , \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442 . 
  but if you close your eyes , does it almost feel like nothing chang . . oh not that bastille !, 
  kinda . 
  any other maps of other parts of the globe ? 
  moldova is so poor , they can not afford food thus they can not afford to be overweight . 
  well not really , because this is the border i was going after : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/bulgaria_simeon_i_ ( 893-927 ) . svg/2000px-bulgaria _ simeon_i _ ( 893-927 ) . svg.png and i 'm not sure hungary would * gib bak * pest . 
  eh , close enough . 
  is this split ? 
  this totally looks like split . 
  on the map is [ hotel rodina \\ ( motherland \\ ) ] ( http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4014/4693412319_739977b37a_z.jpg ) 104 meters , but right now they are finishing [ capital fort ] ( http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm173/georgi_zhigalov/sl274508_zpscstqifgi.jpg ) at 125 meters . 
  poor eastern bloc , noone wants there . 
  i understand the participants at the baltimore riots are people who think something bad happened because the color of someone 's skin and they tend to play the racial/minority card for excuse to riot/protest/loot . 
  is n't this just another `` white cop-black victim '' case ? 
  like the one in ferguson ? 
  or like la in 1992 ? 
  yes , there is police brutality . 
  but why everyone is accenting what the color of the victim 's skin is ? 
  ca n't happen in bulgaria , not that massively . 
  once minorities start rioting police will use massive brutal force and will fuck them up big time . 
  riots can happen , but not by any of the minorities here ( gypsies , turks , refugees ) . 
  also the different countries in europe have more serious problems than the death of a single person so people would riot for proper education and healthcare and etc. 
  bulgarians used to smoke a lot . 
  about 65 % ( according to the national statistics institute ) . 
  now 35 % of bulgarians smoke more than a pack a day . 
  one of our primary exports in agriculture is tobacco . 
  but damn , the stigma is massive . 
  the law states that smoking is forbidden in closed areas . 
  but the law also states that a closed area is any place with 4 hard walls . 
  so now they just build `` aquariums '' for smokers with transparent pvc walls that are rolled up in sunny weather and rolled down when it 's cold . 
  a lot of people in the province/the poor parts of the country still smoke indoors but make self-made ashtrades from a glass and couple of ice blocks or a small vase or whatever . 
  since the law states that both the owner and the visitor should pay fines , bar owners just place these decorative vases and then in court tell that it was just for decoration and the visitor lighted a cigarette on his own . 
  the biggest problem in bulgaria is not applying the laws and that reflects in every aspect in the community , like the smoking problem - we have a law forbidding smoking indoors but the lack of applying it makes things not that good . 
  leisure , lol . 
  to clear everything up : ** tsar ** was the highest monarch title until the communists came . 
  so he was actively ruler ( well , with regents ) of bulgaria before 1944 . 
  one of the most successful pr campaigns of 2014 at our advertising agency was about the refugees from syria . 
  74 % of bulgarians do n't want refugees living in their neighbourhood and 64 % of bulgarians do n't want refugees living in bulgaria at all . 
  we did all we could to change this point of view but damn it 's hard since bulgarians are poor and uneducated and do n't know the difference between muslims , terrorists , refugees , skin-colored people etc. 
  it 's not that surprising with the british question since every student here dreams of going to uk because of various reasons . 
  because everything is just damn too simple and easy . 
  i was born in bulgaria , i was molded with challenges throughout my entire life , i would easily get bored in a country like usa . 
  when i was younger and our democracy was still single-digit-old some french people asked my sister ( while she was there ) if we had washing machines and ovens ... 
  but the most bizzare is that we have many bulls . 
  you know , because of bul-garia :|, 
  he did pretty well , you named your otopeni airport after him . 
  of course we do !!!!, 
  5 centuries of slavery !!!, 
  i live right across the border ( hometown is rousse ) and many times my parents told me that because of how romanians used to queueueue for hours in the communism they managed to pay their debts and that 's why they are having better progress than us . 
  i want to add something : at bnt ( bulgarian national television ) commercials are only allowed 6minutes per hour . 
  all the other ( non-state funded ) televisions get 20 minutes per hour . 
  also bnt can not have more than 2 minutes of advertising per commercial break . 
  so it 's mostly funded by the state . 
  side by side now , divided forever by bulgaria ^ ** gib ** ^ ** back ** ^ ** clay **, 
  better than the previous military alliance . 
  older people always used to tell us how in ww2 the german soldiers helped elders , played with kids and gave a hand for the housework in the houses they were sleeping . 
  both citizens and military understood that this is war and just have to wait until it blows over ( not the best use of words ) . 
  when the russians came they drank all the alcohol , destroyed many gardens for fruits and vegetables and ruined the newly paved roads by the germans with their tanks and etc. 
  when we joined nato the us army positioned some bases in southern bulgaria . 
  they redid the roads and always were polite in the local shops at the nearby villages . 
  we have the same politician here , some people even called him `` the bulgarian bismarck '' . 
  [ stefan stambolov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_stambolov ) was the successor of our national hero and the apostle of freedom vasil levski in some revolutionary organisations . 
  then he was prime minister . 
  in his reign he opposed the monarch knyaz ferdinand for his pro-russian tendencies , unites the bulgarians in macedonia , borrows money from great britain and the austro-hungarian empire for improving the army , infrastructure and administration . 
  due to this just in 7 years 80 new factories are built around the country . 
  nowadays he is n't given as example because he opposed all pro-russians and cleared the army from russophiles . 
  but because of his authoritarian regime he loses control over the church and government . 
  he is assassinated in 1895 when he is attacked with pistol and yatagan ( special curved ottoman short sabre ) and now his monument is his head with massive cut . 
  he was known for always wearing bulletproof vest so that 's why the attackers attacked mostly his head . 
  of course we have buses , it 's just they are n't that big or yellow or systematized . 
  at the village where my grandfather is from , our neighbour had chavdar c-51 and used to drive the kids from our and the neighbouring villages to the county school . 
  then on his way back he got welfare food for the extremely poor ( people were already poor when i was younger ) . 
  when i was a student i used the public transport for 12 years . 
  as did all my classmates who lived more than 15 minutes walking distance away from school . 
  this made me check who is our representative in un .

  you attack israel doing almost no harm . 
  they are way stronger than you . 
  and you still keep fucking with them , with no benefit at all , then they retaliate , destroying whole streets , killing way , way more of `` your '' people . 
  and in the end you 're like `` we stronk !, 
  we eliminate all the juice !, 
  uhm ... nope ? 
  they 're welcome . 
  * iceland * ireland * georgia, 
  weeeeell ... we 're pretty okay with it , to be honest . 
  the thing is , we were allies with the reich , but we were not involved in the active wars , so we did n't have casualties when we were with germany . 
  we had casualties when civilians were bombed by the allies and our pilots had some fights then , but we were pretty okay . 
  second - we had a monarch - pretty cool guy , basically bulgaria was functioning . 
  and !, 
  we were way more powerful and important than today ( because * cough-cough * we got some lands from greece and serbia , we occupied greece after the wehrmacht had invaded them [ map here ] ( http://istoria.bg/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/karta-bulgaria-vtora-svetovna-voina-333x200.jpg ) ) , so no one would dare to fuck with us at least at a local level . 
  we were pretty independent too - our monarch and the church decided to save the bulgarian jews and we did it because we wanted to . 
  not a single jew deported from bulgaria . 
  so yeah , that 's pretty independent - to go against hitler 's will , even when we 're allies . 
  then the communists came , `` liberating '' bulgaria , basically killing unknown amount of people , burring them in mass graves , stealing every single shit they could get , behaving like animals and so on . 
  mind you , when the germans passed through bulgaria before that they were behaving really great - helping to the people , just ... behaving greatly . 
  buying everything they need , building stuff ... then the communists made us send troops against germany and then we had victims of active battles in the war . 
  then there was a dictatorship that purged the intelligence , the officers of the army , the people who wanted to keep their private land and so on . 
  so i would say we 're pretty okay with our `` fascist '' history ( though we had `` monarchical '' history and not fascist '' ) . 
  [ barbarians ] ( http://i.pik.bg/news/529/660_4974ed879b07ad2890f51a42cd53c707.jpg ), 
  uhhhm ... good , i guess ? 
  we 're orthodox christians , i would say most of the people are not atheists , but ... 
  the church itself is a parody . 
  our head priests drive limousines most probably given from the mafia , they also have rolexes . 
  a lot of them are ex-communist agents of the secret police so they can betray the people who are believers . 
  a lot of the monks in the monasteries are making gay orgies and if someone wants to become a monk it 's most probably because he 's into these stuff . 
  it 's a bullshit system , basically . 
  the christianity itself is respected , though . 
  from a black shirt to no shirt at all ... 
  wow , that is interesting !, 
  thanks !, 
  here the phone scams are done just by gypsies . 
  bulgarians just would n't do something like that to the old people . 
  ah , actually bulgarians could be used for `` mules '' . 
  a gypsy contacts some taxi driver or a person - `` hey , i need you to get me a package from my grandma from this address and get it to me , i 'll pay you well . '' . 
  some of the mules do the work , some realise what it is about and call the police ... actually it 's interesting how the gypsies have an accent when talking but at the same time the old people are too afraid or just ... do n't think enough , and get scammed . 
  it 's kinda like how the indian says he 's called `` john anderson '' and he 's from microsoft from the sillicon valley . 
  there are some scams done by bulgarians but they are a bit different and very rare . 
  for example recently the tv news talked about such scam : advertisement for work from home where you can make good money . 
  you call to this number and they tell you that you need to send them ( for example ) 5 euros and they will call you . 
  people send them the money and they are not contacted again . 
  or even if they 're contacted , then they are asked to send like . . 20 euros for materials for this work from home . 
  it does n't seam like a lot but these scammers make like a month salary a day , so it 's really profitable . 
  we 're lucky to not have at least these fuckers , because of our `` exotic '' language . 
  the english speaking countries are flooded with them , though . 
  it seems they 're now trying to get on the german `` market '' ... 
  ah , yeah - when scammers come to your place . 
  we have that too . 
  since we have a lot of bloody stupid people , two or three gypsy woman come and say `` we 're magicians and you have black magic done on your house . 
  we gon na break that black magic but you have to gather all of your money , gold and so on here on the table . '' . 
  so the stupid people do it , the scammers put it in a towel or something and than change the towels with the same one full of newspaper pieces . 
  in the end - the stupid people are like `` omg they stole all of my money and gold '' . 
  no fucking kidding !, 
  there are also scammers - magicians ( on the tv or who place advertisements in the newspapers and online ) who `` break black magics '' for crazy amount of money from the idiotic bulgarian people . 
  how the hell can you give 5 thousand euros to some scammer because he tells you about magics ... jesus christ ... 
  hehe , it 's somehow interesting to see how the exactly same scam works abroad too . 
  i was wondering if you have it , but it 's indeed the exactly same . 
  also , i 'm curious - do you know who is doing it ? 
  does polish people do this scam ? 
  because here it 's done only by gypsies and actually not by all of them , but a specific clan . 
  it 's not done by the pickpocketers rich clan , but one of the `` poorer '' ones . 
  even it is known that they are from couple of specific places in bulgaria , not in every city . 
  but the police is doing nothing , the system itself is just fucked up . 
  the police is lazy and it 's probably corrupted to not touch them . 
  the other funny thing is , they get a lot of money , as you 've written , from these old people . 
  like 10 thousand euros , or 15 thousand and so on , which here it 's even more huge than in poland . 
  i 'm a young person and i do n't have even a thousand euros in me . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  this actually makes a lot of young people angry - the old stupid people have a lot of money they just do n't use - if you 're having them - 1 . have fun - go abroad , go to the seaside , trips and so on , like the german old people do . 
  stop fucking complaining `` omg omg i 'm poor , the pension is small , i ca n't buy food to eat '' while you have 20 thousand euros 2 . 
  give the money to your children - help them with something , the life is expensive here and even working people always lack money , but the stupid old people give the money to the gypsies , so the gypsies can have expensive cars , big houses and eat and drink all day long without moving a finger . 
  it 's just ... ridiculous . 
  it makes you angry . 
  and since you ask - there are many `` scenarious '' about these scams - it was popular with the bird and the pig flue - `` i 'm dr ivanov and your son needs a vaccine for 3 thousand euros . 
  give them now . '', 
  or - `` i 'm a surgeon and your son needs a golden nail in his knee because he needs an operation '' . 
  bullshit like that . 
  romania : people who had suffered fate similar to ours . 
  interestingly , we also have some similar customs . 
  i 'm also glad for them and their fast economical development since the ceausescu era . 
  serbia has some amazing and powerful traditional folk music , which is kinda typical for the balkans and the other southern people . 
  greece has well managed tourism and i 'm actually glad for them , that a lot of bulgarians prefer to go to the greek seaside and not to go to ours . 
  everybody is left with good impression from the clean beaches and water , the good prices and basically - not the thief-scam-mafia way of managing the tourism like it 's in bulgaria . 
  turkey is like a modern buffer between europe and the arab world . 
  i like that it has modern thinking people , that it 's not a conservative islamist state on our border , that people there are fighting and protesting for their rights of modernised society and they try not to fall into the pit of islamism and conservatism . 
  and macedonia is like our little daughter that just had hit puberty and says how she hates us and never wants to see us again , and how she wants to run away . 
  of course we love our daughter . 
  but seriously , not loving macedonia is like not loving ourselves . 
  yep , it 's a long topic . 
  thank you , friend . 
  the thing with corruption is that it 's now part of the mentality of some nations , way more that it 's in others , and that indeed can be explained with the 45 years of communism . 
  the mass practice then was to steal every mean possible from the country , or to do everything with connections , because you would be unable to do it the normal way . 
  for example ... if you work as a truck driver for a cement factory - you drive out with 15 tons of cement , but on the way you stop to your uncles new house under construction , and in the end you get to your destination with 13 tons . 
  you 're thinking - who cares , everybody steals from the country . 
  or ... if you 're working in the state wine factory . 
  you know that it 's impossible to find some wine in the shops , so you ... steal ... couple of bottles of wine , go to your friend in the tobacco factory and you exchange these bottles for couple of packs of cigarettes , that are hard to find , and that he stole from the factory . 
  in these times it 's just impossible to get some things .

  who invades and annexes territories from their neigbour ? 
  who invaded eastern ukraine and who annexed crimea ? 
  the answer to these questions will tell you who the real warmonger and hot head really is . 
   no one in europe wants to be hostage to your traumatic speak for yourself . 
  plenty of people in europe will stand with the baltics against russian aggression . 
   will usa with trump become what russia became with gorbachov and yeltsin ? 
  interesting that you mention that . 
  i have been thinking the same . 
  i feel like trump will be america 's yeltsin . 
  we welcome you with open arms . 
  it will all depend on trumps actions from now on . 
  hopefully . 
  i just hope the damage will not be too great by then . 
   muslim brotherhood , saudi arabia or the akp there is a significant overlap between the muslim brotherhood and the akp , but saudi arabia and their wahhabi brand of islam are completely different and distinct . 
  we are on our way to end up with a russian stooge as our president . 
  all thanks to the hybrid media war they 've been waging on the country . 
  entire websites have been created that are dedicated to spewing propaganda garbage 24/7 in bulgarian . 
  one must give it to them though , they are getting quite good at it . 
  does every political party leader in turkey have a song dedicated to them ? 
  i am fairly certain that the guy depicted by this statue was a quite fierce catholic . 
  sad but true . 
   i 'm really really skeptical russian would annex any of listed regions . 
  many people said the same about crimea . 
  once the precedent is set , there is very little stopping russia from annexing other regions . 
  some elements within the government are in fact not even trying to hide their intention to resurrect novorosiya - a region that spans all the way to the moldovan border across the northern shores of the black sea . 
  the eu 's primary responsibility is to its citizens . 
  if some british people want to maintain their citizenship then they should be allowed to . 
  the eu 's responsibility is to them alone . 
  why should the eu concern itself with the affairs of the british public at large ? 
  how isislike . 
  when was that ? 
  in the early 1800s . 
  far more recently , in the 1990s , merely two decades , not two centuries ago , serbia committed horrific genocide against the muslim population in bosnia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_genocide some of the perpetrators , like karadjic and mladic , referred to their victims as turks and used precisely the kind of imagery in this coat of arms to justify the mass murder of people . 
  in fact , you can clearly hear mladic boasting about taking revenge from the turks as he was entering the town of srebrenica : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfinjlnot4q even though the people he was referring to were not turks , but bosniak muslims . 
  so really there is no difference . 
  it is especially revolting because there are still minority groups in those countries that are linked to turks and this kind of imagery openly calls for their murder and ethnic cleansing . 
  what is ironic is that the same people that express disgust and outrage at the beheadings comitted by terror groups such as isis , have in the midst of their own continent and some of them live in cities and towns that glorify beheadings and use them as their symbols . 
  bulgarian turk . 
  pomaks are distinct . 
   rumors say that they want to build a pipe from saudi arabia , which is financing globalism , terrorism , and muslims invasion in the west , to europe and cut russia off . 
  that 's not a rumor , that 's the whole point of the war . 
  and that is also why russia is so invested there . 
  if such a pipeline were built , then russia 's energy grip on europe would be significantly weakened . 
  imagine if the roles were reversed with a town in turkey having such a symbol . 
  the outrage in / r/europe would be universal across the board . 
  it would be dismissed as barbaric and asiatic and as something that does not fit european values . 
  instead what we have here are tasteless remarks and crude jokes about `` remove kebap '' . 
  the economy is erdogan 's achilles heel . 
  given how much of his legitimacy rests on his ability to deliver economically , any sanctions would probably hurt him a lot . 
  but there is also the danger that if he is cornered , he may become even more unpredictable . 
  those are pkk supporters . 
  the man on their flag is [ ocalan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abdullah_%c3%96calan ) , the pkk leader . 
  they also had a [ `` protest '' in sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhwu9ykmfe4 ) where they accused swedish police of being terrorists . 
  it also has to do with the political suppression of the piously religious lower classes in turkey during the previous governments . 
  with erdogan they feel like they are finally getting their voices heard again . 
  is n't that what politics is all about . 
  there are just eternal interests no friendships . 
   but maaaaaaybe with the whole genocide thing , such things are kind of to be expected . 
  a historical event that happened more than hundred years ago does not give armenians card blanche to commit human rights violations and in many cases outright massacres ( [ khojaly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khojaly_massacre ) ) against azeri civilians . 
  there are plenty of muslims that live in that area . 
  it is interesting that you chose to solely focus on armenian heritage and completely ignored the cultural monuments of the other ethnic groups . 
  the agdam mosque comes to mind which lies in disrepair and ruin because of the continuing armenian occupation . 
  the far right campaigned mostly on the refugee issue , and they came in third . 
   switching from a proportional system for your lower house elections to a majority two round one ? 
  wtf bulgarians , do n't do that . 
  oo i do n't think most people that voted on that question even understood what it meant . 
  they were like - majoritarian sounds good - let 's just vote yes on it . 
   this is because the incumbent , who many agree is the best president we 've had so far , decided no to run due to personal issues . 
  partly because the ruling party gerb refused to nominate him again . 
  it would be interesting to see how well you would fare if trump becomes president . 
   no ethnicity mentioned , and the turkish republic was supposed to promote secular and humanistic values , not traditional ones . 
  nothing at all like modern ethno-nationalists . 
  like all ideologies , ethnonationalism must have looked good on paper , but it is quite a different beast in practice . 
  mine too . 
  if you would let the syrian army have its way , you would probably end up with another massive refugee wave to europe . 
  you will get it stamped at your first point of entry , which in you case is frankfurt . 
   last thing we need here is more fucking gypsies what a racist and backward mentality . 
  i want to congratulate your emissaries too . 
  it is good that at least somebody is standing up for the right thing . 
   snowden is in the same situation about russia . 
  mostly because of the spinelessness of eu countries and their failure to grant him asylum . 
  sometimes eu states act like subservient vassals to the united states . 
   am i wrong ? 
  yes . 
   to be precise , the bank can choose to not do business with anyone . 
  that is kind of scary when you think that countries like sweden are moving towards completely eliminating cash in favor of bank debit cards . 
  if banks could chose not to do business with someone then that could literally mean starvation for the person as they will not even be able to purchase food any longer if cash is not accepted . 
   even under ataturk a `` turk '' was a ** sunni ** muslim you 've got your facts wrong . 
  25 % of muslims in turkey are alevis , not sunni , and they are staunch ataturk supporters . 
   alevis are proud of their cooperation with ataturk , and the fact that the \u00c7elebi and dedebaba of the hac\u0131bekta\u015f monastery had supported him . 
  alevis were his faithful allies in the war of independence , in the setting up of the modern turkish secular nationalist state , and in the destruction of ottomanism . 
  the early kemalist republic is regarded as the ideal state in which the alevis were fairly represented proportionately to their percentage of the total population in the national assembly . 
   alevis saw ataturk as mahdi ( messiah ) , a saviour , a divine emanation following ali and hajji bektash wali , sent to save them from the sunni ottoman yoke , who turned alevi ideals into state practice , and his portrait is hung up beside ali 's in many alevi homes . 
  ataturk on his part saw the alevis as allies in his struggle against the traditional ottoman elite and for secularism and turkish nationalism . 
  he selectively included alevi cultural markers in his construct of the new turkish national collective identity . 
  however , to ensure national unity , the unique alevi identity was subordinated to the general anatolian-turkish national identity . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alevi_history#alevi_perception_of_atat.c3.bcrk, 
  damn , i never realized i was actually from a police state . 
   bulgaria was founded on a crescent of anti-ottomanism feelings .

  these forecasts should n't be taken as gospel , they 're usually at least a little bit wrong , but they 're the best we have . 
  who else are we going to go to if we want to hear about the future of the economy , gypsy fortune tellers ? 
  ... wow this article is actually a load of crap . 
  they say '' ... now economists also believe the impact of the vote will be relatively modest , compared with some early fears . '', 
  but if you click on the link they provide to back up that statement it 's another article from before the referendum and it does n't talk about post-referendum britain but it tries to explain a q2 slowdown with the uncertainty from the referendum . 
  and now that we know q2 growth was n't bad they 're saying `` brexit did n't affect us as much as we expected ! '', 
  which is true but it 's about the first half of the year not july or the future . 
   we still have to wait and see . 
  but predictions made today will look much more rosy than those made a month ago . 
  that 's what the article is saying . 
  the article is only telling us about moody 's predictions . 
  if the others updated theirs there 's no information of that . 
  i do n't think they even update them every month . 
   i agree , but that 's exactly the point . 
  this article is referencing more up to date data that implies that the previous predictions were wrong . 
  what data are they referencing aside from the stock market ? 
  what you say about predictions made today being `` rosier '' is logical mostly because a month ago we thought article 50 will be triggered soon . 
  now we know that wo n't happen for another year . 
  but that telegraph article itself does n't provide reasons to think the uk 's economy is doing better , they just make a bunch of unsubstantiated predictions . 
  the article is just predictions , we will have to wait a few months to know how the uk economy is actually doing . 
  the article does mention that stock prices have recovered but that 's only true in pounds . 
  if you 're a foreigner you can buy the same number of stocks but for a significantly lower price . 
  ye , how biased of me to give more weight to the opinion of 30 institutions rather than one credit rating agency . 
  a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth , so you can have a recession and still grow 0.7 % . 
  furthermore dropping from 2.1 % as was initially forecast to 0.7 % is pretty dramatic not relatively modest like moody 's says in op 's article . 
  i forgot to add that i meant that in the context of our discussion when you asked why the banks over moody 's , not including everyone else who 's made a forecast . 
  btw since a recession means two consecutive quarters of negative growth , you can still end the year with positive growth despite experiencing a recession . 
  so that graph does n't really tell us who expects a recession , just who expects that gdp growth will end up positive . 
  i do n't get what you mean by adding `` then '' . 
  have i said banks are just as untrustworthy ? 
   why trust the banks over moody ? 
  because there are several of them saying the same thing while only moody 's is saying britain is safe from a recession . 
  * also as far as i know banks are considered more independent than rating agencies as the latter are often accused of accepting money to publish more favorable reviews . 
  [ treasury document reveals every major bank expects post-brexit recession ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/treasury-document-major-banks-post-brexit-recession-economy-a7195661.html ) but hey if moody 's everything is fine in 2008 credit agency says there wo n't be recession , then we should trust them , right ? 
  it 's a conspiracy by boyko !, 
  what 's the point of that ? 
   the pm said if re-elected he would serve the full five years of another parliament and then leave number 10 . 
  so he would n't have resigned before 2020 ... 
  interesting , could you source that ? 
  wait do you mean he would have resigned regardless of the referendum ? 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's trolling . 
  we 're all in agreement that may followed the rules but he keeps bringing it up as if that makes her elected even if he himself admits that no votes were cast :d, 
  you 're hilarious . 
  so she was unel ... d ? 
  being a member of parliament or a prime minister are quite different things though . 
  oh , thanks for correcting , i edited my post . 
  i do like the fact that we 've had elections in stead of just switching pms , feels more democratic , even if the ones 2013 went horribly . 
  was a single vote cast for her to be pm ? 
  she was not elected . 
  being one of 650 mps does n't count . 
  i called that ironic , not illegal so do n't go on explaining how that is your system , because i never said she became pm by not following rules or something like that . 
   so from the point of view of a british person , the so-called undemocratic nature of either eu government structures or uk ones might be regarded as not that relevant to the bigger issues facing the uk now . 
  of course , i 'm just trying to explain to u/casualview why it is ironic to me :p, 
  this whole comment chain is based on the irony of some british people calling the eu undemocratic . 
  you have n't made such a claim but by arguing you 're siding with the people who have , even if just for the sake of discussion . 
  you ca n't argue with me and then just say `` that was n't my opinion anyways '' . 
  not even that , she was unopposed - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservative_party_ ( uk ) _ leadership_election , _ 2016 . 
  we vote for a party . 
  so you think being elected as one of 650 mps to become pm is fine , but being elected as a eu mp and * then * being elected as president of the commission by the meps is undemocratic ? 
  it 's not about whether you approve of this system or not but about approving of the first and not the second . 
  this seems to be the general brit 's view . 
  in bulgaria if the pm resigns we hold earlier elections , until which a caretaker government is in power . 
  that 's why i 'm asking if may is gon na stay till 2020 which is 3/4 of a term , though i probably should n't have said `` full term '' . 
  edit : actually that 's only true in practice , the ruling party can elect a new pm , but that has never happened and elections have been held in stead . 
  credit to u/avtogol, 
   irony - a situation that is strange or funny because things happen in a way that seems to be the opposite of what you expected . 
  i expect people who cite the perceived unelectability of eu leaders as one of their reasons for leaving the eu to elect their own leaders , therefore this is ironic to me . 
  also you did n't vote in the tories based on their brexit policy which is going to change all their other policies anyways . 
  and you did vote in the tories expecting they would be able to vote on their own leader and thus pm . 
  that did n't happen . 
  no as i say [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4xlosb/brexit_will_be_delayed_until_end_of_2019/d6guvht ) you * do * have party leader elections which determine who will be pm . 
  may won by default because gove , leadsome and even b. johnson dropped out . 
  also while you did vote for the party a lot of people had completely different expectations about what it would do . 
  the tories wanted to stay , now they have to lead the leaving process . 
  it 's not that any of this is illegal it 's just ironic , is what i 'm saying . 
  when the british people voted for the conservatives back in 2015 they expected cameron to be pm , not may . 
  the party was also chosen based on a completely different platform than what may will be doing . 
  since cameron resigned the conservatives must elect a new party leader from amongst themselves who will become the new pm . 
  according to businessinsider this happens like this :  the new prime minister will be chosen by a conservative party leadership election . 
   this election will have two parts :  firstly , conservative mps elect two candidates . 
   after these two candidates have been chosen , a postal ballot will be sent out to all conservative party members , on a `` one member , one vote '' basis . 
   the winner of this vote will then become the next prime minister . 
  that means that 149,800 tory activists ( according to the latest house of commons library data ) -- around 0.002 % of the uk population -- will choose the next leader of the uk . 
  but since may 's contenders dropped out , she got the position automatically without anyone , including the tories , having a choice . 
  in bg when the pm resigns a new temporary government is formed and earlier elections are scheduled , so that 's why i 'm asking if may is supposed to serve a full term . 
  the more time passes the further away brexit gets . 
  also , is may gon na serve a full term ? 
  ironic , considering how brits complained about eu officials being unelected . 
  someone should also tell erdogan that . 
  maybe he read a history book and emphatised with his long dead countrymen ? 
  i think they 're among the top countries in medals per capita for all the olympics . 
  guess they 're just that good . 
  equipping your army is a one time expense , you need much less money afterwards to keep your army modernised . 
  in 2015 they imported [ $ 9.3 billion ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-12/saudi-arabia-s-weapons-imports-lead-surge-in-global-arms-sales ) worth of weapons , you think they need 1,5 % of their total gdp just to import foreign arms for themselves ? 
  and that 's in addition to their own growing industry . 
  it 's ridiculous to think that saudi arabia , a country of 30 million , became the biggest importer of american weapons just to equip their own army and border police . 
  lol , what do you think saudi arabia does with all the high quality weapons they get ? 
  just store them on some ever-growing pile of sparkling new military equipment ? 
  saudi arabia is the biggest importer of us and uk arms . 
  put pressure on these countries ?!,

  what people on this subreddit call ` balkan ' food is anything but balkan .

   four months pregnant , the wife , diana ramazanova , began making arrangements to leave syria and travel to frederikstad to give birth . 
   she made it as far as istanbul , the turkish capital . 
  there , on jan. 6 , she blew herself up in a suicide attack on a turkish police post , killing a police officer and her own unborn baby . 
  what the actual fuck !??? 
  i 've seen cows and sheep munch grass in the park if that counts =d seriously , tho - you can see squirrels and hedgehogs in my neighbourhood but it 's a rare sight . 
  i 've seen pictures of rabbits and whatnot coming from norway and it 's nowhere near that . 
  i would n't add sofia to that list . 
  not with the standard raised that high . 
  yeah , it 's very similar here . 
  i 've got 2 kindergardens , 3 schools , a clinic , 2 tennis courts , 3 football terrains , plenty of those small playgrounds for kids between the buildings , small shops ( some of them 24/7 ) , restaurants , a mall and like 5 supermarkets - all less than 5 minutes away by foot . 
  we also got an apartment in one of the new neighbourhoods and even tho the building is new and cool and pretty and in general the apartment feels larger , the streets turn into swamps in the spring/autumn , there 's no central heating ( which is somewhat ok considering electricity is not * that * expensive here ) but what 's worse is the materials used in general - you can literally hear the footsteps of your neighbours when it 's really quiet ( think 2am for example ) . 
  and if you want to get somewhere , your only options are a car or a long walk to the nearest bus stop . 
  commie buildings are very , very ugly tho . 
  that 's undeniable . 
  however , i think as people get wealthier here , they 'll most certainly invest in thermal isolation and that usually gives the buildings a better look . 
  the government here has been trying to get home owners to organize and decide on colors and stuff and isolate the entire building . 
  there 's an option where the eu pays 75 % of the whole thing . 
  sadly , people still do n't have the money for that ; / here 's how it * could * look , tho : http://pravatami.bg/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/www.monitor.jpg http://econ.bg/pictures/196521_300_225.jpg sure , it 's not amazing but i think it 's not ugly either  edit : i forgot to mention this but in case anyone 's curious how come the eu is paying 75 % of this yet people are generally not going for this option - after reading up on the issue , it turns out the government has contracts with certain construction companies and you can only choose one of them . 
  and of course , the price is way above what you 'd get from freelance workers and your own materials . 
  also , turns out you need to apply for a grant with a bank instead of getting the money directly which adds even more to the price . 
  long story short - eu project abused to milk the population . 
  sooo , what are we looking at here ? 
  historically , my favourite bulgarian would be [ simeon i of bulgaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simeon_i_of_bulgaria ) . 
  many people associate him with the territorial expansion of the country but what 's more important is his and his father 's [ boris i of bulgaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_i_of_bulgaria ) contribution to the bulgarian culture . 
  under those 2 guys , bulgaria became the cultural center of the slavic world . 
  the cyrillic script and the [ old bulgarian language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_church_slavonic ) ( old church slavonic ) became the de fact lingua franca of eastern europe and the balkans and our literature and works of art spread through the continent . 
  until certain kebap came in the 14th century , ofc . 
  =d  simeon was the bulgarian charlemagne , but he was better educated than our charles the great and much greater than him , for he laid down the foundations of literature that belonged to the people a random quote you can find under his wiki page ;p if we 're talking about events , that would be undeniably the [ unification ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_unification ) which gave serbia a reason to attack us , leading to the [ serbo-bulgarian war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbo-bulgarian_war ) or as most people know it - the first time we gave serbia a boot in the ass . 
  as far as battles go - there 's the [ battle of doiran ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_doiran_%281917%29 ) against gb , french and greek soldiers , with general [ vladimir vazov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_vazov ) being credited with the brilliant defense . 
  another one would be the [ battle of dobrich ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_dobrich ) against the russian empire and romania . 
  we have an inside joke here . 
  we win the battles and germans lose the wars . 
  it 's not far from the truth . 
  oh , so you were n't being passive-aggressive and i simply misunderstood the intent behind that link . 
  you 've got my apologies !, 
  well , if that 's the case then yeah , sure , you 're absolutely right - today , macedonia is a separate country and i doubt they 'd want a union with bulgaria . 
   independent sources in europe between 1878 and 1918 generally tended to view the slavic population of macedonia in two ways : as bulgarians and as macedonian slavs . 
  basically what i said . 
  and in addition you 're claiming it was ok for greece and serbia to fight for clay . 
  and to top it off you try to put us in the same cup . 
  well , we did n't massacre serbs and greeks for one so that 's that . 
  ( and yes , i am aware of certain individual accidents but it was n't a national policy to behave like a barbarian )  everyone goes to war for territorial gains that 's extremely offensive . 
  hopefully you realise why . 
  and do n't ever say it out loud in bulgaria or you might get your teeth scattered on the ground . 
  genuine friendly advice  anyway , there 's nothing to add really so i 'll just let this discussion go . 
  it 's ancient history anyway .

  no , it was n't about land .

  wtf . 
  i thought they are on our expense so ... well , we 're not a rich country so it would make sense that the government ca n't provide a good environment for them .

  having a foreign policy that does n't revolve around blowing the usa does n't mean we are russian lapdogs .

  first investment bank was the victim of a panic induced bank run . 
  people here remember the bank crisis from 1997 when most people lost all of their savings which is why we have the toughest bank laws in europe and the lowest bank trust . 
  so when they started hearing rumors and getting emails about an possible crash the naive ones ran to the banks and took out 400\u00a0000\u00a0000 euro in a single day . 
  now after fibank was shown to have enough liquidity these people lost their interest rates and had to pay fees for pulling out their deposits . 
  they got used and lost money . 
  here is what is really going on . 
  tsvetan vasilev made a lot of bad loans to firms close to his oligarch buddies . 
  he left the country with 100\u00a0000\u00a0000 euro and is hiding in austria . 
  there are unverified reports that he smuggled as much as half a billion euro out of the bank . 
  the government took control of the bank and will move all regular accounts into another bank . 
  after that they will bail that new bank ( credit agricole ) out with 1.6 billion euro from the government 's reserves . 
  our taxes will go to bail out vasilev 's bank . 
  all accounts linked to vasilev wo n't be protected , but the damage is already done . 
  the whole thing was a huge scam that will drain out our emergency reserves .

  the deal for contractors was signed between christmas and new year in 2013 without any competition . 
  the project was overpriced since the austrians will pay almost half per kilometer . 
  it 's good that it was canceled for now , since the building firm is very corrupt linked to delyan peevski ( notorious oligarch ) . 
  the russian leaders are corrupt like ours , but at least they do n't want to turn us into the ghetto of europe that houses all middle eastern refugees and supplies western europe with wage slaves and doctors . 
  not going to happen . 
  the technology is still experimental and it would cost too much .

  he probably realized that without putin his country would have been turned into a us vassal state like poland and the baltics . 
  that their resources would have been leeched out by european and american multinational companies and that their economy would have been decimated like the rest of eastern europe . 
  the same as that of the orange revolution . 
  they traded a bunch of corrupt oligarchs with others . 
  they got used . 
  the last one did n't use artillery and bombers against his own people though .

  typical oligarchs . 
  the money comes from the bulgarian government , but the eu had to approve it since it falls under `` unfair competition/protectionism '' eu crap . 
  anyone who knows about the lead up to the second balkan war knows why we joined the central powers 2 years later . 
  the picture is simple french war propaganda , nothing more . 
  pretty much . 
  people from my part of bulgaria ( south west ) were forced to call themselves ethnic macedonians on a single census by the communists who feared reprisals from stalin . 
  modern fyromians still cite that census when they make territorial claims ... 
  i would love to see a study on the bush generation and their views on kissinger and reagan 's doctrine in south america , south east asia and the middle east . 
  http://ycharts.com/indicators/europe_natural_gas_price so they will pay what ? 
  15 usd per million btu instead of 10 dollars like the rest of europe ? 
  ukraine has been paying 295 usd per 1000 cubic meters for years which is much lower than anyone else ... their economy would die in a few months at the us prices . 
   a eu `` new deal '' alliance would benefit us greatly if we could pull it off . 
  it would n't , because we ca n't absorb enough money to make a difference . 
  eu money is always locked behind bureaucracy and other bullshit . 
  what is this link supposed to mean ? 
  as for productivity . 
  the 2 countries need investments in order to renew their production plants and create more and better products . 
  with new plants and better machines exports would rise meaning higher wages and more disposable income and need for even more goods . 
  https://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2013/111413.htm one of the problems is the low domestic demand for goods . 
  people are uncertain and do n't spend money which caused the 2 % deflation earlier this year .

  the numbers speak for that matter . 
  the amount of migration from the middle east and africa has significantly dropped in 2016 . 
  the newly elected president is pro-russian of compared to the former one . 
  however as a non-professional politician and as a person without any political experience there are two possibilities : he actually gains enough political strength to distance himself from bsp and push his own ambitions , or becomes easily manipulated unnoticeable parody of president . 
  impossible . 
  add a sword as well and you 'll be fully prepared to fight for your country in the future british invasion . 
  ha ha ha , i am afraid you consider your illusions a reality . 
  first of all , brexit has n't happened yet , so nobody knows what the real impact will be . 
  second hard brexit is the only option as britain wants an access to eu market but without the four fundamental freedoms , which in this case means - no leverage to negotiate anything . 
  third , trump is a conservative isolationist and making a trade deal with him will be difficult for both , uk and eu , besides no trade deals include financial services which is a big portion of the uk export . 
  fourth , you can not compare greece and uk , the former never was a global leader , neither industrial power , the latter was all that at some point in the past , hence both countries have completely different base for their development . 
  increasing military spending got nothing to do with trump-the-clown , it was an agreement which nato countries signed more than a year ago , my guess calculations already have been considered , plus that might boost certain part of economy . 
  the migrant flow and grip on europe has generally declined and steps have been taken for expulsion of illegal immigrants . 
  calling a market comprising 450 million people ( without the uk ) and some of the biggest economies on the globe `` a toothless tiger '' is delusional . 
  and last but not least , watch out before the eu break up that uk may split up as scots ai n't happy with hard brequit . 
  britain has a secret and super classified plan to reconquest its former colonies and add new ones in order to become a global leader on trade . 
  the world must watch out !, 
  ha ... make things like that so you do n't have a deficit and turn into surplus nation . 
  nobody made germany surplus nation , it is the germans themselves that achieve it . 
  stay in your misty swamps . 
  clowns . 
  trump-the-clown will make a trade war with the rest of the world . 
  he 's trying to make the states a glorious manufacturing , trading and intellectual empire the wrong way . 
  tripe soup is actually quite delicious . 
  it is also rich in collagen . 
  squid ink in spain !, 
  in greece they cook rise with cuttlefish ink . 
  salted pig fat is also something we do have in bulgaria . 
  it is not a dish though . 
  it is their fellows that voted leave , right ? 
  now they will have to bear the consequences . 
  you sound like boris-the-clown . 
  and your troops are not much of a strength in eastern europe . 
  they have symbolic presence . 
  and if there are any dislocated in ee , it is because of nato . 
  nobody stops you to introduce 10 % corporate tax . 
  bulgaria has the same . 
  and i believe trading under the rules of wto is good enough for both sides . 
  yes , sink your savings in stocks !, 
  i think , it is good enough uk and eu to trade under the rules of wto . 
  no special deals , no exclusions , no exceptions . 
  everything will be simple and clear . 
  johnson-the-clown is yank ? 
  now that is something new lol . 
  huh ... i feel sorry for all these retirees . 
  they will have to move back to uk , and as they are old , that will put the healthcare system at pressure . 
  haha ... in fact i do use my real name . 
  so if you check on facebook . 
  you 'll find my real pictures . 
  it 's americans that have to react on that article . 
  i am tired of all that carp . 
  may warns...johnson-the-clown warns...johnson-the-clown mentions the nazi 's in regard future negotiations with eu and so on . 
  who they think they are ? 
  politicians of misty island , they have the right to warn the brits . 
  should i warn them i will knock down brits if they are arrogant enough to come across me , as i did put down two british pissheads some years ago ? 
  clowns . 
  i speak 4 languages , in both oral and written level and i use 3 alphabets for those languages without being oxford educated , and not even working with people . 
  technical stuff is my field . 
  johnson-the-clown can only warn brits as he 's in the british government . 
  how will brits react if brussels warns london about something regarding scotland ? 
  clowns . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  i know hsbc announced it 'll relocate part of its business ( i guess regarding euro clearings ) to paris . 
  will not be surprised if other banks do the same . 
  will the price rise ... have no clue . 
  euro clearings can be done only in eu member state/states . 
  so no matter what are the plans of the city of london about moving to ny , staying in london or migrating to hong kong , they will have to have branches in europe for clearings . 
  otherwise they will have to abandon that particular business . 
  johnson-the-clown can warn the brits about whatever he wants . 
  who he thinks he is to warn eu about anything ? 
  he 's a member of the british government not a member of any eu institution . 
  how on earth uk politicians will react if someone from brussels warns london about anything regarding scotland ? 
  clown . 
  say whaaaat ? 
  do we live on different planets ? 
  bulgaria built a fence all along the turkish border . 
  hungary did build fences as well . 
  greek islands were the weak point , but i assume it is quite difficult to seal off maritime border . 
  nobody stopped anybody . 
  the other weak point - italy , has the same problem as greece . 
  that may happen , and british citizens will not be feeling comfortable . 
  and i ai n't scared of brits at all , while working in the service had to put two down , it was an easy task . 
  i am not playing anything . 
  i do not have the feeling i live in any empire . 
  obviously you know something more than me . 
  so please be kind and enlighten me . 
  libertarians are lost in the current situation . 
  they support and spread in the societies completely different political values than the well established left - right political streams with all of their nuances . 
  people just trust more to previously well established political traditions and ideologies rather than encouraging drift . 
  really ? 
  since when i live in the german empire ? 
  please enlighten me , cause so far i did not know i live in any empire !, 
  in fact i 've met quite many english tourists . 
  and in my personal opinion - they are arrogant . 
  however i 've never visited england and never wanted to . 
  it is good that unemployment is at the lowest for the last 12 years . 
  it is good that the pound has gained strength . 
  it is good that britain is leaving the eu . 
  however it is not good you politicians using arrogant language regarding europe just because the average ignorant english doe feels like britain is the center of a glorious empire by such words . 
  that can trigger anti-english sentiment on the continent .

  it 's still a unique culture , with unique foods , dances and language . 
   is macedonian language a dialect of bulgarian , or is it a language of its own ? 
  is serbian a language , or a dialect ? 
  are croats and serbs two nations , or one nation ? 
  macedonian is a dialect of bulgarian . 
  serbo-croatian is one language , but four nations . 
  ( serbia , croatia , bosnia , montenegro )  which religion is the religion of the germans ? 
  which religion is french ? 
  northern germany is protestant . 
  southern germany and france is catholic , if you exclude the non-religious . 
  now that i 've answered your questions , what 's your point ? 
  identity , history , culture , tradition , dialect , religion . 
  nationalism is not pompous `` my tribe is better than yours , we do n't need you '' . 
  nationalism is love for your people , putting your people on top priority and best interest . 
  yes . 
  destroy the boogeyman that is nationalism and the nation-states , the foundation of happiness and harmony . 
  the reawakening is happening and not in the way the writer of this article wants it . 
  the european union is a failed project and many will follow britain . 
  the eu will not exist in 20 years . 
  a third of indians defecate on the streets . . 
  leftists make the argument that the refugees are potential doctors and engineers and we should let them all in . 
  he 's making fun of that . 
  thank you for your brave attempts to kill freedom of speech , eu . 
  this would never pass here and we 'd leave the eu before an atrocity like this happens . 
  the netherlands or austria is next . 
  my post is two sentences . 
  i do n't know how you managed to not understand it . 
  there would n't be a 50k + large protest for brexit if remain won . 
  funded by george soros . 
  you would not see pro-brexit protests if remain won with 52 % . 
  one of the things they did is censor freedom of speech . 
  are you advocating that ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_orthodox_church#ottoman_rule https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_christians#persecution_of_orthodox_christians_in_ottoman_empire  during and immediately after the ottoman conquest , a significant number of the bulgarian churches and monasteries south of the danube , including the patriarchal cathedral church of the holy ascension in tarnovo , were razed to the ground . 
  some of the surviving ones were converted into mosques . 
  many of the clergy were killed, 
  so your ancestors invade the balkans , enslave the people , take the women , refuse them the right to practice christianity . 
  and you have the audacity to try and claim they were oppressed . 
  meanwhile , 75 years ago ...  germany has a different mindset and legislation when it comes to free speech . 
  it may not be the best system , but it 's ours . 
  deal with it . 
  false advertising is fraud and has nothing to do with free speech . 
  the way he phrased it is as if your neighbor mitko is telling you to buy his stuff , because it cures cancer . 
  obviously if you believe him , it 's your own fault . 
  you 're saying that kind of talk should be illegal ? 
  there are none . 
  all civilized countries should have absolute free speech . 
  do you know what the words `` free speech '' mean ? 
  the right to express any opinions , without censorship . 
  this law should not pass . 
  idiotic . 
  the armenian genocide happened and it 's a tragedy , but this is a breach of free speech rights . 
  the national socialist party . 
  one can only assume . 
  thank you for your unbiased opinion , socialist spanish republic . 
   closet nazi how is this an argument ? 
  another case of `` literally hitler '' . 
   german nationalist all nationalists are nazis ? 
  by that logic all socialists are nazis since the nazis were socialist too . 
   secretly thinks epic . 
   everyone i do n't like is a nazi !, 
  it 's amazing how often i see this . 
  and what are the other steps , complaining and whining ? 
  do n't whine how everything is fucked unless you 're doing something about it . 
  no , our ancestors looked in different villages , not just our own , it 's described in a few works of literature . 
  kadyrov is making fun of him here . 
  he lost his cat a while ago and john oliver made a joke about it . 
  nobody likes a defeatist and pessimistic attitude . 
  speaking of ozil . 
  has anyone noticed how inbred this guy looks ? 
  til letting people vote on what happens to their country is cowardly . 
  if you do n't have at least a light brown tint of brown on your skin , forget it . 
  can you tell ? 
  the whole country is at an uproar and there 's protests in front of the parliament actually calling for subsidies to those who preach radical islam . 
  what do you think ? 
  anyone else remember when you did n't hear about rapes , murders and terrorist attacks monthly in germany ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npvfq_laxwy from jan. 26th . 
  make fun of the only guy who warned you about brussels just because he misspoke ... 
  because nobody knows jo cox . 
  i 'm sure calling 50-55 % of the uk dumb is going to help the remain campaign . 
  5 % of the uk is muslim . 
  christian crosses deemed provocative . 
  10 % of egypt is christian . 
  would the star and crescent be offensive and provocative in egypt by your logic ? 
  hard to believe , is n't it ? 
  how a christian cross can be considered provoking in an european majority christian country is beyond me . 
   please explain turkish political movements in bulgaria.thanks . 
  they 're turks and we do n't want turks ruling over us . 
  the bulgarian populace loves russia . 
  our leaders do n't . 
  nowadays macedonians are brainwashed bulgarians . 
  we have the same language , the same names , the same customs , traditions , dances . 
  probably not because your customs and traditions are n't that of the english . 
  they spoke greek , acted greek , wrote in greek . 
  they were greeks . 
  yep . 
  except they do n't admit it , and falsify their history by stealing some of bulgarian and greek history . 
  thanks for the non-biased opinion , sashko . 
   communism_is_cool : xxxxx, 
  you bet i 'm going to be offended when this tiny country tries to claim my country 's history . 
  he was born in the ancient kingdom of macedonia .

  jailing one person that is small fish , over something ( i do admit ) stupid , is doing nothing for me , sorry . 
  firstly , i am not entirely sure if i got it right , but if i did , i see a few problems . 
   let countries decide whether they want to add something on top of that . 
  no one is going to do that . 
  and how do you know the standarts would rise ? 
  i mean , overall it makes sence but there is no certain guarantee that it would rise . 
  i can tell you for sure that after this is voted the most poor countries would just cut heathcare funding and use the money they get from the eu to cover the cost . 
  insurence companies would not allow your plan either and most of them are very rich with big influence . 
  this wold require a lot of laws being changed and a huge synchronization of 28 countries 's hcs . 
  would take years and many goverments would be voted in and out during that time , some not agreeing with it . 
  i still think it 's a step in the right direction , do not get me wrong , but i do not forsee it happening any soon . 
   really ? 
  really ? 
  you have n't see military presence in european airports this last year ? 
  and to be honest i thought spain was safe from this since we mostly hate our military ... but on my past trip to bilbao there were army guys too . 
  it is not surprising to me in the slightlest that people who do n't travel at all are the ones most in favour of this types of restrictions . . yep , bulgaria-malta , malta-barcelona , malta-bulgaria , zero military presence isnide the airport . 
  i saw 1 military car outside the malta one once in the morning and i had no idea what it was about , they were just chiling in the car . 
  guess i do n't travel enough . 
   really ? 
  really ? 
  they 're putting people in prison now for `` offensive '' tweets about long-dead historical figures . 
  but according to you wahabi mosques are exempt from this . 
  according to me , yep , they are not closed . 
  treating the symptoms of a disease wo n't help either . 
  and it 's not a right being taken away . 
  spewing hatred is forbiden for more than a decade everywhere across the eu . 
  terrorism and the mocking of it 's victims is a kind of hate speech for me . 
   my company just forwarded an email to me about restrictions for egyptian citizens . 
  no idea on that . 
   here was talks about eu requiring visa again for american citizens . 
  irrelevant to the discussion , do n't know why you brought it up . 
  it 's because they have visa requiring to some eu nations and refuse to remove it . 
  has nothing to do with terrorism . 
   a month ago , i got a russian friend stopped at the eu border for 24h just no idea about that either . 
  probably the economic restrictions but i am not sure . 
  is it relevant to this discussion as well ? 
   where is it that you live ? 
  bulgaria . 
   because countries are not accepting them , period . 
  the ones that we accepted are gone to germany . 
  their destination even before entering europe . 
  there was an asylum center with 3k people before 3-4 years , most of them went to germany . 
  portugal wanted to accept them , no one wanted to come . 
  serbia and romania had the same idea , welfare is more important . 
  it 's on us for being worse than syria i guess . 
  your headlines are hilarious . 
  they got someone with false travel documents in the shengen area during a check . 
  geez . 
  so racist . 
  sweden had conscription until 2010 , just checked . 
  huge deal and loss of rights right here . 
  you are yet to tell me what does that have to do with this discussion . 
  it 's because of russian threat , maybe that 's why your friend got stopped as well . 
  nothing to do with terrorism . 
   this is literally a textbook example of demagoguery . 
  a word i have n't seen used in a long time ever since it became mainstream politics . 
  yes , it does sound like that , even though it was not my intention at all . 
  still think something should be done . 
  maybe stop sucking sa money and not doing anything about radical mosques rather than jailing this lone rapper that probably got the idea from somewhere * shrugs * . 
  honestly have no idea how this would work . 
  ca n't even fanthom it . 
  cross funding would require a lot of laws being changed . 
  hcss in europe on average . 
  guess i should have said it more differently . 
  do n't even know if we have union sponsored systems ? 
  i think it 's just donor cooperations between countries if i am not mistaking . 
  i thought we are talking at european level here . 
  still , european hc is one of the best around , compared to other continents , in my opinion . 
  it may require tweaking but if it was left the way it is , i woud n't complain . 
  ours is underfunded to oblivion and has it 's problems tho . 
  i am all for that by the way . 
  exept the heath system , i think it 's good enough as it is , bar the salaries . 
  how is this topic relevant to what west/russia is valuing in bulgaria at all ? 
   nah , we maintain a careful balance . 
  or we were , until erdogan . 
  turkey is not an easy country to conquer , unlike bulgaria . 
  your sentence makes no sence , sorry . 
  my second paragraph was for you to notice how rediculous you sound but i guess it did n't help in that matter . 
  last time i ever reply to you . 
  you sound more and more like a regular troll that just repeats the same thing over and over again . 
   there 's a fucking guy with machine gun groping my parts every time i try to board a flight and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  never got chekced in an airport before . 
  where do you live ? 
  last 2 flights i did n't see any guns at all to be fair . 
   the government in my own country is putting people behind bars just because of some tweets could `` enact terrorism '' and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  seems like it , 1 loner saying something radical is not stopping anyone to preach in the wahabi mosques and importing isis terrorists without checking them . 
  plus never deporting them after . 
   getting a visa is getting harder for the first time again , where do you live ? 
  and where is getting a visa harder ? 
   the geneva conventions are being regularly ignored what part of the geneva convention ? 
  the refugee one ? 
  the one that the refugees ignore themselves , become migrants and still get asylum in germany ? 
  how is it ignored ? 
   european countries now drop schengen whenever they feel like it and we 're not doing anything ? 
  you mean when they try processing people that are not eu citizens ( no shengen rules apply ) and fail at it because someone did n't close it 's border and did not apply the rules that are required when you enter shengen ? 
  sound like not doing anything to me . 
  not in time at least . 
   nord european countries are increasing military spending and some of them are bringing back conscription and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  i think they already had conscription there and increasing military spending has nothing to do with this crisis . 
   i do n't know in which world you guys live that a single lunatic yesterday is more important than the loss of rights that me , my father , and my grandfathers fought for more than a century .

  can you tell me more about your involvement in south stream , , not progressing , , - putin blamed you - there are others to blame with romanians , germans probably too and some others . 
  was n't following this in any capacity since it 's cancellation . 
  the reason why putin blamed us is most likely since there is a section of the population , that is thankfully getting smaller every year , that still falls on this man 's bullshit . 
   i think south stream was in your national interests - also it would generate money - so what changed on your side ? 
  you made deals with turks and americans ? 
  they promised you pipeline from caucasus ? 
  deals witz azeris or turkmen or promise that assad will fall and qatar pipeline will happen after all ? 
  an infringement procedure . 
  the last one costed quite a significant sum to the country and 2 of the 3 political parties in a governing coalition at that point in time would never recover from the loss of popularity they suffered . 
  ( though that was mostly because of how badly those parties were mismanaged . ), 
  also i 've seen enough evidence to say that the leadership of the russian federation would avoid making deals to a mutual benefit of both parties if it could . 
  ( trains loaded with gravy for the signatories of such agreements would undoubtedly be necessary ) . 
   i mean if you would go for it and putin/gazprom would see you are serious about south stream i doubt he will accuse you of hindering it - so there was probably some , , switch of sides , , from your side . 
  you are way too confident in the credibility of that man . 
   you do realize chairman of ec has no authority decide what is legal and what is not , right ? 
  so whatever he says , he 's just posturing . 
  because the european commission habitually starts infringement procedures without any legal basis for them . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delyan_peevski ) was the person i was talking about and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporate_commercial_bank ) was practically his bank . 
  i never asked you to guess who went bankrupt , i wanted you to guess the reason why . 
  the right answer would have been that a train loaded with gravy would n't be arriving at their offices . 
   honestly never heard that someone said south stream was illegal ... crazy and idiotic claim ... you can see a link to barosso 's speech in my reply to another guy raising the same point as you . 
  and if you would disregard the chairman of the commission 's opinion on the matter as idiotic i would like to know why . 
   i think 250 million eur was mentioned - not 500 - 250 or 200 - it was in many articles and even putin \u00b4 s words - maybe i am wrong . 
  here it is , straight from the horse 's mouth : https://www.rt.com/business/210483-putin-russia-gas-turkey/ and honestly it would n't surprise me if he had said 250 million as well . 
  like i said , putin says a lot of things . 
  :d  who yours - bulgarian magnate/politician ? 
  have no idea who really i do n't understand the meaning of this sentence fragment . 
   south stream was illegal ? 
  who said that ? 
  :d the chairman of the european comission . 
  :d  wasn \u00b4 t putin laughing how stupid are bulgarians ? 
  yeah , he said we were expected to profit from the project for half a billion euros each year . 
  strangely enough nobody has been able to find any documents supporting that number , and mr. putin himself ... let 's just say he has been know to say a lot of things . 
  :d oh , and right after the project got canceled , what was pretty much the personal bank of a media magnate/politician went bankrupt . 
  would you like to guess why ? 
  i 'm not blaming merkel for the stopping of south stream . 
  i 'm confident that she planned to profit from the project the same way bulgarian politicians did . 
  my problem is with the current commission and it 's unwillingness to enforce it 's laws . 
   we have just launched an infringement procedure against bulgaria which shows that we mean business . 
  other infringements procedures related to other countries will follow if some of the obstacles to the respect of our internal market are not removed meanwhile . 
  [ jos\u00e9 manuel dur\u00e3o barroso , chairman of the european commission ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_speech-14-430_en.htm ) a few weeks later our government , fearing a repeat of the last infringement procedure halted work on the project . 
  but if you want to , tell us about the way the us vetoed the project . 
  i 'm particularly interested in the involvement of george soros . 
  well , if south stream was illegal why is nord stream 2 legal ? 
  because angela is envious of gerhard 's retirement fund ? 
  ( and they say eastern europe was corrupt . ), 
  when he died 6 years ago the net worth of ian cameron was 2.7 million pounds . 
  the total amount of money claimed to be connected to childhood friends of the president of russia would amount to 2 billion dollars . 
  even ignoring the passage of time , putin 's panama affairs should be at least 500 times as big of a deal as cameron 's , should they not ? 
   crimea wo n't rejoin ukraine . 
  ever . 
  or until the government of what we now know as russia experiences a total collapse . 
  ( which has happened twice in the last 100 years , so it 's not that inconceivable of an idea . 
  [ in fact senior officials in the presidential administration of the russian federation have claimed that the death of the current president would hail the end of russia . 
  ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/news/article/no-putin-no-russia-says-kremlin-deputy-chief-of-staff/509981.html ) ) or do you doubt that lots of people who would normally want nothing to do with ukraine would suddenly change their minds , if staying with russia meant staying with a bankrupt , failing state ? 
  you do realize that we 're talking about thousands , probably tens of thousands of people ? 
  or do you think milosevic personally raped women and slaughtered villages ? 
  which is probably a good thing since there would be a lot more armenians around here , if turkey had never experienced the wonders of progressive nationalism . 
  conscription does n't usually involve kidnapping children . 
  and how do you intend to catch such a doctor ? 
  you ca n't just check the child to see if nothing unlawful has been done , he could always say that the circumcision must have happened after he did a checkup . 
  do you do a sting operation with circumcised babies ? 
  have a government inspector check the babies on the exit of the physician 's cabinet ? 
  and even then the parent could delay the operation until the child is , say 2 or 3 years of age , at which point children are not expected to get naked in front of medical professionals . 
   then that physicians will loose his license and be charged accordingly for obstructing the law . 
  how likely is it that law enforcement discovers the physician 's obstruction ? 
  you seem to be missing the point . 
  laws against child sexual abuse are difficult to enforce yet the situaton with them is so much more favorable than a potential law against circumcisson . 
  laws against circumcision are thus practically impossible to enforce . 
  or do you think a jewish physician will report people to the authorities for that ? 
  hell , even most ordinary physicians probably would n't do it , and the law enforcement agencies themselves will probably find it impossible to compel them to . 
  and even if they did , avoiding the atention of a country 's medical institutions is n't that difficult . 
  and finally , do you honestly believe that everything harmfulshould be proscribed , regardless of consequences . 
  let me remind you that this kind of thinking , as applied to opiates , is the major reason for the continued existence of modern organized crime . 
  need i remind you what happened when the americans tried to apply the same logic to alcohol . 
  you do realize that the only effect of that would be a more corrupt medical system , where patients with circumcision will only go to a sympathetic doctor who would n't report their crime . 
  and by the way child abuse is infact amongst the most difficult laws to enforce . 
  even though the victim of the crime may realize it 's been wronged and that there are others who would cooperate with law enforcement in the pursuit of justice ( like the family of the victim ) , most cases of sexual abuse of children that i hear of , would only become known decades after the fact . 
  the difference between domestic violence and circumcision is that in the case of circumcision the victim of the crime is exceedingly unlikely to cooperate with the authorities in any way , making the it practically impossible to enforce a law against it . 
  with domestic violence , at the very least there is some chance that the victim of the crime shall report it to the authorities . 
   although i have no idea what happened in this particular case [ according to the tva ] ( https://www.tva.com/about-tva/our-history ) itself they were founded by the government to improve the infrastructure of the region the company is named after . 
  huh , did n't know that . 
  i guess i was wrong then . 
  edit : though , does n't the tva provide some service to the public , like cheap electricity ? 
  i do n't really see any other reason for a government to own a utility company . 
  silly as it may be , my definition of civil servant seems , if nothing else than popular . 
  the tva , for example , would show up when you google `` highest paid federal employee '' ( amongst other interesting facts , for example the most highly paid pentagon official being the football coach , who also outearns the president . ), 
  gazprom-media is indirectly controlled by the russian government . 
  ( it is property of gazprombank which is itself property of gazprom . 
  the russian government owns more than half of gazprom 's shares . ), 
  most people would consider the ceo of such a company a de facto civil servant . 
  the article seems says pretty much the opposite , does it not ? 
  then how come the supply of gas from europe be so much more reliable than the one from russia ? 
  how is that relevant to the matter at hand ? 
  is the catholic church somehow opposed to women engaging in business ? 
  yes and no . 
  i can see where you are coming from , but at least here it 's usually sold to us as a measure to enforce some degree of conformity and reduce the level of alienation between ethnic groups , rather than having to do anything with the bulgarian people . 
  i do n't know if public opinion has changed recently but i do n't think i 've ever seen or heard anyone in bulgaria criticizing any turkish government 's handling of it 's kurdish separatism , so here 's that . 
  also as far as i can see around here most of the `` hardcore humanists '' ( or at least those i 've met ) here are strongly opposed to the idea of someone using ethnic identities for political gain . 
  let 's just say that some countries in the eu used to border yugoslavia , and the people in those countries naturally took note of the events that transpired there .

  take a picture of my city in the afternoon and everyone is out for coffee . 
  only the waiters/waitresses work !, 
  half of americans do n't even have passports . 
  make them get a visa and they 'll limit their holidays to canada and mexico . 
  it 's really as simple as money . 
  tourism income and business income and the mathematics of it is that more people travel from their to here than the other way around and spend more money . 
  maybe if america allowed the same visa free travel to europeans in general they would see more tourists as well as i 'm sure the same principal applies in terms of ease of entry leading to more travelers . 
  these recent terror attacks however by european citizens is n't really going to help our case . 
  i 'll have to visit sometime !, 
  never been to that part of romania . 
   you 're nice though , so i 'm not exactly upset :d the sentiment is mutual !, 
  keep riding !, 
  i am a motorcyclist , indeed . 
  adancata is a small town about 12km northwest of urzicheni on a road to ploiesti . 
  there 's a new 4km track there . 
  i go for track days and races there often . 
  actually i 'm there next weekend !, 
  a few guys from bucharest also run a track school , teaching people how to ride on the track . 
  it 's worth a visit , you may like it !, 
  but it 's super far from you !, 
  you 're closer to hungaroring . 
  is it a pleasant part of romania , satu-mare ? 
  bulgaria is trying , really hard . 
  people here are starting to take notice of the progress and want more . 
  but it 's still too often that those with money and power get away with doing whatever they want , plainly and in open for everyone to see . 
  i am ... a man . 
  though i embrace my femininity with my username , 
  while i makes business sense , perhaps , it does n't work out well for human beings . 
  we live in the light . 
  even in the age of electricity . 
  it does screw with when you want to wake up and do things and when you feel the day is done . 
  i would n't want to move bulgaria in to thecet zone . 
  mid summer sunset would be 20h and winter at 1530 . 
  that 's depressing . 
  i 'd move just for that . 
  we 'd all have to shift out day an hour earlier to get by . 
  that would still put us in a different waking time period than the rest of europe regardless of what the clock says . 
  i was also circumcised at an age old enough that i can remember parts of the experience . 
  i remember the doctors and the pain . 
  it 's actually my earliest memory . 
  i do n't think i would say no , however if i were given the choice at an older age . 
  i definitely prefer the way my penis looks to that of uncircumcised penises . 
  this is called a `` police '' force or gendarmerie at most . 
  why would you want a military which does n't leave its home borders ? 
  what would it 's purpose be ? 
  if your enemy is at your border ... you 've kind of half way failed . 
  its a senseless policy to greet your enemy only when they get to your border . 
  a common unified military can not be `` pooled '' units from separate forces . 
  this works as a coalition or alliance but has myriad issues of funding and contribution as nato does . 
  i have no issue with israel historically speaking . 
  however the current state of affairs with palestine - basically a new apartheid state , so close to europe while we all sit around staring as it happens ( again ) is despicable . 
  the arrogance of israeli politicians to think that any past or present transgressions gives them the right to stomp on others erodes at our progress in europe . 
  spot on . 
  if your knowledge matches your years of experience , you 'll find a company in europe willing to sponsor you . 
  however you might also want to try looking for a us company offering a remote position ... there are a growing number of those . 
  then your visa is based on your savings and income , not on a local job offer . 
  much lower compensation , though in comparison to germany and britain . 
  and even in those scenarios , with 20 years of experience it 'll take you a while to find a firm that could 1 . 
  pay you even 1/2 of what you 'd get in the states at a senior level , 2 . legitimately put your experience to work and 3 . present you with a challenge at the same time . 
  not saying it 's impossible , lots of startups could use senior engineers , just most ca n't afford them for very long unless results are fairly immediate . 
  multinationals - auto industry , fin tech etc , present the most sensible options for your experience and possible contribution , so i 'd say germany , britain and france in that order . 
  barcelona if you really do n't mind or can afford taking a serious pay-hit . 
  or start on your own . 
  consulting is a profitable avenue especially with the startup wave pushing forward . 
  lots of new players need the experience of a good engineer for a boost to get off of the ground , while they 'd prefer to afford engineers with 5-10 years of experience as permanent staff . 
  positioning as that guide when needed might be a option for . 
  i myself am american with 15 years of experience as a fin tech software engineer working in europe , as a point of reference to the source of my opinions . 
  as for visas -- you have the experience , in you also have the educational background , and a decent amount of savings in assessable cash , then in most cases visas are not difficult . 
  britain is an exception . 
  it 's a pain to get a visa for the u.k. 
  however elsewhere in the eu it 's a matter of money , having a job or job offer earning a given minimum ( different depending on the country ) and time in government office queues . 
  it 's possible . 
  10 % - bulgaria . 
  even cheap shitty bullets will kill when fired . 
  i do n't think putin is bluffing . 
  he just has less to lose than the rest and is ready to lose it to gain a lot more . 
  mean while the rest of us and too tied up trying to keep things the way they are . 
  i honestly feel like it 's the opposite . 
  i 've lived in the and in various countries in europe and my feeling is you 're less free to express yourself in the us , free of ridicule or disdain when your opinion differs from consensus or your way of life does n't conform to the american dream . 
  i feel the us is good at brainwashing without even realizing it . 
  politically there 's only ever two opinions . 
  socially you 're either `` in '' or `` out '' . 
  in europe i 've always felt i 'm free to be who and what i want and most people do n't give a shit . 
  part of my feeling of freedom however does come from being schooled in the us and having that mentality of `` you can do whatever you want '' engrained in me from a young age . 
  where as here in europe people do professional conform so i have a bit of an advantage as far as out of the box thinking goes just because i was taught to think elsewhere . 
  so i guess maybe ... they are n't so different and just you see and different side of the same coin ... 
  huh ? 
  what 's wrong we being polish ?? 
  sounds like you just need a hug !, 
  i 'd have to agree . 
  the u.k. 
  is n't very `` american '' at all . 
  wow . 
  that makes the world pretty small . 
  i 've lived a third of my life in places where the native language was n't my first language . 
  being confined only to what i understand , to me seems almost like self imprisonment . 
  not if you learn a few of the above subjects in your second or third language . 
  two completely different things . 
  we 're not holding millions of people of a particular group in an open air prison/zoo , in which case push back is understandable behavior from any conscious animal regardless of how hard you try to put it under your shoe , self respect mandates an attempt at reclaiming dignity . 
  i do n't think many europeans support terrorism anywhere .

  [ briefly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_enlightenment ) [ somewhat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huzkzad1xds ) [ expanded ] ( http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.bg/2010/02/from-mises-to-carlyle-my-sick-journey.html?m=1 ) [ full on ] ( https://books.google.bg/books?id=-yeaaaaaiaaj&amp;pg=pa547&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ), 
  nope , not at all - constitutional monarchies are pointless . 
  i am a royalist . 
  we did no such thing . 
  a foreign controlled regime tried doing that which was at that same time opressing the entire bulgarian population as well and more than eagerly de-bulgarizing the region of macedonia . 
  the same people who tried to expell the turks had already actively participated in the ethnic cleansing of the bulgarians in macedonia or forced the bulgairans in pirin region to identify as `` macedonians '' in the national census . 
  all of this they did with the agreement or direct orders from the kremlin . 
  so no , the bulgarian nation did no such thing to the turks , in fact when the bulgarian nation was independent for decades after 1878 it did not kill or opress its turkish minority but leave it completely alone , with turkish volunteers even fighting in our army in the balkan wars against the ottoman empire . 
  the bulgairan people were extremely tolerant of their minorities and even protective , saving its jewish and gypsie populations in the second world war . 
  there is no historic bulgarian guilt to answer for , only communist one of the kremlin lackeys , who were openly repressing bulgarian nationhood as well during that in many parts whilst preaching marxist internationalism , so can hardly be called bulgarians . . 
  what you read . 
  only if it is a right-wing , national-capitalist absolute monarchy with all fundamental mechanisms of universal democracy abolished . 
  what i told him :  which would still make the graph extremely inaccurate ? 
  by a factor of over 1400 aircraft , or more than all of europe combined . 
  by being a fortress of morality and virtue on this sub . 
  which would still make the graph extremely inaccurate ? 
  by a factor of over 1400 aircraft , or more than all of europe combined . 
  a highly incorrect map . 
  the us alone has more than 10,000 combat aircraft across its various military branches . 
  this here , i believe , is only the number of aircraft within the air force of each country . 
  mind you , the second largest concentration of combat aircraft in the world after the us air force is ... the us navy . 
  then russia , and then on 4th place ... the us army . 
  each branch of the us armed forces has at least 3000 combat aircraft , so the above number is ridiculous . 
  [ some details ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=united-states-of-america ) : * total aicraft : 13,444 * * fighters/interceptors : 2,308 * * fixed-wing attack aircraft : 2,785 * * transport aircraft : 5,739 * * trainer aircraft : 2771 * * helicopters : 6,084 * * attack helicopters : 957 *, 
  no , it is n't anywhere near 99 % . 
  read the actual and official lists of each party with exact numbers of ds agents or party officials . 
  these are open and you can see the reality is far from such . 
  russian sanctions barely touch the bulgarian economy . 
  karakachanov is an old communist whore who worked as an agent for the security services of the regime , within the ideological censorship bureau under the pseudonym ivan . 
  he is as much a corrupt bitch as the rest . 
  from the coalition of nationalists i personally would put valeri simeonov as the least compromised and the most anti-kremlin one . 
  you and others seem to have misunderstood this statement of mine as meaning there were turks in both yugoslavia and bulgarian and they were n't killed in the latter but were in the former . 
  no , what i meant is there were no paramiliatries killing our minority here ( the turks ) , but there were such paramiliatries killing them ( the minorities ) in yugoslavia . 
  ( serb minority in kosovo or bosnia , bosniak minority in parts of bosnia , croat minority etc. ), 
  i did n't claim there were turks in yugo . 
  no , that is not what i meant , i meant they had paramilitaries that went to kill their minorities whereas we never had such . 
  the serbs , bosniaks , croats and albanians all formed paramilitaries who went to kill or deport communities of the other ethnic groups . 
  some of these paramilitaries are still active today . 
  ( namely the albanian ones ) we never saw anything remotely so in bulgaria . 
  ukraine had a political establishment which was openly pro-kremlin in its geo-political and economic orientation , to the point their broke the ascenscion talks with the eu . 
  if we have a bsp/dps government we will get the same , even though breaking with the eu i believe is impossible , encumbering the state with a complete economic dependence on russia , its energy and its political money is entirely possible . 
  just like ukraine was . 
  you have wilfully and gladly drank the western-leftist kool aid of `` white-guilt '' and `` everything is our fault '' . 
  bulgaria has not had any repressive , any anti-turkish measures in the past 25 years , on the contrary - we avoided any yugoslav style cleansing or war . 
  at no point did bulgarian paramilitaries go to kill the turks like they did in yugoslavia . 
  we forbid them nothing - not to have their own turkish news , turkish schools , turkish political party even . 
  in fact they have a special treatment with the tobacco subsidies from the sate which is entirely uneconomic and drains the budget for no other reason but to keep their regions producing tobacco . 
  to claim bulgaria has forced them towards ethnic parties is pathetic left-wing self-flaggelation . 
  `` it 's always our fault others do n't like us '' . 
  the turkish vote was centralized immediately - from the very start and remains so . 
  it is their own fault they segregate themselves in communities entirely controlled by the mafia structure that is dps . 
  they need to fight against it , not us . 
  how exactly is `` camaraderie and fraternity '' going to free entire regions which are under the economic and social control of dps is a delusion within your head and nothing to do with reality . 
  stop parroting the western leftist who treat minorities as children that must be pampered and never held accountable or responsible for their own conditions . 
  * the party of kremlin here - the socialists bsp , ** doubled ** their voters in this election , after they elected their own president last year , who openly advocates for the kremlin . 
  their party was under 19 % last time and almost hit 30 % this time , second largest only 2 % behind the winners gerb . 
  there is a real and threatening pro-kremlin surge here but the ostriches with their heads in the sand want to announce victory because the putinists are barely 2 % away from being fist party , after doubling their votes and electing the new president . 
  pathetic . 
  this is time to act before we are a new ukraine of janukowicz , not celebrate you fucking morons . 
  ahmed dogan leading dps , ya know , the russian agent who openly defended russia in a public letter as the proper geo-political orientation of bulgaria ? 
  the one who lives in palaces built in illegal lukoil enclaved on the seaside ? 
  for the russian influence in bulgaria volen is a cheap clown , dogan is the expensive viceroy and true connection , so think again if russian influence is your big problem with those parties . 
  are nationalists worst than the ethnic-turkish parties ? 
  you seem to the ignore the reality that extremism is not persecuted or silenced in the west when it is left-wing or marxist , only when it is right wing , hence the invalidity of your argument `` europe '' silences extremism and hate . 
  no it does n't . 
  i have been personally taught hatred and extremism from left wing teachers and professors at both universities i attended in europe . 
  and seen this hatred and extremism freely expressed on campus and in your media . 
  stop prenteding hatred and extremism are not ok in europe , they are - when they are left wing . 
  they are n't only when they are right wing . 
   expressions of hatred , extremism and racism are not fine . 
  you are wrong here though , objectively this is not the reality . 
  expressions of hatred and extremism are perfectly fine and tolerated all over europe . 
  i lived and studied for 4 years in the uk and 2 years in belgium . 
  only right-wing hatred and extremism are persecuted . 
  left-wing are perfectly acceptable - my own teachers at coventry university were marxists and hatred for their enemies - `` the burgeoisie '' , the `` bankers '' , the conservatives , the christians and the church , the traditionalists , the nationalists , the `` patriarchy '' , the `` class-enemy '' - hatred for those , even extremist views of violence against these , was perfectly fine . 
  it was often taught at classes , such as my classes on neo-colonialism at ku leuven or social history at cov uni . 
  in the media you can hear comedians like ricky gervaise spew hatred against christianity or christians as dumb , backwards , blind , stupid , paedophile priests etc. 
  it 's actually fashionable to do so especially among liberals and leftists . 
  but if you do even remotely the same for islam and muslims they cry `` racism '' and `` islamophobia '' just like you did here . 
  to hate with a passion people born white becacuse of their `` privilige '' or people in the middle class is normal . 
  it 's encouraged . 
  to say you do n't want mass immigration from africa or the middle east is `` racist and intolerable '' . 
  do n't pretend there is some stance in europe against `` hatred or extremism '' . 
  there is n't . 
  those are fine , as long as they are not right-wing . 
  and people like you are open about the fact truth and objective , valid information should also be censored , like you said above , based on who gives it . 
  which is not censoring hatred , it 's censoring truth for the sake of political ideologies . 
  the idea of free speech as a human right is not american . 
  it comes from the natural rights concept developed in europe by great european thinkers such as john lock , thomas paine and many others . 
  it was at the core of fundamental european events such as the french revolution or the spring of nations . 
  it is profoundly european and only adopted by the americans . 
  the `` balance '' you speak of in europe is no balance at all -- it is a growing level of left-wing censorship and persecution of right-wing ideas all across the continent which feeds the far-right and the growth of populists you can see in all major countries . 
  the left is too stupid or blind to realize they are 100 % the reason why le pen , wilders or brexit are happening . 
  those are natural response to the growing push of censorship and forceful imposition of left-wing ideas . 
  the more you push this attitude you demonstrated here yourself , the more people will be pushed to the far right . 
  yet you say `` the american way does n't work '' . 
  freedom does n't have to `` work '' -- it has to merely exist . 
  it 's an end into itself . 
  your marxist censorship is what does n't work and should be smashed . 
  same as we smashed it here in eastern europe after decades of disgusting ideological oppression .

  i like how everybody is talking about the eu as if its some outside invader . 
  it is you . 
  you are the eu . 
  you are in the parliament you have an equal representative in all the other institutions ( bar ecb and ac ) . 
  if you do n't like something then its your fault for not doing anything . 
  this is democracy , some people will always get misrepresented . 
  if you dont like it make another authoritarian dictatorship , it worked out fine the last time . 
  i am leaning towards yes on most of these except the compulsory voting and state subsidies for pps . 
  i think we need to make people more interested in voting and make it easier for them to get educated about the candidates , forcing them to vote will make a lot of people vote randomly for the person they 've heard about the most/has advertised the most . 
  and a change from 11 leva to 1 is too drastic all at once . 
  ` this will most likely increase trade and tourism whilst having almost no financial downsides , 
  its just the phonetic equivalent for the `` e '' in focker/fucker ( it actually is something between an \u044a and an a ) . 
  our `` e '' is more like the `` e '' in met . 
  its the same formula . 
  translated literary back to english it would be : meet the fockers or meet the focker family . 
  the official bulgarian translation is actually '' \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0439 \u0441\u0435 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435 '' which means meet my parents which is also nice because it is neutral in displaying how good/bad the parents actually are and the main structure of the title is preserved . 
  it is not a pun . 
  a pun requires it to mean at least two different things while sounding roughly the same . 
  it is just a quirky name , and as everybody knows what fuck means the jokey name is n't lost on anybody . 
  meet the `` family name '' aint something english speakers hear often either , when by itself without having seen or heard anything about the movie you would n't know what the movie was about at all , and thats how the movie makers decided it should be . 
  the romanian title gave out information that the movie makers didnt want to . 
  therefore its a bad translation . 
  yes it is lost but its better than creating a completely different title which has absolutely nothing to do with what the movie people wanted to show to the audience with it . 
  if the people who made the movie wanted the name to have a hint towards the general story then they would have . 
  dont go off inventing your own titles . 
  translation means translating it into another language as accurately as possible . 
  like how bloody hard is to translate `` meet the fockers '' , just do the romanian word for `` meet '' + the romanian word/s for `` the fockers '' it would probably be something like `` meet the focker family '' . 
  again if the people who made `` meet the fockers '' wanted their title to hint that the fockers are inlaws and that they are nightmarish they would have done so . 
  why is everybody so bad at translations ? 
  they were stopped at the outer european border in all cases except for greece , which as it does not border any schengen nations didnt give the migrants an opportunity to go to other eu nations undetected . 
  i dont know what to say to you either , you think schengen and freedom of movement are the same thing , you think the hungarian border with serbia was not-existent for the last time im telling you , you are just talking bs based on assumptions . 
  whether you will go and educate yourself on the issue is your own responsibility . 
  freedom of movement is not schengen hence why countries like bulgaria and romania have it whilst not being in schengen . 
  also the migrants didnt benefit at all from the lack of borders . 
  the only country that didnt manage with the influx was greece which doesnt border any schengen nations . 
  there are eu borders still , which is more economically sensible and crucial to the eu citizen 's liberties than every country having unnecessary borders . 
  and the fence wasnt necessary before the migrant crisis , hungary had a normal border with serbia . 
  you have made a bad opinion because of incorrect assumptions , you ought to use facts rather than emotions as your basis . 
  there is no problem with freedom of movement ? 
  if you mean the migrant crisis the only way for the migrants to abuse it is to somehow gain a eu nation nationality which is impossible to happen . 
  this is another issue . 
  people like you not knowing what they are talking about basing their opinions on wrong assumptions . 
  them being angry about every legislature that gets passed in the parliament that affects them ? 
  also their disagreement with freedom of movement . 
  the only way the uk is harming the eu is with its euroscepticism . 
  the relationship is only dysfunctional because the eu is a democratic union while the uk wants to be completely in charge . 
  i still dont think there are any valid reasons for the uk to wish to leave , their reasons stem from nationalistic ideals and xenophobia . 
  [ this website ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/overseastradestatistics/pages/eu_and_non-eu_data.aspx ) says its 47 % exports and 52 % imports where the values were taken at the end of 2015 . 
  either way my point stands . 
  i 'm sure palau will be fine with a brexit . 
  from what i understand the brexit will also force them leave any economical treaties and agreements attached and run by the eu . 
  it is for the best of both sides that as many of them are re-instated as fast as possible but it will cost us and them by the time its done . 
  so a brexit will hurt both sides , but the eu is what like 50 % of the uk 's exports and imports , while the uk is not as important for eu trade . 
  nah its mostly because the western countries are giving us a shit tonne of money and support . 
  and it makes sense since it much easier and cheaper to develop poor nations than to make developed countries even more developed . 
  also muslim migrants , most of them are being kept in refugee centers , they will either find a good paying job or be deported in some time . 
  the eu has come up with several decision in regards to the migrant crisis , the problem is : 1 . 
  the relocation program the juncker commission created is infective until something is done to curb the influx . 
  they are trying to find a way to curb it now , while they should have done the opposite - curb influx first , then deal with migrants in europe . 
  due to the uncentralized nature of the eu , it takes ages for anything to be done due to the wants and needs of 28 different political entities . 
  so there are in general issues with the eu idea . 
  it is too weak to do anything fast , therefore ineffective decisions take ages to reform . 
  but then there is the idea of a `` ever closer union '' which if followed will make the eu stronger , and therefore minimize the issues of a political union without federalization . 
  i dont think the eu idea is flawed , it is just currently at an awkward position where it is weaker than people think therefore blame it when it does not do things up to their expectations, 
  then people should base their arguments on that instead of participating in the `` eu sux '' circlejerk . 
  its like people blaming merkel for the relocation policy . 
  most people dont understand what is happening and are blaring out euro-sceptic bs at every opportunity . 
  my point was that when your government makes a mistake you blame the person responsible . 
  when the eu makes a mistake everybody blames it as an ideology . 
  yeah i have n't been happy with the bulgarian government recently either . 
  lets scrap the government , its obviously too weak to lead or to do anything about the situation in the country . 
  its obviously not that the people in it are doing dumb things , its the whole system overall thats flawed . 
  i too support a two speed eu , but not the one that cameron proposed . 
  freedom of movement , taxes and all inner european policies should remain . 
  what we can remove is the political and legislative ties which i think is what most brits have an issue with . 
  this way the eurosceptic nations can stay behind while the rest of the union works towards a federal and centralized government . 
  i was looking at the budget per country on wikipedia , which would be revenue ( + loans ) yes . 
  there it said it was $ 85bn which is about the same as 70 bn euros . 
  10.6 bln is a little over 15 % of your budget . 
  no this is straight up money . 
  as you see in the other half of the title poland has already allocated 80 % of that for infrastructure work . 
  also about the 10.6 bn it was my mistake i was making it into 10s of billions like in the data for the budget . 
  its about $ 135bn and $ 850bn budget . 
   as in the past , poland will be the largest beneficiary of eu funds . 
  our country will get eur 106bn, 
  i converted the euros to $ before comparing , it comes up to 14 % . 
  the link i sourced is from the world bank which is pretty reputable and it shows different values from your chart . 
  the only relevant growth before joining the eu was from the early to mid nineties which is basically the country entering the capitalist world , most ( if not all ) ex communist countries experienced such a growth . 
  [ eu funds 2015 ] ( http://polska.pl/en/business-science/investments-projects/eu-funds-poland/ ) are 10.6 bn in eur and poland budget is $ 85bn ( based on wiki ) . 
  budget is budget if eu didnt give you the money you would have to spend it from your own pocket . 
  and no , [ it wasnt growing faster ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg?page=2 ) before the eu . 
  yep , these rankings never take into account the level of industrialization of the country . 
  the uk , france , germany can be the second , third and fourth strongest militaries in the world in like 5 years if they wanted to . 
  if there were war western europe and the usa ( plus other westernised nations ) could just out-produce the rest of the world easily . 
  yeah i personally think poland is weaker than germany . 
  but there are some sources like [ the business insider ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-worlds-20-strongest-militaries-ranked-2015-9 ) who rank them as stronger . 
  yeah they are rapidly expanding their military . 
  their economy is growing extremely fast thanks to the eu ( 15 % of budget is eu funds ) and are able to allocate more funds to their military which they justify with russia 's actions in the past several years . 
  also their gdp is not that bad gdp ppp is almost 1 trillion . 
  spain 's is 1.5 trillion .

  bars are alright , but if you could , * do * avoid the ones with chalga/pop-folk music as it 's rather bad , especially to the ears of a foreigner . 
  pretty much every resort has bars/clubs that get filled with young people during the summer . 
  there are also , of course , beach parties that are super wild sometimes . 
  well , yes , they kinda look like that . 
  here 's an [ example ] ( http://www.faktor.bg/uploads/images/nekrolog_kova4ki.jpg ) . 
  they probably took more money from you , because you were a foreigner , which still happens ( more specifically by taxi drivers ) . 
  not saying that sozopol or nessebar do n't have fascinating old towns , but the one in plovdiv is really great . 
  you can take a bus from burgas to plovdiv . 
  the trip should be around 3-4 hours . 
  aslo , since the city will be european capital of culture in 2019 , there 's a lot of events hapening each day/week/month , especially in kapana ( the cultural/artsy district next to the old town ) . 
  you can check the schedule here http://www.visitplovdiv.com/en/eventsplovdiv . 
  you can start with a [ free plovdiv tour ] as your introduction to the city . 
  if you come around 11th-12th of september , you can go on the [ night of museums and galleries ] ( http://www.night.bg/blog/?cat=60 ) , about which i talked in [ this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gyke6/so_you_want_to_visit_bulgaria/cu30aiv ) . 
  you probably mean [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:obituariesonthewall.jpg ) , they 're called \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433 ( from greek \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 - dead and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 - word ) or [ obituary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obituary ) in english . 
  yes , they are still put on power poles , doors and walls . 
   acommodation for foreigners was expensive interesting . 
  how much did you have to pay back then , do you remember ? 
  if they [ had reported ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6940166/2-14082015-ap-en.pdf/660ae7cb-bb7d-4905-a78f-64034b4b659b ) them , probably yes , but until then it 's czech republic at the forefront with the numbers . 
   mama-ti-deba alternatively : maika-ti-sheiba . 
  also , if you are a special snowflake - born and raised in plovdiv , you can use * mainata-ti * . 
  translation varies by situation , but mostly it 's along the lines of `` whatever , bastard '' , `` mind your own business '' , `` fuck you '' , `` fuck your mother '' , `` bitch , bye '' and etc. 
  you can come visit my city of plovdiv on 11th-12th of september for the 11th edition of the night of museums and galleries . 
  as many as 60 000 people from the city and other places/countries walk around the museums and galleries of the city as they are open for free throughout the night ( extended in two nights since 2013 due to too many events ) . 
  the program of the night features more than 120 events like exhibitions , concerts , performances and presentations , which are held in museums , galleries , theaters , cinemas , clubs , bars , and open spaces throughout the city . 
  here 's some videos : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtj0msxaxvg&amp;list=plvcpfuhbuut9wwotjtzfxciwrt9o-acbr https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sghooizusa, 
  that 'd be unconstitional . 
  no emblems should be put on the bulgarian flag , unless it the standart of the president . 
  the flag , he placed his face on , is not official . 
  why do you think that ? 
  good for you , then !, 
  the message stays , though , for general awareness . . 
  i think they mean that by population varna has surpassed plovdiv . 
  iirc , varna city proper is 341k whereas plovdiv city proper is 335k , or something like that . 
  i could be wrong though . 
  if it 's by area/size , varna is deffinately bigger than plovdiv . 
  in that regard plovdiv is like 5th ( burgas being second and ruse being 4th ) . 
  i 'm sorry to hear about your experience . 
  and you are very right in that :  you just should n't go to sunny beach there are other , much better places in the country to spend your vacation and where young people also go . 
  sunny is not representative of the whole country . 
  it 's rather an exception . 
  as i have already wrote this in a thread in / r/bulgaria , here 's an advice for all foreigners flying to sofia :  buy ( a ) tickets for your luggage when using the metro in sofia , because there are inspectors , who just wait for foreigners not to do that and thus fine them ( 20bgn , if i 'm not mistaken , so $ 10 ) . 
  this is currently a very hot topic in the media as it was revealed that metropoliten ( the company that built , owns and manages the sofia metro ) did not bother to put such instructions in english or even a cartoon , explaining that , on the cashier desks in the metro stations . 
  so foreigners easily fall in the scam they put up . 
   can some local give some cost of things perspective ? 
  local from which part , described in the album , though ? 
  prices differ from region to region and city to city . 
  as for safety - normal alertness is recommended . 
  be aware of pickpockets in city centres and tourist resorts especially in crowded areas like buses , trains and busy streets . 
  prostitution is legal so be aware of them in ring roads . 
  carry a copy of the information pages of your passport/id at all times as proof of identity . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
   also , i want to pet that cat .

  [ eurostat has some stats on that ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshtableaction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tin00186&amp;language=en ) , however distance is not taken in consideration , because . . well , domestic trips can not always be made at such a distance ( malta comes to mind and they should n't disregarded ) . 
  the last time i was away from home for more than 5 days for persponal purposes was in 2010 as since then i usually did 1 to 3-days long vacations . 
  for example , last year i went 4 times to greece during the weekends of august ( total money spent : 4x $ 15 tickets + 4x $ 10 food and drinks = $ 100 ) . 
  this was so hard to watch !, 
  can new zealand be invited also ? 
  we wo n't require them to change their flag .

  hi , there !, 
  could you , please , pm me the details ? 
  i would like to send your friend sweets and maybe other stuff that she could possible like . 
  my mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer when she was pregnant with me . 
  despite the diagnose , she insisted on giving birth and then getting the procedure for the removal of her whole uterus including part of the vagina . 
  she 's a survivor , but there are women who would n't be as lucky as her and they should be made happy every day until the end . 
  that is why i would like to send something that could possibly put a smile on her face . 
  i live in an ( allegedly ) 8000 years old city so her not being able to come over and see all the things the city can offer entices me even more to send her something . 
  i look forward to your message !, 
  : you can try x-posting in / r/randomactsofcards ( postcard exchange etc. ), 
  or in / r/assistance ( though you ca n't ask for material items , cards requests are acceptable nonethless . . ), 
  love how we have a separate category , where are all on our own . 
  life is grey here alright . 
  next time they can put their starting point on where the average bulgarian 's satisfaction is , as in `` how much more satisfied than the average bulgarian would you say you are ? '' . 
  maybe then they 'd finally realise that legend brackets are split in equal parts , not with arbitrarily chosen difference between one another . 
  some swiss redditors have mentioned before that a low-tier job like cashiers ( at mcdonald 's , iirc ) are paid `` minimum wage '' of $ 4200 , so i 'd wager it is not . 
  ( minimum wage in quotation marks , because switzerland does n't actually have a set minimum wage ), 
   0.3 % alchohol in his blood at first i got confused as i 'm used to reading it anounced in permille , but then i remembered 1 \u2030 = 0.1 % . 
  anyway , good job on the round-up !, 
  according to the same source , [ yes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydsgsvl.jpg ) . 
   alde on the right with the blues why ? 
  they 're centrist and i would even say they 're more left-leaning than to the right . 
  and as far as my country is concerned , alde is represented by the party of the turks , which is allegedly a [ centre-left party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/movement_for_rights_and_freedoms ) . 
  the minute i read \u201e \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 `` i closed the page . 
  speculation is what that piece of article is . 
  i swear i could n't hate peevski ` s media more today than any other day of my life . 
  [ agri-food export data by member state ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/russian-import-ban/pdf/exports-data-by-ms_en.pdf ) ( very short , 5-page pdf ) has even more detailed data on what products ' exports rose or declined in each eu member state . 
  more stats can be found [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/russian-import-ban/market-data/index_en.htm ) . 
  the word \u043f\u0438\u0432\u043e also works in bulgarian . 
  in fact , a producer of beer , i.e. 
  see : http://www.pivovari.com/english/index.html ( pivovari = brewers ) also : http://www.lomskopivo.com/pages/en.php?lang=en, 
  lol not the entire bg male population . 
  i 'm inclined to believe only 50 + aged men , who have no knowledge of how a computer works , watch those channels . 
  everybody esle has the internet for that stuff .

  honestly my beef is not so much with the eu , than with the attitude people have , we will never become a good successful country if we keep on relying on others . 
  i honestly do n't know , although i 've seen a lot more positive attitude towards bulgaria from americans for some reason ... 
  again i do not represent the nation of bulgaria , these opinions are my own , and i do n't think it 's childish to want to be able to grow and develop on your own , all the successful countries went through that process , and if we want to be successful and respected we should too . 
  even so , that does not make it better , just because they mock somebody else , that has to make you feel better ? 
  i do n't think neutrality has to do with financial and economical success , well maybe partly , but theoretically you can still be poor and neutral . 
  staying somewhere we are clearly not wanted is worse i would argue , at least if we leave , we would not lose anymore respect . 
  they did share the border with nazi germany though , and that did not bother them much . 
  uhm ... what 's that suppose to mean ? 
  i would honestly vote for neutrality . 
  we should be on our own , that does not mean that we should isolate ourselves , no we can still trade , have all kinds of social , diplomatic or economic relations with the eu , russia , the us and so on , but we can still be neutral , look at switzerland and norway , they are neutral , and it 's working ok for them , they are still part of europe in the political-economical sense , they have specific trade agreements and such signed with the eu . 
  i think a setup like that could work well for bulgaria . 
   nothing personal , but that rant sounds like the outpourings of a spoiled teenager . 
  is that really how bulgaria feels , or are you just projecting ? 
  no this is just how i feel , my opinions are my own , and they do not reflect the ones of my countrymen and women . 
  also means world , but yeah . 
  i think the eu should die . 
  good riddens , the eu should die . 
  bono can shut the fuck up , and stick a potato up his irish ass . 
  i amma half-a-swede so ... 
  he is a litteral huge pussy though , i want somebody with more backbone . 
  eastern block, 
  i am not trying to troll , it 's a fact . 
  how can we overcome them , westerners are racists and hate the eastern europeans , they openly mock them and regard them as animals . 
  a union will never happen . 
  the eu would probably break apart , there is too much animosity between the east and the west and i do n't think we can go over that , as long as westerners are racists towards slavs and quite arrogant to boot . 
  and racism from the west towards the east ... 
  we do n't need a union , we can simply sign trade and political deals for the free movement of people . 
  eu is too restrictive , my country was in a union before , it did not work out , this will not work out too . 
  this is basically the west being racist and arogant towards the east and slavs in particular , we can never have a union when the east hates the west and vice versa . 
  never gon na happen . 
  yes . 
  the irony here is that they are actually doing that . 
  i hope never , and i hope the eu breaks apart soon as well . 
   they go back running to turkey good . 
  well , i think the west should spend money for the refugees , and not expect us to do so , it 's their problem . 
  much more islamic . 
  also i hope the eu breaks apart . 
  hahaha , we did not spent a dime , fuck you westerners , you will pay for everything !, 
  also , you should handle the refugee problem because that 's what you deserve . 
  now we see the true face of the greek fucks , why are we in the same union with them is beyond me , we should fucking leave . 
  thank god for the west taking hits so that we can live safely in the east . 
  i see it 's time to shit on eastern europe again , and show how the wast is superior , op you are a racist and a bigot . 
  simply i do n't want to talk to bigots that think that eastern euros are backwards rednecks . 
  fuck off you racist twat, 
  that 's why we ca n't have nice things . 
   my european friends have done a very good job of giving me an outside perspective of the real and imminent danger that trump and his facist ilk pose my country . 
  it is my intent to quickly explain my fears for you . 
  regressive detected . 
  you are racist , and completely unapologetic at that . 
  i have close friends that are gay , and they have not experienced any homophobia , both are openly gay . 
  you took your sweet time , i needed backup half an hour ago . 
  all i can say is : lol, 
  he is being racist , what else should i respond with ? 
  no , i need you to stop hating me , and stop being racist . 
  so you basically do n't care of the horrible shit you committed , not surprised actually , go salute your nazi flag please . 
  yes i have because all of you northern germanics and western germanics and so on have enslaved and oppressed my people all throughout history . 
  you are a racist imperialist , and your wealth is built on the backs of poor slavs , the word slave comes from the word slav for a reason . 
  you do realize that the word slave comes from the word slav , not to mention that you and all the german ethnics constantly enslaved and oppressed my people . 
  our end of the deal ? 
  what might that be ? 
  also i am quite angry that some racists in the west try to buy their white guilt with money and expect we all dance to their tunes . 
  slavs are a group of people characterized by similar biological and ethnic traits , and being bigoted towards them is racist , and you are racist !, 
   then what in heaven 's name would be in it for the west ? 
  is n't it bad enough that you buy our land and exploit qualified worked at three times or more less wages ? 
  political difference of thought is not an excuse for racism . 
  have you seen the comments here ? 
  well bulgaria is not russia . 
  that 's not an excuse for the blindingly obvious racism towards eastern europeans , also we have stood with the eu on every decision against russia , and we are still being perceived as scum . 
  or , maybe , just maybe , that 's reality . 
  that 's quite racist . 
  the point is , we do n't want to be in a union with them either , why would i want to be grouped with somebody who blatantly hates me . 
  we do n't want to be in a union with you too . 
  we join nothing . 
  i do n't have any problems with my neighbors , well maybe with serbia and turkey , but old quarrels die hard . 
  well they obviously hate us , do you know how many articles there are about slavs being inferior to germanic people ? 
  why should i work to prove anything , everybody deserves basic human decency . 
  every time i have said that i am from bulgaria , people from western europe look at me like i am scum . 
  i remember the dutch prime minister saying that bulgarians are rapists and murderers on dutch national television . 
  i am of swedish and bulgarian origin with some jewish in me , my girlfriend is argentinian jewish , i have many gay friends and none of them have experienced what you said , neither have i seen any persecution . 
  granted bulgaria is no czech rep. or slovakia . 
  i live in varna where there are many western european students , some of them black or brown , nobody , and i do mean fucking nobody mistreats them or beats them , or anything , we have 1.5 million tourists every year on the black sea coast from every country imaginable , nobody gives a shit if you are black or brown , or gay or trans . 
  also i do n't want to be an ally to the us or the eu . 
  do you know how poor my country is , how the fuck are we supposed to take care of refugees when our own people live in poverty ? 
  about the union , thing , maybe we should split up , if you hate us so much . 
  i do n't think we are the problem , westerners are just racist and they think we are lowlifes . 
  please no brown buffalo countrymen in the eu . 
  i am referring to cenk ugur . 
  i usually watch , last house on the right ( or something like that ... ), 
  let 's see how this new graphic can be racists towards east europeans, 
  i wish it was that easy . 
  i find it extremely satisfying , that bulgaria 's biggest and most hated enemy is getting shit from russia . 
  never trust a truk . 
  i hope russia brings down the hammer on you turks . 
  a glass crater where now turkey is would be fitting for 500 years of slavery . 
  this map is racist since again it portraits the east like rednecks and the west ubermensch as the real europeans . 
  no , it should not be based on the koran . 
  nobody watches your bullshit tv programmes , and pizza is way more famous here than kebab here . 
  basically because we are treated like second class citizens by the racist west . 
  yes , and we proud of that . 
  bulgaria should leave the eu .

  this was just shitty assumptions from the whole start wow . 
  wow , unlike this shitshow , ours was agreed from a brussels council , meaning a lot of people prepared for it . 
  not like some bravehearth stating something without thinking it trough . 
  and what does that have to do with the crisis anyway ? 
  this is not even whatabautism , just plain stupidity . 
  seriously , let 's just imagine that this thing is happening ( turks do n't get agressive please , no one is invading anything ) . 
  how do you get the idea that just these random countries are going full out against turkey , it would be a coalition between a lot of participants . 
  still no idea why anyone would be dumb enough to do it though . 
  i heard about islamic doomsday prohpecies that istanbul is going to be conquered before judgement day by the christians so there 's that . 
  maybe poland-bulgaria make it !, 
  why would bulgarians do it ? 
  guy who suggested it is polish , i would like to help tho . 
  deus vult and all . 
  would be happy with edirne and lulekburgas . 
  you see , hungary did it 's part without funding , they installed fences pretty quick when shit hit the fan . 
  no eu funding was needed . 
  as much as i know , one of the most important things when entering the shengen zone is guarding the external borders properly . 
  countries that are in the shengen therefore are required to do it in a competent matter even before entering it . 
  blaming it on proper funding and 2 countries is not an excuse ( not sure if hungary and poland would have any power to veto it if every other , as you say , voted for it ) . 
  italy and greece did n't have that much of an issue before it got exponentially bigger after people realised how easely they could reach the welfare states . 
  guess who wellcomed this with open hands . 
  problem was that no one wanted to stop it , not that they could n't . 
  because people were crying to allow them in . 
  eu can and does enfore when we are talking about shengen though . 
  no one did a damn thing . 
  we met the `` quote '' thing even before it was agreed upon . 
  and i am pretty sure serbia and macedonia got more refugees last time because our route is longer and people have problems with our border guards ( ding ding , border control working example , in case you did n't get it ) . 
  you are pretty much against refugees when you would want to go out of the eu just to not have them . 
  did n't even get your last sentence . 
  makes zero sence to me . 
  you agree with the netherlands being called nazi while your friend here is trowing everyone in jail and pushing for a death penalty at the same time . 
  edit : your `` simple '' salution is not even simple at all . 
  even if some day , god forbid people being that dumb , bulgaria leaves the eu it will take years for them to actually leave . 
  during that time refugees ( that you like soo much ) would still be coming . 
  we will be having zero trade agreements . 
  hundreds of firms who outsource in bulgaria would be made to leave because it is not a profitable enviroment anymore . 
  your `` simple '' salution would bring us back to the 90ties . 
  serbia and macedonia are not in the eu and yet refugees go there as well . 
  they also have to take them in no matter what the refugees want . 
  you gave this zero thoughts . 
  like what ? 
  remove the border and start kissing your sorry ass ? 
  i honestly have no idea what imbeciles like you expect . 
  go vote akp or dps or dost or whatever . 
  well , trowing billions to a dictator who uses everything as leverage to gain more power or just not having borders at all ( and even taking them in when they sink their own ships , lol ) proved to be way more effective . 
  i never said he 's a good guy or anything . 
  i fear he will fuck my country up while trying to suit his voterbase so i have nothing but hatred towards him . 
  it 's just that it 's nothing new and saying `` fuck erdoshit '' kind of moves the attention just towards him while previous goverments did far worse . 
  at least he tried doing something with the kurd problem . 
  and failed . 
   since the us does n't publicly call their arm in syria pkk , you may have missed that their announcement of assurances about the arms they were providing would n't be used against turkey . 
  did n't miss it . 
  it was about how they will get them back from the fighters once isis is done for ( as if that 's possible , lol ) . 
  just that it was related to the syrian branch of kurds . 
  not going to argue how related ( or if they are the same ) to pkk they are since there are people claiming a lot of things and i am far from convinced either of them are right . 
  what i am trying to say is that i did n't tie the us and their support for sdf with pkk stopping the terror in turkey . 
  guess that confirms that there are at least ** some ** talks between the groups . 
  i know this is not going to be liked but i find this kind of good since it leaves rooms for nagotiations and reason without making bloodshed one after another ( even though that legitimizes their actions in turkey which i concider acts of terror )  kurds being told to go to kurdistan etc. 
  nasty . 
  yeah , this will deffinetly happen . 
  at least they would n't have a proper reason to bomb themselves in turkey if they already establish a country since the ones not integrated and having a huge disdain towards turks would have a place to go to.kind of like what israel is to jews . 
  i think they will continue even if us allows them to form a country but some wishful thinking is always welcome . 
   http://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2016/12/istanbul-bombings-shattered-turkeys-post-coup-calm i remember reading about this . 
  forgot that it was december . 
  what a fucking sad mounth for your country . 
  i assume you are turkish by the way , from the knowledge you have about kurds . 
  if not , sorry . 
  you are one of the few i had a good conversation with . 
  so you keep saying that it 's just visegrad that has problems and discriminates towards them while the rest of europe is fine and dandy and has zero double standarts . 
  all this while you lump a group of people into one and accuse them of being hypocrites . 
  you are basically doing what you acuse central europe of . 
  having double standarts against them while completely dismissing that the whole of europe has a problem with immigrants . 
  i am done with this guy . 
  most of the me and turkey dislike us anyhow , that 's just another excuse for them to hate them even more . 
  never thought of the us intervetion in pkk 's plans though . 
  it does seem rather calm after they started to openly support kurds in syria . 
  do you think that both parties would be okay if they declared northen syria to be the kurdistan they tried to make in turkey ? 
  sort of like a middle ground in the peace talks ( they get land and get to do whatever they want inside and turkey looses none of it 's control inside it 's country ) . 
  and what terror hit in december ? 
  i remember the club shooting but i thought that was isis . 
  as much as i know pkk demands were met . 
  was n't it related with the language and how turkey forbid it being taught in schools ? 
   where have i said that it is ? 
  what was your initial comment about ? 
  who did you call hypocrites and alt-right ? 
  i do n't think he started all of this to be fiar . 
  he just continues it . 
  i doubt we will see peace between turks and kurds even if turkey does nothing against them the upcoming years . 
  tensions are high and there is a lot of grudge on both sides ( some even justified ) . 
  again not a single fact was stated . 
  you seem to just talk nonsence . 
  yet you accuse me of lacking arguments . 
  what arguments do you want against `` alt-right hypocrites ! '', 
  that countries from visegrad would not acknowledge this because it 's not a muslim that did the crime but a british-polish guy . 
  do such kidnappings happen all the time where hundreds are victims ? 
  you are comparing one case done by one polish person against organized acts done a couple of times every year . 
  and the person is even alive for god 's sake , there are no casualties . 
  seriously , you people talking about hypocricy . 
  please tell us about the hypocricy of the alt right , give us the cold truth . 
  are you saying it 's just v4 that does this ?

  lol , its the same here . 
  a lot of people from sofia love using `` the province '' . 
  well ... islam did n't exist during late antiquity . 
  it 's pretty obvious by his comment that he is talking about possible independent gibraltar . 
  do n't tell anyone i leveled that up . 
  humans seem to want things they do n't have . 
  in their case that would be poverty and misery . 
  is n't that supposed to be a romanian thing , or i have missed some prime fun ? 
  we dress sheep as hungarians ? 
  dat vlad tepes flashback . 
  scot talking about getting carried , good shit . 
  i am talking about my country i do n't know or care what you are doing in romania . 
  op was talking about bulgaria so i can talk only about the things i have experienced . 
  in my country to police does n't touch them even if they have made a crime , not to say for no reason . 
  i know you guys have some genocidal history and i guess that is the reason you still talk about it , but i can assure you its not happening in bulgaria . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porajmos as you can see . 
  we are not into burning jews or gypsies , unlike some other people . 
  what ? 
  is there supposed to be any logic in your sentence or the problem comes from your english ? 
  i guess the joke hit home . 
  please read and understand at the same time . 
  continue with the misrepresentation . 
  nobody says violence is justified you weasel . 
  once again , the violence comes only from one direction but you do n't seem to have a problem with that . 
  you keep talking how words are as bad as actions but i bet that the people who are actually suffering from the issue do n't share your opinion . 
  it 's sad that in today 's discourse the ones that play the victim are replacing the people under actual threat . 
  is this serious ? 
  holy shit . 
  you preparing for that uk visa ? 
  i guess we need to meet up , lol . 
  i also believe that a united world is the only way forward but i do n't think its going to happen in our lifetime and it seems unlikely even for the next generation . 
  damn komshu , looks like i am not the only person in our region who likes ice hockey . 
  bulgarian cuisine has no dumplings . 
  there is no such thing as slavic cuisine . 
  you are the only insane one here if you think that such organized effort exists or will ever exist . 
  like you are seriously fucking mad . 
  nobody is punishing them in any way , no vigilantes , no law , nothing . 
  there is zero violence against them , but there is quite a decent amount coming from them , especially in small town schools , because they know they can get away with it . 
  the only organized group is that of a gypsy family of 40 screaming at your door if you say to them to lower the music . 
  they are living the life and you are here moaning like a little bitch as if someone has even touched them . 
  your illusory boogeyman , simply does n't exist . 
  well i like the other seasons but the amplitude in temperature between them is problematic . 
  if it went up to like 27-30 max i would have been fine with it . 
  i am worried of people pushing false narratives . 
  while people talk about violence against gypsies , the gypsies are doing the real violence in rural towns and villages . 
  people can always be tolerant about topics who do n't concern them in a direct way . 
  i would like to put people like you just for a month in a house close to a gypsy ghetto and talk to you again . 
  you have interesting friends . 
  i mean most people would want them gone but i do n't think anyone past the nationalists thinks of genocide . 
  also , where are you from ? 
  i dislike the bulgarian weather ( the hot summer and huge differences between season ) . 
  i do n't listen to chalga ^ tm . 
  i do n't drink rakia . 
  i am not a nationalist , communist lover or follower of the boyko cult , leaving me with no political representation . 
  i do n't really care about football . 
  i am not fascinated/interested in expensive cars . 
  the pimps and the chiefs of the pickpocket gangs . 
  but even the not so rich ones drive bmws and audis in here . 
  we have some quite cancerous car culture where you drive an expensive car but ca n't afford a nice apartment . 
  all of them ? 
  i doubt it . 
  even if 10 % make it , its worth it . 
  because one million is not at all noticeable for a rich country of over 300 million . 
  not to mention that you can shoot thieves . 
  we have as many gypsies as the usa . 
  less gypsies vs no visa ? 
  it 's not even a choice !, 
  should go to sweden . 
  just a prank bro . 
  a decent amount do here , unfortunately . 
  you are out of the podium !, 
  they are populist . 
  period . 
  its laughable that you are getting downvoted . 
  bitch please . 
  i would rather prefer to not die for either but if it comes to it ( defense from an invasion or something ) i would be equally willing for both . 
  pretty much any ranking puts france ahead of the uk in military capability . 
  no need to be salty . 
  i mostly agree . 
  that is why i ca n't vote for anyone in here . 
  the thing is , i understand why some people go to the other side . 
  the truth is that the right wing did n't have to do anything to get to this point , it was all up to the complete failure of the left . 
  i do n't agree with religion either , but i understand its allure . 
  nationalism is a form of tribalism ... 
  ofc there are a lot of people who vote far right because they completely agree with everything they say . 
  but there are also people who no longer have anyone who represents them . 
  i personally do n't think i would ever vote for nationalists , but my country is not facing the same issues as some of the western ones . 
  i completely understand people who feel disconnected from both the left and the right wing . 
  i myself am such case . 
  i consider myself a social-democrat but there is simply no party that fits my worldview in bulgaria . 
  there is no way i would vote for the communist leftovers who love putin or for the corporate mafia which we call centre-right in here . 
  when the left stops caring about the native population , where do you go ? 
  its quite sad that you think you are refuting any of his points . 
  he does n't say that the terrorist are n't responsible for their actions . 
  they are by far the most important factor . 
  he is saying that liberal policy is what helped them to get to france in first place and as such the french establishment shares part of the responsibility . 
  its `` i do n't know how to answer '' , basically the i do n't care option . 
  as far as i know no . 
  because it is actually a great beer . 
  someone czech can answer better but i think they like it .

  here are some sources that show that they have over 90 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usage_share_of_operating_systems  even if it still is 90 % for traditional desktops - those are also declining in favor of newer form factors . 
  who cares if ms has a monopoly on desktop computers if 50 % of personal computing happens on other devices ? 
  this 50 % of personal computing consists primarily of running fart apps and other not-very constructive work . 
  for actually creating stuff , you still need a desktop in most cases . 
  so , i care . 
   google docs does n't run locally , but that does n't make it a very different product . 
  both are offices suites , and as long as they work reliably the majority of people do n't care if it runs locally or hosted . 
  i 'd even go so far to say that in the future ( note : personal opinion ) , locally installed ms office is going to die , replaced by office 365 ( online ) , google docs , or whatever other online suite comes up . 
  i and many other people who do n't want to share their documents with the nsa and google think these are very different products . 
  having your documents up on google 's cloud is even worse than using ms office as far as i am concerned . 
   and you just ignored half of my argument . 
  not , really , same goes for business . 
  moving away from microsoft is far more difficult than moving away from google . 
   switching to openoffice is no problem at all for most home users . 
  lol ok . have you actually tried doing so ? 
  hell , i 've been on linux for over 5 years and i still have to use ms office every now and then both at home and at work . 
  and i am a phd student and most of my documents and other people 's documents i work with are on latex  but can i run skydrive on google.com ? 
  can i use openstreetmaps ? 
  can i get stuff recommended my friedns liked on facebook instead of google + ? 
  that 's like saying `` can i use linux on windows '' . 
  it 's just dumb , these are competing services offered by different websites . 
   which other tool gives you information about what 90 % of the people are searching out there ? 
  show you which search term go them to you website ? 
  how likely they are to land on your site when looking for that term and not on your competitors website ? 
  it is n't , but still holds a monopoly . 
  i see it very differently . 
  moving away from google is far easier than moving away from microsoft . 
  for home users , it only takes a few clicks to change your default search engine , email provider and other online services . 
  changing your operating system and all programs that you use is far more complicated and you ca n't even do it in many cases . 
  i know this quite well as i have been running linux for over 5 years now . 
  moving away from windows is simply not feasible for many use cases . 
  also , there are plenty of analytics and advertising solutions that do n't rely on google at all . 
  you certainly do n't have to use anything google offers to compete online . 
   i think it 's debatable if microsoft still holds a monopoly . 
  let 's look at operating systems : even if you only regard traditional pcs , microsoft is getting under pressure with macos and chromeos they still have over 90 % of the share of desktop operating systems which i think qualifies for a monopoly . 
  also , chromeos is a joke , it 's not putting any pressure on windows . 
  ms office is still the dominant office suite . 
  the ooxml fiasco that microsoft pulled certainly did n't help with establishing open standards so that we can move away from vendor controlled formats . 
  google docs is a very different product , it 's not an office suite that runs on your computer , but on google 's servers . 
  if we will be breaking up monopolists , do n't forget microsoft . 
  but of course , this is just populist bs . 
  he was talking about a specific event which just makes the current government look bad . 
  that 's his job , to report news , regardless of which party will look bad . 
  he was telling his editors to seek people for comment . 
  who the fuck do you think that guy is ? 
  he does n't have the power to tell what ambadassadors and the european comission say on the matter . 
   the leaked letters were advising his journalists to trash the government over anything energy related and call barroso 's office for comment that can be used against the government . 
  it 's a single leaked email , not letters and it does n't say that . 
  i 've read it . 
   if you go back and read some older euractiv artices about bulgaria you will see that it 's always dnevnik and kapital that shit on the whole country in order to get political gains against the bsp . 
  this is why they used the picture of volen siderov in this article . 
  they are sister organisations . 
  that 's why they link to dnevnik all the time . 
  they are just reporting on the news . 
  the bsp are just embarassing themselves on their own . 
  just reporting the news is enough to realise how incompetent they are . 
  dnevnik is by far the best and most objective news organisation in the country . 
   they makes the whole country look like assholes infront of the eu . 
  no , that 's the government that does it , not the media who is reporting facts . 
  i do n't see the big deal really . 
  as the article points out , 40 % want to stay in the eu and the country is one of the most pro-eu countries in the union . 
  it 's mostly old people who are notalgic over the `` goold old communist times '' which were n't so good , but hey , they were young back then . 
  yeah , that guy is just repeating what sergei stanishev ( leader of ruling bsp party ) was saying , which makes no sense anyway . 
  he paints ivo prokopiev as some sort of mastermind which has political influence over the two major right parties and structures in government . 
  that 's just batshit insanse . 
  also , notice how there are never any leaks incriminating the bsp of anything , but there are always leaks before elections whose purpose is to undermine the other parties . 
  they have learned a thing or two from their communist past . 
  his `` action plan '' was telling his editors to look into stuff so they can report on them . 
  his email servers got hacked by someone who leaked the information . 
  it was the ruling party ( bsp ) who came up with the nonsense that he is colluding with the opposition , which ca n't do anything anyway . 
  it 's just typical bsp bullshit . 
  plus , that guy is nowhere near oligarch level anyway . 
  american imperialism etc. 
  these are not `` separatists '' , they are `` activists '' . 
  we do n't want to use bad words . 
  absolutely disgusting and fucking cheap ~ ~ russian ~ ~ soviet propaganda . 
  the soviets `` liberated '' bulgaria from a democratic government , despite the fact that the country has never been in war or fought ** any battles ** against the soviet union . 
  but fuck it , why not . 
  said communist regime then murdered far more people and opressed far more people than the previous government who were colluding with the nazis ( which were overthrawn before the soviets arrived ) . 
  so , thanks , but no thanks . 
  also , you have to be a monumental moron to be thankful to the soviets . 
  they only occupied , they did n't liberate shit all over europe . 
  and they were allies wth the nazis at the beginning of the war . 
  a lot of communists like to ignore that part . 
  those are mostly communists , old people who are nostalgic over the past and retards who actually believe the soviet union liberated bulgaria from something . 
  the good news is that all groups are decreasing . 
  corporations and governments do n't care about protecting your information . 
  a political solution will not happen . 
  it 's been almost a year after the spying revelations and what has the eu done ? 
  jack shit . 
  you have to protect your data yourself , nobody else is going to do it ( if you care about it in the first place anyway ) . 
  he testified in front of the european parliament several weeks ago . 
  he could do it again if he is a free man . 
  he ca n't do it if he is in a supermax prison in america . 
  obviously , the american government cares about such stuff . 
  that 's how i imagine it as well . 
  given the current circumstances , putin can just trade him in anyway in return for easing off some of the sactions that the us are/will be imposing . 
  it definitely sucks to be snowden these days , living in such uncertainty . 
  is this one of those `` self-organised local militia defnese force '' or something again , just like in crimea ? 
  i suspect this is what putin wants you to believe .

  it 's the same in bulgaria , and for similar reasons -- in a developing economy you do n't have a safe `` base '' of highly-paid workers you can tax . 
  you also have weaker institutions making tax collection harder at higher levels . 
  thirdly , both countries have pretty low levels of inequality and do n't really need to do wealth redistribution in huge amount . 
  the event has 1k `` going '' but from the looks of it it was closer to 200-300 . 
  the event was organised on facebook and the admins are bulgarian . 
  a few anticorruption parties also participated ( this photo is taken from `` da , bulgaria !, 
  '' - s facebook page ) . 
  unfortunately all comments containing links to facebook get autodeleted so i ca n't share it here :(, 
  eastern europe would still be poorer on average if communism never happened , but the gap would be far less stark . 
  for example , look at ireland , which had half the gdp/capita of the uk back then , and is way ahead now . 
  or scandinavia , which went from somewhat poor to very rich . 
  the protest took place today at 5 pm next to the romanian embassy in sofia . 
  the protest took place today at 5 pm next to the romanian embassy in sofia . 
  more photos [ here ] ( https://www.facebook.com/dabulgaria.bg/posts/1673289706297104 ) . 
  we have a few of those anticorruption parties . 
  they will be lucky if they get a combined 10 % share in the next elections , and probably none will pass the threshold , because in bulgaria populism wins the day , as most people do n't care about anyone else but themselves and their immediate family . 
   they should all be doing 4 % or more to converge with western europe and yet not a single one of them are . 
  well , what you really care about is gdp per capita which is growing faster as eastern countries have lower population growth . 
  it looks like the majority of eu eastern europe has managed to avoid it already . 
  let 's hope we do too . 
  i agree . 
  location is a big factor . 
  russia also has a powerful oligarchy which a big chunk of the gdp is funneled into . 
  ditto for productivity . 
  the vast majority of your consumption is not iphones . 
  a smartphone is a once-in-a-year buy , and that 's stretching it . 
  no definition is perfect . 
  productivity and income correlate strongly , but yeah , you 're right . 
  i do n't think russia is catching up to latvia in any meaningful way . 
  once you include inequality , they are much worse off still . 
  the average russian is poorer than the average latvian , even if the per capita figures point toward the opposite . 
  as you can see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality#/media/file:2014_gini_index_world_map,_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg ) latvia is much more equal than russia , which more than makes up for the small difference in the per capita gdp . 
  nominal gdp per capita is nearly useless for country-to-country comparison as it does n't take local prices into account . 
  therefore it does not at all reflect quality of life . 
  ppp is an adjustment that 's done according to the price to a whole basket of goods and services . 
  it has ( almost ) nothing to do with inflation ( which is roughly uniform across the eu anyway ) . 
  it means exactly that , if we define `` richness '' as local purchasing power . 
  if a romanian lived in south italy with their romanian income , yes , they would be poorer , but that is largely irrelevant for estimating the quality of life . 
  curiously , even though we 're the poster boys , we 've experienced a fairly robust growth nonetheless ( especially romania ) , in contrast with croatia which has pretty much stagnated . 
  i feel there are other factors in play here , not just corruption . 
  check out [ this article ] ( http://voxeu.org/article/how-rich-nations-benefit-eu-membership ) for a fairly thorough analysis . 
  it 's \u0432\u0430\u0434\u0430 , not \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 , which means a small stream . 
  brook seemed like an appropriate translation . 
  should have mentioned i was n't aiming to be 100 % factual , i guess . 
  also , \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430 indeed comes from bulgarian and not russian and means `` pretty '' . 
  i checked this one :d, 
  they have a ridiculously tiny ( in a good way ) central government , which probably helps a lot . 
  a lot of power is delegated to the cantons . 
  also , no state healthcare -- it 's all private health insurance . 
  no , i was quoting the nominal gdp/capita for 2015 . 
  at ppp it 's lower , at about 39k , but i agree that it 's not very relevant . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-per-capita-ppp ), 
  i think we should encourage them to take education more seriously so their kids can grow up to become productive citizens . 
  we are never going to solve the vast wealth gap otherwise . 
  it looks they have rather [ harsh taxes ] ( http://www.worldwide-tax.com/slovenia/slovenia_tax.asp ) . 
  `` general government spending generally consists of central , state and local governments , and social security funds . '', 
  [ oecd ] ( https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-spending.htm ), 
  uks gdp per capita is not 45k ( was 41k in 2015 , but it will drop like a rock in 2016 because of the fall in the pound ) . 
  the gypsy minority - pretty much so . 
  but after the mating period is over they leave for western europe with their kids so all that sweet growth is wasted :(, 
  the bulgarian president has very limited powers . 
  i am sure he wants a bulgarian space program too . 
  indeed . 
  i 'm worried about the parliamentary elections later this year though - a bsp majority would be a disaster . 
  for one , poland mysteriously did n't get seriously affected by the great recession . 
  they did n't experience a single quarter of negative growth . 
  i still wonder * how * they managed it , but the result is that they retained their previous growth , while most other ee countries had 1-2 `` lost '' years . 
  in most of london , water is really hard ( as in , has a lot of mineral content ) . 
  this makes it taste bad , but it 's perfectly drinkable . 
  just ruins your washing machine , 
  do n't be silly . 
  how can there be weather in a place that 's not real ? 
  the author mentions on his facebook page that he uses dji phantom 4 pro . 
  does that help ? 
  i loved the idea , sadly [ my photoshop skills are n't exactly top notch ... ] ( https://s28.postimg.org/jotpku4rh/attack_on_sofia.png ), 
  spain and romania both speak romance languages , both are predominantly christian , both used to be part of the roman empire . 
  that 's quite a bit of things in common . 
  yup , [ they are quite beyond ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/russland_topo.png/1920px-russland_topo.png ) the caspian sea . 
  among bulgarians it 's popular to diss our country for everything , but highways are something we have been doing pretty well at . 
  we actually have more highways/person than poland ( 85km vs 112km per million ) , and a lot are in construction . 
  i do n't consider that too bad , taking into account the difficult terrain in many places . 
  sure , and their highways probably took more effort to build , too . 
  to be fair , it 's much harder to build highways in bulgaria . 
  like 50 % of the country is mountains . 
  poland is really flat , on the other hand . 
  edit , because downvotes , here is a comparison : [ poland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/polska_relief.jpg ) , [ bulgaria ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/bulgarien_en.png ),

  i do n't think we have people who speak pure serbian as their first language , however , we have a bunch of areas in the west with the [ torlakian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torlakian_dialect ) dialect , which is between serbian and bulgarian . 
  as a bulgarian , it 's not hard to understand most south slavic languages , as well as russian . 
  speak , not so much . 
  keep in mind this study is based on self-reported fluency , so it 's to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  i am by no means denying the * possibility * , but : * romanian language back in the early middle ages was probably significantly different than modern romanian , and it 's hard to draw conclusions without looking at the version of romanian that existed back then . 
  modern romanian has been influenced by slavic and hungarian too much to definitively dismiss a slavic or hungarian source for `` cr\u0103ciun '' . 
  * it is just as possible that bulgarian received the word from one of the other romanised tribes in the bulgarian state , or byzantium , or even through knyaz boris ' brief flirtation with rome . 
  it 's hard to say . 
  edit : formatting . 
  i suppose it 's entirely possible that a large christian minority existed in romania since long before official christianisation took place . 
  but along that line of thought , the same phenomenon could have given rise to the latin-derived term for christmas in bulgaria . 
  the bulgarian state encompassed a diverse range of people , some of which , for example the thracians , were probably romanised to an extent .

  it looks like the turkish policy is now shifting back to being friendly with assad at the expense of its alliance with the united states . 
  in fact some speculate that the coup in turkey was intended to punish erdogan for betraying the us in syria . 
  tl ; dr erdogan was allies with assad at first , it was the usa who convinced him to attack by giving assurances that they would help remove assad from power . 
   a european energy would be more about reducing the overall dependence from russian gas . 
  and how does nord stream help that ? 
  to me integrated means somebody who follows the law of the country , speaks the language properly , has a job , and pays taxes . 
  it does not mean that the person must completely abandon their ethnic identity and become an austrian . 
  erdogan claims that france suspended it too under article 15 , and that it is legal for turkey to suspend it too . 
  how much truth is there to that ? 
  if the ttip passes expect these cases to become even more common . 
  that treaty has the most draconian copyright and patent laws as of yet . 
   nt belongs to the gulen cult . 
  how do you know that ? 
  i guess power does indeed corrupt people . 
  sadly it looks like turkey is going back to the middle ages . 
  most turks in bulgaria are not fans of erdogan though . 
  at least my immediate surrounding is n't . 
  i thought i was posting on / r/turkey . 
  for a canadian he sure does post a lot pro-serb propaganda . 
  well , there is a propaganda war going on , and in the fog of that war it is sometimes difficult to discern the truth . 
  there is also quite a lot of video evidence of the excesses that the coup plotters have engaged in against the civilian population . 
  he is just sacrificing the pilot to mend his ties with putin . 
  if any soldier fights for erdogan after this , he would be a fool . 
  it is run by a serbian nationalists who hates the us and turkey . 
  rt - trying to stoke ethnic/racial tension everywhere . 
  apparently erdogan just arrested those pilots accusing them of being part of the coup . 
  yeah , but i 've never heard my grandparents , who were quite religious , use it except in prayer . 
  when used for political purposes ( like the case above ) that phrase is usually associated with salafists . 
  it is similar to how after ww2 many germans stopped using the name adolf for newborns . 
  when something is constantly associated with evil acts , then its reputation is irreversibly damaged by association . 
  not all adolfs were as bad as hitler , but the actions of one were enough to tarnish the name forever . 
  similarly the phrase allahu ekber has been damaged by its association with isis . 
  you can not really change that . 
  if religious turks were worried about that then they should have adopted a more hard-line approach against isis using that phrase rather than adopting it as their rallying call . 
  yes , but is allahu ekber really a turkish thing ? 
  i thought it was mostly an arab thing . 
  your video shows turkish soldiers calling the name of allah , but they are not shouting allahu ekber . 
  see my edit . 
  so are you saying that gulen was not responsible for this coup ? 
  if not him , then who was ? 
  the beheading story was shown to be a fabrication .

  the us is harboring and protecting a man who is the mastermind of a coup de etat in turkey . 
  hundreds of people have died . 
  that is not a conspiracy theory !, 
  enough said . 
  it is a testament to the determination of the turkish people to protect their country that it did not . 
   you actually believe that ? 
  it does not really matter what i believe . 
  the fact is that the overwhelming majority of people in turkey believe that - even the secularist believe that . 
   enjoy the middle eastern islamist experience bud . 
  as if gulen , the man behind the coup , is not a radical islamists preacher . 
  he is just the variety that the cia likes and supports . 
  what does this have to do with jews ? 
  gulen is a radical islamic mullah . 
  gulen is the head of an organization that is considered a terror group in turkey . 
  to compare that cia backed mullah to the pope is a joke . 
  i would compare him to bin laden . 
  [ top turkish commander 's aide admits allegiance to g\u00fclenists ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/top-turkish-commanders-aide-admits-allegiance-to-gulenists-.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=101851&amp;newscatid=341 ), 
  except that he is the head and mastermind of an organization which has branches all over the world and manages millions of dollars in education and other activities . 
  i am curious then . 
  in your expert assessment who was behind this coup ? 
  i mean somebody must have done it . 
  and yet blaming erdogan for a coup that saw his own people killed , his own parliament bombed , and some of his close allies murdered , is not tinfoil conspiracy nonsense ? 
  then who is fetullah gulen and why is he harbored in the us ? 
  who funds him , and where does he get the money to run all these schools ? 
  how did he build all these huge compounds and palaces that he lives in ? 
  i doubt it . 
  turkey is not some latin american or african country . 
  if all the coup plotters were members of his organization , then what kind of evidence would you need to implicate him ? 
  that would be like saying that after 9/11 there was no evidence bin laden was involved despite the fact that all the terrorists were members of his organization . 
  to be honest , your country does not look very round to me . 
  the reason why the gulen issue is so sensitive in the west is also because it could directly imply american culpability in this failed coup as gulen himself is based in the us . 
  who funds him ? 
  where does he get all his money from ? 
  does the us protect him ? 
  because back then gulen and erdogan were allies . 
  the irony in the case of erdogan is that the gulen movement helped him come to power against kemalist opposition . 
  now he calls them terrorists . 
  was he not aware that they were terrorists back when they were helping him ? 
  do you think the nsa does not have such lists in the west already ? 
  in fact , i bet it has far more intimate information about the population . 
  erdogan 's intelligence services , by comparison , are amateurs . 
  i think what he mean is the top leadership . 
  they were mostly kemalists before but erdogan removed them . 
  now he will have no choice but to reinstate them unless he can find other competent people . 
  turkey would never attack southern cyprus . 
  that would be insane . 
  the secularists were already removed by erdogan . 
  this is the man who restricted the right of all bulgarians abroad to vote , just so that ethnic turks with buglarian citizenship in turkey could not exercise their vote . 
  if gulen is not behind the coup , then who is ? 
  yes , but that war happened before cyprus joined the eu . 
  i doubt that turkey would ever attack an actual member state . 
  1912 is long before ww2 . 
  i would also put gerb in the pro-kremlin camp . 
  sure but is it more difficult than producing the material in the first place ? 
  turkey has no nuclear power stations yet .

  any kind of block does that , actually . 
  all nato members must agree for example on new joiners . 
  all arab league members must . 
  hell , even all fifa members must . 
  you do n't seem to grasp the notion of a club/organisation/union / alliance etc. , or are just stubbornly rejecting reality because you ' v decided to fixate on catalonia . 
  sorry for you feelings , but the eu : 1 . 
  is not an empire that decides which countries keep their borders or forces them to change them . 
  is a union/club/alliance that needs all of its member states to agree on new members , as is custom in most such organisations . 
  deal with it . 
  it should n't if it is only one sided and the colonialism/conquests/wars etc. 
  of exclusively one group of people around the globe is held accountable , whilst all others ignored . 
  could your kind stop pushing this `` politicize the eu '' bullshit ? 
  no one , at any given point , voted to turn the eu into a political weapon/tool . 
  it was meant as an economic union that helps its members states ease trade , development , science and so on - not to impose political agendas , be it self-determination or not . 
  in fact , the treaties that pushed this such as the treaty of lisbon were actually rejected in the only referendums they were put for . 
  so no , the people of europe do not want and have not voted for a political empire that dictates such matters . 
  they want an economic union , perhaps a common voice in the world and defense such as a joint military , they want science co-operation , they do n't want brussels to say which region can secede , which country can keep its borders etc. 
  so an occupied people was eventually ethnicly cleansed from their lands by one of their occupiers . 
  and we should feel ok about that according to the comment op . 
  in the second world war those were people who did n't want to be under kremlin occupation , be it soviet or otherwise , even less so when the kremlin was a brutal bolshevik regime . 
  so they resisted by supporting the enemy of the kremlin . 
  this isn ; t colaboration in any moral sense of the word for the idiot op to brand them as such and justify their deportation . 
  it was an occupied people fighting their occupiers . 
  nor did i claim there was . 
  i asked why were they under the occupation of the kremlin as opposed to ruling their own country and why should people deserve to be `` punished '' for siding against those who had been imposing stalinism upon them for the previous 20 years , as well as occupation for the 150 years prior ? 
  the moron r/irimiash called them collaborators , as if they were n't occupied people fighting against their russian , and since 1917 bolshevik , occupiers . 
  what were the russians doing occupying the land of the tatars and forcing stalinism upon them in the first place to make them collaborate with the germans ? 
  there are far more issues that caused the greek problem , which poland for example does not . 
  check out tax evasion and collection as percentage in both countries for example . 
  or pensions as compared to minimal and average salary . 
  living for decades above their means whilst developing a culture of tax evasion is what sunk greece as much as the euro problem . 
  poland does n't do that , it would have to triple its current pensions to reach the absurd levels of greece when compared to nominal gdp and government collection . 
  what 's wrong with `` extreme butthurt '' about people invading and occupying your country ? 
  are n't the serbs as butthurt about the ottoman empire as the balts are about the ussr occupation ? 
  why do you have the right to whine like bitches about the turks , or austro-hungary in ww1 , or german invasion of yugoslavia , or nato bombing , but the baltics have no right to complain about the soviet invasion of their lands just because it smears your eternal allies in the kremlin ? 
  celebrating the soviets is a disgrace to my great-grandfather killed by them in september 1944 in bulgaria and the millions more killed and oppressed by them . 
  people like you have no soul . 
  did n't answer what you want the government to do and how you justify violating people 's right to determine the price of whatever they produce and sell . 
  a decision made by the producer or distributor of that fish . 
  do n't buy it if you do n't like it . 
  or you want what - the government to tell the producer/distributor what to do with his own goods or what price to put on them ? 
  because what ? 
  please connect your otherwise random sentence to my post if you want to participate . 
   i do n't hate them i just think that if they ca n't show some solidarity and gratitude , they should simply go their own way . 
  solidarity with whom and gratitude for what ? 
  young men from moroco , algeria , tunisia , nigeria , sudan or pakistan coming to europe are not , in my opinion , those ee societies owe any solidarity or gratitude towards . 
  if western/norhtern european societies are eager to fill themselves with these people they are free to do so , but why impose that onto the ee ones , unwilling , as well ? 
   doors are there , you wo n't be missed . 
  except by the corporations that monopolized the ee markets thanks to them being inside the common market of the eu , or by the western employers using the chepear labour , or by the western economies as a whole getting massive benefits from the eastern brain drain and market monopolization by their own companies and exporters . 
   im very curious how would all those ee criticising eu handle the crisis if they were in the position of greece or italy . 
  like they already did - enforce their borders and spare everyone the issue of millions of economic migrants . 
  my own country was in the same position as we are an outer-eu border with turkey and were a main migrant route , same as greece or italy . 
  we [ built a fence ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-to-build-more-fences-to-stop-migrants-media-report-europe-migration-crisis-refugees-asylum-human-rights/ ) and stopped our entire flow . 
  any who inevitably are smuggled in get stopped , detained and then deported , sometimes all the way back to afghanistan . 
  problem solved . 
  it 's your fault that you allow [ numerous ngo 's smuggling people ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/3e6b6450-c1f7-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354 ) to italy or greece , and then your own fifth column of regressive leftists pressure your governments to take them in , put them on wellfare and breed them in ghettos that are spiraling out of control . 
  but then wonder why the ee states do n't want to follow the same fate and have [ shit like this become normal ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/30/female-genital-mutilation-england-fgm-girls ) with the growing enclaves of parallel , mid-eastern and african societies inside our countries . 
  it 's very simple - europe does n't need to take in anyone its consitituent countries do not want taken . 
  if any inside countries like germany or sweden wish to take people , they are free to do so . 
  they are n't free to impose that societal project onto other members of the eu . 
  nor did i say it 's not a problem . 
  either explain where i did or read again the comment chain to grasp what notion i was correcting . 
  if you hate leeches why do you support importing more of them into europe then ? 
  are n't the eastern euro 's you hate so much enough ? 
   pretty sure flamboyantly dressed left wing atheists from western europe would n't fit in very well in poland , especially if they 're queer . 
  well if you add transsexual and crossdressing to this mix your statement will be even more incorrect , as a few years back poland was the only country in europe with currently such a person [ elected to the parliament by popular vote . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_grodzka ) can you answer if such a person will fit well in any of the massive muslim and african communities the west has accepted ? 
  how about among the 7-8 million maghrebis in france ? 
  or the paksitanis in england ? 
  or the turks in germany ? 
  you know , the kind of cultures that [ kill their own daughters/wives/sisters for shaming them ] ( http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2016/july/she-will-never-shame-me-again-honor-killing-epidemic-in-pakistan ) ...  what exactly do you have in common with western europeans ? 
  this is an oddly random question to answer , but perhaps you 'll be more specific after some kind of a reply . 
  so , uhmmm , let 's see : 1 . 
  same continent . 
  same linguistic family . 
  ( indo-european ) 3 . 
  same majority religion . 
  same historical roots . 
  same architectural , cultural , scientific and political waves throught the past 1000 years . 
  similar levels of social peace , safety , crime rates or violence . 
  quite a lot more . 
  any reason in particuraryou 'd ask ? 
  you seem significantly unaware of this part of history . 
  cultures were not directly tied to demographic groups , and the migration of one such could happen simultaniously as a cultural shift or change occurred . 
  the slavs are indigenous to their lands , same as the balts or germanics , their culture is what changed shape over the centuries . 
  [ the lusitanian culture is early balto-slavic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_slavs#homeland ) one from as early as 900 bc . 
  then other cultures were dominant on that land , burgundian , gothic etc germanic ones , then again slavic one with the wends . 
  culture has changed more often than demographics . 
  which is closer , pre 100ad or 1000ad ? 
  so what you are telling me is that the demand exists , in quite large numbers , but instead of filling that demand by creating competition which will provide the more quality goods , we must instead punish the current producers or force them to dump their lower quality produce ? 
  all producers , especially agricultural ones , have better quality and worse quality part of their produce . 
  it is unavoidable , a significant percentage of each year 's apple yeald in poland for example is of much lower quality than the average . 
  same thing goes all over the world . 
  so what you want is these producers to destroy their low quality produce , and only sell their better one which is up to the standard . 
  in your `` economically literate '' mind this cut in supply when the demand has n't changed will magically leave the prices intact . 
  truly , you are a scholar of economics . 
   you comments show enough , i keep doing it because its fun . 
  i love this admission . 
  admitting it is fun for you to swear at people or attack them personally is better than any insult i could write . 
  keep it up mate .

  they are fucking loading the big cannons . 
  they want this to have the highest price possible for scots and the eu . 
  that 's going to be an ugly motherfucking break up . 
  ugly . 
  tough times ahead for scotland , the people are going to be torn apart like a motherfucker . 
  used and abused . 
  poor bastards . 
  you 're either coming out strong but severely bruised or the whole thing is going to collapse on itself with aggressive movements sprouting up on both sides hurting scottish society long term . 
  i fully agree with you . 
  and i truly believe that you as a nation are bigger because of how you accept part of the responsibility in light of so many other nations going the other road on issues like this . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that a lot of reactions have been of ridicule and exaggeration . 
  erdogan deserve it , yes . 
  but do n't forget he is selling the idea of morally disingenuous , arrogant , ignorant , and offensive europe to his constituencies ( who at this point live fully within a bubble he has created by destroying freedom of press and suppressing social media , etc. ) . 
  so in a perverted kind of way by eliciting a certain reaction from us he proves his own point . 
  i just think that we 're doing the internet 's older mistake here . 
  feeding the troll . 
  i think we let him get the best of us . 
  that 's an unfair interpretation of his words though , do n't you think . 
  i 'm not advocating anything he 's said but he did not say the netherlands is responsible for what happened . 
  he is saying that the country is n't the beacon of moral purity and speaks of ** the role ** of the netherlands in srebrenica . 
  now you and many others may disagree but it 's not that outrageous a statement given how controversial it has been . 
  there 's no way this is about us . 
  i have n't figured it out but this is not about our rights or have something to do with anything related to us . 
  this is probably eu 's plan to get more bulgarians to emigrate to the us instead of western europe . 
  i think the biggest problem of sofia and the country for that matter is sofia 's overall attitude towards the rest of the country . 
  like the city is one and the rest of the country is a different entity , like a foreign place . 
  for sofioters it 's a source of pride that the rest of bulgaria is dying off . 
  one of bulgaria 's biggest problems has been the fact that sofia has been concentrating all the economic power , jobs , and population for 3 decades now . 
  it 's like a growing cancer . 
  bulgaria is divided into 6 economic regions . 
  5 of them are the poorest in the entire eu , the other one has sofia . 
  if the whole country had the gdp per capita of sofia we 'd be somewhere between slovakia and portugal , not dead last struggling for a gasp of air . 
  it 's not a sustainable situation . 
  you ca n't treat this like it 's a dick measuring competition with plovdiv , varna and burags . 
  it 's literally a matter of life and death . 
  the cancer dies with the patient . 
  you ca n't have a gigantic gypsy slum with a single `` oasis '' in it . 
  sooner or later the whole thing will come down crashing and your ugly , congested ball of turds will dissolve in the rest of the gypsy slum . 
   sofia native here and i got ta agree thank you . 
  admitting is the first step towards improvement . 
  people who say sofia is a very beautiful city are like the people who claim one of those morbidly obese women are beautiful models ... like i get it not every city has to be young , tall , lean , elegant , sexy paris or rome . 
  real , everyday , hard working , `` imperfect '' cities are beautiful too . 
  but goddamn it you ca n't just put lipstick on the pig and let it out on the catwalk ... 
  i 've never been to kiev but i hear russian soldiers go there on holidays a lot . 
  tirana is a nice city , it has a quirky and interesting flair to it . 
  i love that it has a lake and park and it 's near the sea . 
  it 's got more nature and it 's cleaner than sofia . 
  sofia is such a turd . 
  there 's simply no denying it . 
  i googled ugliest capitals to see what 's out there . 
  sofia is mentioned quite a lot . 
  http://opentravel.com/blogs/worlds-ugliest-capitals/ http://www.eguidetravel.com/articles/most-ugly-cities-in-the-world/ http://www.dangerous-business.com/2012/08/a-tale-of-two-capitals-bucharest-and-sofia/ http://www.tourism-review.com/bucharest-is-reportedly-the-ugliest-eu-capital--news2833 http://www.novinite.com/articles/113172/bulgaria+capital+airport+world's+10th+ugliest, 
  lol what ?!, 
  sofia is the ugliest capital city in ~ ~ europe ~ ~ the eu . 
  do n't be ashamed and lie about it . 
  embrace it , be proud of that unique achievement . 
  kosovo is empiric proof country karma is real !, 
  out of respect for the serbian * brothers * bulgaria also did n't recognize kosovo ... for a whole month !, 
  we just ca n't wait to start pretending it 's a real country with it 's own culture and history . 
  and then they build huge golden monuments to taunt serbians . 
  and start spreading their fake history books in schools . 
  mhhh ... 
  i can almost taste it . 
  that sweet revenge . 
  it 's the best fucking thing in the world . 
  because the relationship russia has with other parties has to be that of master and slave . 
  russians do not believe in partnership on an equal footing because they do n't believe anyone is equal , let alone to them . 
  even in communism it was still done like this . 
  russians are basically don corleone . 
  a ton of `` family '' talk but it 's all based on fear and distrust . 
  and if they 're having a bad day they can wipe out half their beloved `` family '' just to show who 's boss . 
  and if they think you `` owe '' them you 're fucked . 
  as a person who speaks german and english on daily basis but is n't german nor english dutch makes me feel like i 've taken drugs and my head is playing with me . 
  my brain is like `` are we high again ?!? 
  dude i think there was something in that sprite ... 
  i 'm freaking out man . . did you hear that guy pronounce a g. . no wait i think he 's gathering spit . 
  wtf look there more of them . 
  i think we 're dying ! '', 
  she 's literally the blandest most androgynous woman i have ever set my eyes on . 
  my meatus just yawned . 
  in a world of front national france and afd germany i 'd definitely still trust france more . 
  that petry witch has too much pent up hidden hate in her eyes . 
  who the fuck ca n't trust france ?!?!, 
  literally the most trustworthy country in europe right now . 
  you 're just not as aware yet . 
  when i see cops from southeastern europe i do n't get horny . . 
  i see young men stopping breathing in a puddle of blood , teeth , and piss in the basement of a police station . 
  a sign that you live in a peaceful country - when you see riot police you get horny . 
  i know how to offend him , guys . 
  watch this !, 
  well i once visited portugal . . it 's just like bulgaria but [ without the socialist architecture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/et3qoyh.gif ) . 
  eli5 : imagine ikea is about to buy some fancy italian designer furniture store . 
  turns out the italian owners have 17 trucks full of cash from decades of selling overpriced furniture to micro penis 50 year old closet fags around the whole world . . so they decide to * show * ikea who is boss and slowly start buying off ikea . 
  in the last moment they realize they wo n't be able to do it so they actually sell their store to ikea to finally buy ikea . 
  that was until 2007 afterwards the company was reorganized and now you ca n't claim audi dna in seat anymore . 
  because audi is part of volkswagen too . 
  when you think about the fact that skoda and seat are practically volkswagen . . the map would be a lot more blue . 
  do n't . 
  they have been blasting hateful nazi propaganda against romania and bulgaria for a decade now . 
  i mean that an election is connected with risks and being so certain gerb will rebound is naive .

  your loved `` free '' money are not very `` free '' . 
  i does n't contradict shit , because you have a period of 2007-2013 , while my post showed only 2013 . 
  you love posting periods because you do n't like the yearly results . 
  the organic 0,5 % wo n't be much different than the current one for most people , given the facts that they do n't see shit from the eu funds . 
  i ca n't wait to see countries like macedonia and serbia joining and keeping the same growth rate they currently have while also getting eu funds . 
  educate yourself , please mate . 
  http://i.imgur.com/an1inhp.jpg i know it triggers you hard that reality does n't align with your ideology but you have to deal with it . 
  i also like how you ignore the fact that countries had , have and will have growth without eu funds . 
  first , the money bulgaria actually uses are much less and add up to around 1 % gdp per year . 
  ofc no one is dependent on eu funds you moron , they do n't go into the budget , people wo n't even notice if they stop coming . 
  oh instead of 2017 we will finish the highway in 2019 , a real disaster for the country . 
  the countries in the western balkans seem to be growing fine without your precious eu funds . 
  free money just for the cost of having all your companies owned by western organization , best deal ever . 
  the thing you talk about growth is true only for hungary , you wan na stop posting false info propaganda master . 
  i also hope you know that eu funds do n't go into the national budget and are irrelevant to the money people in ee make . 
  it actually does . 
  germany is not really 3 times more expensive . 
  lol no , a large part of asia will be the same as it is today . 
  the arabs states will probably stay the same as they are today as well . 
  nope . 
  those countries are in nato , so that choice is not really a thing . 
   you really think russia would dare to invade poland or any other ee country while they are in the eu ? 
  like do you seriously believe that ? 
  nato , not the eu . 
  lol , its not about products being exported , lmao . 
  its about buying up the whole market and destroying local companies at the cost of some pennies . 
  where is the strange part in that ? 
  how is hungarians being xenophobic against muslims removing the fact that westerners are xenobhobic against easterners ? 
  his username makes it exceedingly easy . 
  we also use \u0431\u043e\u0436\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 , but its not as popular . 
  i do n't know if they are treated the same but they are definitely treated worse than the locals . 
  does that warrant some knife attacks according to you ? 
  if bombing and going around with an ak are reserved for the muslims which get treated the worst , i guess the poles should limit themselves to some stabbing action ? 
  i guess eastern european migrants should start bombing shit if that is the prerequisite . 
  go read again moron . 
  the eu funds are not charity , they are a compensation , a rather pathetic one at that . 
  did you miss some class on german history ? 
  you are not giving anyone anything . 
  get over your delusions german . 
  you are not giving anyone money clown . 
  eu funds are not part of the national budget . 
  the brain drain would n't be the same without free movement and the most important part is that their local competitors would not be bought out or pushed out of business by western companies . 
  you are not helping anyone , you are paying for what you got , and you got it pretty cheap . 
  well maintained illusion . 
  as if serbia is a relevant part of the equation . 
  well , if we are talking about worldwide , no european country is close to a leader in it . 
  if you compare that to the us , maybe . 
  for the european standard it definitely is . 
  not a math teacher [ but . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0ii1yzv.jpg ), 
  that would mean that you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  go to the uk and ask where their engineers come from . 
  while other stuff might not be great , the it industry is thriving in both countries , even western europeans come here to work in it . 
  bulgaria was at the top of the game even during soviet times . 
  there are more arrogant and pretentious people in western europe than you can find in the rest of the world combined . 
  lol, 
  there wont be any union , do n't worry . 
  bulgaria does n't need an even poorer region with ethnic tensions , and we certainly do n't need people who hate us and deny history . 
  genetically we are mostly descended from the thracians , slavs after that and very little coming from the bulgars , which were the ruling elite which integrated into the thracian/slavic majority . 
  europeans do n't really drink much tequila , but whatever . 
  need to kick those fanatics out of the eu !, 
  i thought this is about poland . 
  canada is not comparable to most if any country on the planet . 
  the combination between lack of distinct identity/culture and geographical isolation gives you the chance to do whatever you want with your immigration policy . 
  as always , geography defines your destiny and canada got pretty lucky . 
  geography . 
  op 's has less data . 
  the best one . 
  well , you are one of the self-appointed proselytizers yourself . 
  we already had an attack , even if it targeted jewish tourists . 
  we are fine for now , but if eu keeps on welcoming everyone from the third world , who knows . 
  for very good reasons . 
  did he call her an interdimensional space alien ? 
  simply put , rich people like to act like assholes . 
  the three are the most popular premium brands out there , but you should n't expect someone with a maserati or a range rover to act differently . 
  is that a common name ?

  her name is kinga duda ? 
  i read the article . 
  they are free to go back to their heart in syria . 
  what you think is irrelevant . 
  you can help them escape their misery by inviting them for a sleepover at your place . 
  you should go and save them from the opressive post soviet shithole glorious weedman . 
  you can take as much syrians as you want , free of charge . 
  yep , that is what is happening here . 
  they are chained and treated dog food . 
  if you do n't like what you get for free you can go back to your sand house , nobody is going to hold you back . 
  because its better than the shithole they come from ? 
  because they do n't get to choose ? 
  because they are living on the back of working citizen ? 
  they should be grateful that they are taken care of by people who own them nothing . 
  people who will see nothing positive in return . 
  ungrateful garbage . 
  i guess reading links is too hard . 
  cyrillic was made in preslav , the capital of the bulgarian empire at the time . 
  he mad . 
  i read a comment , which basically stated that putin 's actual intent was to point out to the macedonians that they are bulgarians in denial . 
  the length some russophiles are willing to go to defend their delusions is astounding . 
  do you want me to go country by country ? 
  the only places from your list that has cities with comparable muslim population to the uk are the netherlands , switzerland and maybe austria , i am not sure if vienna has passed 10 % muslim population . 
  its good that they have not had terrorist attacks but its not like they do n't already have problems .

  all options required either changes to the constitution or annexation . 
  there was not a single option for status quo . 
  none . 
  hardly a referendum when you do n't give people an option to vote for status quo , would n't you agree ? 
  occupation by an aggressive foreign military force aside , of course . 
   the right of people to self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law . 
  it is !, 
  it is recognized under the charter of the united nations specifically !, 
  why did n't russia follow international law procedures and decided to annex it illegally instead ? 
   if you think it is illegal , then kosovo shall be part of serbia and syria intact . 
  in kosovo , there was an attempted genocide . 
  a little different than ukraine , would n't you agree ? 
  russia supported an illigatimate dictator who violated human rights , exterminated the opposition ** and released islamic terrorists who formed isis ** . 
   well , russia will never return crimea never say never , 
   not exactly , they train and support rebels , some say even direct them . 
  why not admit , i don ` t know really , it seems pretty legal , although morally questionable . 
  nope , not legal at all . 
  annexing territories and waging illegal wars is definitely not `` pretty legal '' . 
  `` morally questinable '' is putting it lightly . 
  especially in the 21st century , especially in europe and the doorstep of the eu . 
   yeah but us initially supported `` moderate '' rebels . 
  isis was further development . 
  isis would not have developed without assad 's help . 
  the moderate rebels were a better alternative than assad , however none of them remain today ( unfortunately ) . 
   depends on your logic , according to putin , there are plenty of reasons to support those guys . 
  yes , the reasons being that ukraine should be rightfully russian , should not be a sovereign country and should not choose the eu over russia . 
  none of these are legitimate reasons , hence he has to face the consequences . 
  i hope we manage to sanction the russian economy out of existence since russia does not seem to have learned its lessons from the cold war . 
   you have any proof they are not ? 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/syrias-assad-moves-to-allay-fury-after-security-forces-fire-on-protesters/2011/03/26/affozddb_story.html ) . 
  what about you ? 
   ukranians are killing each other mostly , russia is supplying weapons and intel . 
  like us and turkey in syria . 
  russia is also sending soldiers ~ ~ on vacation ~ ~ to murder ukranians but does n't have the balls and honesty to admit it . 
  also , the situations are hardly comparable , since there is no `` islamic state of ukraine and crimea '' or something . 
  russia has no reason to be in ukraine . 
   aha , yes . 
  no way they were telling lies . 
  you have any proof they are lying ? 
   i don ` t know , iraq has several hundred thousands to million plus casualties . 
  crimea had one guy dead . 
  maybe it was better to annex it ? 
  and you conveniently left out the thousands of people killed in ukraine . 
   isis is originally from iraq , not syria . 
  how on earth assas could create it ? 
  he had a secular state initially . 
  more like us created it by removing saddam . 
  read the article . 
  assad realesed the jihadists who founded isis from prison . 
   true , but if you consider russia a barbarian state for this matter , then eu should be a barbarian state too . 
  it does exactly the same on regular basis . 
  where is the difference ? 
  when was the last time the eu annexed the territory of another country ? 
  when did the eu start a war that it denies participating in ? 
   european sanctions are way more important than american sanctions . 
  not necessarily . 
  the reduction of ravenue from trade is as much due to the sanction as it is due to the failing russian economy . 
  american companies have billions of lost ravenue as well , take exxon mobil who were about to start extremely expensive drilling in russia worth multiple billions of dollars before the sanctions were introduced . 
   well , you have barbarians at the gates because of us/eu actions in libya . 
  you are missing the part where russian-backed assad [ released the jihadists who created isis ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/assad-syria-devil-endgame-putin-obama/407635/ ) . 
  isis would not exist if it were n't for assad . 
   russia is a threat to ukraine , yes . 
  but how it is a threat to eu ? 
  yes , it has started a war in europe , attacked ukraine for becoming pro-eu and continuing negotiations with the eu . 
  russia also meddles in elections around the eu and tries to destabilize the union , openly claiming that the eu and its values are its enemies . 
  you bet we have barbarians at the gates . 
   because if there are rules , they should be applied to everybody . 
  there are rules and there are also priorities . 
  these priorities dictate that the most dangerous regimes should be sanctioned first . 
  would n't you agree that it would be foolish to sanction countries that pose little to no threat while we have barbarians at the gates ? 
  no need to read it again since you failed to point out how the eu introduced more sanctions that the us . 
  i read it , and it does not say that the eu introduced more sanctions , but that it has greater loss of ravenue . 
  that does not indicate that it has placed more severe sanctions , just that it had more trade with russia in the first place . 
  this is due to russia 's counter-sanctions , not due to eu sanctions . 
  why do you keep bringing up turkey ? 
  i am not opposed to never introducing sanctions to them , since they have n't started a war in europe , which is a far greater concern for the ** european ** union . 
  it does n't say so in the article that the supported south stream specifically . 
   sorry , i assume people on reddit are able to perform simple google searchs . 
  i assume they can read too , yet you did n't provide any evidence of the eu enacting * more * ** sanctions ** . 
  do you know what a sanction is ? 
  and where does it say germany supported south stream specifically ? 
  europe needs to prioritize the threats towards it . 
  right now , the biggest threat is the barbaric state that starts wars in europe itself and deliberately attacks out democracies . 
  hence , sanctioning russia is a far more important priority than sanctioning turkey , which so far has n't done anything on the level of russia 's crimes . 
   this idea that russia founded isis and overthrew assad ( or contributed greatly to either ) has to be among the most stupid things i have ever read on this sub . 
  [ educate yourself then ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/assad-syria-devil-endgame-putin-obama/407635/ ) . 
  russia 's interest in the region is to prevent qatar from building a pipeline through syria that would compete with their gas pipileines in europe . 
  this is why they need assad so badly and why they keep supporting him . 
  as for the creation of isis and how assad and putin gave rise to it , just read the article i provided or the numerous other ones on the subject . 
  isis would not exist if assad did not release the radicals who created it from prison . 
   we are talking turkey now . 
  with russia is all clear . 
  but supporting rebels and de facto controlling part of syria with official turkish army is no different from ukraine . 
  why not sanction them ? 
  again , because they have n't annexed other countries ' territories , they have n't started an illegal war they deny participating in and they have n't been attacking our democracies . 
  controlling parts of ex-isis territories is not the same as invading ukraine . 
  also , as i mentioned , turkey has to guts to acknowledge it participates in a war against isis , unlike the cowardly russia that denies any involvement in ukraine ( only russia is capable of such an obvious hypocritical lie ) . 
   eu has set up sanctions against russia that are many times more important than us sanctions vs russia . 
  [ citation needed ], 
   they won ` t do it officially , but they already control it .

  turkey has more than enough as it is . 
   most want to go home when the war is over . 
  given the current escalation , that does n't look like it going to happen any time soon, 
  isis emerged in the political vacuum that was created by the us invasion of iraq . 
  no us invasion of iraq = no isis . 
  the link is quite clear . 
  can cryptographic protocols ensure anonymity though ? 
  i thought that was one of the remaining open questions . 
  even so the risk of theft is probably lower than 0.5 %, 
  you are excluding albania , but including serbia ? 
  that does not make any sense .

  it is quite significant [ compared to previous years ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/11/2300.jpg ) . 
  it is a 10 fold increase compared to a decade ago . 
  compared to previous years , it is quite large . 
  [ washington post : a record number of americans are renouncing their citizenship ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/03/a-record-number-of-americans-are-renouncing-their-citizenship-whats-going-on-here/ ), 
  it is not limited to citizens only , fatca actually refers to `` us persons '' and includes residents and certain nonresidents who have links to the us . 
  for example , if you are a foreigner who is married to a us citizen , you may come under the provisions of fatca . 
  there are enough stories of [ `` accidental '' american ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3ws6fn/accidental_american_fatca/ ) that realize that fact only when they want to open a bank account in a foreign country . 
  it is one of the main reasons why a record number of people are [ renouncing their us citizenship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_account_tax_compliance_act#renunciation_of_citizenship ) . 
  edit : and the bar is not that high . 
  it is [ $ 50k ] ( https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/fatca-information-for-individuals ) which is how much individuals would make in western europe . 
   that 's blatantly not true on the contrary . 
  the united states is the only country in the world ( along with eritrea ) that has [ citizenship based taxation system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_taxation#citizenship ) . 
  all other countries tax based on residence . 
  given how heavyhanded and inequitable american taxation is towards its own ex-pats , this demand is somewhat hypocritical . 
  in 2010 the us passed a law named fatca , and the [ the economist published a pretty good article about it ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21605907-americas-new-law-tax-compliance-heavy-handed-inequitable-and-hypocritical-fatcas-flaws ) :  america is the only large economy to tax its citizens on everything they earn anywhere in the world . 
  fatca 's purpose is to ensure that not a centime or rouble that a `` us person '' has stashed away goes undetected by the irs . 
  in a piece of extraterritoriality stunning even by washington 's standards , the new law requires banks , funds and other financial institutions around the world to report assets held by american clients or face a ruinous 30 % withholding tax . 
   ( ... )  most of these problems would melt away if america switched to the `` territorial '' system favoured by other advanced countries and taxed only those resident there , not all americans everywhere . 
  america should also embrace the oecd 's efforts , already backed by more than 50 countries , to create a truly multilateral system in which tax information on residents ' accounts and certain investments is shared annually . 
  for that to work , america would need to hand over data similar to those which it demands from others -- something it has hitherto appeared reluctant to do . 
  the financial superpower looks ever more a regulatory bully , setting rules it ignores itself . 
  could it be that the usa is opposed to the eu probe , because it would prefer to keep those tax revenues for itself ? 
  slovenia and croatia [ also have one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93slovenia_border_disputes ) . 
  the winter war with finland lasted for quite some time . 
  i guess finns should be grateful that the russians did n't have nukes back then . 
  the [ northeastern shore of the black sea ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/resettlement_of_circassians_into_ottoman_empire.jpg ) was inhabited by a people called circassians ( adige in their own language ) . 
  when the russian empire expanded into their territory , they wiped them out and almost erased them from the collective memory . 
  the russian historian berzhe bore witness to the state of the circassians as they awaited deportation on the black sea shore :  i shall never forget the overwhelming impression made on me by the mountaineers in nvorissiisk bay , where about seventeen thousand of them were gathered on the shore . 
  the late , inclement and cold time of the year , the almost complete absence of means of subsistence and the epidemic of typhus and smallpox , raging among them made their situation desperate . 
  and indeed , whose heart would not be touched on seeing , for example , the already stiff corpse of a young circassian woman lying in rags on the damp ground under the open sky with two infants , one struggling in his death throes while the other sought the assuage his hunger at his dead mother 's breast ? 
  and i saw not a few such scenes . 
  george ditson , the first american to visit circassia , in a book dedicated to prince vorontsov cites the russian ruler of the caucasus as saying :  these circassians are just like your american indians - as untamable and uncivilized ... and owing to their natural energy of character , extermination only would keep them quiet . 
  a good resource on the subject is a [ book by walter richmond ] ( http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/product/circassian-genocide,362.aspx ) . 
  denmark and canada also have [ a territorial dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_island ) . 
  the policy of appeasement did not work against hitler prior to ww2 , and it will not work against putin now . 
  if russia is allowed to get away with using a nuclear device in turkey in order `` to quickly end the war '' , then that would set a terrible precedent . 
  if there was a confrontation with poland , or with finland , what would prevent russia from employing the same strategy there ? 
  is syria really such a vital interest to russia that it would risk apocalypse over it ? 
  for what ? 
  so that assad can continue to be a dictator in his country ? 
  it is really sad that so few people in the west know about the circassian genocide . 
  if more people were aware of it , there would be more pressure on russia in cases like this . 
  if erdogan and putin succeed in destroying each other , that would be a net positive for the world and their respective countries . 
  the orange is erdogan 's party , and the red are the secularists . 
   us can not afford to have 2 nato members fighting each other what makes you think that greece and turkey are going to fight each other ? 
  if anything there are more prospects for cooperation than conflict . 
  especially with the renewed prospect for unification in cyprus . 
  they ca n't cut production because they need every last cent of foreign hard currency to prop up their dwindling reserves . 
  she is from [ kardzhali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kardzhali ) . 
  the situation is pretty bad and people are exploited , but they put up with it because of the few employment opportunities in the region . 
  i think the issue is more of greece wanting to use the migrant flow as a political tool and leverage for its dealings with the rest of europe , perhaps even to punish germany for its stance during the eurocrisis . 
  given that there exists a landborder between turkey and the eu in thrace , one has to wonder why do the migrants cross throught the aegean . 
  given that the main reason macedonia is still not in nato , is because of naming conflict with greece , i wonder if this crisis will give a new impetus to macedonia 's membership in nato . 
   sanction the shit out of turkey that would be like cutting your nose off in order to spite your face . 
  why does everybody here assume that turkey is allowing these refugees through out of malice , rather of a genuine inability to deal with the problem of millions of these people flooding the country from across the border with syria ? 
  sanctioning the country would be like beating a dead horse . 
  turkey is already crumbling under the weight of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the influx of refugees . 
  if europe is serious about reducing the flow of these people it needs to help turkey , not sanction it . 
   can walk without drowning i guess you 've never heard of the [ darien gap ] ( http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2008/09/darien-gap-most-dangerous-absence-of.html ) . 
  if russia initiates hostilities in ukraine , while still engaged in syria , i think it will have bitten more than it can chew . 
  with the low oil prices their currency reserves will not last them for long . 
  is this irrational erratic behavior perhaps a sign that they are beginning to panic ? 
  what incentives does russia have to cooperate and take these people back ? 
  and what do they do with them ? 
  source ? 
  do n't you think they need to finish their `` job '' in syria , before being able to focus back on ukraine ? 
  my aunt works in one of those factories . 
  the invasion of cyprus was not illegal . 
  turkey was bound by the [ treaty of guarantee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_guarantee_%281960%29 ) , which according to wikipedia :  article iv reserves the right of the guarantor powers to take action to re-establish the current state of affairs in cyprus , a provision which was used as justification for the turkish invasion of 1974 . 
  the treaty also allowed the uk to retain sovereignty over two military bases . 
  it was the military coup that attempted to annex the country to greece that triggered the invasion . 
  if you can blame turkey for anything it is that rather than restoring constitutional order , it chose to occupy half of the island . 
  but hey , the south had to pay a political price for trying to annex the island to greece and ethnically cleanse the turkish cypriots . 
  even in the balkans there are a lot of people that like turkey and want to be friends . 
  in the balkans there are a lot of russia lovers . 
  they are really loud in their anti-turkish rhetoric , but make no mistake they do not represent the majority . 
   where do you think isis sells all there oil ? 
  the biggest buyer of isis oil is the syrian regime . 
  this russian meme never gets old . 
  turkey supports isis only in the minds of the putinbots and the imbeciles who have bought into their propaganda . 
   finally , i hope future proves i 'm full of shit here . 
  that we slow down the mass migration , that countries stabalize on their own , start to prosper . 
  this . 
  turkey and the eu need to stabilize the situation in syria urgently to allow these people to stay in their country , and the rest to go back there . 
  to me it seems that russia is deliberately creating the most recent refugee flows through its bombardment of aleppo in order to punish the eu for the sanctions , and turkey for shooting down its jet . 
  it is their russian buddies that are causing this entire mess in the first place . 
  if it was not for them carpet bombing aleppo to help their friend assad , none of the most recent immigrants would feel the need to flee and press against the turkish border in their tens of thousands . 
  europe is not weak willed , it is just schizophrenic .

  and when in 1885 two of these pieces united russia protested and sent the serbs to stop it in the war of 1885 . 
  and when the unified country declared independence from the turks in 1908 russia opposed that again . 
  why ? 
  are n't they `` orthodox borthers '' ? 
  russia would n't repress and kill thousands of `` slavic orthodox brothers '' in ukraine over the last 3 centuries either . 
  russia does n't give a fuck about orthodox brothers or constantinople - it only cares about its interrest and expanding . 
  it always was an imperial country that cares about power , about subjugating people , about occupied others and ruining neighbouring nations . 
  and no , i am not a turk or a leftist , i am a christian - a real christian who would n't let christian borthers be vassals of the turks and protest when they liberate themselves . 
  i am a right wing nationalist who would n't support communist and bolshevik parties , like the kremlin does today all over europe , and in this country . 
  if russia is today `` orthodox '' , why does it pay our socialist party - made up of people who were part of the communist regime that destroyed churches and banned people from being orthodox ? 
  the uk lost 450,000 out of a population of 47 million , but those 450,000 include soldiers from its empire . 
  so the percentage is tiny , many times smaller than during the civil war . 
  cheers for your contributing comment as well . 
  very much needed and very much imporving the quality of this conversation . 
  you must be a delight to talk to and a well informed member of any discussion . 
  not censoring , adding the $ sign to it to imply it 's them getting money from organisations and ngo 's connected with the respective influence zones that actually means `` sucking cock '' . 
  you ' r just stupid enough to have the reference fly over your head . 
  is russia really that desperate for a couple of ships ? 
  they were headed for the same the first time . 
  as in immediate damage - no . 
  the war killed millions and destroyed entire cities . 
  the cold war saw building cities rather than destroying them . 
  as in long-term damage - definitely the cold war . 
  world war 2 killed off a population that was quickly returned in demogprahic terms and destroyed cities that were rebuilt in decades . 
  communism made us miss a pivotal moment in urbanisation that determined what countries would be first world and which would be loosing people to migration for decades to come . 
  the inevitable fall of the communist experiment actually deprived eastern europe of more people through migration than the second world war , and we are still loosing . 
  especially young and educated ones . 
  so both are correct in their own way . 
  between them sucking on the west 's c $ ck and wanting to emulate the `` progressive west '' in all they do and say , and the russo-idiots sucking on kremlin 's c $ ck and wanting to emulate `` glorious \u0420\u0443\u0441 / \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 '' in all , this country 's political landscape is getting a bit too frustrating for me . 
  the uk had pretty terrific time compared to anyone in eastern europe , but they had made up for it in the civil war that killed off a good chunk of the population . 
  pretty much . 
  poland : 1 .

  3rd snarky comment with no substance or contribution to the thread due to complete lack of any knowledge on the subject to give actual arguments . 
  you appear like a peasant trying to form coherent taught . 
  i am startign to feel embarassed for you . 
  same thing again . 
  very constructive comments mate , you ' r like a school kid just saying `` no you ' r wrong '' in a debate . 
  please learn a bit how to argue like an adult - you ' r supposed to address the opponents claims and arguments with such of your own , like i did , not himself . 
  that 's called an ad hominem fallacy and gets you disqualified in competitive debating at unviersity . 
  but i guess you did n't go to one to know . 
  every time a brainwashed serb or russian makes a bold claim and gets refuted with facts he runs away quickly with a short snarky remark like this . 
  no surprise here . 
  edit : nice going adding all that comment to your short ad hominem now that i called you out on it . 
  why not go and edit your other comments as well not to look like a tool . 
  will russia make a referendum in its ethnic republics to see if they want to be governed by moscow ? 
  the same that fought two wars in chechnya just a few years ago to break away from it ? 
  oh i forgot , russia outlawed all talk of separatism , whilst at the same time it hosts world separatists convention in moscow and directly supports separatists in georgia and ukraine . 
  we can thank the kremlin 's denial that de jure ukraine is n't at war with them , only with separatists in its own territory . 
  if those get crushed and kiev renounces crimea they can join without issues . 
  the russian fought their 13th war against the ottoman empire when they saw that it was loosing its balkan provinces one after another ( serbia and greece were already free ) . 
  the purpose was to quickly carve out a balkan satellite . 
  this is why bulgaria was not liberated , but only 2 small parts of it , and left separate and vassals of the ottomans . 
  when the two parts united 7 years later in 1885 the russians opposed it and sent the serbs to stop it . 
  they failed . 
  then when the united country declared independence in 1908 russia opposed again . 
  all of this because russia did n't want bulgaria to have an independent policy - it just needed bulgaria to be weak satellite of petrograd . 
  how can bulgaria be grateful when russia has done all it can to leave bulgaria as weak and small as possible in order to control it ? 
   i wonder if in many years bulgarians would be thaught that russia occupied bulgaria this already is true - the russians occupied bulgaria in 1944 and we liberated ourselves in 1989 . 
  risk what ? 
  the day ukraine joins nato russia all of a sudden invades ? 
  :d what is this , the middle ages ? 
  things do n't go like that - even the cold war saw the ussr and us only square off in proxy wars , whilst continue their trade uninterrupted . 
  today it 's even more so - never will there be a conventional military conflict between russia and nato - it 's ridiculous to think so . 
  half the russian oligarchs live in london , the other half has their families and fortunes in the west . 
  putin 's own daugther lives in the netherlands . 
  geo-poltiics is n't a video game , people have to stop imgaining a `` third world war ' or any kind of direct war with russia - it 's hilarious . 
  under the right circumstances you could ' v grown to be a kukluxklan member , a bolshevik , an islamic terrorist , a greedy capitalist , a pedo rapist , an alcoholic etc. 
  it does n't mean the actions of any of the above should be less regarded worth consequences , just because we * understand * how they came to be . 
  it 's a fact russian society came to overwhelmingly celebrate the aggressive and expansionist policies of the kremlin . 
  it is to be punished , regardless if one can * understand * the underlying causes . 
  the country getting divided along ethnic and religious lines is much better than staying under a unified dictatorship that bombs its own cities . 
  syria is an artificial colonial construct - it should n't exist in the first place . 
  let alawites have the coast , kurds have the north , sunni arabs have the rest . 
  and see who decides to run their country what way , instead of drowning the land in blood just to keep those groups together in a remnant from the colonial past . 
  the berlin congress divided bulgaria because russia wanted a small satellite easy to control . 
  bulgaria united and the russians sent the serbs to backstab us and stop our unification . 
  you are the traitors , you are the backstabbers after thousands of bulgarians fought with the serbs for your freedom in the 19th century . 
  so it does n't matter what happened later - we did n't owe serbia anything , you had broken any friendship and deserved any war against you by bulgaria . 
  so do n't talk to me about `` orthodox people '' , because you invaded your orthodox neighbours to please your russian masters like dogs . 
  are you saying the serb invasion of 1885 did n't happen ? 
  :d lol , serbs and russians literary say anything they do n't like is `` western proapganda '' . 
  what morons . 
  yep , the alawites would be oppressed now . 
  pretty sad . 
  but not as much as the entire country reduced to dust , tens of thousands dead , 10 million displaced and numerous historical sites and artefacts destroyed . 
  nothing would be worse than what happened , so there 's no way an intervention back in the day would n't be better . 
  syria was much more alike tunis in all regards , and tunis avoided a civil war after the arab spring . 
  but tunis had a quick removal of the dictatorship and that 's why it is n't ruined today , whereas syria had russia to protect its dictatorship , resulting in the carnage we have . 
  did n't answer my question of course - what happened in 1885 ? 
  bulgarians fought together with the serbs against the turks for centuries .

  unless it 's a vodka martini ... or a vesper . 
  i see some people go 50/50 with the vermuth . 
  because the monarchies united , giving them greater wealth which they used to explore and acquire even more wealth . 
  wealth gave them the ability to open and acquire new territory . 
  there was no vagueness in my `` claim '' . 
  i never mentioned attack . 
  i specifically wrote `` political '' support . 
  i 'm not weaseling out of anything . 
  you 're inflating my words with implications that i did not refer to . 
  clarifying that is not weaseling , it 's informing you that your argument is misplaced . 
  strange - i do n't recall making any false statements of a fool of myself , nor did i refer to patriot missiles in my comment . 
  your assumption . 
  no where in my statement do i specify surface to air or air to air . 
  i refer to the lack of political support from nato after turkey shot down the russian warplane . 
  there was an awful lot of `` um ... so . . um what happened there ? '', 
  had . 
  nato cut them off by not having their back . 
  you 're correct , but there are a significant amount of russians involved . 
  my wife used to work in a medical office in brooklyn 's russian/ukrainian area and she was amazed that every visit seemed to be inflated like this . 
  not only that but then the patients who would roll up in new audi a7s or the like would be using subsidized medical care for poor people then actually complain about the service of their free visits that they later received kick backs for from the doctor . 
  these were most often russians and ukrainians . 
  i wholly concur !!, 
  down with the pineapple pizza . 
  hawaiian pizza in my opinion should be topped with spam , roasted ham , smoked ham , and poi . 
  peppers are always appreciated . 
  jalapenos more so . 
  thanks . 
  i thought i read 70km not 70nm . 
  it 's not special treatment by expecting open comms and professionalism in international waters and airspace . 
  being 70nm off of a port and a warplane approach with no comms and does a low and fast fly over , that 's the beginning of a threat . 
  it 's not special treatment to ask that nations refrain from approaching war vessels like that with no communication . 
  edit : fixed distance measurement . 
  thanks / u/awesomelove, 
  absolutely - corruption is a major problem in southern and eastern europe and should not be tolerated as much as it is . 
  i ca n't speak for all of eastern europe on the subject , but here in bulgaria it 's tolerated at a high level because it 's just as present in the general population . 
  of course it does . 
  but those leaders and institutions are not `` things '' . 
  they are made of living breathing people . 
  the same ones , as a matter of fact which are grown and reared in the local culture , system and way of doing things . 
  the choices our leaders make can not at all be separated from our methods of making choices and our value system in which we make them . 
  which is cultural . 
  thanks , neighbor !, 
  i 'd say the biggest difference in standard of living in the south is lower income and less/unless in some cases social services . 
  i 'd agree it be nice to get up to northern european standards in those areas , but i 'm sure i 'd sacrifice the quality of life here in order to gain those benefits and i think it would need to be sacrificed in large part to make it happen . 
  the carelessness . 
  the long days lounging . 
  the working super hard for really quite little and only complaining about it but not doing much because at the end of the day you do n't want to pay more for what you have and that would really be the only way to receive more in compensation ... 
  list goes on . 
  i 'm not sure you can generalize the `` rest of european citizens '' like that . 
  i for one am fairly content in southern europe . 
  i find northern european cities to be too serious and uptight for my preferences with a few exceptions . 
  i think when your life is not focused on finances , southern europe offers more `` living '' . 
  i know many people emigrate to the north , but most often for financial reasons . 
  many people also comes south ... to try to live a better life . 
  that kind of challenges the viability of a union if you have to compete without and within . 
  in my opinion , complimenting each other 's needs forms a much better partnership than trying to out do each other and then admonishing the loser . 
  because northern countries have a different definition of good quality of living . 
  why should they compete with the northern countries ? 
  i 'd say the economical differences between north and south are more cultural than structural , so besides maybe northern italy eventually , i do n't see southern europe ever being able to `` compete '' with northern europe but then as part of an economic block and political union , should n't we be more focused on complimenting each other 's short falls and maximizing strengths rather than competing ? 
  debt relief would not mean necessarily loaning more . 
  i would just mean agreeing to not get back 100 % + interest on what you 've already loaned or agreeing to wait much longer than original terms to get back your original loan . 
  i do n't see how that 's political suicide ... 
  sounds like the best way to get something back . 
  the other options would yield lesser returns on their loans for the creditors , germany included . 
  you should check with the mexican 's first -- i think they should get to choose since they 're paying , after all . 
  i do n't know about that - but they certainly never have to worry about landslides . 
  the swiss one is looking appealing to me . 
  i 'd like to visit rivendell some time . 
  weird . 
  how is your mother in law pushing you to get married ? 
  i mean , how many mother in laws do you really need ? 
  holy shit , i did n't know that existed !!, 
  awesomeness !, 
  um turbo tax ftw !, 
  costs me about 80 $ for fed and state and takes all of 20 minutes of my time . 
  wow this is super optimistic !, 
  good on you mate !, 
  i hope some of this happens , but in reality , i do n't expect much will change in 10 years . 
  transatlantic trade is already superseded by asia . 
  there are too many differences in the political systems and end goals in my opinion for political ties between asia and europe to even approach those of north america to europe . 
  eastern europe does n't have and i do n't think will see enough venture capital investment to really get many game changing companies started and functional there . 
  people migrate where the money is ... few people will be willing to come from britain or germany to romania or bulgaria for employment when it means taking a 80 % or more hit to their salary . 
  maybe eastern european governments might start taking the need for heavy tech and education investment seriously because that 's what 's needed to get home grown ideas off the ground . 
  when locals start investing in growth and future , then the migration of capital and resources might begin . 
  the refugee crisis as it is will never end . 
  it did n't just start last september when 24 hour news took notice . 
  it 's been going on for years , just on a smaller scale . 
  italy has been increasingly complaining for a decade now . 
  with any luck it will return to its previous numbers . 
  my hope is that in 10 years europeans begin to recognize their common goals and similarities , stop emphasizing and focusing on preserving differences keeping us apart . 
  i think in 10 years europe may be on track to taking its union a little more seriously and we can get back to feeling european commonly as it sort of was 10 years before anti europe politics really began to take hold . 
  i was wondering the same thing . 
  i 've been to hong kong on a number of occasions and while i 've never felt unsafe , i would n't go so far as to say it 's safer than scandinavia . 
  i 'm not even sure i 'd label it safer than bulgaria . 
  common military is near impossible without fiscal union . 
  else we end up with a `` peacekeeping '' force like the un has . 
  with fiscal union , the budgeting for a common military does n't have to be taken in 28 proportional pieces so no one complains . 
  but too many member nations are still too self-interested to get anywhere near this in the foreseeable future . 
  for some reason , europe still feels the need for individual military forces even though the majority of said forces do n't have the support , technical prowess , size or equipment to be of any practical military use if they ever became necessary . 
  no need to apologize .

  do you claim sweden is actually one of the most devoutly christian nations in europe with a staggering 60 % practicing christians and i 've got it all wrong ? 
  the church of swede is also practically non-existent demographically . 
  i wrote a comment-joke specifically on the topic . 
  someone else asked if we border syria and i answered in the same joking tone i started , that we do by proxy of the migrants we currently have in sofia . 
  everything from there on has been in correlation to the comments and answers people have made towards me . 
  i have n't just popped out of nowhere to write `` fuck islam '' or something like that on a random thread , i comment on the topic at hand . 
  that you do not like anyone being against proto-fascist , far-right regressive ideologies is your own problem , deal with it . 
  i do n't recall bashing all muslims collectively , i recall bashing the religion of hate that is at the core of islamic terrorism across the world . 
  just as it would be an empty argument to ask you how can you bash the tens of millions of people across the world who identify with nazism or fascism , despite the majority being completely peaceful people who never hurt anyone , i too find it a meaningless argument to ask me how can i bash all the adherents of an ideology i despise . 
  it 's their choice to declare as a part of it , so it 's my choice to disrespect them and demand they stay away from my land for it . 
  mmmk ? 
  1 . who determines what under what article what views you can express ? 
  why is expressing anti-islamic sentiments `` promotion '' of such ? 
  when you express your opinion on a given subject are you necessarily looking to promote them , or just share opinion ? 
  it happens regularly on the pc 's of thousands of euiv players . 
  versus 150 million active protestants in the us . 
  i rest my case which country has a more representative sample . 
  i just hope by that time the intolerant germans and swedes have gotten rid of their islamophobia , so they can stop forcing innocent muslims to become terrorists by insulting their feelings . 
  not that i am saying terrorism has anything to do with islam or muslims , of course . 
  plz come here , we close too , we good weather , we great food , we need das geld, 
  `` we have no basis for strong feelings '' for a person who chooses to stand on a ticket by the party of the communist terrorists prior to 1944 , the totalitarian , foreign-owned regime after 1944 , and the `` red oligarchs '' after 1989 ? 
  a person legitimising and representing with his ticket the party of terrorists , murderers and mobsters ? 
  a party which till this day defends said actions in the past and refuses to condemn the people who forced the macedoninisation of pirin , the concentration camps , the `` red briefcases '' and credit millionaires in the 90s ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  ekd has how many active members in 2017 regularly attending church as opposed to the usa protestants ? 
  then you are stating it from your own perspective , whereas i was stating it from the christian one and said so . 
  hence why state i am saying it as if it is a bad thing ? 
  of course it is from the perspective i clearly indicated . 
  and it does stop it . 
  hence why the catholic world is n't fractured in its teachings , dogma and action into tens of thousands of local churches with fundamentally varying ideas and messages . 
  it merely has the occasional rouge priest , which is not even remotely comparable to the protestant us alternative . 
  so your attempt at comparing the two fails miserably . 
   had a private security company in 90s bulgaria . 
   `` was not technically a mobster . '', 
  top kek . 
  what i claimed to be a disaster from a christian perspective was the eventual death of christianity in most of the protestant european regions , where entire countries like england have less 10 % active adherents today . 
  do you deny this is the case ( in which case show alternative data where the active adherents of christianity are more ) , or do you deny the death of christianity is not a disaster ... * to the christians themselves * ? 
  too few . 
  the us has 15,000 . 
  i rate it 2/10 . 
  i said it is bad from a christian perspective . 
  did you fail to read that part or do you have an argument in favour of it being bad even from the perspective of christians ? 
  turkic does not equal turkish . 
  turkish people should stop appropriating an entire , ancient linguistical group as synonymous with their own identity . 
  when the ancient bulgars spoke a turkic language ( if they did ) , the turkish identity and people whom are referred to as `` kebabs '' today would n't exist for many hundreds of years to come . 
  what you do is like someone using a deragatory slur about modern russians , and then those saying it should be applied to 5th century venedi or sclavinian tribes as well , because they were also slavic . 
  no , russian does n't equal ancient venedi/slavic tribes , turkish today does n't equal ancient bulgar , avar , hunnic etc. 
  tribes . 
  there is an ongoing debate if the bulgars were turkic or iranic . 
  http://www.novinite.com/articles/117903/scholars+claim+bulgarians+descended+from+iran http://samoistina.com/2/similarities.htm, 
  are those protestant churches ? 
  well the general came from the pro-putin socialist party on a russia-friendly platform , so yeah i guess it 's 100 % a putin vibe . 
  taught by whom ? 
  we do n't have a hive mind here in bulgaria that teaches us everything we know about the world , we are individuals with vastly different information based on our sources . 
  is that not the case in germany ? 
  are you brainwashed meticulously so whatever you say i must accept as `` this is what they teach them in germany '' ? 
  my sources are pretty much anything you can find on the internet that ranks european countries based on religiousity or church attendence . 
  the protestant countries are entirely , all of them , at the very bottom with less than even 10 % , whilst the catholic and orthodox ones only have one or two such exceptions . 
  ( france and czech for the catholics , bulgaria for the orthodox ) https://i.redd.it/h83rcifgswox.png, 
  indeed , these cases are even remotely comparable to the 15,000 separate protestant churches that exist in the us alone . 
  / s learn to not use logical fallacies . 
  where else are there actively believing and practicing protestants in large numbers ? 
  europe ? 
  lol, 
  you ' v got one , the catholic . 
  the protestant areas are basically 90 % atheist at that point , as protestantism easily died under the assault of the atheist forces in europe 's modern age all over the continent . 
  in scandinavia , england , northern netherlands , estonia and latvia or protestant germany - believers are basically below 10 % . 
  unlike in most of catholic or orthodox europe . 
  ergo , protestantism either devolved into a bazillion moronic churches like in the us , or simply died like in protestant europe . 
  both are cases that from a christian perspective it was a disaster . 
  muuuh reductio ad absurdum , i 'm so smart i can barely resist myself . 
  that 's what you get when you destroy the church framework of an organized religion , you get thousands of sects and preachers saying whatever their brains come up with . 
  they were warned this would happen 5 centuries ago . 
  catholics 2017 : [ climate change is important ] ( http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/334881-pope-francis-gave-trump-2015-encyclical-on-climate-change ) , [ evolution and big bang are real ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-declares-evolution-and-big-bang-theory-are-right-and-god-isnt-a-magician-with-a-magic-9822514.html ) .

  you get the sentiment our people have for the type of leaders they elect . 
  you ca n't get more spineless than that really . 
  even when muslims literary butcher people on the streets ... it 's * still * the fault of the `` far-right '' . 
  i see lots of romanians using this argument , but then forgetting that the all the land they received in transylvania was by far not 100 % romanian either . 
  sure hungary had lots of land that should n't have belong to it before , but afterwards they were not taken only those lands , but also lots of their core ethnic ones and they are right to be pissed about it . 
  711ad , we did it first . 
  the turkish/muslim population of bulgaria has grown both as percentage and numbers since the liberation , to about 1.2 million people today . 
  the christian/greek/armenian population of turkey was huge and reduced to less than 1 % today , through a combination of deportations , forced assimilation and outright genocide . 
  for turks to dare criticise bulgaria for the fate of its minority is the absolute height of hypocrisy . 
  it 's like iran criticising the netherlands on gay rights - pathetic . 
  yeah but he 's stupid you see for it . 
  i am not the one that whines , check out the comment thread - it was a turk that whined about the greeks doing to his people the exact same things you have now spent a few posts explaining was entirely normal and we ca n't blame the turks for . 
  why do n't you go tell him to stop tone down his nationalism and stop bitching about the smyrna turks killed , cause `` everyone did it , the romans , alexander , blah blah ... '' ? 
  cause you ' r as nationalistic as the people you accuse of whining . 
  so then why do you whine about the greeks doing that same thing when they got the chance to ? 
  at least they had a moral reason to hate the turks after centuries of oppression , all that the turks had when they invaded was `` meh , we can do it so we will '' . 
  your question makes no sense - the turks conquered a group of people , subjugated and oppressed them for centuries , then this group hit back . 
  this makes sense and is quite logical , if you do n't want group a to hate and kill you then do n't occupy it for centuries , instead of doing it but then whine like a bitch that they ... hate and kill you . 
  it 's obviously of your own doing . 
  quite simple . 
  your question seems irrelevant . 
  i did n't though . 
  i asked something else .

  according to statistics - be it names of newborns or others , there are certainly still regions with lots of bulgarian muslims or turkish people . 
  what you say is true , but the blame game on the balkans is not something you can win . 
  everyone has its fair share of blame . 
  a new balkan war probably involving more than just greece and turkey . 
  bulgaria has a lot to fear from the dream of a big turkey , we have some major regions with people speaking turkish ( like close to 50 % in a few regions ) . 
  it 's well documented . 
  german language was a taboo for a while . 
  members of the kkk went into german churches and forced the priests to use english instead of german . 
  there was a lot of discrimination against germans . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-german_sentiment#united_states not the only source on the topic by the way . 
  the fact that germans were persecuted in the states after ww1 ( also by the kkk ) is not really funny imo . 
  neither is any name funny to me , just because it 's not common to hear in a hollywood movies . 
  people from europe , africa and asia have lots of names some may find funny . 
  lots of people with `` funny '' names changed them to fit in and become more anglo-saxon . 
  having to change your name - that 's a stain on america 's history , not on trump 's family history . 
  what do you do once you 're old and not earning as much anymore ? 
  are the people of europe saving money ? 
  do we have 401ks ? 
  you can not own your own house in plenty of places too . 
  not sure how prices are in hungary , but i live in sofia , bulgaria . 
  i preferred to stay here because i could own a home . 
  i doubt i could own an apartment 10 minutes away from the city center of london . 
  on the contrary , this is possible for me right now . 
  people rarely consider cost of living when moving abroad . 
  there 're higher wages , but everything is generally more expensive like rents and house prices . 
  that 's my opinion of it all . 
  also , i think if you work hard you can do well in eastern europe as well . 
  there 's no instantaneous success and it does not happen over night . 
  but it 's the same in western europe . 
  well it certainly gave me a perspective as to why you guys love tea so much :d just joking of course . 
  to not sound like a hater , i will say i did i love the beer and the architecture . 
  also camden was a very cool place that we do not have over here and it was a fun experience, 
  i lived my whole life in bulgaria . 
  when i drove around the country with friends i saw vast empty spaces . 
  there were villages here and there and towns , but most of the times it 's just nature and agriculture lands . 
  when i flew in to the uk it amazed me to see how densely populated they were . 
  the other thing i noticed was how bad the quality of the water was . 
  bottled or tap water in london tasted like piss . 
  later , i found out indeed the water has a lot of recycled piss in it . 
  i could n't wait to come home and drink some bulgarian mineral water ... 
  which by the way i think is way better also than french mineral water . 
  there are some benefits to being poor and in a demographic catastrophe . 
  village properties go for pennies and the water and soil are top quality . 
  i have never eaten better vegetables than those made in the gardens of my grandfather . 
  traditions can be beautiful if you ignore the obvious problem of penis shrinkage . 
  i am not going to be able to find my little guy after going into such cold water probably lol . 
  i personally chose to separate the actions of a state from its people in places where there 's no direct democracy . 
  russia is not switzerland . 
  i was just trying to make a point that because of an unrelated set of political reasons we also chose to hate on russian culture and nature . 
  is it a coincidence again i ask that we rarely see anything posted about sights from russia in terms of photographs ? 
  i only ask you to think about this . 
  there 're many more arguments to be had and valid points to be made of course . 
  i would bet 10 eur if a bookmaker but i ca n't find such odds lol . 
  it 's not just the media however . 
  think about how often we see images upvotted with anything good . 
  like nature/countryside in russia . 
  lake baikal is beautiful but we rarely if ever see pictures from russia upvoted in / r/pics or other subreddits . 
  i would say that there is a large group of people with a strong negative opinion against russia . 
  people in the west do not go as tourists to sankt peterburg , they go to paris etc. 
  i think we ate too much of the propaganda ourselves . 
  there 's russian propaganda and wetern propaganda . 
  news and politics news in particular are shit . 
  what scares me the most for the future is that they will still have nuclear weapons . 
  i did not know that portugal was a producer of lithium . 
  it would be foolish not to consider portugal with its access to ports they can easily deliver to plenty of european countries and there 's also the roads and other infrastructure . 
  a good portion of the money comes from russian/other tourists who will go to bulgaria instead of turkey . 
  2016 was the best year for the tourism business , it looks like 2017 will be another great year . 
  bulgaria and greece will have another great tourists season . 
  yeah !, 
  welcome bratushki !, 
  the very same thing was recently exposed in bulgaria . 
  if i remember correctly their job was to report on the `` gulenists '' . 
  this was done by bulgarian nationals who likely do not have a turkish citizenship . 
  it 's national treason basically . 
  you 're two hours away from paris by train so i can live with a bit of dull in my daily routines and in the weekends you can go outside of luxembourg easy, 
  i went there in march . 
  i enjoyed it a lot actually . 
  would live there for sure if it was not for the prices of real estate . 
  communism brought forth a high level of urbanization . 
  a poor family living in a village where they grow their own food and need children to help with the work would be a different story . 
  people living in apartments and being poor have no reason to make a lot of kids . 
  why are we given stats from 2010 ? 
  i do n't get this . 
  it 's almost 2017 . 
  yes, 
  this is an awesome idea  i would even raise to 5000 eur . 
  hope bulgaria follows suit soon . 
  go to the mountains if you go to bulgaria - rila 's seven lakes or pirin . 
  when they commit to zero exploitation of the arctic for oil drills i 'd be happy . 
  this only tells me i should be advertising on twitter . 
  seems like the western demographics use it a lot more . 
  thanks !, 
  i have listend to sonic syndicate , but did not know about the unguided !, 
  thanks man !, 
  do you have your own youtube playlist/favorites or spotify list you can share with me ? 
  there 's a long history of queen elizabeth choosing her outfits to convey a message . 
  in 1960 she receives the highest honor from the thai king . 
  during her visit to thailand she wore colors similar to that . 
  in 1975 in japan she wore cherry blossom resembling outfit . 
  in 1983 - when she visit ragen in the states , she wears a poppy flower dress which symbolizes california .

i am pretty certain turkish funded mosques do n't preach the ultra conservative variant that saudi mosques do . 
  and is it common or even allowed in turkey to ban the call to prayer in the early hours of the morning , because i 'm sure germany will ban it . 
  we are certainly more genetically similar to other slavic nations and turkey . 
  and i do n't think it 's taboo to say it . 
  practically everyone knows it even those that deny it . 
  never underestimate the stupidity of people . 
  in my experience the more northern the country the more people dislike being actively encouraged to buy wares no matter the way they are presented . 
  i have been to istanbul and have never experienced shirt pulling . 
  but price negotiating is so deeply ingrained on the culture that if you do n't negotiate the merchant will be offended . 
  and understandably some people do n't like that . 
  however i have never got the sense that i was a money bag and every single waiter was unimaginably polite and thanking . 
  however i speak some turkish and people might not see me as a simple tourist . 
  my girlfriend and i have never been overtly stared at or felt anything close to a disgust from turks and have not had problems with her not wearing hijab . 
  i was impressed at the wonderful building spree that istanbul is feeling and i saw some of the most beautiful buildings i have ever seen in istanbul . 
  so yeah just wanted to share my experience since everyone is doing it . 
  all in all loved it . 
  wow he was a great prophet as well as a dictator . 
  and now libya is in a state of disarray and civil war . 
  who do we blame for this terrible outcome ? 
  i did n't have a lot of time to explore but it 's a lovely city . 
  it sits on a lone hill with a breathtaking view to the lower plains of italy . 
  the city has a lot of ancient architecture and castle but that 's not really my thing so i only briefly visited them . 
  what left the biggest impression in my was the view , the plains mostly but also the city itself . 
  it looks quite good with such steep hills . 
  if you are with a car , do n't worry about the quality of the road it was very satisfactory but parking is a bit tricky . 
  also i visited in summer so it was full of tourist and picture taking everywhere . 
  * bulgaria * greece ( holiday ) * serbia ( passing ) * croatia ( only zagreb ) * slovenia ( passing ) * italy ( venice and brief work in northeast italy ) * san marino ( brief visit ) * turkey ( holiday ) * uk ( london , brief visit wish i stayed more ) total = 9 ( probably more than average for bulgaria ), 
  the eu would n't be so stupid as to fuck london 's finance industry as it is the largest market for even euro-related stuff and changing its location to somewhere in europe ( frankfurt probably ... ) will be incredibly unsustainable and will spur a lot of discontent . 
  merkel is not going to fuck germany 's reputation that much . 
  the common agricultural market is incredibly stupid and should be reworked in my opinion . 
  french farmers , which are heavily subsidized , should not be able to compete in bulgaria with native bulgarian production which is 2000km away with wages 5 times lower and much better soil ... 
  the fishing common policy is in the same state of idiocy . 
  so there is good and also there is bad in the common market . 
  i would like to think cameron will be able to get europe to talk about these problems and eventually reform them but it 's probably my optimism talking . 
  and we have n't even hit glorious q3 . 
  i hope it 's finally recovery and growth time . 
  is it true that portuguese people understand spanish speakers easier than the other way around ? 
  and to what extend is there mutual intelligibility ? 
  e.g there is basically no significant difference in macedonian and bulgarian expect a few vocabulary changes but even without mutual intelligibility i can still have a grasp of what a serbian person is saying . 
  i have seen the pitiful state of the hospitals of regional cities in bulgaria ( i imagine it is the same in romania ) and the need for new equipment is dire . 
  however even if you had the money to modernize the equipment it would be so much better to actually pay the doctors for the minimum 60 + hours of hard and extremely responsible work they do . 
  the few doctors who are capable of performing life-saving operations are all in their 60s and even 70s and when they die even cities such as plovdiv ( 350k pop ) will have to import specialists from sofia . 
  equipment can be bought but people can not . 
  younger generations have no desire to work in a toxic environment where older patients do n't take their meds and refuse operations and when they inevitably die it is blamed on the sleep-deprived doctors who have to work double-shifts because the emergency and first-admission rooms are so understaffed . 
  and that is without taking into account that they are even not payed for the extra hours they work , on top of the already pitiful average 400euro salaries they get . 
  some people say that medical universities are all full and the admission is always the hardest out of any other and they say there will always be doctors . 
  but they do n't understand that those students are not studying for the 500 eur that bulgaria offers . 
   90 % of medical graduates leave and the effects are already felt . 
  i mean who in their right mind would study 7 years for a meager 500eur they can get without education ... nobody . 
  i 'm sorry if this sounds like a rant and i 'm not really replying to u/zoorope anymore but all i see in bulgarian news are stories about doctors who fucked up an operation or doctors taking funds from the hospital or using other clinical paths , when they do n't understand the underlying reasons . 
  i have not seen a positive news in so long ... and do n't even get me started on the fucking bureaucracy . 
  uk is only going to get stronger though and it has a much stronger cultural influence than both france and germany ( mainly because it is an english-speaking country ) . 
  if the uk does n't vote to exit the eu i presume they would take a bigger leading role than now , with or without the euro . 
  although it is floating it is always very close to the euro . 
  the vast majority of time 1 eur \u2248 9 sek . 
  even in extreme circumstances the rate does n't change by more than 10-20 % . 
  the same is true for other major european currencies ( besides the ruble ) . 
  i would like more skyscrapers . 
  the ones in london are a sight to behold . 
  however i do n't know if there is enough demand for them and space , as they tend to be in the city center . 
  it really feels that way . 
  i think a lot of people would be very against the idea of extensive welfare states and extremely high taxes ( i assume that 's the approach nordics would prefer ) . 
  it would surely be much better than now but there would still be much dissatisfaction and so no not everyone will be happy . 
  ignoring that it was an obvious sarcasm/joke ofc . 
  there are alternatives to oil and when the price of oil gets high enough those alternatives will see huge development . 
  that being said oil prices are projected to fall again ... 
  the only private university i can think of in sofia is new bulgarian university , which is notorious for letting students pass exams who should n't have passed them because they pay relatively huge ( in comparison to public universities ) fees . 
  so they let them pay another year . 
  the problem you described was very prevalent in the 90s but i think it is now relatively solved . 
  it is a requirement that the exam commission is made of 2 or more randomly selected people so the change of bribe is significantly lower and you have to bribe more people . 
  however to what extent the rule is followed in universities not in sofia i do n't know . 
  this does n't happen ever . 
  there are numerous clauses that state that if a student proposes money for exams or other evaluations there are severe consequences . 
  and those are strictly enforced . 
  either your cousin is studying at the shittiest university in bulgaria or is lying to you . 
  as for his comment it is actually the other way around . 
  a lot of small towns and villages around the border depend heavily on greece . 
  there are a lot of people that regularly travel and work in greece because wages are so much higher . 
  those people worried that if greece defaulted they would be basically fucked . 
  both us and bosnia were pegged 1 to 1 to the deutsche mark so that 1 bgn = 1 dem and when germany switched to the euro they valued it at 1 eur = 1.95 ... dem so that is where the bizarre exchange rate is from as far as i know . 
  dear slovakia , we need them more !, 
  i am in slightly in favour of political union and it would obviously benefit bulgaria as it would be a huge net receiver of money . 
  in such a case there should n't be any fiscal sovereignty on the part of bulgaria . 
  however this is not what is happening here . 
  greece is asked to give up its sovereignty but greek people can not choose the people that they gave that sovereignty to . 
  you can see how such an arrangement can be a very unattractive option . 
  they are giving their future to someone who might not hold their best interests at heart but also someone who they can not punish in case he fails . 
  edit : upon closer inspection this is precisely what you said ... 
  i feel stupid for writing this comment . 
  i get the feeling that some of those countries went to the meeting not to discuss the greek problem but to basically force greece out of the eurozone . 
  is this the eu we want to build . 
  one with no solidarity , no compromise ... for the longest time i was on the side of the creditors but maybe i was wrong ... 
  this is so cool . 
  sadly we do n't have any building of such height in bulgaria although there are some projects . 
  do you have a picture from the bottom of the street looking to the sky ? 
  something like this : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/equitable_building.jpg, 
  i have none :(, 
  it might be because i am not all that well familiar with black culture in america as i thought . 
  in bulgaria employed roma people are not much poorer than employed bulgarians ( bulgaria in general is very poor ) and there certainly is n't any state based discrimination , although roma people have bad reputation among ethnic bulgarians . 
  however nobody would treat them differently because they are roma .

  thats how you get more hate . 
  you know what , im done with this sort of articles on both sides of the issue . 
  the smallest thing is taken to drive an agenda . 
  why dont we shut the fuck up at least until we learn what kind of deal the uk gets . 
  its because americans view diversity as african americans , italian americans , dutch americans , and we view it as muslims and christians . 
  id prefer a sofia with germans , spaniards , romanians way more than with just bulgarians . 
  but i aint seeing middle eastern people as good neighbours simply because they are not capable of assimilating to our laws and social norms . 
  public support shouldnt be the basis of economic treaties . 
  what the fuck do we know about shit like that . 
  merkel 's actions were admirable from a humanistic and ideological perspective . 
  but not reasonable from a real-world one . 
  from what i understand van der bellen isnt far-left and has a very reasonable immigration policy . 
  lol what bs . 
  im not sure whether id prefer the average nigerian/pakistani rather than the average roma . 
  i dont see how you can say the eu is a failed project . 
  has worked pretty well so far even with its hiccups . 
  was hoping it was the bosnian serbs and bosniaks working together . 
  if we can expect the classical balkans to happen anywhere it would be bosnia . 
  i am sceptical it will survive the next 20 years in its current form . 
  where to ? 
  are you thinking us/australia/canada or something more exotic ? 
  yeah of course but you still need to be able to power the country by other sources because renewables are very unaccountable . 
  you will never get a continuous surge of power as it fluctuates and stops periodically, 
  not before doing their own bombardment of the city . 
  considering the soviets got to berlin first i dont see how the us couldve gotten to warsaw faster than them . 
  you poles and your fear of nuclear energy haha . 
  aye , i think krakow , budapest , bucharest and sofia are the most polluted cities in europe . 
  meh , people were just confused on when the actual brexit would occur . 
  but its pretty annoying having to see 100 threads that the uk is doing as well as before the vote and people using that to drive their leave campaign agendas when even negotiations havent even started yet . 
  people believed that letting the muslims immigrants live the way they did in their birth countries would cause no issues . 
  but it did . 
  im not afraid i just want gender equality and secularism . 
  most certainly is still enough to contribute to the level of uncertainty . 
  hasnt it created economic shock by the pound falling by .2 in a couple of days to the $ ? 
  and all sides have agreed that it has created uncertainty which is only magnified by your government not invoking art 50 . 
  the quote is so vague it is hard to know the extent of damage the treasury proposed would happen in the months after the vote . 
  but even then , i think its rather unreasonable to expect major consequences at least until some details about the deal uk will strike with the eu is revealed . 
  if the uk decided to stay in the eu in a norway kind of way there will be little change . 
  because technically the government doesnt have to abide by the vote . 
  of course but what is crazy is thinking the country would be on fire by now and using the fact that it is not as an argument that the inevitable brexit wont negatively affect the country . 
  literally nothing has happened yet to cause any changes except for people losing faith in the currency which then lost some value . 
  but but 2 months after a non-legally binding referendum . 
  i have seen less rocky mountains than that beach . 
  i feel like a big problem is that if i moved to germany and lived there for 40 years , got citizenship , spoke perfect german , i would still not be german to the people who know i was born and raised in bulgaria . 
  which is something that wont happen in the us , for example . 
  people need to belong to something bigger and if that is denied to them in their new country then they will revert to their birth ones . 
  yeah i agree . 
  i feel like federalisation would push towards a more common form of government rather than the one we have now . 
  whatever happens i think moving towards a federal europe is the best way for us to get to make the most changes . 
  i dont see the difference between the guys in our parliament and the eu parliament where only a part of the mps are bulgarian . 
  ** edit - ** i dont think / u/siprus raised a bad point , in fact it is one of the biggest arguments against federalisation currently so i dont think he deserves the downvotes . 
  if the option of federal europe ever arises we need to make sure that local government is not removed and that federal governance and administrations is chosen for only the matters that would benefit us because they are done on a european level like regulations , some laws , currency , etc. 
  balkan airways , where they serve grenades and ak-47s instead of lunch . 
  you are the ones in the sea . 
  alone . 
  what will play the biggest part is when brexit actually happens depending on the deal they get . 
  what will decide the future of the eu is how much people will want to be involved with the project and the result of the leave will heavily affect the people . 
  who the fuck cares . 
  when it comes to things like these what is important is where the person was raised and educated . 
  the guy died in 1948 but if his places of birth to be proud of are washington and moscow i would guess it was between the end of the war and his death . 
  who cares ? 
   i think deciding what 's should be the normal desire of women is pretty sexist too . 
  i think we all agree that they should be free to dress and live the way they want . 
  however in strict muslim families they are not free to dress the way they want . 
  they are not free to live the life they want . 
  at least until they `` learn '' to want to live the way their husbands and families want them to live . 
   also , if you wanted to abet the issue you 'd treat it at source , not ban it , by banning you 'd simply remove a symbol that bothers you stylistically , but people involved wound have the same mind frame in the addition they will feel ( rightly so ) they are oppressed . 
  how do you deal with the issue ? 
  its not like nothing has been done in western europe to battle extremism , and it is not working . 
  instead we see muslim protests against revealing clothing driven by women who sound like they have stockholm syndrome . 
   and actually you can see that this is the case when it comes to `` burkini '' the ban of the swimsuit that covers the entire body , i think the face if visible so it 's not a `` security '' issue like presumably burka is , it 's just a way to remove something you do n't like . 
  okay but i personally am not really driven by the security argument . 
  for me the burka and burkinis are a much more serious issue as it is a foundation of the radicalisation of european muslims . 
  if some aspects of some cultures do not match with europe 's values of equality , liberty and secularism then they can not be allowed . 
  with burkas it is a very difficult issue . 
  i am sure there are women who want to wear them and those who do not . 
  but those who do not may be forced into wearing them due to family and societary pressure . 
  plus as / u/w4hammer said it is not a religious custom , so who in their right mind would want to wear this , especially in the summer when it becomes a health hazard . 
  it is a sexist tradition forced upon women who can not find the freedom and support to not abide it . 
  turkey is joining germany ? 
  i am also open to the idea . 
  first they just need to cover 99 % of the requirements , deal with the breeches in civil and media freedom and find a solution to the cyprus problem . 
  same as the eu has been saying for years . 
  there is no chance they enter the union in less than a decade just based on all the requirements they need to cover . 
  it rose because the remain campaign was said to have won . 
  you want credibility from whom ? 
  random reddit commenters ? 
  if they knew about the 2 year negotiation period they would not have expected too many changes until then . 
  but the whole country is not under the ocean so all the economists were wrong ye ? 
  amazing , people are upvoting comments like these . 
  what sheer ignorance . 
  the pound fell by .2 ( to the $ ) points that day and is still .14 less than it was a month before the referendum . 
  this is as much as its going to happen till article 50 is enacted and till the actual brexit . 
  there cant be any real consequences yet because all the treaties are still intact . 
  the fall in the pound was just people losing hope in the currency due to expecting future negative changes . 
  many people forgot about the 2 year negotiating period and thus expected harsher consequences earlier . 
  but its been only 2 months and all the changes have been only driven by negative expectations of the future and no real-life reactions . 
  you got ta crawl before you walk . 
  its getting better . 
  emigration is shrinking and birth rates are rising in bulgaria .

  i 'll try explaining it as eloquently as possible - it shows they are savages . 
  simple enough for you ? 
  yes.it.most.certainly.is . 
  thank.you.robot . 
  sure , the westerner . 
  whereas those lovely people in the middle east never do anything wrong . 
  or the chinese passing dying people on the street , or the japanese exploiting teenage girls , or the indians treating women `` great '' , or the ever pacifist africans . 
  no , it 's those bad westerners that have a lot to answer for in their daily life . 
   why ? 
  because i 'm a human and the only biological purpose for my existance is the furthering of my species , not that of others . 
  if other speices ca n't further their own existance evolution demands their extinction or adapting . 
  empathy exists as a practical tool of furthering co-operation between the members of a species for the sake of helping the entire species . 
  that 's why i feel empathy towards those members of my species that are yet unborn and despise the selfish choices of some members of my species to kill them . 
   nonsense , they do both . 
  their minds are still there , just like when you sleep . 
  just measure their brain-waves and it becomes clear . 
  if they were brain-dea , however , we woul pull the plug . 
  without the brain you do not think , you do not exist . 
  the same is with fetuses . 
  brain activity has been detected in fetuses as early as the 11th week , whereas abortions are done as late as the 16th . 
  you just confirmed it 's murder even by your own personal logic . 
   putting a stop to that process at any given point is directly interfering with the biologically predisposed development of a homo sapiens organism , and thus - murder . 
  alzheimers and other deaseas destroy the mind as we know it in their later stages . 
  they are still people and they are still alive . 
  i do n't equate human life with that of bacteria , pigs , any sentient animal or even primates . 
  i never claimed to be some pan-species defender of life , so do n't try to call out some level of hypocrisy from me - i 'm openly biased 100 % towards homo sapiens sapiens and no other life form . 
  humans ca n't be killed mercilessly except in self defence . 
  all other creatures can . 
  a person in a coma does n't feel and we do n't know whether they think either . 
  nor one under heavy sedation . 
  they are people nontheless . 
  there 's only one action humans take to create life - conception . 
  from there on life develops itself from a fetus , to an unborn baby , to a newborn , to a child , to a teen , to an adult , to an elderly person . 
  putting a stop to that process at any given point is directly interfering with the biologically predisposed development of a homo sapiens organism , and thus - murder . 
  they had time to think about what they are doing , which is taking a life just because a 9 month pregnancy and delivery would be too hard on them . 
  i understand they might also use that time to delude themselves `` how horrible '' the life of the child most certainly would be if they gave it up for adoption ( which is utter bullshit and the worst excuse ever to kill someone ) , but it does n't change the fact they conciously decide to terminate someone 's life . 
  killing and stealing are even more natural . 
  nothing excuses hurting other peopel for your own pleasure , be it physically or emotionally , as cheating does . 
  studies i read whilst at uni showed the psychological trauma of cheating is often close for the hurt one to loosing members of your family and the effects it has , including physical , similar . 
  there 's no excuse to hurt someone so bad because you were horny and could n't just bust a nut at home . 
  i know people who ' v had opportunities and resisted not because it was some excrutiating battle and they were strong , but simply because it was their personal position in life when regarding infidelity . 
  i ' v cheated twice and both times the temptation was n't anything more than it is any time you have a chanceto flirt with an attractive person of the opposite gender whilst in a relationship . 
  but i did n't care that much for my girlfriends at the time , and did n't care much for how the act itself reflects on my life choices . 
  i like to think i ' v grown since then and live by some rules now rather than just desires and urges as when i was in my early 20s . 
  neither opportunities nor the level of temptation has subsided , but i ' v not cheated on any of my previous 3 girlfirends . 
  it 's a life choice - i wo n't do something i consider immoral and a form of betrayel . 
  and when you take such a stance you see how others , like my friends from uni , could so seemingly easy resist temptation - it just becomes normal not to regard the possibily of fucking another girl whilst in a relationship . 
  if you ' r that horribly horny you go home and jack one off , rather than jump in bed with another and then lie to your so like a peace of trash . 
  which makes it even worse when they choose to go through with it . 
  having sex is in our bilogical programming and you can do it as much as you want with as many people as you want without ever betraying the trust of someone you are committed to . 
  cheating is nothing but a selfish desire to have it all - a committed partner in a cosy relationship , and the trill of hooking up with someone . 
  it 's egotism . 
  if you want the thrill break up or decide on an open relationship ( in which case it is n't cheating ) . 
  what 's disgusting is n't the sex or the human drive , it 's the betrayel of someone for a bit of pleasure . 
  if you feel the need to hyperbolize his statement in order to ridicule it you most likely feel ok with cheating . 
  according to my belgian professor at leuven the subsidies are huge only because a lot of people in france are still connected with family or history to the rural areas , particurarly the older , since most of the population lived in rural areas until the 70s ( as in most of europe ) and only the vast urbanization of the 70s and 80s took them to the cities . 
  even today the farmers have a strong political power due to that and plenty of people take their side in politics since most have family members , usually older who were born on farms , or extended family that still is . 
  agriculture is just somewhat idealized and farmers have a disproportionally large political influence over their negligable economic one , to be able to get such massive subsidies . 
  the economy , however , is far too big and developped to leave agriculture as anything but a minimal factor . 
  does n't it take a negligable percentage of france 's gdp and trade ? 
  at least according to wiki : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/2012_france_products_export_treemap.png, 
  you must be the edgiest teen at your school . 
  tell these ignorant relieguous people how stupid they are !, 
  i thought it might be that but it seemed far too much . 
  i thought serbiah had a more industrialized/service based economy than ours . 
  could n't find a definition of gvp . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  how important is agriculture to the serbian trade and economy ? 
  oh please do give them money . 
  house them too . 
  just anything that keeps them from returning . 
  bulgaria outright risked an invasion from hitler refusing completely to declare war against the ussr or participate in the invasion in any way . 
  not a single soldier when to the ussr . 
  bulgaria remained the only axis country to keep full diplomatic relations with the ussr . 
  it even sold ammunition for the first 2 years that was vital to the defending russians . 
  it also was the only axis country to refuse to send its jews to camps . 
  bulgaria was only axis to save itself from destruction when hitler knocked on the door at the time that the ussr was allies with him . 
  for all of this it got `` repaid '' by being declared war on the 5th of september 1944 when it had already expulsed all germans , occupied and have its entire intellecutal ellite slaughtered . 
  the occupation of the rest of eastern europe is entirely the product of traditional russian expansionism as well , and do n't call the ww2 `` not initiated by us '' , since it was exactly the hitler-stalin alliance that began it . 
  the rest of you comment is so devaut of basic understanding of how the eastern block economies worked it 's astounding . 
  there has rarely been as inneficient and broken system in history , you call it perfect . 
  that has to be some a grade propaganda you ' v been injecting . 
  and btw , i and all my friends are by far way richer and better off than my parents and all people in this country during communism who were n't party nomenclature . 
  i thank capitalism every day and spit at the memmory of the disgusting social experiment brough here by the invading asiatic barbarians . 
  and russia invading eastern europe all the time . 
  i do n't recal bulgaria invading russia even once , but i do recal our country declared war against , occupied and fucked for 45 years by moscow . 
  same goes for most of eastern europe . 
  oh , the dreaded czech invasion of russia !, 
  oh the horrendeus hungarian conquest of poor mother rus !, 
  how dare these aggressors not trust the kremlin with their security ... 
  true , but urbanisation in bulgaria is quite high , at 77 % it 's more than 10 % above all our neighbours , so there 's not that much rural people to account for the overal unemployment . 
  sofia alone has almost 30 % of our population and unemployment here is on a germany level . 
  about 10 % of our population are from the gypsy community and their unneployment is estimated at over 78 % , so i guess it 's safe to assume our overall unemployment of 9.8 % is heavily inflated by the minority . 
  among bulgarians it would be closer to 5-6 % . 
  russia creating a shield around europe is like letting the wolf build the sheep-pen fence . 
  how can you call bs a refusal to let the country most detrimental to european security in the past 70 years and the only one still fighting wars on the continent participate in its common defence ? 
  there 's no one europe has needed to defend itself from since 1944 more than russia . 
  you do n't seem to know which countries in europe are catholic . 
  either that or your bias is showing . 
  first mentioned in the 930s on a column in preslav .

  i just hate that they promised no preliminary negotiations before article 50 and now they do it . 
  sure . 
  that will pass with sanding ovations in all member countries . 
  i suspect they will vote to give 5 % of their gdp as gift to uk as well . 
  monthly . 
   why the hell erdogan would start a war with the west when the nation is on turmoil and when he has already an open front with syria ? 
  why not ? 
  if erdogan sees as utmost importance to shut down schools and charities , i do n't see why his logic will not lead him to that . 
  charities ?!, 
  slacker ... should have started with kiosks . 
  imagine the damage they will do when revolting with bags with ice !, 
  eu expects to keep full right of movement for eu citizens in uk ... 
  ... sweet board member job for the child of the guy , vacations bookings , setting tender conditions to fit only one company product , letting some one live in luxurious villa for indefinite time , borrowing expensive cars , and thousand others methods . 
  stop this . 
  his name has to be forgotten . 
  it is ridiculous that you help him live on , while his victims are remaining anonymous ... 
  i agree they have to follow the law . 
  but will they even bother to even consider that ? 
  knowing the police is reluctant to enter their areas, 
   at least here they are not free to do whatever the fuck they want , here they will end up in jail . 
  are you sure ?!, 
  do you have even a single example of similar situation that was punished in the past ? 
  do n't forget that in your country they give community service as punishment for manslaughter - as they did for that indispensable footballer that killed an person while driving with 100km/h in a 50km/h zone . 
  well , technically the asshole is in power in turkey for the last decade . 
  most of the assholes are already in netherlands much longer than that ... 
  but i agree they should pack and go back to chant his name 24/7 on the streets . 
  too bad you ca n't apply what some adults do when two boys fight each other : throw both of them out and let them sort it out before they are allowed back . 
  or maybe to suk - semi-united kingdom . 
  with 2 kingdoms leaving ... 
   withdrawing without invoking article 50 would be very much the `` nuclear option '' , but it 's an option that remains open . 
  i 'd call it `` suicide option '' . 
  i do n't see a reason why uk should not enjoy 2,3 , maybe even 5 years of the very nice deal they have now until they leave ... 
  if you sign a contract to pay rent for an apartment , the money is still yours but you have to pay me on a certain date . 
  otherwise , courts , account blocking , etc will follow . 
  i do n't need tanks indeed . 
   funny part is , you state you are bulgarian , which is not a developed country and has benefited massively from globalization . 
  or has it ? 
  bulgaria , compared to bangladesh is ultra developed . 
   then do n't have to listen to the court . 
  it does n't work that way ... you cant negate a contract by changing stuff after it was in power . 
  otherwise i will just take loans and hop to other countries . 
   actually some people are investigating the possibility we do n't trigger 50 at all . 
   we just repeal some legislation in parliament and then tell you we have left . 
  that 's very interesting !, 
  i an genuinely curious how could this happen ? 
  any link , please ? 
   personally i would rather we stayed i also would prefer you to stay , but on equal level with all . 
  no exceptionalism and exempts . 
  just to make sure we do n't positively discriminate some based on their nationality . 
   you also need to drop this entitlement to my tax money . 
  why ? 
  eu is a club with membership fee . 
  i do n't see german tanks on uk soil forcing you to pay up , do i ? 
   when you 're the paymaster anything is possible . 
  when there are formal contracts , laws and that kind of unfair conspiracy against uk , the paymastery comes secondary . 
  you have a contract that you have to fulfill - pay your contribution . 
  in the mean time feel free to compete against other scientists and institutions to get grants for projects that last years . 
   and receives little for it ? 
   weird how people are ok with this . 
  yep . 
  i am absolutely peachy about it . 
  it is like when you sign a lease for 1 year and you want to break it after 6 m because you want to go abroad . 
  it is all great that you have new plans , but you have to pay the rent till the end of the year . 
  whether you use the flat or not - it is up to you . 
   we should n't pay for them if our teams are being frozen out , actually , you must . 
  as long as you are a formal eu member , you keep all the obligations and benefits . 
  but i do n't see how you can force anybody to collaborate with you . 
  so you get a lot less benefits . 
  deal with it . 
  grin and bear . 
  keep the stiff upper lip . 
  well , you will . 
  until you are formal member of eu , you have to pay . 
  if you do n't get anything back ... well , though luck !, 
  you should absolutely do that !, 
  it is not fair to give money and get nothing/little in return !, 
  however , collaboration and hiring of uk citizens can not be forced on other eu countries . 
  but on the other hand , you have legal obligations to give money ... 
  therefore , the simple solution is quite obvious , frankly : - today , trigger article 50 . 
  - tomorrow , tell eu that you exit immediately without any negotiations . 
  this will cut the `` giving money but not getting anything '' from 2 years to 2 days . 
  pretty neat , eh ?

we have [ these guys ] ( https://www.cooolbox.bg/za-doma ) but they charge 12.50 $ :(, 
  i would n't jump to the conclusion a higher employment rate is necessary a good thing . 
  it means fewer people with free time , and less happiness in society overall ( of course , work is just one aspect of happiness ) . 
  if more people are content to sit at home and not work , then good for them . 
  people looking for work but not finding any is bad , though ( and this is what unemployment reflects ) . 
  good luck determining what we are genetically , we 're incredibly mixed . 
  yet it 's hard to deny bulgaria is culturally slavic and romania is culturally latin ( albeit with heavy slavic influences ) . 
  well , in the northwest there are no jobs and no infrastructure - not a single kilometer of motorway . 
  the land is not particularly arable so even agriculture struggles . 
  young people are looking to move to either sofia or abroad . 
  if you look at the chart in the article , you 'll see that we 're actually among the less centralised countries in europe . 
  not that everyone being equally poor is a nice thing . 
  the difference is the racism in other european countries is not toward europeans and as such wo n't be noticed by as many people in r/europe . 
  it 's hard to deny the racism toward arabs and gypsies in eastern europe for example . 
  this photo has a very half-life 2 vibe for some reason . 
  is lgbt acceptance the single cultural difference between the west and russia now ? 
  come on , you 're being extremely narrow minded here . 
  only 20 years ago western europe was far less accepting of gay people . 
  i think you need to give the east a little longer to catch up . 
   us , canada , australia , new zealand , ireland , scotland you ca n't cherry pick the `` nice '' nations . 
  what about india , pakistan , sudan , egypt , uganda ? 
   and what are you telling me , greeks are anything like danish ? 
  they 're not . 
  the greeks have much more in common with the danish than the indians have with the irish . 
  you must have a very superficial view of culture to claim otherwise . 
  i hope [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_europe ) might help you identify some similarities , 
  there is absolutely nothing in common between the british empire and the eu . 
  the british empire came to being through conquest , subjugation and exploitation , to the benefit of britain and britain alone . 
  the eu is an association of sovereign states who decided to work together for the common good . 
  most subjects of the british empire were never able to vote for their representatives in the parliament . 
  citizens of eu countries can vote for both national assemblies as well as the european parliament . 
  the british empire included territories with vastly different culture , wealth , spread all over the globe . 
  how could a union including india , sudan , and australia ever survive ? 
  the eu on the other hand is composed of white , christian countries with shared history , geopolitics , and to some extent , culture and language . 
  the empire fell because it was unsustainable . 
  things are looking much better for the eu . 
   translation below refugees are taking food out of refugee shelters and selling it , showed an investigation by nova tv . 
  the journalists even managed to buy some of the products at a market in the bulgarian capital . 
  what 's being sold are croissants , canned food , milk , and cheese . 
  during the early afternoon , the women 's market is busy with commerce . 
  a strange man pulls a tub of yogurt from a large bag . 
  the price : two for 1 lev ( 0.50 euro ) . 
  he explains he 's coming from afghanistan and received the wares from `` military ramp '' ( a refugee camp in the outskirts of sofia ) . 
  he also sells cans of food : at 3 lev for 4 . 
  the situation has been going on for months , say the traders at the market . 
  the refugee center confirmed the man lives there . 
  he has been warned that his actions are illegal . 
  `` he explained that his children do not eat yogurt and in afghanistan , it is common to sell what one ca n't consume '' - said plamen penov , director of the refugee center . 
  the refugees receive food from the shelters daily . 
  the ca n't sell the cooked food , but only sealed goods such as milk and cans . 
  the poultry the nova reporter purchased from the refugee turned out to be a donation from the red cross . 
  `` in respect of this , we worked together with the security company to check the baggage of people leaving the shelter , so that does n't happen again . '', 
  - said plamen penov . 
  the agency for refugees has warned the ministry of internal affairs of the ongoing illegal trade with food , so they can increase the police presence at the women 's market . 
  feeding a single migrant costs 4.20 leva ( 2.10 eur ) per day on average . 
  the refugees ' meals are quite varied ; an inquiry shows that refugees received yogurt 4 times in the last week , and canned meat once . 
  to prevent illegal food trade , every can given to the refugees will now be opened at the point of distribution . 
  decades ? 
  bulgaria and romania joined in 6 years . 
  scotland can probably join in one , as it 's a developed free country . 
  well , that took a while to click . 
  ukraine , with population of 45 million , is the largest country in eastern europe aside from russia . 
  that 's not big enough ? 
  the map compares total gdp and you 're a pretty big country . 
  if you do n't already own real estate ( and real estate ownership is very high in most of ee ) , yes , you could buy a decent house or apartment if you save up a few years of average western europe wages . 
  i assumed the op was asking about moving permanently . 
  if you move , your family and friends wo n't move with you . 
  money does not equal happiness , not by a long shot . 
  for most people , the change in living standards would be quantitative : a more expensive car , more expensive electronics , perhaps more expensive brands of clothes . 
  the change in your social life will be qualitative : it will take you some time to make friends , if you do at all . 
  in some countries such as the uk , you * will * be treated differently to a native by a large swathe of the population . 
  that 's not a recipe for happiness . 
  russia is 4x more expensive ? 
  that is suprising as salaries in russia are a fraction of the french . 
  what 's going on there ? 
  why is the economy a factor here ? 
  besides , what about all the other eastern european countries which joined schengen in 2007 ? 
  poland in 2007 had a lower gdp ppp/capita than bulgaria in 2016 . 
  but macedonia never existed as a country prior to the dissolution of yugoslavia . 
  poland did , for centuries . 
  note that croatia has been historically richer . 
  what you see when you visit a country ( the buildings , infrastructure , etc. ), 
  was not accomplished in a year - it 's the result of many years of economic activity . 
  since croatia has been always been richer than romania , it is still more wealthy , even though it may be less productive . 
  it will take a few more years for the wealth difference to disappear . 
  i 'd say it 's just friendly competition . 
  we always compare ourselves to romania because you 're closest to us economically and culturally . 
  the discount version of finland - netherlands if you will . 
  not big enough to show up on statistics - we 're not africa . 
  i am more willing to believe that people living in rural regions ( of whom there are more in bulgaria and romania ) do n't have the easy access to processed calorie-dense foods that urban dwellers do . 
  so they eat less , and more healthy , although perhaps not intentionally . 
  that 's interesting because very few bulgarian words end in - u. 
  also , sobaka is not a word in bulgarian at all . 
  i think your teacher might have gotten confused with some other language . 
  we are given free money and we * still * fail to manage it properly . 
  injecting a further 1b in the economy would easily add 1 % to our gdp growth . 
  why do romania and bulgaria get comparatively less than more developed countries such as greece , portugal , and the czech republic ? 
  i always assumed poorer countries get more funding per capita . 
  i do n't see what your problem is . 
  are you being forced to read everything you see on r/europe ?

  what do you get when you combine nationalism with socialism ? 
  these grades have long ceased to be a meaningful economic indicator , and are now used for purely political purposes . 
  i am wondering what america demands in exchange for this upgrade . 
  i do n't think the european elites care much about what the european masses think these days . 
  if turkey joining fits their interests , they will let it in . 
  i thought cyprus was an extension of the anatolian peninsula ? 
  actually turkey has [ a pretty descent gay parade ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaoxe61q-rq ) every year in istanbul . 
  compare that with parades in some eastern european countries . 
  without the eu , the uk is likely to be reduced to an irrelevant island off the coast of france . 
  it neither has the industry nor the natural resources to remain a dominant player in the global geopolitical scene , especially in comparison to such behemoths as the us and china . 
  the only way the uk can remain relevant is by exercising its influence through europe . 
  how lovely - motherly russia coming in to protect its orthodox brethren . 
  perhaps it can survive , but it will not thrive . 
  my cousin emigrated to sweden in the 80s when there was persecution against turks in bulgaria . 
  she went to graduate a university in sweden , and gained an excellent command of the swedish language . 
  married a swedish guy ( despite some opposition from her family ) , and last time when i visited her told me that there was a noticeable difference in responses to her job applications . 
  with a turkish surname she could hardly ever get responses , but when she got her husbands surname the responses poured in . 
  most of the discrimination that people face in europe is usually quite subtle and overt . 
  it is a pity not only for the people that are being discriminated , but for the overall economy as well , because people that are perfectly capable of doing their job are denied the right to do it for some archiac prejudices . 
  nothing in what i said above is false . 
  soon they will be mulling taxes on the right to breath and drink water . 
   ... , bulgaria , ... 
  there is a difference between not recognizing gay marriage and outright banning it . 
  as far as i know , bulgaria has no legislation on gay marriage . 
  it is not recognized , but i do n't think they are any obstacles to it being recognized at some point in the future . 
  so if a referendum were to be held , what do you think people will vote ? 
  i think a lot of people underestimate how important food is for their health . 
  you are what you eat after all . 
  paying slightly higher for good healthy food is far better than stuffing yourself with junk that will ruin your health down the line . 
  what a lovely and forward looking country the eu has admitted . 
  i am sure they are going to fit right within western liberal values . 
  enough taxes already . 
  the eu bureaucracy has just turned into a gigantic parasite sucking the life blood of the productive economy . 
  if things continue this way the parasite will soon grow far bigger than its host , and both the parasite and the host will die . 
  what is needed is smarter governance within the existing tax structure . 
  i think a far better option thane enabling ads would be to donate directly to the website , rather than let unsolicited ads clutter up your precious screen real estate . 
  i was recently checking out amazon.fr and comparing prices with amazon.de , and prices were consistently higher on the french one than the german one . 
  i am wondering what other taxes french merchants have to put up with . 
  the uk and france have been great cheerleaders for the rebells/terrorists fighting assad . 
  turkey is merely the executioner , the order for `` fucking up a country '' comes from much higher up . 
  ataka is not nationalist , it is fascist . 
  it 's supporters openly talk of concentration camps for minorities , and turning them into soap . 
  they also frequently march in paramilitary formation , and use violence to intimidate their opponents . 
  they also have a symbol reminiscent of the swastika . 
  does n't gerb have some ethnic turks among its ranks now ? 
  it would be interesting to watch how they would interact with the ataka party if such a coalition were to form . 
  another interesting possibility is for the conservatives and the turks to form a coalition . 
  turkey 's objective is to incorporate syria into its economic sphere of influence , not to starve the syrian people of water . 
  as for it being opportunistic , when states fall apart other states step in and fill up the vacuum . 
  welcome to geopolitics 101 . 
  when you play with fire you eventually get burned . 
  erdogan 's little adventure in syria of sponsoring and aiding terrorists fighting the regime , seems to be blowing up in his face . 
  debts that can not be repaid wo n't . 
  it is the responsibility of the banks to assess the risk and ensure that they give out loans only to people and entities that are likely to repay them . 
  in this case they screwed up and should face the consequences . 
  that 's the recipe for a successful economy - people that make good decisions should reap the benefits of their success , and those that make bad ones should face the consequences of their mistakes . 
  to talk of debt as if it were some form of private property is barbaric and reminds me of some form of bondage where the bond holder has sacred rights over his debt slave . 
  i think what the eurozone needs is debt repudiation . 
  wow !, 
  the know-it-all commission , not content with its deep unpopularity , is now sticking its nose into what farmers have been doing for thousands of years , and is telling them what they can and can not plant . 
  this is just pathetic . 
  you are right that some islamic texts prescribe punishment for [ zena ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zina ) ( unlawful sexual intercourse , i.e. 
  intercourse between individuals who are not married to one another , encompassing extramarital sex and premarital sex ) , that can range from 100 lashes to stoning to death according to the exact school you follow and the exact circumstances , but the punishment is equal for both sexes . 
  the usual explanation given for why women have been targeted more is because it is easier to to detect when they have lost their virginity by the torn hymen , whereas with men unless they have some condition with their foreskin ( which muslim men have removed anyway ) , it is almost impossible to ascertain whether they have engaged in sex . 
  all people that are alive today have a mother lineage that converges to a single woman called the [ mitochondrial eve ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitochondrial_eve ) , and a father lineage that converges to a single man called the [ y-chromosomal adam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y-chromosomal_adam ) . 
  y-chromosomal adam lived between 237,000 and 581,000 years ago . 
  there is no reason to suggest that y-chromosomal adam and mitochondrial eve should have lived at the same time and mitochondrial eve is estimated to have lived approximately 200,000 years ago . 
  so in essence if we go back far enough we all share a common father with different mothers , and a common mother with possibly different fathers . 
  honor killings are not condoned by islam . 
  they predate islam in the societies where practiced ( mostly arabs and kurds as far as i know ) , and go all the way back to ancient times far before mohammed ever stepped a foot on the sands of arabia . 
  mostly it is a function of the way these societies are structured , where the only way to avoid social ostracization is to perform the killing . 
  as sad as it is , families that are faced with living as complete social outcast that are rejected by all their neighbors and relatives , choose to `` cleanse '' their honor by murdering the individual who has brought in the `` shame '' . 
  this , or they can choose to immigrate to another place , but the options are limited these days . 
  it is easy to judge while living in a liberal society with no idea how strong social pressure can be to push people to do things that in another time and place would be considered totally reprehensible . 
  that this goes on in even seamingly liberal sweden shows how marginalized these immigrant groups are - that they attach greater importance to how they are perceived in their ethnic community , than to following the laws of sweden . 
  i am not sure what the best way to tackle this problem is , but public shaming on the media , and associating their names with this crime forever would be an effective tool . 
  i hope they reject it outright . 
  patents , while having the noble intent of promoting innovation , have long ceased serving that purpose and are now primarily used to protect big corporations from competition , and serve the exact opposite purpose - they stifle innovation . 
  they rejected it because they thought they could get more concessions from turkey once they joined the european union . 
  i think it 's probably more for lack of record keeping than of us being clean . 
  wonderful . 
  we are now getting our daily dose of serbian propaganda . 
  in the turkish dialect spoken in bulgaria , we use the word `` salata '' . 
  the stance of most bulgarians is that macedonians are ethnically and linguistically identical to them , and have developed a separate national identity over the past century largely because of serbian propaganda . 
   anti-religious this one seems to be pro-christian . 
   elsewhere on orkan , singer \u00d8rjan stedjeberg refers to muslims ' `` unforgivable customs '' and calls for a new `` kingdom '' to `` shine through [ the ] bad years , shame and ** christian ** times '' . 
  i do n't think europe will decline in absolute terms . 
  what people mean by decline is usually a relative one . 
  other parts of the world will begin to grow much faster , and their significance will increase relative to the one held by europe . 
  communism in bulgaria had quite a ring-wing flavor , especially right before its downfall in 1989 . 
  the communist government propmoted a nationalistic ideology , actively persecuted ethnic minorities , and engaged in the notorious [ revival process ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revival_process ) for the assimilation or expulsion of the turks in bulgaria . 
  so in general this is nothing new - the radical left and radical right have been historically quite close in bulgaria and holding hands behind the barn for quite some time now . 
   organ harvesting of serbs in kosovo according to the article the victims were mostly from outside of serbia :  would-be donors from turkey and poor parts of the former soviet union were lured to the clinic in pristina , called medicus , on a promise of 10,000-12 ,000 euros ( $ 13,000-15 ,600 ) . 
   more than russia does , for instance . 
  including greater willingness to be a part of the club and play by its rules . 
  willingness to play by the `` rules '' set by the eu is more a function of the size of the country and its geopolitical power than anything else . 
  russia is too big to be easily pushed around by the eu , whereas smaller countries do n't have the same resources to protect their interests . 
  those are not the only things that europe demands . 
   `` lie like turks '' your quote is inaccurate . 
  google returns [ no relevant results ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lie+like+turks%22 ) .

  then the communist regime was imposed by the red army and the entire nation robbed of its private property , property rights , entrepreneurial rights , travel rights , trade rights , even communication with the outside . 
  for 45 years this regime continued and all wealth in the country was national , in their hands , within state owned factories , trade groups , pension funds etc. 
  when the regime saw what was happening in the ussr and that the block was about to fall - they quickly stole all that money by `` selling '' it to themselves . 
  the same people who were controlling all money and property in the country , thus deciding what value it had for privatisation , sold entire factories to themselves for pennies . 
  then they looted what was privatised , sold all machines or land and became the billionaires . 
  so effectively the communists robbed bulgaria 2 times - once in 1944 when they imposed bolshevism and robbed all of the private property ( including my family of our family house ) , and then again in the 1990s when they looted the wealth now held in national accounts under the planned economy . 
  the result i explained already - a country with equal population and gdp as greece in 1939 is just a couple of generations later 4 times poorer , 40 % less populated and many times less developed infrastructurally or in any way , shape or form . 
  the pivotal difference between the two is the date 9th september 1944 when our country was occupied by the red army and the communist regime imposed , given free reign to rob the nation twice . 
  oh shit , savage . 
  yet you know he 's not wrong . 
  everything exhibited as turkofilia in bosnia is 100 % the same , and often stronger , in serbia towards russia . 
  they feel like the small brothers of the turks , you do of the small brothers of the russians . 
  they feel only turkey is their protector in an environment of hostile neighbours , you feel exactly the same with russia . 
  they act as a geo-political bootlicker of ankara , you do so of moscow . 
  they rigorously defend turkey from criticism and in arguments with people from other nationalities - serbs do that constantly with russia and more often when i criticise russia on the internet i will end up having serbs attack me than russians . 
  so the entire situation is kind of the pot calling the kettle black . 
  some suggest pushing the relations to the bottom are a way to smoothen an eventual drop of the sanctions as a `` necessary emergency measure to restart relations '' after they were purposefuly pushed to the bottom . 
  strange they did n't invite bulgaria . 
   is leftists an insult ? 
  of course . 
   poor bulgaria literaly . 
  we had , in fact , one of the more `` successful '' if that can ever be applied here socialist regimes and quite a high standard compared to the block . 
  yet this was followed by the most brutal robbery of the state by that very same regime in the 90s , where pretty much every single thing that was nailed and owned by the state was privatised immediately to a selected few red oligarchs for free and then looted for the quickest buck . 
  all the money from the pension funds gone . 
  all the money in the foreign trade bureau of the regime - gone . 
  all the people 's savings in the banks - gone . 
  just like that , an entire nation was robbed to the core and we had to build shit up from the ground , from almost nothing , for the past 20 years . 
  ( by 1997 most was already stolen ) furthermore , as a result of the massive theft our population shrunk apocaluptically from 9 million to 7 million with over 1.2 million people fleeing to the west . 
  today we are 4 times poorer than greece and with 40 % lower population despite in 1939 being as rich as them and with equal population - that 's what communist regimes did to this country , more than any war in our history ever has . 
  he is quite adamantly shitting on everything polish in his comment history despite being a pole himself , so there must be a sincere reasoning behind this . 
  i am intrigued what it is . 
  - islam is viewed popularly as a medieval , regressive , oppressive , violent , aggressive and kind of proto-fascist ideology that threatens people in europe not only physically ( terrorists ) but also socially should muslims become a significant demographic group . 
  europeans with liberal world-view who value individualism , human rights and personal freedoms above all see islam as a danger equal to nazism or bolshevism . 
  turks are the largest muslim nation on europe 's borders and the largest immigrant muslim group in countries like germany . 
  - erdogan is considered a tyrant and an aggressive islamist who threatens to turn turkey into a catalyst of all i described above .

  that 's a good advise , even if someone in the west actually says that in his presence he wo n't be able to understand him and get offended , unless he 's one of few poles fluent in turkish . 
  where does your hatred of poles come from ? 
  lol , do you not know which sub you are to even be surprised by that ? 
  now try and post some mildly positive accomplishment of the third reich , see how many upvotes and what kind of comments that gets you . 
  i 'm quite happy and reassured our turks are secular and lean pro-europe and anti-erdogan . 
  it reassures me we might not face a `` crimea/donbas '' kind of scenario should eu or nato fail in the future . 
  yes , pardon i meant them , confused the abbreviations . 
  hdp is the kurdish one and chp the leftists , right ? 
  there 's a laz race ? 
  unlike the left 's totally rational ideas such as `` the patriarchy '' , dialectical materialism , intersectionality , multiculturalism and more . 
  totally not a modern set of social superstitions and myths ... . 
  our turks voted overwhelmingly against erdogan in this referendum ( ~ 78 % no ) , as opposed to the turks around europe . 
  traditionally they vote for hdp , together with western turkey , because our turks are secular , european kind , not the east anatolian migrants that go to europe . 
  certainly our turks have no desire to be `` liberated '' by a regime they oppose . 
  [ removed ], 
  [ removed ], 
  there are large numbers of arriving poles , moroccans , turks etc. 
  there ... but you wonder why people vote for the anti-immigration party and call them simply `` racists '' ? 
  could there possibly be a more obvious reason ? 
  am actually polish myself . 
  my grandfather 's entire family hails from macedonia from before ww2 and was thoroughly bulgarian . 
  same as a huge number of bulgarian artists , poets , politicians etc. 
  who openly proclaimed their bulgarian identity and worked , created or fought for bulgaria , from nikola vapcarov to gove delchev and many more . 
  of course the region had its regional independists like every other in europe , and those grew with each failed attempt of bulgaria to unify with it , but to proclaim `` all slavs in macedonia were non-bulgarian '' and some complete , fully realized macedonian nation , is to falsify history as much as claiming alexander and the ancient bs . 
  building monuments and claiming as `` macedonian '' historical serb , greek and bulgarian rulers and figures like tsar samuil or alexander is similarity disingenuous - how do you expect people to take your seriously if you do that ? 
  bulgaria . 
  my grandfather faced from the tiniest , most petty bullshit to serious impediments in his life . 
  from something as petty as being the only kid in elementary school who did n't receive a dessert or gift on new years ( instead of christmass , which was not celebrated ) and this done in front of the other kids as an example , to things like not being allowed to purchase an apartament or later a car , so instead these were bought on his wife 's name , my grandmother . 
  he was not allowed to leave the country as well , unlike the grandma who travelled a lot around the ussr on work . 
  ( chemical engineer , visited lots of plants there ) the secret services of the regime kept an eye on him and a dossier , which we found out about barely a decade ago when the archive of these was opened publicly . 
  yugoslavia is literary where the people started mass murdering each other on ethnic and religious lines the minute the regime fell apart , so it 's possibly the worst example to give of what you are trying . 
  my grandmother 's family had their house seized by the regime in 1944 , raised and an ugly block built in its place , which they filled with party functionaries who had earned the privileged of living in the capital . 
  my family was `` compensated '' by being given the right to buy a flat in said block , which they did using all of their savings . 
  6 people , my grandma and grandpa , her father and mother , and my mother and aunt , had to all live in said small apartament despite grandma being a chemical engineer and her husband an architect , the kind of people who in a free market society can easily afford not to live crammed . 
  my grandfather 's father was killed in 1944 as an officer of the royal guard of the tsar . 
  my grandpa was 9 at the time and spent his life in the regime as branded `` son of an enemy of the people '' , with severe restrictions and punishments . 
  since i talk of two groups of societies in my post - traditional , ethno-based ones , and such who have embraced post-racial , post-national multiculturalism as their goal , i fail to see how ee does n't all fit into the same , former category , unless you can point to one or more ee societies that have also embraced the post-modern idea of building a post-racial , diverse society like the western ones have . 
  there is no greater prevelence of racism in eastern europe than in most of the world outside those few western countries where the goal of establishing a post-racial , post-ethnic society has been embraced . 
  hence , nothing special or unique about racism in eastern europe . 
  you disagree with that ? 
  eastern european societies are as racist as any african , mid-eastern and certainly less so than the east-asian ones . 
  nothing strange about societies that have not decided to become post-racial and multicultural , like the western ones have . 
  and albeit racism towards individuals annoys me as a social phenomenon , i find it less of a price to pay than what follows when societies steer towards the radical post-modernims , post-racial , multicultural national nihilism of the west . 
  we are talking region-wise . 
  check out maps of the us showing that date to see it . 
  finally one good joke in this thread . 
  but making dark humour or shocking jokes is not a sign of being dumb . 
  if anything , such humour i have always found to come from witty and people of more intelligence and education , like carlin , hitchins , dawkins , sam harris , louis c k , bill nye , prince phillip etc. 
  i disagree with this statement . 
  the government in russia never even attempted to pass into free market economy , let alone a `` hardcore '' one . 
  a free market economy consists of as little government control in the economy ( hence free ) , and thus maximised competition between the actors . 
  russia 's government instead passed from a government controlled planned economy into government controlled market economy . 
  there was never a free market , never a free privatisation . 
  those within the government sold assets to themsleves and then continued to use their government ties or positions to enlarge their assets or take those of their rivals . 
  this is not a free market economy , it has nothing to do with it in fact . 
  this is still an economy controlled by a few people in the government , and continues to be so . 
  a free market economy , like those in europe for example , mean the ruling prime minsiter or president can do fuck all to take your business away or sell off state assets to his close friends . 
  merkel ca n't become a billionaire over night like putin did , because germany has a free market economy . 
  putin could , because russia never had that or tried to have it - it had a government controlled economy , which merely opened itself to the market in 1991 , but remained in the hands of those in power . 
  and it 's also one of the most prosperous and developped parts of germany . 
  `` the redneck '' regions everyone described and their original meaning - the us south , imply a backwards , poor region in the given country .

  but people love to classify themselves by language family for some reason . 
  and in case , romanians and bulgarians are genetically close to each other , but that does not mean that they are close to russians . 
  yeah , i know . 
  but i do n't believe that i need to act in a manner perceived as arrogant by the above poster . 
  i believe in self determination for peoples . 
  anyway , it seems like even serbian and bulgarian are closer than some german dialects , so it 's a little moot . 
  a language is a dialect with an army . 
  it sounds a bit softer than the bulgarian spoken in sofia , like the words are more rounded . 
  it was ~ 95 % intelligible for me , but i was also surprised at how much i understood from all the south slavic languages , even slovenian . 
  i 'd say maybe izmir is the most liberal city in turkey . 
  no worries mate . 
  shutting the parties down is not really an option . 
  most parties are connected to the shady underground in one way or another . 
  plus , we would have a ton of pissed off turks and nationalists at once , which is not a good recipe . 
  thankfully , we have pretty much driven ataka out of office by not voting them in . 
  dps has become so associated with the ethnic turkish minority that i 'm not sure that the party will ever completely leave . 
  as it is , there are no parties that are even competing with dps for the turkish vote . 
  well , except for mestan 's new party , but i do n't think they have a shot . 
  one more thing that i forgot about dsp is that delyan peevski is an mp for them . 
  he owns something like 70 % of the media in bulgaria , print , radio , television . 
  when he was nominated to head the bulgarian version of the fbi , it prompted [ over 1 year of continuous protests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%e2%80%9314_bulgarian_protests_against_the_oresharski_cabinet ) . 
  he is still an mp with dps , but thankfully never got to be head of the agency . 
  the next problem is that the 2 bigger parties bsp and gerb are n't much better . 
  bsp is also very strongly pro-russian . 
  it 's the remnants of the old communist party , with a lot of ties to russia still . 
  gerb , for all their pro-european talk , also appear to have shady dealings with the russian oriented underworld . 
  at the beginning of this year , there were some judicial elections , where members of the constitutional court had the chance to elect a reformist , supposedly something gerb is interested in . 
  but the gerb aligned judges and the dps aligned judges together voted for the status quo candidate . 
  not to mention the judicial reforms which have been stalled for forever . 
  the whole mafia-party structure in bulgaria has the nickname ` the octopus . ', 
  because there are many heads ( parties , businesses ) , but it 's all one big beast dragging the country down with its tendrils . 
  i know in turkey there is talk about a ` deep state ' controlling the countries fate ( or there was , before erdogan ) - in bulgaria you could say we have a super corrupt deep state that cares only for enriching itself and pleasing its foreign benefactors . 
  at the present , i 'd only trust that the reformist bloc even thinks about bulgarian development for bulgaria 's sake . 
  but they only have 8 % of seats in parliament . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/russia-and-turkey-fight-for-control-over-obscure-but-powerful-political-party-in-bulgaria/article28938032/ ) is pretty good - but only scratches the surface , and is only about dps ( also called mrf , the english acronym ) . 
  you pretty much got it right . 
  there is a lot of scaremongering in bulgaria about turkey , but it pretty much goes like this : - russian backed nationalist party ataka ( or others now ) says , look out for the turkish party , they are secretly backed by turkey and want to take over bulgaria - bulgarian nationalists vote for nationalist party - russian backed turkish party dps says , look out for the bulgarian nationalists , they want to take away your rights - bulgarian turks vote for dps it 's kind of a ridiculous circlejerk . 
  and , by the way , most people do n't trust turkey as a country , but have no problem with individual turks . 
  of course there are armchair generals who will tell you how great bulgaria would have been without being conquered by the ottoman empire , and how evil turks are , but that 's really not the answer you would get by walking down the street and asking someone what they think of turks . 
  usually it would be something like , `` they are hard working and keep to themselves . '', 
  about mestan - in general he seems like an okay guy . 
  three things come to my mind about why i do n't like him though : - was part of dps , which is a pretty obvious mafia organization which pulls a lot of strings in the background - used to travel to turkey to meet with akp leaders to formulate strategies ( i do n't think any politician should do this , and it pisses me off when bulgarian politicians do the same in russia ) - when he was voted out as leader of dps , he went to find shelter in the turkish embassy . 
  the last two points make him seem like he trusts turkey more than bulgaria , even as a major political figure . 
  edit : one more thing about dps - they pay roma to vote for them en masse , and promise milk and honey ( aka fiscal investments in their towns ) to their followers , but usually keep the money for themselves . 
  dogan personally owns a ridiculous amount of luxury hotels . 
  one does n't need to go very far to find examples of christian 's that hold christianity before the law . 
  like the plethora of european countries that have equality enshrined , yet have homosexuality illegal due to it being immoral and a sin . 
  ted cruz saying he is a christian first , and american second , is another example . 
  that 's not true . 
  at its worst during stalin , yes , they were quite similar . 
  but the very fact that the ussr had changed by the 80s shows that the two are not the same . 
  the culture in the ussr allowed for some change , whereas in n. korea , it still does n't . 
  sure , agreed . 
  what does that have to do with n. korea ? 
  no personal attacks , please . 
  you could argue that n.korea is an artifact created by the un , as the un was the one that saved s. korea from complete conquest . 
  as to the oppressive version of n. korea 's regime - the ussr supported communist dictators in many countries , only n. korea turned out like n. korea , showing that its development was influenced greatly by internal politics and culture . 
  no personal attacks , please . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but did n't the un war crimes absolve serbians of genocide in bosnia ? 
  no personal attacks , please . 
  no personal attacks , please . 
  we had a pro-russia government which started this project , followed by a pro-west government which canceled this project . 
  i personally think we should have built it . 
  looks like we know where the money from [ this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/bulgaria-energy-loans-idusl5n17s11q ) loan is going to go now - russia . 
  please do n't link other subreddits . 
  your comment got removed by the automod because of it . 
  please refrain from personal attacks . 
  no personal attacks . 
  i would look at it this way - you have someone willing to do a little bit of extra work to tell you whether or not this is misleading . 
  it is clearly misleading , after a deeper dive . 
  this wo n't happen for every article/infographic , but if a mod has the time , then that provides a plus to the community , not a negative . 
  plenty of turks could pass as bulgarians - and vice versa . 
  plenty of thracians/thracian descendants ended up being part of the mix that makes up modern bulgarians . 
  this comes up every year when we celebrate the first of march with martenitsas , just as some greeks and romanians do . 
  not to mention that we celebrate the day of wine , an old thracian holiday dedicated to dionysus . 
  what bulgarian case are you referring to ? 
  i know there have been times of heavy assimilation , but not genocide . 
  greens have historically assimilated minorities at least as and at times even more aggressively than their neighbors . 
  they have only one officially recognized minority , who they call greek muslims , who happen to be turks and pomaks ( bulgarian muslims ) . 
  stalin and mao were prime examples of reshaping society in their vision , just as hitler was . 
  they took the sphere they had power in , and tried to reshape it into their ideal image . 
  i kind of doubt that . 
  all slavic countries have been experiencing rapid population decline since the fall of communism . 
  please post the source . 
  you 're assigning modern day stereotypes to hitler . 
  hitler wanted to eradicate basically all east/western slavs , and give their lands to german settlers . 
  south slavs , especially bulgaria , he seemed to like , for some reason . 
  the other thing is that hitler was fond of muslim countries , as he saw their traditional / family oriented culture to be more like what he wanted for germans themselves . 
  tourism is up this year - according to [ this news article ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/174660/bulgaria+reports+double+increase+in+tourist+numbers+ahead+of+summer+season ) burgas airport alone has registered an increase of 40 % during may . 
  there is a [ neat little graphic ] ( http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/7058/arrivals-visitors-abroad-bulgaria-months-and-country-origin ) in the bulgarian statistical institute 's website that shows where visitors came from and how many there were in 2015 ( 9.3 million visitors total ) . 
  you can also check out this graph : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/bulgaria/tourist-arrivals set it to 10 years , and you will see monthly visitor data . 
  the trend is up . 
  i think that 's a good way to look at it . 
  i do n't see gerb losing power barring some crisis or foreign behind the scenes intervention . 
  so unfortunately he does n't have much pressure to keep up with reform / improve the country . 
  only something like 2,000 greek companies registered in bulgaria in 2015 - and the vast majority do not create jobs when they do , simply do it for tax purposes . 
  there is a lot of investment in it , a lot of investment in chemicals , and a lot of investment in car parts manufacturing . 
  basically outsourcing . 
  which is fine , because as unemployment goes down , so does the amount of money being paid to bulgarians by multinational corporations goes up , more money stays in bulgaria , salaries start to rise , etc. 
  what there is 0 of , is a long term vision for bulgaria .

  how does that explain the absolute correlation of poorer states around the world having high crime rates ? 
  central america also exports a ton of its criminals , far more than poland , to the us , and yet it has high crime rates . 
  bulgarian organized crime also specializes in credit-card fraud . 
  it dominates this sector in europe actually . 
  it is by far not a fact that bulgaria is a relatively safe countries , or one without migrants . 
  we are absolutely crime riddled when it comes to non-violent crime . 
  there 's an epidemic of car theft in the larger cities and our police has a rate of crime solving of ** 4 % ** . 
  pickpocketing is huge , and so is home burglaries . 
  domestic crime is entirely not reported or tackled in any way , shape or form , and victims of such have no place to turn , unlike in western europe . 
  our murder rate is low , sure , but our assault and battery rate is very high , especially on the road . 
  and i think you are completely ommiting institutional and corruption related crime for some reason , as if it was n't `` crime '' . 
  we are champions of it , it 's rotten the entire state and businesses are routinely stolen , in their entirety , by paid judges who write the business off to new owners . 
  that 's theft , and we ' r plagued by it . 
  as for the `` migrants '' - lets be honest , you mean minorities in the west . 
  all of them , combined - those who recently came and those who are born there as arab/muslim minorities reach around 8 % -10 % of the population of countries like france or germany . 
  meanwhile , we have 10 % gypsies , who are far less integrated , working , paying taxes and much more prone to crime than their `` migrants '' . 
  so , no - we are n't in any better situation . 
  we have a shit ton of crime and a shit ton of ethnic ghettos , far bigger and far worse than their `` arab '' or `` african '' ghettos . 
  what we do n't have is their wealth and development to tackle this . 
  hence - massive emigration . 
  germany is 3 times richer , more developped , less corrupt , with better paid and organised institutions and police , twice less unemployment , hugely larger wellfare and social programs , etc. 
  etc. . . and * still * it is `` nearly '' as less crime as poland . 
  that does n't look like an anomaly to you ? 
  i know he 's being obnoxious with this comment , but when you think about it , why is eastern europe lower ranked here than western despite all other maps with criteria - social and economica , showing the opposite ? 
  should n't the poorer east have higher crime ? 
  what other explanation than the highly crime-intensive migrant enclaves make the west relatively higher ? 
  you do n't pay monthly in taxes as much as you will be getting in pensions . 
  not even 20 % as much . 
  this is n't how it works - the economy sustains the budget that pays your pension and the economy ca n't run properly if there are more elderly people than those in working age . 
  it 's your duty to make at least 2 children in your life with one other person to at least cover the two pensioners there will be eventually . 
  otherwise you ' r a strain on other people 's children . 
  europe 's and ther rest of the developed world 's greatest problem is the opposite - ageing , not overpopulation . 
  overpopulation is only a problem in the third world , mainyl africa and asia . 
  unless we are to replace our population with theirs , we should start making more kids . 
  according to society and economics , sure . 
  according to biology it 's the opposite - 40 year old mom carries enormous risks during pregnancy and delivery as opposed to an 18 year old . 
  you run from undefendable statements you make like a rat . 
  it 's pathetic and hiding behind swearing and sulking does n't work . 
  they did - half of them pretty much , that 's how bosnians came to be . 
  do n't wonder why africa-ridiculing memes and stereotypes do n't die . 
  400 years under turk occupation , numerous times fought for them as vassals against other christians , saved the ottoman empire at the battle of ankara by protecting the heir and entire treasury , helped the turks besiege vienna ... `` kebab remover '' . 
  lol, 
  your aggressive attitue a-la pissed off little kid feeling inadequate says otherwise . 
  what a waste of time . 
  i love bacon and meat , i by no means think we should somehow fight this , but to be honest , factory farming is shitty and cruel . 
  small-scale farms are much better at treating the animals ( seen it on my grandparents ' one ) and provide the profit directly to the people who work it every day , not to the corporate owners of huge conglomerates that just hire minimum-wage workers . 
  it 's better for the animals , it 's better for the workers . 
  but it would definitely reduce efficiency and thus quantity , increasing price . 
  which i see no problem with - we eat too much meat as it is in the developped world . 
  no reason why a steak should cost as little as a few tomatoes . 
  even though i love , i 'd glady see meat price double or triple if this means we treat animals far better than factory farms do , and give more to the workers . 
  i bet it would help reduce obesity in the developped world too . 
  this shit is n't worth me getting cheap meat : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdisr0lgry8, 
  first of all , i do n't get what this at all has to do with you misinterpreting the proposal of people here . 
  someone says `` lets have a unified , equal country between ukr . 
  etc. '', 
  - you say `` no thanks i do n't want to be occupied '' . 
  that 's nothing to do with being european , turkish , russian etc. 
  - it 's just you for some reason twisting the proposal of unified , equal state to occupation . 
  i was just asking you why you do that . 
  secondly , `` being european '' is n't about want or not . 
  you * are * european . 
  because you are in europe . 
  you ca n't be something else . 
  russian , moldovan , hungarian , and belarussian are also europeans . 
  finally , i have no idea why you say some want to go to other countries , what does immigration have to do with the proposal of people in this thread of a unified commonwealth-type country with equal ukraine ? 
  you seem to talk of very unrelated things . 
  i am not sure you understand what was being discussed here . 
  not sure why you mention that , i asked you why do you refuse `` another polish-lithuanian occupation '' , when this was n't the proposal of anyone here , but that of an equal state for the nations . 
  people talk of an equal ukr-pl-other nations state , whereas you refuse `` occupation '' - not talked of by anyone . 
  `` want cake ? '', 
  `` no , but no thanks , not a huge fan of bacon . '', 
  you ca n't `` google '' questions on the basis of validity . 
  as in what * should * happen . 
  it 's up to you to decide how you think it should be . 
  should the european union help european nations , or african and asian ones . 
  was n't his proposal of an equal commonwealth , along the lines of that treaty from 1658 ? 
  it 's meant to be `` the jews '' . 
  by european i do n't mean purely geographic , i mean a civilization that is composed of nations marked in the fundamental ways each of them was established and developped by the same major concepts . 
  greco-roman influence and the re-acceptance and re-development of it through the renaissance . 
  christian religion and the cultural developments connected with more than 1000 years of its complete dominance on the history of every single one of those nations . 
  the englightment era of rationalising the world through the scientific method , and the embrace of the core ideas of the 18th and 19th century - nationalism , the french revolutionary liberalism and modern parliamentary democracy . 
  there exists in the world a selected group of nations , a very specific list , that has had all of its members influenced by the above . 
  nations that can all look back towards 1000 or more years of christianity , towards similar developments in literature styles , music styles , fashion , painting and art as a whole . 
  in serbia compoers compose similar classical pieces in the 18th century to those in far away ireland and spain . 
  in bulgaria the writers were influenced by shakespeare or geothe , as opposed to ab\u016b \u02bfal\u012b al-\u1e24usayn . 
  as far away as finland you can see [ buildings ] ( http://valtioneuvosto.fi/documents/10184/158647/valtioneuvoston+linna+2/199f637e-fae5-4235-99b9-461ddb7aea08?t=1408017047380 ) that represent the re-discovery of ancient greco-roman classicism back in 14th century italy . 
  that is not how [ rabat ] ( http://www.fsr.ac.ma/cmss/images/rabat/rabat2.jpg ) looks like , despite being far closer geographically . 
  so yes , there is definitely a strong civilizational line separating spain and morocco , despite being much closer . 
  a line that puts most european nations into the same historical civilization , sharing more traits with each-other than with any other nations around the world . 
  hence , i find it entirely logical for closer co-operation and help between these nations . 
  as i explained already - charity begins at home . 
  help your family first , then your neighbourhood , then city , country , region etc. 
  the european civilization is our closest family - when no more nations live in abject poverty like moldova or ukraine , * then * we should go on to help others . 
  in what way ? 
  it is when deciding where the budget of the ** european ** union should go towards . 
  to ** european ** countries that need it desperately or to african , asian etc. 
  i think this should be a rhetorical question . 
  same with moldova or ukraine . 
  is it more important to keep azerbayjan stable ( by the way , they have tons of oil ) than ukraine ?

  they did not protest or revolt against ukraine or new ukrainian government . 
  it was all done by russian armed forces and putin had the only authority to give the order . 
  russia took over crimea . 
  that 's the fact . 
  now if polls showed that crimea residents support the incorporation of their peninsula in russian federation it does not change the fact that their homeland was conquered by russian army . 
  they did not revolt against ukraine in order to join russia . 
  i must admit it was the most weird map of all that thread - europe according to country x. kinda funny . 
  funny how many misconceptions !, 
  mini russia for bulgaria . 
  lol . 
  i bet there are more russian speakers in latvia than bulgaria . 
  never heard of it as a crisis . 
  i heard of yugo refugees . 
  there were even small amounts of kosovar refugees in bulgaria , but nobody referred to the refugee wave of that time period as - crisis . 
  do n't think i like the idea of a hedgehog living in my pants and inviting its relatives . 
  i do like hedgehogs , they look cute , they are not aggressive , not noisy as well , but with all the needles that covered their bodies ... hm it is not convenient to live inside my clothes :p, 
  now mister informed german . 
  i am bulgarian , in fact i claim bulgarians do know a lot more than westerners about the civil wars in ex-yugoslavia . 
  there were ethnic cleansing everywhere . 
  however it was not religious based . 
  yes , croatians did kick out many serbians out of their country once they got strong enough to do it . 
  yes serbians did the same to croats and muslims in bosnia . 
  yes kosovars did assault serbians in kosovo . 
  and so on . 
  you think you know something about the balkans ? 
  no you do n't . 
  in fact , as i worked in several western countries , you 're ignorant about our region . 
  yugoslavia was a secular state , and yugoslavians of any ethnicity were secularists . 
  again i have made quite clear in my comments that we have to distinguish between the `` old muslim migration '' and the contemporary wave . 
  islamic revival started roughly 20 to 15 years ago and change the trend in their societies from going to liberal to turning conservative and embracing islamic religious rules . 
  now what i see as the main concern is the fact that 2nd generation muslims in europe in fact accept that dangerous trend and the current wave may make that matter even worse . 
  never heard of refugee crisis back in 1994 . 
  an did you read the words `` islamic revival '' in one of my comments ? 
  i explained why contemporary muslim wave of migrants is very different than the immigration coming from islamic countries 30 or so years ago . 
  if you are unfamiliar with what `` islamic revival '' means , use google . 
  there will be many problems with the so called refugees . 
  do n't want to generalize , but contemporary muslim migrants are not like the ones that came to europe 30 or so years ago . 
  islamic revival which started around 15 years ago , radically changed the views of modern day muslims . 
  and i am scared that 2nd generation migrants in europe can easily become radicalized of such influences . 
  as i suggested , kick easterners out and stick to the muslims . 
  at least muslims do not drive drunk and kill people . 
  they 've got other reasons to kill . 
  i suggest you stick to the muslims and kick out easterners . 
  and after several years compare . 
  see i lived and worked in several eu countries . 
  never did get attached to any of them , they were well ... just work places . 
  but never created problems or showed disrespect towards their traditions or culture . 
  so why do they have problems now if they know how to manage with muslim migration ? 
  it is one thing muslims coming in small flocks , another thing coming in large quantities . 
  but do not worry , the problems have just begun . 
  and do not forget that 15 or more years ago something called `` islamic revival '' started . 
  if many of the muslims which were migrating to europe 30 years ago wanted secular lifestyle and education for their children , contemporary migrants are not like them . 
  ha ha ha ... romanians think in versions . 
  so there is original and versions of it . 
  i am lost now , can not comprehend your words . 
  huh , in fact i like hedgehogs . 
  they look cute . 
  things change if you put one in your pants . 
  english is not my native language and i used a simple example . 
  inappropriate i guess . 
  i am not familiar what wmds mean ? 
  taking all these refugees in germany and europe in general , is like putting a hedgehog in your pants . 
  problems will only be increasing . 
  if the western part of the continent think they had bad problems with easterners , well , now you will understand what real problems mean . 
  at least countries with large muslim minorities , like my home country , know what sort of problems they might cause and how difficult is to integrate them . 
  can the eu survive populism ? 
  no , either populism will destroy the eu , or the eu will destroy populism . 
  if someone knows other way around , please share it !, 
  many description of many countries connected with women or porn !, 
  french women should think wise and french men should think twice !, 
  austrians are obsessed with thievery ? 
  paranoid even lol !, 
  i lived in some european countries as well . 
  and to tell you the truth , i did not feel and do not feel attached to any of them . 
  they were well ... just work places for me . 
  will not recommend to anyone to be immigrant in europe , just go to europe , work , save up enough so you can start something or buy something in your country and leave . 
  european countries or europe in general is not the place where an immigrant should try building his/hers new life . 
  not that i understood anything of that map . 
  but that is the funny part . 
  i look at it and it is completely incoherent - funny lol !, 
  bulgaria is not poor because of the western part of the continent , it is because of the rampant corruption . 
  it is because bulgarian business is not innovative and creative . 
  it is because bulgarians do not unite . 
  it is because bulgarians do not vote for ideologies and political concepts , but vote for `` messiahs '' . 
  bulgaria - funny language . 
  funny map !, 
  romanians like to compare themselves with bulgaria . 
  obviously as they think they are better , makes them feeling superior lol !, 
  obviously most europeans like to travel !, 
  haha ... i lived on a greek island . 
  the greeks there were crazy about money and crazy about sex . 
  in other words they were dividing people - with money and less money , easy to be pursued to be getting laid and not easy . 
  and yes , greeks do prefer blonds . 
  where is the gate ? 
  amazing how those buildings survived all wars and were preserved . 
  any info about how many times and when they had been renovated ? 
  the fanatic communist is one of the good guys of europe , give me a break !, 
  and his real name is vladimir ilich ulyanov , lenin is just alias . 
  spectacular view !, 
  where is that ?

  actually it has a lot of bulgarian items and even one of the soundtracks is a bulgarian song . 
  now , it is a polish game , you ca n't expect is to reflect balkan culture exclusively . 
  fake money , fake democrasy , fake justice system , fake patriots , fake eco nuts , fake sallary , fake workers , fake meat in the stores , fake foods , fake girlfriends , fake relationships , fake fasebook friends . 
  since 1944 bulgaria has been a counterfeit country . 
  thank god when a rakia bottle says it 's 50 % alcohol , that is not fake too . 
  yep , most popular post on r/bulgaria is a halloween hate . 
  ironically , they are using the exact same local ritualistic rites to proose how `` outlandish '' the eirogayamrican haloween is . 
  i 'm also willing to bet that 90 % of them uppity ashole trditionalists who are so vehement about protecting orthodoxy , can not name the date of the the bulgarian all saits day . 
  i 've seen illiterate people being shown which symbol they should look for and scratch over . 
  while i do belive that e people like them still should have a right to choose a representative , they should ' t have a right vote on referendums on subjects they know nothing about . 
  that is why most normal democracies tend to avoid referendums . 
  it 's not the will of the people . 
  it 's the will of whoever can gather up the most idiots at the voting booth . 
  we have some great v.o. 
  voices , alas they are mostly used for soap operas . 
  saudi arabia ... 
  se what you reaction was . 
  now go ahead and tell me how developed they are . 
  actually , orthodox priests are allowed to marry . 
  compared to bulgaria the greeks are still doing quite well . 
  / no s, 
  ironically i 've seen a quite a few doctors sucking a fag . 
  there is a story on fb abou a woman getting scolded for telling off a doctor who went out to ligh a cigarette at the hospital entrance . 
  it would n't even surprise me it happens to be true . 
  one thing that i do not agree with in the table is the proportions . 
  yes , some men are chimneys , but most are occasional smokers . 
  women on the other hand - well it seems like 99 % of the sub 40 group is a smoker . 
  a pack a day keeps the doctor away . 
  ... no , wait , that 's not right ... also , we 're first , so `` yey '' , i guess . 
  tjere should be a warning lable . 
  title may cause uncontrollable laughter fit .

  hahha gluttony ... russians merely adopted eating a lot . 
  usa was born in fast food , molded by deep frying . 
  they did n't see a salad until the scales were already over capacity . 
  careful , bobo . 
  you do n't want to bite the hand that feeds . 
  yeah , and putin is very likely to start ww3 and the nuclear apocalypse . 
  that trumps some greedy suits and the radical cult . 
  every big city has `` no-go '' zones - poor , usually suburban neighbourhoods where minorities and criminals thrive . 
  there is a difference between illegal practices and a state approved slavery .

  i would have to work about 65 months to have earned this ammount of money and that does not account for rent or living conditions . 
  in other word i would have to spent about five years to have that ammount of money . 
  you 'll excuse me if i 'm not feeling very sorry for these migrants . 
  edit : used `` an '' instead of `` a '' . 
  definitely going to hell . 
  wait , did n't he get stabbed by one of his first maters ? 
  the discovery channel lied to me . 
  the brigit bardo foundation does not approve . 
  yes , foreign workers should also wear some sort of identification on them . 
  it could be a geotaggin braclet , but it would be far more economical to just use cloth armbands or some symbol to swe on their clothes . 
  what did columbus personally attribute to the slavery trade ? 
  he was an explorer . 
  thag 's all he did . 
  it 's like destroying a statue of einsteing because heroshima . 
  for f sake , he even got cheated out of naming the place , because of that vespucci guy . 
  yes , also , buy drugs , get stabbed , get chased by an ancient evil demon , or be a victim in a third-rated cop tv series . 
  excuse me . 
  i 'll be in my bunk . 
  well i guess you can fuck yourself ... 
  jesus , call peta or something . 
  that is no way to treat a horse , even a dead one . 
  how about a trade war between the us and china , beacuse of a certain power-wig was building a wall ... 
  while a peg is limiting in form , it does alow some wriggle room , especially in extreme economic situations . 
  bulgaria already suffered a major currency shock some 19 years ago . 
  economy is arguably stable for now . 
  there is no fortelling how the market will react to a violent change like this . 
  as an economist mo own predictions lean towards negative . 
  that has nothing to do with political views , as i support the eu . 
  there is no unified taxation across the eurozone , and that is a pretty big achiles ' heel . 
  as the bgn is pegged there are not actual benefits for adopting the euro . 
  the euro is in a very turbulent state . 
  now is a bad time to join , for simple volatility reasons alone . 
  patriotis - i do n't want to forgo the lev currency for historic and other reasons . 
  there are may people who do n't know jack about science . 
  they just love getting into arguments and bashing zealots . 
  the aforementioned also refuse to recognise that there may be religious people who are not complete retards and that fringe movements supported by a 0.00000 something percentage of the populattion are not representative of the religion as a whole . 
  creationism is a retarded american interpretation of the bible . 
  in fact , thoughout centuries , the church has been one of the biggest investors in education and science . 
  also , ironically , the big bang theory , which seems to have become the rallying call for idiots who support science , because it 's the hip new thing , was created by a catholic priest scientist and the layman explanation is heavily inspired by the bible . 
  well , i 'm european and for the better part of five centuries my people were slaves in the ottoman empire , yeah there 's that . 
  just some scientific heart cutting out and human sacrifices , nothing to bother about ... 
  it 's not a joke . 
  some of us have been rasing the issue of too easy citizenships for russians as a threat to national security and now an official russian politician gave confirmation . 
  disturbingly enough , there already are green men in bulgaria and the brainded secret services are doing jack because freedom of blabbing and etc. 
  seing as how , nevsky helped tamerlan islamise that other ( vologi ) bulgaria , i 'm thinking - no sale . 
  stop proliferating this myth if the helpless buttnaked afrikanes and indianes and the evil gun-toting europeans . 
  most of the times europeans were outnumbered 100:1 with no hope of backup . 
  tribes like the azteks and zulus were batshit crazy . 
  the world is better off for having whiped them out . 
  fuck russia and their tourists . 
  thanks , farrage . 
  30s now remember kids , when they open this time capsule in the future they are going to be fascinated by the way we lived and how our daily lives went on .
