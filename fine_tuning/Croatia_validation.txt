  of course , they can still negotiate , but at that point the uk is just another foreign nation making a deal . 
  now you might ask , why is this relevant , what 's the difference ? 
  the difference is that after the 2 years have passed , any deal needs a unanimous vote to pass . 
  any country can block any deal for any or no reason which means it 's in everyone 's interest to heed that deadline . 
  luxembourg is taking money out of your pocket . 
  they contribute quite a bit , but the bank assets in luksemburg are over 1600 % of their gdp and they were 3000 % of their gdp before the recession . 
  that money , more than likely some of it came directly from you and almost certainly should have been taxed in your country . 
  if hungary freeloaded for the next 1000 years , they still would n't be worth mentioning in the same sentenca and that 's not even considering that when the next big attack happens in europe , odds are the terrorists funding came through luxembourg , because , fun fact , if you were to discover and reveal those funds , you 're breaking a law , a criminal one no less , that carries quite a bit of jail time . 
  the real joke here is that this is coming from luxembourg , one of the principal tax havens on the planet . 
  former home to the world 's most corrupt bank , shut down because it was involved in the slave trade , the nuclear arms trade , the drug trade and 50 different kinds of money laundering and tax fraud . 
  naturally , they did nothing to shut it down them selves and are still involved with some of this planets biggest monsters . 
  when kim jong il decided his money was n't safe in switzerland , he sent it to luxembourg . 
  luxembourg is currently trying to become the islamic banking capital of the world . 
  i 'm willing to bet any sum that the cash used to buy isis equipment , propaganda and training at one point went through luxembourg , but ask the average person about the country and everyone thinks they 're little angels . 
  obviously this has nothing to do with the average citizen , but the foreign minister can go fuck him self . 
  i 'm genuinely unsure if this is a conscience deeply riddled with guilt talking , or if it 's a way to loudly tell the saudis that he 's their guy , so please send your money to luxembourg . 
  no , they 're just helping the people helping the rich evade taxes or they 're profiting off them . 
  the city does not attract money by being transparent and ethical . 
  works is a relative term . 
  helping the rich evade taxes and the ctminals to pay them while skimming of the top is time consuming and it 's an activity , but i find it hard to call it work , much like i would find it hard to call robbing a store work . 
  doubtful . 
  the uk was the eu 's no 1 supporter of the ttip . 
  it was already a tough sell and became tougher still . 
  the us really wants it to happen and the eu does n't so they 're the ones who have to sweeten the pot , which leaves them little room to negotiate for stuff that others want . 
  allegedly . 
  there 's basically no difference between pakistan and afghanistan in the border region and everyone familiar with the area knew that . 
  people move between the two all the time making the invasion absurd on it 's face . 
  a special forces team might have caught bin laden in afghanistan , but an army coming in basically guaranteed he would just pack his things and move a few miles away in to perfect safety . 
  because here , he 's untouchable . 
  no one is sending him to prison for rape . 
  however , back at home , and admission of having consensual sex might be a problem . 
  the religious fanatics do n't care how rich you are , so you constantly keep up the pretext of bein a devout muslim . 
  any excuise other than having choosing to have sex is ok . hell , he could probably get away with saying that he was seduced and could n't control him self , but had to lie at court because `` the westerners just do n't understand that it 's the womans fault . '', 
  and the guy who planned it , and his second in command and all the people who financed it , but they were in pakistan so the army had to invade afghanistan and iraq . 
  we have national armies is an assertion . 
  we have national guys with guns and uniforms , but weather of not those are actual armies is unclear . 
  in the case of say , a russian invasion , if we were to assume every country has a fully functioning army , the proper way for poland to mount a defense is to find a defensible line and hold it at all costs . 
  you do not want the front line to be in the middle of your country . 
  however , can poland truly trust that the rest of europe would mobilize in anything close to the required time to help . 
  let 's ignore the us for a moment because while they 're the principal deterrent to war with russia now , they might decide to look inwards at any time for any reason and ca n't be counted on in perpetuity . 
  if europe ca n't come and help , you need a different strategy , because holding a line against a vastly more numerous foe is a death sentence , and after breaching the line , it takes a modern army no more than a day or two to cross all of poland and arrive at the german border where there is likely to be little in terms of fixed defensive positions , because you thought you were going to be fighting in poland , not in germany . 
  if nothing else , we should at the very least have a joint air force since establishing air superiority immediately is critical , but having a common army is ultimately what 's required to safeguard europe . 
  countries that feel safe will inevitably drag their feet , cut corners and basically be useless in a fight . 
  using the same equipment , under a common command structure you have a proper army . 
  what we have right now is maybe 3-5 proper armies and 20ish ceremonial institutions that put civilians in uniforms . 
  exactly this . 
  you do n't look like me ? 
  do n't care . 
  you constantly act in ways that i find objectionable ? 
  now i care . 
  europe is for europeans and being european is a state of mind . 
  people who share that state of mind have been coming here for a long time , but now we 've open the floodgates and let in the very people secularists , homosexuals , non muslims , progressive women and other marginalized groups from muslim were trying to escape . 
  i already told the story about my friend from bosnia who became a nurse in germany , but went back home after her neighborhood went to shit and she started getting constant verbal abuse from unemployed foreign assholes who wanted to explain why her being a whore was unacceptable to them . 
  now she 's back and i get to hear a bit of bosnian daily gossip and it 's seemingly all about the saudis . 
  they 're sending huge sums of money , but it comes with their own personal brand of hate and a sense of snobbish superiority over the locals . 
  the migrants are going to bring that in to europe as well . 
  they 're the poor , downtrodden mask behind witch hides the wannabe rulers of the world by means of cultural domination and constant low level violence . 
  property can be gotten for cheap , and potentially even for free depending on where they would build the plant as the jobs would incentivise government aid and the handing over of unused government property . 
  supply lines are trivially easy to reroute , especially if the parts and materials are n't coming from the uk , assembly line workers are by design replaceable , and if they build their plant close to existing or former auto or vehicle factories , a trained workforce already exists . 
  new plants are certainly nice , but so is cheap labor . 
  if they went to say , poland , they could likely get existing factory floors for free from the polish government and get workers with years of experience working with cars . 
  poland already has 130,000 auto workers and makes close to a million cars a year . 
  the czech republic makes more and while it 's workers are a bit more expensive , most of them are exceptionally good at their job , comparable even to german auto workers . 
  romania is the cheapest of the bunch , but has a surprising amount of talent that 's getting noticeably better each year . 
  that 's before we even go in to the options you get if you 're willing to spend more and go to where the big players are , germany , italy and france . 
  you are grossly overestimating how hard it is to move your whole operation overseas . 
  the textbook example is the soviet union moving their entire industrial base over a thousand kilometers deeper inland , in a matter of months , using rail rather than ships and while being at war . 
  a more recent example is the exodus of us manufacturing to mexico after nafta and to china . 
  you can also look at factories who 's companies suffered bankruptcy . 
  you can see locusts looking as the plants are disassembled and taking notes . 
  a factory assembly line is modular . 
  parts are standardized and used in every line a company has . 
  this is so that you both benefit from economies of scale , but also because you can replace any part , any machine , any single line , or every single line with minimal disruption to production . 
  as far as workers go , the auto industry was the first to create the system that all but eliminated the need for skilled labor . 
  before fords assembly line , you needed multiple highly experienced engineers working on one car at a time , or one major car part at a time . 
  ford 's assembly line took every part of the car making process and divided it down in to simple , easy to learn , easy to repeat actions for the precise purpose of taking the jobs away from highly skilled laborers and giving it to basically anyone willing to do the job . 
  this removed the bottleneck of needing a massive amount of highly skilled labor , but also meant that by design , every line worker was easy to replace . 
  it 's not a gun so much as bluntly explaining their position . 
  they ran the numbers and in no uncertain terms came to the conclusion that anything short of basically staying a de facto member of the eu means they have no choice but to leave . 
  it 's like a tenant telling a landlord that if the rent goes up , they 're going to stop renting . 
  there 's no threat here , just a simple statement of an economic reality . 
  i would n't overestimate the costs . 
  you do n't have to build a plant from scratch . 
  when outsourcing happened from the us to mexico and china , they used existing factories and infrastructure and they merely had to transport the existing equipment from one factory to another . 
  moving a factory is far , far cheaper than building a new one . 
  while it was an extreme example , stalin managed to move his entire industrial base in mere months while being chased by the wehrmacht . 
  modern factories are n't all that different and are surprisingly easy to move . 
  it 's not something you want to do , but if it cost billions , there would n't have been anywhere near as much industry leaving the states . 
  this is in spite of being told point blank that this is precisely because their decision made staying in the uk non viable . 
  it 's absurd when you think about it . 
  the first question anyone should have asked is : `` do our products get sold in the eu ? '', 
  if they do , especially if that 's where a large percentage of goods is going , the fundamental equation of why a plant is where it is , suddenly changes . 
  someone sold them a bag of goods and told them they were special and irreplaceable . 
  workers in a car factory , the first industry to do away with irreplaceable workers by dividing every task in to jobs basically anyone could do . 
  factory workers though are replaceable by design . 
  that 's the whole basis of assembly line . 
  you take a complex job that at one point would have required a master craftsman and divide it in to 5 , 10 , 50 smaller tasks , easy to learn , easy to repeat and given to unskilled workers who can suddenly replace decades of experience within hours or learning a few simple motions . 
  it 's brilliant as it allows for economies of scale that were impossible to achieve do to a lack of skilled labor , but it essentially turns every worker in to a simple part of a very large machine . 
  not only is every worker replaceable , they all have multiple replacements on other shifts and even on the same shift . 
  people doing the exact job day are , day in , day out .

  i can tell that when it comes to the `` dozens of srebrenicas committed upon serbs during wwii '' , they 're called genocide . 
  because they are genocide . 
  they 're just not called separate instances - the dozens - because they were all part of one policy . 
  as i said , i agree that using a single pic to prove an argument is weak . 
  at least you should link court sources in such contested cases . 
  or idk , actual war footage which is much harder to fake , lord knows we have a lot of that . 
  but your point that those pics are contested because `` someone on internet says '' they 're actually from vukovar is also not helpful . 
  `` someone on internet '' will also say that holocaust did n't happen , and they 'll use that to deny every single piece of photography/footage/etc etc. 
  and this is actually the 2nd time i 've seen that outrageous `` source '' spreading horseshit . 
  if / u/derloladin goofed with a weak argument , your dismissal of it should n't have been even weaker . 
  aside from using a single pic in an argument being lame ( it is , i agree with you there ) ~ you have any source for those links that happens to be more legit than ... someone 's blog ? 
  and a * forum * , of all things ? 
  preferably blogs and forums whose `` source '' is n't broken links and yet more blogs/forums ? 
  actual police/even army reports would be helpful . 
  now i am familiar with revenge killings happening during that war . 
  but it 's ... odd ... that you mention vukovar , since the vukovar defenders were mostly dead to a man by the time vukovar fell . 
  ( most of the rest were either captured or massacred . ), 
  `` november 19 , 1991 '' ? 
  * vukovar fell by november 17 . 
  * [ it was controlled by jna . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vukovar_massacre#timeline ) `` neo-nazo skull crushers '' ? 
  ohh ... those fine sources you linked also go on and on about `` albanian organ thieves '' , presumably they 're `` jihadist albanian organ thieves '' , because why not . 
  ** your source ? 
  as far as i can tell , it 's about the heaviness of the word itself . 
  people immediately think `` holocaust '' when you say genocide . 
  because obviously they do , and just as obviously nobody wants to be associated with that ( extra troublesome because one of the foundations of republika srpska would then be literally hitler ) . 
  but genocide is misunderstood by * meaning * . 
  numbers mean nothing , only the intention to exterminate a certain ethnic/religious/etc group of people . 
  for example , france and germany go to war and millions of civilians die . 
  but the aims and the plans of that war are n't extermination but for example annexing each other 's clay = not genocide . 
  ( war crimes , yes , every civilian death is a war crime . ), 
  another example , turks set up an extermination camp for kurds but only manage to kill a few thousand . 
  it 's about * intention * ... though apparently some debate even that , cause women mostly were n't killed . 
  ( though they were raped , and war-rape was mostly done with the goal of them getting pregnant , which iirc counts as genocide too . ), 
  can we stop it with the storm = genocide/cleansing narrative ? 
  it 's been debunked by every court that pieced the facts together , and it 's frankly tiring . 
  they were literally [ ordered to evacuate * by their own leaders . 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm#4_august_1995 ) now we can argue about why they felt they need to leave before/as a military action happened ( military , as in , army vs army which is perfectly legitimate seeing as that army happened to be illegally occupying 1/4 of our territory ) until we 're blue in the face . 
  but if civilians running away from battlefields is genocide , maaaan my own city was genocide 'd and i never even knew that . 
  tbh i think it actually is n't . 
  looks very striking ... you may even say , [ meme-worthy .

  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/1b048b3d89f40c18fbae2983995dd452.png ) it also remains to be seen how much investors will want to get into uk after it does n't have easy access to the rest of eu anymore . 
  not sure about army sizes etc. . . 
  i would n't be surprised if usa dominated that one as much as it dominates economy . 
  ( which is why nato is usa-by-default , and also since eu countries put together would make for a respectable army , why not federalize that bit ? 
  we 're usa 's yes-men atm . ), 
  so ... you do have some advantages . 
  ( like a respectably big population of workers/consumers , many know-how 's etc. ), 
  but the way you 'll be negotiating with usa/china/india / brazil will need to be very different . 
  nah , i understood you right . 
  i 'm agreeing and adding to your comment , since it was rather short and has long chains of disagreements ( not sure where to add mine in that , so i 'm `` hijacking the top comment '' so to speak ) .

  not only that , but \u0160e\u0161elj 's party ( the guy burning flags , spewing hate and who was very active in yugoslav wars ) got 8 % of the votes in their 2016 elections . 
  seriously , what 's up with that . 
  that 's wholly legit line of thinking , or rather feeling , as well . 
  after all , home is where your heart is . 
  i just do n't think it 's necessarily in your ( not speaking to you specifically , but generally ) homeland . 
  you could just try moving somewhere else , not living `` here '' might be preferable to not living at all . 
  not at all , good burgers are usually around 5 $ here and i 'd say it 's worth it . 
  `` normal '' sandwiches ( some grilled/fried meat and vegetables ) cost around 3 $ . 
  just a little caveat , it 's ` zagre ** b ** \u010danec ' , there 's no change when writting it down . 
   zagreb - zagreb\u010danec fixed that one for you .

  its sheer size is quite impressive , so at least some credit goes there . 
  i never heard people grumbling about that church and i also kinda like the modern touch on them , so you 're definitely not alone .

   i 'm curious , how would you characterize them , compared to various other empires quite alright i guess .

  you 're a bit more than a decade late . 
  because `` centre '' was zagreb before .

  i 'm not sure what statement you 're talking about since the one i quoted is the very first to be mentioned .

   eastern europeans think they 're entitled to a job in the uk or western europe simply because they 're white .

  your comment does n't really address the fascist problem though , which / u/solewanderer wondered about . 
   ante kotromanic said earlier in the day that his country `` has no hostile intentions toward serbia '' . 
   warmongering clickbait at very best . 
  i wonder whether even more complaints in more cities will surface now that so many had already come out . 
  someone will have to do a recap on all this . 
  hillbillies and football hooligans are two different things . 
  whether there could be an overlap , i 'll leave it to you to figure out . 
  not so sure , i 'm not too informed on how it goes in dalmatia . 
  they 're seen as rednecks/hillbillies , lacking the manners of someone from the city . 
  i 'm of the opinion that someone can always slip by , but here 's hoping i 'm wrong . 
  i 'm pretty sure jihadists are n't armed when returning to their countries ( uk , france , etc. ) . 
  nor are all vocal about going to jihad . 
  of course not . 
  but can you be sure that the one who went to jihad murdered someone ? 
  what i 'm saying is you ca n't simply imprison people for going to jihad , nor you can 100 % sure who went to middle east because of jihad . 
  as is now , you 'll have jihadists returning . 
  the key point is if we have lawful reasons to . 
  i 'm not an aficionado of all the legal systems throughout europe , but i 'm pretty sure you ca n't imprison them for going to participate in jihad . 
  there should be some solid proof of their wrong-doing , and you probably wo n't get that in the mess that middle east is now . 
  even if it was illegal to jihad in syria and co. , how would you know ? 
  unless there is footage , for all you know they may have just went on vacation . 
  historically , vlachs in croatia were mainly orthodox people who came here after ottoman conquest in south-eastern europe ( that 's how they are reffered to in documents ) . 
  but i think it 's a broad term . 
  today , there are some in istria , and they speak istro-romanian language . 
  i never heard of them facing discrimination . 
  however , there are vlaji in dalmatia ( do n't know how relevant that is ) and they are seen as backward villagers with all the other `` honors '' that go with it . 
  there 's also `` boduli '' , who are mainly people from the islands . 
  that would be two derogatory terms in dalmatia . 
  i never heard of the two being used in zagreb however . 
  and considering how little there is of them , it would be odd . 
  so take it with a pinch of salt . 
  it 's definitely not common . 
  i 've never heard of that . 
  there 's vlaji in dalmatia , but i do n't know how relevant that is . 
  of course . 
  i 've just skimmed over some weather forecast , and it 's supposed to be below the freezing point over the next few days .

   hopefully the political `` promotion '' ( read : lots of poo flinging ) will calm down soon . 
  i doubt it , at least in zagreb it will not calm down . 
  the second round is in two weeks , right ? 
  so that 's another two weeks of poo flinging .

  we already de facto have a multi-speed eu . 
  you should also refrain from leaving comments like this one , consider yourself warned . 
  pretty much . 
  the european community can be given credit for a lot of things regarding keeping peace on the continent , but they failed so miserably in the yugoslav wars that the americans had to intervene . 
  this is a common misconception among people from coastal croatia ; if croatian tourism took a major hit , people from istria and dalmatia would suffer the most , not people from continental croatia . 
  blaming everything on zagreb is a traditional pastime in dalmatia but it has no basis in reality .

  that was the inspiration according to the guy who designed it , but it 's not what it symbolises today . 
  nah , his name was nikola tesla and he was born in croatia . 
  wait ... 
  exactly , pr teams of european institutions could be a lot better . 
  i also blame local journalists for not giving european events enough exposure and not reporting what 's going on in bruxelles and strasbourg . 
  yes , i wish we had more such manifestations troughout europe so that people really feel that their country is a part of something bigger . 
  very nice , we had a similar thing in zagreb on the european square last year , every country had a stand where they offered local specialities .

  on one hand i want more people to know about croatia so we can attract more tourists and get more monies , but on the other hand i do n't like crowded beaches in the summer . 
  habsburg dinasty best dinasty 1527 best year of my life bring monarchy back on a more serious note , austria is economically essential to croatia , it 's one of the biggest trading partners , many of its banks are present here , many tourists come from austria and many croats go skiing there .

  if the french intelligence agency was attacked on bora-bora , that would be news . 
  russia counts as a european country so even though this did n't happen in geographic europe , it can be posted here . 
  well russia is in europe . 
  i 'm just saying orban is not the only * european * leader to congratulate him . 
  neither are we in britain , write however the fuck you want . 
  putin also congratulated him . 
  yup , there were celebrations there on sunday when the referendum passed . 
  they also like to cheer for turkish national football team when they play against croatia . 
  perhaps bosniaks . 
  no isis in croatia though !, 
  i know you 're joking but i 've never understood the mental gymnastics behind this belief that is popular among serbs . 
  we never were orthodox ( there was n't even such thing when neither we or serbs converted to christianity ) , we have always been under vatican influence , not byzantine . 
  we 're like that . 
  the world 's biggest tie was proudly presented in [ pula ] ( https://imgur.com/a/rb9i9 ) a couple of years ago . 
  there 's something beautiful about catholic mass , especially on easter and * especially * in old churches and ** especially ** if it 's in latin .

  surely , that 's not so difficult to understand ? 
  here , i 'll give you just one example - croatia largely participated in the renaissance ( in architecture , literature , politics , etc. ), 
  because it was in the italian/central european sphere of influence while serbia did not because it was in the ottoman sphere . 
  now imagine how differently the western world would have evolved culturally if the renaissance never happened . 
  same with the reformation , counter reformation , enlightenment etc. 
  religion is a huge , huge thing culturally . 
  i do n't think anything else has as big an influence on a culture as its religion . 
  but even if that were irrelevant , serbs have always gravitated towards the oriental , greek influences , and croats have always gravitated towards occidental , germanic and italian influence . 
  this is shockingly evident in everything from art & architecture to literature and music . 
  and that 's ok . we do n't have to be the same to share other cultural connections . 
  but the original question was why serbs and croats are different and i think i explained it adequately . 
  well , apparently , the younger generations of serbs and croats ( born after the breakup of yugoslavia ) are having at least some difficulty understanding each other because even though serbian and croatian share a lot of grammar and vocabulary , a lack of exposure to the other variant ( in terms of cultural exchange there might as well be a brick wall between croatia and serbia right now ) means that a lot of words and phrases us older generations were exposed to through books , comics , television etc are just not being learned by the younger generations . 
  of course , they still manage to find a common language , but it 's interesting that the process of alienation has already begun . 
  i really do n't see things getting better any time soon , so even though croatian and serbian will probably be mutually intelligible 100 years from now , i suspect the differences will continue to pile on especially if the cultural ~ ~ bonds ~ ~ exchange remains frozen for a while . 
  evolution of language is a very slow process , and 200 years is not enough for things to change dramatically . 
  think back to shakespeare and his english . 
  it 's archaic , yes , but it 's still very much like modern english in terms of grammar and vocabulary . 
  so in that context , serbian and croatian were always very similar , but if for example croatian kept the older kajkavian based standard , then it would probably be closer to slovenian and farther from serbian then it is today . 
  if serbian kept the old slavonic-serbian standard of the 18th century ( even though that language was n't really the language of serbian commoners ) , it would be far closer to russian/ukranian than to croatian today . 
  in any case , at least in terms of croatian , adopting the shtokavian dialect as standard was a very calculated move , since even today , barely 50 % of croats in croatia speak that dialect natively . 
  on the other hand almost all bosnian croats speak it natively , so it was probably a move that kept them in the croatian national fold , and prevented the serbs from claiming that all shtokavians are serbs , which is something that was very much advocated by eminent serbian linguists like vuk karadzic in the 19th century . 
  many slavic languages are very similar to each other and mutually intelligible . 
  czech and slovak for example . 
  russian , belarussian and ukranian . 
  serbian , croatian and ( to some degree ) slovenian . 
  bulgarian and macedonian . 
  croatian and serbian were brought closer together through standardization . 
  official standard languages are based on the same dialect ( shtokavian ) this was very much intended , as the intelligentsia in both nations at the time felt that south slavs should be united in the same way italy was united 50 years earlier . 
  the older serbian and croatian standard languages were much further apart . 
  so while the drive to unite these two different nations did exist in the past 200 years , it 's now obvious that was a very bad idea in the long run . 
  i guess unlike the italians the cultural differences were just too great . 
  well , if a culture separated by 1000 years of history is n't enough i really do n't know what is . 
  serbs and croats have literally never shared a state until 1918 . 
  from the croatian kingdoms of the 10th century to the serbian empire of the 14th century , trough the great schism of the christian world , through the ottoman invasions and austrian expansion , serbs and croats have always remained in opposite camps . 
  yes , they lived side by side , but often divided into bitterly opposed camps through the ambitions of great empires and great religions . 
  unfortunately , the `` west balkans '' is the place where civilizations always rubbed shoulders for thousands of years , at least since the west - east roman empire split . 
  the very idea of south slavic unity did n't exist until the early 19th century and even then it took a 100 years and some very unusual historical circumstances to get serbs and croats into the same state . 
  you can imagine that 1000 years of separate history makes a huge impact on the respective cultures . 
  yes , on one hand they are similar , but on the other they are worlds apart . 
  czechs and slovaks or danes and norwegians are far more alike than croats and serbs . 
  at least those nations shared a state for large part of their histories . 
  you mean apart from the fact that around 200 000 collaborators , army regulars and civilian sympathizers that were killed in forced marches and outright executions in 1945 , starting at bleiburg ? 
  the slovenian countryside is littered with mass graves due to `` denazification '' of croatia . 
  any more and it would be genocide . 
  in principle , this is called universal jurisdiction and is almost exclusively reserved for international courts like the icj or icty . 
  there have been some cases where certain states invoked universal jurisdiction in their own courts for crimes that involved crimes against humanity , but as a rule these cases are almost always left up to international courts or courts of the state where the crimes have been commited . 
  that 's why extradition laws and agreements exist in the first place . 
  now , serbia claiming universal juridiction , although troublesome is n't the biggest problem . 
  the problem is that serbia is refusing to put some people who are accused of war crimes in croatia on trial and it 's also refusing to extradite them to croatia to face justice in croatian courts due to its `` universal jurisdiction '' law . 
  on the other hand , it has in the past arrested and tried croatian citizens who had no idea that they were even wanted for alleged war crimes because serbia did n't request their extradition or showed any intent to prosecute before they stepped on serbian soil . 
  this is absolutely unacceptable and shows a gross disregard for international legal customs and due process . 
  also , as far as war crimes in former yugoslavia are concerned , the only widely accepted universal jurisdiction over those belongs to the icty , and all those cases should have been brought before icty before it was disbanded . 
  they can still be brought before the icj , so there 's really no reason for serbia to claim universal jurisdiction at all except as an attempt to protect its own citizens who were involved in war crimes on croatian and bosnian soil from facing justice . 
  semantics . 
  serbia should n't have the right to organize a trial for crimes that did n't happen in its own jurisdiction , that goes contrary to every law and custom in international legal community . 
  `` captain dragan '' commited war crimes on the territory of croatia . 
  that 's why croatia can put out a warrant for his extradiction . 
  that 's how international law works . 
  serbia on the other hand thinks it can put out that same warrant because he commited war crimes on the territory of former yugoslavia , a country that does not exist anymore . 
  it 's unprecedented in international law . 
  that 's why croatia demands that serbia renounces this nonsense law before it can join eu . 
  really simple . 
  if it 's occasional and casual it 's ineffective and represents a `` security theatre '' . 
  if it 's regular and thorough it 's absolutely an assault on civil liberties . 
  not only that , it turns the presumption of innocence on its head . 
  everyone is a suspect until we ( the state ) determine they 're not . 
  every single day . 
  yes , you should , because while terrorist acts are horrible and detestable , the odds of you or anyone you know being affected by one directly are about the same as you or anyone you know dying in a plane crash - i.e. 
  extremely low , about the same as being struck by lightning or winning big in a lottery . 
  on the other hand , terror by the state is very real and would affect you and everyone you know every day , for an indeterminate amount of time . 
  giving up civil liberties for some imaginary `` security '' is both stupid and sad , and , incidentally , exactly what the terrorists want . 
  the stated goal of al ` qaeda and all other related terrorist groups has always been to destroy the western values , philosophy and liberties . 
  and they 're doing a damn good job of it . 
  play stupid games , win stupid prizes . 
  croatian communist partisans won in ww2 so i 'm not exactly sure what you 're implying . 
  even if , like a good serb ultranationalist you want to imply ustashe were a legitimate croatian government ( like vichy france or nedic 's serbia , right ? ), 
  then they lost the entire bosnia and 200 000 + croat supporters of the regime that were killed in the immediate aftermath of the war and still litter the slovenian countryside in countless mass graves where they were put after being executed without any trial or semblence of justice , often just because they were croats . 
  this is what serbian ultranationalists actually believe . 
  do n't even get me started on `` muh 6 gorillion '' in jasenovac which has by every objective measure been determined to be no less than 60 000 and no more than 100 000 dead , and that number included jews , roma and croats opposed to the regime as well as serbs . 
  paired with the fact that the area we 're talking about had around 12-15 million people before ww2 one would have to be literally insane ( or a serb nationalist ) to claim that the ethnic structure shown on your map ( map of greater serbia , let 's not forget ) was in any way related to the admittedly horrible crimes of the ustasha quisling regime . 
  in fact , even though ustasha did claim bosnia as a part of `` independent state of croatia '' it 's an undeniable historical fact they never actually controlled even 50 % of that territory so even if your inane theories were correct , it would mean that some political force other than the ustashe regime must have been responsible for the supposed ethnic structure changes on those territories . 
  oh look , half of the territory on that map does n't even have a serb majority . 
  would you have a ) `` ethnically cleansed '' those territories as well , or would it b ) suddenly be ok to live with huge minorities in `` greater serbia '' . 
  if the answer is a ) - fuck you , you got what you deserved , and if it 's b ) was n't yugoslavia even greater territory gain ? 
  in any case , since this `` greater serbia '' does n't include the `` krajina '' i guess more wars to get the `` otad\u017ebina '' would have been inevitable . 
  i guess you think croats should n't have been asked anything ? 
  i guess you think they would have just taken it without question ? 
  lol , think again . 
  in fact , keep crying about it like a little bitch cause god knows you tried everything else . 
  maybe you can celebrate this loss for 600 years like that last one . 
  yay , we 're first !, 
  wait ... 
  dawwwww , we love you too little slovenia :3 < 3 < 3, 
  wise words from a person whose nick translates to `` i shit in your mouths '' . 
  \u0106a\u0107a ti je serbo-croatian . 
  well , serbia always likes to point out that it was in no way directly involved in bosnia and croatia , as in no serbia regular ever crossed into those countries , do they not ? 
  or is that ... * different * ? 
  you 're strawmanning hard now . 
  please point out any comment up to this point that `` circle-jerked '' about anything of the sort . 
  economics is as much about human behaviour , psychology and politics , as it is about mathematics .

  latvia is best at women ? 
  well , it 's our sea , i do n't think we should just give it away for no reason . 
  also , koper is rijeka 's top competitor , it 's not in croatian interest to give that sea away . 
  yup , like nutella . 
  we get shitty nutella . 
  and we buy it because we obviously do n't care if we 're treated like shit . 
  you 're not an independent country . 
  croatia : http://www.total-croatia-news.com and https://eblnews.com, 
  the brexit process has n't even oficially started yet , it 's too early to make conclusions on its impact to the british economy . 
   the bad that religion brings far outweigh the good in my opinion really depends on the religion . 
  for instance , the good that [ the catholic church does ] ( http://www.caritas.org ) vastly outweigh the bad imo . 
   intolerance of introlerance is good , not bad . 
  very popular point of view , at least on reddit , but it 's overly simplistic . 
  who decides what 's intolerant ? 
  do you think every catholic is intolerant the same way you think every trump voter is racist ? 
  is n't that pretty bigoted and ignorant ? 
  you 're the one here who seems full of hatred . 
  he 's a serb living in slovenia . 
  croatia is centre/centre-right . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  new macedonia sounds pretty reasonable , it would be a good compromise . 
  very creative name !, 
   and it is known that was an ethnic cleansing how about instead of this `` it is known '' bullshit you actually provide some sources for your absurd claim ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/croatia-war-crime-analysis  because the appeal judges found that the shelling was not unlawful , they also concluded there was no planned deportation of the serbian minority and no `` joint criminal enterprise '' or political conspiracy by a leadership cold-bloodedly planning an ethnic pogrom . 
  so , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia explicitly ruled that the operation storm was perfectly legal , why are you ignoring that fact ? 
  my street is full of flags . 
  there 's one building where they also put a couple of eu flags every holiday lol . 
   however , some have claimed that croatia 's lack of war crimes verdicts is somewhat compensated by that fact that the country 's courts have convicted people of committing murder and other crimes during the conflict . 
  the state attorney 's office told birn that it had initiated several thousand criminal cases after operation storm . 
  it said that it launched criminal procedures against 3,728 people for murder , violence , sexual crimes , theft and destruction of property . 
  of these , 2,380 people were convicted . 
   yes , but half the country were serbs . 
  and half of it were n't serbs . 
   it 's not like young bosnia was just serbs anyway . 
  it was mostly serbs , right ? 
  a-h did occupy bosnia , but bosnia was n't serbian land , it was ottoman . 
  i highly doubt that the catholics and muslims of bosnia preferred kingdom of serbia over austro-hungarian empire . 
  the last one is the only one that 's appropriate because it 's factual and nothing more . 
  i still do n't understand why serbs consider princip a hero , he murdered the only member of the habsburg family that actually wanted to change the structure of austria-hungary to accommodate the south slavs ( plus he murdered his innocent wife ) . 
  it was terrorism , not heroism . 
  this is the work of a french artist etien .

  because that 's the way it should be . 
  that 's how it 's been for hundreds of years . 
  why should it change ? 
  if all the institutions and systems merged , things would be going much smoother . 
  yugoslavia was also a failed prospect , particularly economically . 
  too much borrowing going on . 
  please take a look at a book called `` the myth of ethnic war . '', 
  also , serbia and croatia are guarantors of the dayton accords and both are there to ensure the territorial integrity of bih . 
  secession is not going to be tolerated . 
   why ? 
  if people want independence why should n't they get it ? 
  that 's how all exyu republics got their independence , by the will of the people . 
  why should n't serbs and croats in bosnia have the same right ? 
  their `` indpendence '' will lead to minimal recognition . 
  it will then lead to tariffs . 
  no money = the `` country '' will fail . 
  not to mention they simply do n't have the resources to exist . 
  the so-called rs relies heavily on the imf and even the imf will stop giving them money . 
  see what i 'm getting at ? 
  also , serbs in bosnia are not serbians . 
  they are bosnians . 
  indeed . 
  you say that like a united bosnia is a bad thing or something . 
  i 'm all for everyone working together and creating a functioning state . 
  if both `` entities '' merged , life would n't be as rough over there . 
  it would make things so much better for everyone . 
  but if somehow the primate dodik is able to push for the secession of the so-called rs , it 's not gon na end well for the serbs . 
  ultimately , however , it 's the people 's choice . 
  although , dodik knows he ca n't secede . 
   who cares . 
  kosovo is serbian . 
  but it 's not . 
  who cares . 
  kosovo is kosovo . 
  also i 'm not downvoting you . 
  i do n't particularly care . 
  that would be hilarious . 
  their official title is `` republic of kosovo . '', 
  they are no longer a part of serbia . 
  yes , i understand they are essentially a us colony/protectorate but all other functions they can handle . 
  they can barely handle them , but they still do . 
  kosovo could only be part of serbia through force , and that 's not really going to work very well . 
  they got their independence whether the serbs like it or not . 
  there were polls done by the new york times i think . 
  just two years ago . 
  they did a poll post war on how many people think bosnia should stay together and did three age groups encompassing 18-65 or so . 
  i tried finding the source because i 've linked it before , but ca n't seem to find it . 
  most people in 2015 were pro bosnia staying together . 
  bosnia will be bosnia . 
  no one can break bosnia apart . 
  i 'm sure the kids love it . 
  little do they know that trump probably does n't even know where serbia is . 
  let alone kosovo . 
  you might be wrong on that . 
  the old farts might not want to but i 'm sure us younger people think very differently . 
  i guarantee he 's 13 years old and listens to war songs on a daily basis . 
  you realize there are bosniaks of catholic and even orthodox faith , correct ? 
  russia does not have deep ties with the serbs . 
  maybe russian nationalists and serb nationalists do , but only in times of war . 
  other than that , there 's not much there . 
  does this guy really think he can do anything to kosovo ? 
  but croatians have the whole adriatic coast , as another user mentioned . 
  it 's a joke m8 . 
  they still wo n't gib sea . 
  croatian does not always equal croat . 
  i know . 
  and all of that is horseshit . 
  bosnian muslims have never bothered anyone in `` christian '' europe . 
  they should get over it . 
  also , even after the war , after all our dead , and after all the displaced , we are still the majority in bosnia . 
  so technically , a muslim state * does * exist . 
  did i say he was n't ? 
  they 're all cunts . 
  also , at least bakir is n't threatening secession . 
  yeah , then the army can rush into banja luka and arrest that walking pig they call the president . 
  maybe they 'll replace him with someone reasonable . 
  just maybe . 
  muslim states have existed in europe for a long time . 
  everyone knows bosniaks are secular and have been for centuries . 
  the `` muslim state fear '' is fucking bullshit . 
  what the fuck does that even mean ? 
  it 's still secession and it will bring * nothing , * again , * nothing * good to 1 ) serbs and 2 ) everybody else . 
  either way , dodik knows himself that he ca n't do it . 
  i 'm a bosniak but thanks bro !, 
  sorry , but i 'm not really familiar with the history . 
  could you provide me with some more background info ? 
  you 're ignoring the fact that serbs , croats , and bosniaks lived together for centuries prior to sfrj . 
  also , it is a huge misunderstanding that the war was an ethnic war . 
  the real causes of the war in bih were a ) politics and b ) the economy . 
  you ca n't just secede and keep borders . 
  part of secession is creating new ones . 
  they wo n't secede . 
  they ca n't , and dodik knows that . 
  he 'll have all of nato engaged because croatia is a guarantor of dayton . 
  croatia can not just act in the interest of croats in bih , they have an obligation to preserve the territorial integrity of * all * of bih . 
  when have bosnian muslims carried out bullshit in europe in the past decade ? 
  you think we 're the same as those gost fuckers in the middle east ?

same thing in croatia as well ... 
  it pisses me off beyond limit . 
  entire nation is just stupid voting for people that are convicted thieving criminal politicians . 
  what 's the difference between strategic and tactical nuke ? 
  they both destroy everything around themselves when they get dropped . 
  what guarantees that one of strategic missiles wo n't become tactical ? 
  putin is a small , primitive man . 
  he only cares about his money . 
  guns melt in epicenter of the nuclear blast . 
  thanks . 
  interesting logic and understandable view from marketing point . 
  still , i wonder after how many pluses there wo n't be any point of adding any new ones . 
  if others are complaining about lower grades then dismiss them all and just let everyone have a 's with pluses as much as they want . 
  i 'm probably expressing myself incorrectly . 
  my question was why are there 4 pluses for a grade when they could have added more letters after g ? 
  so the grades would go from a to k , instead of a + + + to g. 
  obviously . 
  i was asking why so many pluses ? 
  was n't it easier to make categories with more letters ? 
  what do those extra pluses mean ? 
  so it all comes down to getting used to it ? 
  from turkey most trucks i see are 34 and i 've already looked it up and remembered it 's istanbul . 
  everything else is a mystery but i understand you need to live within the country to fully get used to those numbers on plates . 
  it might be easier if there was some logic behind them but it seems the numbers go randomly around the country . 
  always wonder how people remember plates that are represented by digits . 
  france has a lot of departments , that 's around 100 numbers to remember . 
  turkey also has a lot of provinces each with their own number assigned . 
  i hate not knowing the license plate by looking at it . 
  letters are easier to figure out . 
  i can do that with lots of countries but those numbered license plates always made me angry for not knowing where they 're from . 
  if i remember correctly , uk plates are even worse , once i 've read about them on wikipedia , it took me 5 seconds to forgot all the logic behind them . 
  i do n't know how you people do it ... 
  is st.petersburg-moscow the straightest line in the world ? 
  according to this fantasy high speed network , zagreb can only be accessed from ljubljana and budapest from directions west and northeast . 
  real major passenger lines very much include zagreb-vienna and zagreb-belgrade so this map is truly a big fantasy . 
  the bridge is not going to be built by itself . 
  they can decide to swim afterwards though . 
  first they need to build a bridge . 
  just few seconds ago i 've read that the guy in moscow ikea left ak47 and they want him to come and pick it up . 
  some local dialects around zagreb say `` kusa '' for woman or a girl . 
  but seriously , croatian has only one lent word from finnish and that is sauna . 
  everything else is completely different . 
  same with hungarian . 
  my country is bordering hungary and i have no idea what the hell they 're saying or writing . 
  every word is miles long and consists of weird letter combinations . 
  sorry burazer , it 's not really easy to discern joke from a serious talk just by looking at text . 
  it 's been a while since i was in school but we 've always been taught that after ireland , our country had the biggest emmigration to other countries . 
  iirc , there 's around 4 million croats in the world excluding homeland . 
  way off friend . 
  i 've been here for over 20 years , never ever heard someone saying it , although we all know what it means . 
  it 's nothing personal , just sounds weird when trying to talk in slovenian ... for me , slovenian seems like a drunk from zagorje had a line of coke and let the words go loose . 
  i 'm not sure how to explain it , i feel very weird trying to talk slovenian . 
  red and white squares is our national coat of arms . 
  its earliest mention is from 15th century . 
  it 's a symbol of our history and struggle for independence . 
  even though i would n't mind , i 'm pretty sure you 'd find trouble if mentioning that to some conservative croat . 
  but i admit , it looks like a checkered table cloth . 
  its meaning though is much more historical . 
  seselj had an interesting statement while on court in haag : vojislav \u0160e\u0160elj : why did n't you read it all out ? 
  you read more beautifully than i do . 
  at the end i said : '' ... all you members of the registry office of the hague tribunal can only suck my dick . '', 
  but that is not my article . 
  it is my submission to the secretariat of the hague tribunal , which for a full two and a half years is preventing my defence and refusing to register my legal advisors and in other ways violating elemental rules and regulations with regard to my status and rights . 
  prosecutor nice : read the last short paragraph on this page . 
  vojislav \u0160e\u0160elj : no , i ca n't do only the last one . 
  i have to do the penultimate one and the last paragraph together because you can understand the last one only if i read the one but last paragraph as well . 
  `` my legal advisors are not my defence counsel and that is why they need not fulfil the conditions stipulated by the rules of procedure and evidence for defence counsel . 
  all they have to do is to fulfil those conditions which i prescribe for them . 
  and you can go on hampering my defence and then ultimately you 're going to have to eat all the shit that you excreted . 
  `` fuck you all , beginning with hans holthuis , and so on , including that tjarda van der spoel , who is a crook . '',

  i always thought romanians mostly travel to their coast cause it 's a lot closer than adriatic sea . 
  i believe past 50-60 years were the only peaceful time in europe in whole inhabited history . 
  croatian and serbian word is \u010daj , pronounced same . 
  i believe the word comes from chinese , i 've heard that on tv . 
  66 % voted yes , 33 voted no . 
  43 % of voters came out to vote , the rest obviously did n't care . 
  i 'm all for integration and joining forces so that we can all live easier and better ... but time will tell if this was a good move . 
  croatian president said yesterday they are expecting 40000 people in next few days ... 
  definitely . 
  although the problem started few months ago in italy and greece . 
  this is just the result of those mistakes and now we 're all in a deep shit trying to get out of this mess . 
  each and every country on their way is at fault by not controlling the situation more tightly . 
  everyone just transfers them to the next country , let them be theirs problem . 
  i believe , without any media hysteria , that we 've failed as humans and as sovereign countries by not doing things we 're obligated to do . 
  it 's a sad time for europe , that 's for certain . 
  we can call them any way we want , the reality is they are here and they are hungry . 
  at the very least , we should keep our dignity and understand their reasoning while trying to help them if possible . 
  media is having a field day with this topic . 
  they are always over-exaggerating and clickbaiting people to open their links . 
  try not to believe every scandalous title they write and just use reason . 
  no one wants to mistreat children but you ca n't guarantee that everyone is treated fairly ... it 's the problem with big numbers ... 
  it 's difficult to help thousands or tens of thousands in a matter of 24 hours ... media just wants to watch the world burn and earn those sweet clickbaiting moneys . 
  i 'd suggest avoiding local media sites ... 
  i 'd wager that living in refugee camps anywhere in the world is n't that good or desirable especially if you 're living couple of years in them . 
  some people just think they deserve more than waiting for the situation to calm down . 
  they should have sent old people and children instead and die somewhere between cyprus and greece ? 
  it 's reasonable to suggest that they 've thought about it and decided it 's way safer to send physically capable people on this long trip . 
  you are too high man . 
  how come we only hear about coffees that cost 7 $ on stradun ?

  closer to hungary here , eating gulash and paying taxes . . 
  `` serbia has undergone a remarkable transformation from the `` reluctant europeaniser '' to `` the best pupil in class '' '' from the article . 
  just lol . 
  what i did today ? 
  paid taxes . 
  this liste is bulishit !, 
  trojan ... 
  i dont think we should trust this dude , guys . . 
  its like these two powers keep the area in as much turmoil as possible to make them weaker . . 
  as we can see serbian `` lets make babies '' plan almost worked . 
  how is it unholy if they are islamists ? 
  til : triglav is the mountain in slovakia and is also on their flag !, 
  the more you know !, 
  man id expect norway to use such bold claims not someone who can see himself same way we do , we are small but we try our best . 
  erm . 
  they took our little bosnia . . 
  now that we understand this , lets continue shall we . 
  isnt mexico the scariest motherfucking place in the world atm ? 
  im sure they dont need ak47 . 
  its concentrated pure awesomeness , not some shit piss latte moca dicka . 
  whole soviet union stockpiled weapons like its god damn christmas whole year long for years . 
  if you think that weapon is obsolete , its not . 
  dude . 
  you two were bros in crime , wtf ? 
  which means croatia alteast banned them and if your not familiar those people do get arrested by the police . 
  serbia ofcourse continues to be closer to its eastern cousins . 
  im just glad countries of ex yugoslavia dont have to be alone in listening this serbian nonsense each week . 
  so when exactly is croatia getting that vojvodina slice ? 
  you can leave out the quotation marks . 
  if you think oluja was on your soil then il gladly take some vojvodina for my soil . 
  so ronry . . 
  and no croatian flag ? 
  you fucking ortodox cunts !, 
  fuck you serbia for forgetting us !, 
  its nice to see a country so small like slovenia to have this much pride !, 
  i love slovakian mountains . 
  can we all here agree if any of this shit ( differentiated internet ) happens , cars will burn ? 
  jesus romania relax a little with those arrests these days . 
  oh man for a moment seeing slovenia mentioned i thought youre croatian . 
  but yeah , same here . 
  bosnian civil war . . is this how we are gon na call russian aggression on ukraine in 20 years ? 
  why do you need northen ireland ? 
  why do you need sardinia ? 
  why do you need creta ? 
  jesus fucking christ at the retarded fucking question . 
  point that europe , not european union but europe is standing idly is the same way it stood when hitler made his claims of sudeten and so on . 
  thats the point of their letter . 
  unless you didnt understand the part about munich betrayal . 
  it should not be `` ok '' to arm rebels in order to annex a country next to you . 
  end of discussion . 
  can it move a bit south too ? 
  cant we just invade all the way there ? 
  does yugo count ? 
  yay croatia !, 
  nvm im not from yugoslavian goverment families or franjo tudmans family & friends . 
  but they won . 
  and we all know how history works . 
  i have a feeling kings landing will be overcrowded this year . . 
  and why should there be consequences ? 
  what is this a fucking dictatorship ? 
  bill didnt do shit wrong when compared to fucking slobo . 
  rarely a house in croatia wont have them . 
  i came !, 
  it will be a male son !, 
  il make his brothers a year from now !, 
  serbia has assistance from gypsies but we have bosna kebab children . 
  fuck this !, 
  im cummin in my wife today !!!!!!!, 
  `` all y' all '' brat . 
  bro before your chimney would be clogged i think it would sooner caught on fire !, 
  sorry bout that !, 
  should also add that postojna cave in the pic . 
  triglav looks so awesome !, 
  way too young bro . 
  i think it might be something like , jesus took away his weapons and is trying to tell him that what hes doing is bad . 
  i loved zadar . 
  croatia , country split in two . 
  no , because they say `` bunch of gypsies '' . 
  i find it hard to believe that there would be 1000 young guys all going rape mode . . 
  youre a meterologist and your asking me about climate then . 
  you can explain to me our climate then !, 
  inland you get continental climate . 
  near coast you get mediteranean climate . 
  betwen those two there are mountains to stop them from mixing too much . 
  its magic . 
  show off !, 
  . . damn , srbosjek does no damage to slovenes . . 
  germany is more and more acting like a passive agressive cunt . 
  either get your army on the greece boarders or stfu . 
  what the fuck happend with all the slavs in europe ? 
  i swear even serbia is making more sense then these polish/czech cunts who didnt even see 1 immigrant . 
  we are such good guys . 
  money well spent . 
  i dont get it . 
  for years we kept hearing here in croatia how poland is growing stronger and stronger and then i hear some retards won elections ? 
  how did that happen ? 
  all ya maniacs wanting to live in hungary instead of croatia are cray cray . 
  what !, 
  relax little bro . 
  we shall export to saudis .

  the uk is n't in schengen . 
  even if the eu decided that open borders meant open borders for everyone , which they most certainly did not , the uk still would have retained full control . 
  i do n't know , off the top of my head it might have been smart not to hand over even more power to the very institutions that created the mess they wanted solved ? 
  `` oh , but you could have listened to your doctor , he 's been telling you to change your habits for years . 
  well i did n't so now my only recourse is to never step foot in to a hospital again . '', 
  that 's the point . 
  the whole idea behind free movement is that everyone competes on an equal field . 
  western countries have stronger economies so they can export more goods to the east , eastern countries have cheaper labor so they export that to the west . 
  the eu then makes weaker economies stronger , making them more attractive markets for the west and more attractive for their own people so that they do n't feel the need to leave . 
  everyone wins . 
  however , some people seem to think that a deal is only fair if it 's grossly in their favor . 
  the system as it stands created massive amounts of wealth in the east , spawning some of europe 's biggest success stories . 
  free movement is a huge part of that . 
  yes , it 's very much worth it . 
  it 's basically life insurance for the survivors . 
  rather than having absolutely nothing , the reserves are there to help them . 
  ok , that 's what i wanted to know . 
  time and registration . 
  if that 's how it 's being done and no corners get cut , there should be no problem . 
  that 's a given , but do they fingerprint ? 
  how do they make sure the same guy is n't comming in twice a month with a new name every time ? 
  how do they make sure the same guy has n't already received money from france and the netherlands to go back home ? 
  how do they make sure the asylum seeker is n't just some guy with german citizenship trying to scam some money ? 
  most importantly , what 's the penalty for abusing the system ? 
  not getting asylum is only an issue for someone looking for asylum . 
  if the consequence is simply no asylum and no money , then there 's no reason for swindlers not to just give it a shoot and if it works it works , if not , who cares . 
  you 're not thinking about this comprehensively enough . 
  can a person from a safe country legally fly to germany , put on some ragged clothes , claim that they lost their papers , apply for asylum , grab the cash , change back and fly home ? 
  are people being fingerprinted before money is handed over ? 
  how is their status being verified ? 
  what are the penalties for trying to abuse the system ? 
  when and how is money handed over ? 
  how is it ensured that they actually leave the country ? 
  how is it ensured that they do n't take advantage of similar deals being offered in other countries ? 
  the problem here are n't people coming in as pert of the refugee wave , it 's professional scam artists from countries close to the eu or even people who have eu citizenship . 
  when giving free money to undocumented people with the only requirement being that you never see them again , the potential for abuse is huge . 
  case in point , cuba . 
  if there 's one place that quite convincingly demonstrated that the cia is anything but all-powerful , it 's castro 's cuba , sitting right next door . 
  the minimum wage in the uk is higher than 3000 $ a month ? 
  that seems absurdly high . 
  that seem like it would be on the high end for average wage , let alone minimum . 
  and yet it could n't be more different . 
  france does n't have a two round system it has a requirement that a candidate recieve a simple majority to win . 
  that means they have an election , a real one , not the nonsense that passes as one during the us primaries , in which everyone in the country get 's to vote for whichever candidate they like most . 
  if no one has a simple majority after that , all but the two most popular candidates are eliminated and then people get to vote again for the candidate they hate least . 
  primaries are nothing like the first round of an election since a ) two of them are happening at the same time and you can only influence one , b ) that 's assuming you can vote in one at all , c ) that 's assuming there 's an actual vote , d ) instead of counting votes cast for the candidates electoral votes are handed out , sometimes proportionaly , sometimes by giving the candidate with a plurality all the votes . 
  then in the actual election , while it 's not common , third parties spoiling the vote have been known to happen . 
  it 's a big reason why gore lost in 2017 . 
  superficially the us system looks similar , but it 's anything but . 
  in addition to everything stated , the election in france is national vs being state by state + dc , nevada 2 and main 2 and there are the election is determined by a simple popular vote . 
  one person , one vote , majority rules . 
  no one in france is going to have their vote go to the other side just because their neighbors voted for said other side in greater number . 
  relevant point , this was supposed to be the 24th stop for the exhibition in croatia . 
  it 's quite literally one school principal being an idiot . 
  in the other locations it was well received . 
  school principal is basically a cushy reward for members of a political party that 's currently in power . 
  it 's the budget bin equivalent of giving someone an ambassadorship in a tropical country . 
  they tend to have next to no real power , but what little they do have , they use to the fullest , as evident here . 
  you can give people flairs saying they 're from anywhere . 
  thing is , the flags i 've seen tended to be from countries that are generally underrepresented on reddit . 
  it 's a bit suspicious that you would get about as many czechs as you would brits . 
  that 's it . 
  that 's exactly the shade we need . 
  the damn flag is blue . 
  having regular blue passports makes sense . 
  i 'm baffled that no one stopped and thought : `` hey , blue with gold , are n't those the eu colors ? '', 
  they do though . 
  the conservatives only got 37 % of the votes , but more than half the seats in parlament . 
  the lib-dems got around 8 % of the seats with 7 % of the votes . 
  ukip however , they got 12 % of the votes . 
  zero seats until a conservative jumped ship and gave them 1 . 
  that 's less than 1/6th of 1 % of the total seats for 12 % of the vote . 
  however , do n't feel too sorry for them . 
  they had a referendum a few years back to change the system from this one to one that 's proportional and they shoot it down . 
  you 're correct in principal , but wrong on a few details . 
  tyranny of the majority ca n't be solved by replacing a simple majority requirement with a qualified majority . 
  ( 50 % +1 vote , vs 55 % or 66 % or 75 % ) because in any case a majority is able to impose their will and potentially cause great harm to a majority . 
  to give the most extreme example , even if 99 % of a country is required to vote for the execution of one person , if that person can be executed for arbitrary reasons or no reason at all , it 's still tyrannical even though basically everyone agrees that they should be killed . 
  the reason why you would put a qualified majority on such a decision is because one option allows for one side to try and try and try again until they succeed , allowing them to gain more support of the people really do want a certain action to be taken , while the other side does n't get a second chance if they lose . 
  once the uk leaves the eu , british voters can no longer decide to just reenter it . 
  the decision is effectively final . 
  because of that , it 's generally quite important to define a majority that 's high enough so as to be reasonably sure that public opinion could n't swing the other way over night . 
  as you pointed out , if just 2 % of the voters were to change their minds , the whole thing goes the other way . 
  you want a buffer that 's big enough so as to make sure the people are still on board after the initial enthusiasm dies down , because if they 're not , they 're suddenly helpless to undue what was done . 
  if this was merely with the people having to live with their choices , that would be one thing , but the consequences of adapting a radical plan and following through , only for it to lose support mid stream guarantees disaster . 
  suddenly everyone starts playing the blame game . 
  remain voters are blaming leave , leave voters are baling each other and the government , the government is blaming a neurotic public . 
  no one wants to try and make things work anymore , because that 's a lightning rod for blame and then people have to suffer far more than can be attributed to just the initial bad choice . 
  and why not ? 
  it 's not her baby . 
  the voters did n't give her any nonce or direction . 
  if she does anything other than going all out , that 's on her , but her line seems to be `` the british people went in to this with their eyes wide open and i 'm giving them exactly what they voted for ! '', 
  it 's politically the safest choice to make . 
  this is n't her policy but it 's what the people demand so by god she 's going to deliver . 
  if someone stops her , that 's their fault . 
  if things end up going wrong , she already has her defense lined up . 
  people knew the economy would suffer but the vote was n't about economics , it was about sovereignty , national pride and freedom , aka stuff that people gladly claim was their motivation and also just so happen to be absolutely impossible to measure . 
  it 's not good leadership . 
  a good leader does what 's best for their country , political backlash be damned , but then she never ran for office . 
  she was appointed to manage a difficult situation in a way that will keep the conservatives in power and the way she 's handling it does just that .

  getting someone up to speed mid way through is exceptionally difficult and hireing someone you know is high risk is just bad management . 
  let 's look at this objectively shall we . 
  is there a motivation for someone stabbing 3 girls that would make the act better ? 
  would the fact that he had no reason what so ever make it better ? 
  people like to throw around mental health issues like they 're a catch all excuse . 
  unless the guy is suffering from something like schizophrenia and genuinely can not distinguish between things that are real and things that are not , he is a person with a value system that allows him , for some reason , to stab little girls . 
  once we establish that , the precise reason is irrelevant . 
  so let 's look at this from the other direction . 
  i 'm a criminal . 
  i know that you have certain limits you wo n't go beyond . 
  limits that are in fact , quite wide . 
  limits i can comfortably hide inside , collect others willing to work with me and commit crimes in the full knowledge that we 'll ether go unpunished , or that the punishment is so lenient , we have no reason to fear it . 
  as we demonstrate that crime does pay , that achieving ones goals by illegal means is a valid way of life , more and more people will join in , until the problem escalates to a point where a normal crime free existence become impossible . 
  here we have a criminal who 's threshold for punishment is far , far greater than that of all but the worst of europeans . 
  the ax attacker from earlier today was shoot , but only after attacking the police and the police ended up being criticized for the way they acted . 
  this guy is n't dead , and does n't have to fear death , or even any great level of uncomfort . 
  he 's going to be a hero to the muslim inmates in whatever jail he ends up in and might receive financial compensation for the attack if he pledges himself to isis . 
  how do you deter these people from doing what they 're doing , because if you do n't , more and more people are going to see it as a legitimate way to live . 
  two attacks a year , became two attacks a month , became 2 attacks a day . 
  french prisons are already jihadi training camps and this problem is likely to spread through out europe . 
  our system of justice is geared to the re socialization of deviant europeans . 
  we rehabilitate our own . 
  you ca n't do that with people who were never part of our society to begin with . 
  who share none of our values , and would undoubtedly have no issue lying , just to secure early release and commit another crime . 
  we are woefully unprepared to handle what 's happening . 
  the system does n't work because we 're trying to get it to do something it was never intended for . 
  are you 5 years old ? 
  because thats about the age were humans should begin to understand concepts . 
  a style , something that is representative and recognizable as part of a bigger artistic movement . 
  yes , because what idiot would make such a huge decision before knowing all the facts . 
  i mean you would have to be a complete moron to just have a referendum on leaving a union before knowing any details or having any plan . 
  no one could possibly be that short sighted . 
  most money has a picture of an asshole on it . 
  some money depicts a tourist attraction . 
  european money depicts a common idea . 
  the bridge is n't any specific bridge , but it 's not a japanese bridge , or a brazilian bridge or an american bridge . 
  it 's a european bridge . 
  it means something to people , just look at this thread . 
  people are defending an imaginary bridge , because it 's our imaginary bridge . 
  our money does n't depict a symbol , our money is a symbol . 
  the symbols are n't neutral . 
  they are representative of european architecture withoubt being specific . 
  we symbolically all invoke a 50 and imediatly reform as a `` new '' union . 
  problem solved . 
  politics is n't a game . 
  there are no real rules , only agreements that last as long as everyone is willing . 
  and most of the time , that snowflake was the uk . 
  let 's not pretend that major deals were derailed because poland or luxembourg wanted something . 
  they were brought in line . 
  of course it 's not necessarily bad , but it will all but certainly be here . 
  consider the following . 
  the uk wants trade deals to sell it 's goods or services . 
  it 's goal is to get the best possible terms in as many markets as it can . 
  nations like australia , china , the us , japan , canada and others want to open their markets as little as possible since the uk is selling finished goods ( planes , trains and cars ) and financial services , rather than raw materials , bringing the uk in direct opposition to local lobbies . 
  when making a deal the uk will be forced to open it 's market by a lot . 
  the chinese for instance , will defiantly demand guarantees that their citizens will be able to buy property without any limit , that there be no quotas or tariffs on chinese made goods , no restrictions on british industry being outsourced to china ect , while in return offering only a partial opening of the chinese market in return . 
  if the uk says no , every other country get 's to demand more because the uk has one less potential trading partner . 
  if the uk says yes , it 's market get 's even more saturated . 
  open it for japanese cars and the us suddenly cares less about the uk auto market because people already have cars and will have a wide choice in new cars so for the same amount of access to uk markets , they 'll offer less , because they know they 'll be selling fewer cars . 
  while a trade deficit with any given country is not a bad thing . 
  a trade deficit in general , that is to say , the uk overall importing significantly more than it exports does mean a bleeding off of wealth . 
  having an open market with all the major global economic players poses one important question . 
  what can the uk make and what can the uk do that no one else can do better , because uk businesses would be going head to head against everyone in the world . 
  germany , japan and the us have a firm hold on high end goods . 
  china and india control the low end . 
  they all get to sell in britain , so what does britain sell to the british public and what does it sell to the world , because if the answer is , not much , well , that 's not good . 
  no , no . 
  the original crown that goes with the iron throne is gold . 
  the crown of the iron islands is driftwood and the crown of the north is iron . 
  because you have to cater to one country , the trade partner , from a possition of weakness . 
  china was eager to make a deal with russia after the embargo . 
  their first offer was a huge deal for natural gas , 50 % off . 
  they setteled at 40 % off . 
  when the eu makes deal as a whole , the eu gets to be picky because the trading partner wants access to the market . 
  they want the access more than the eu wants whatever they have to offer and in negotiations , the primadona countries are an asset as negotiators can use them as further leverage . 
  `` if we do n't get x portugal is saying no , no mater what , so you can give us x or we forget about the whole thing . '', 
  on the flip side , access to the uk market is n't quite as pressing an issue . 
  in addition to being far smaller , and well saturated . 
  what this means is that the uk generally wants a deal more than the other party , so it has to give more for less . 
  in general , countries that expect to have a trade surplus with the uk will be eager to make a deal . 
  you do n't need to work hard to get someone to sell you something . 
  the tricky bit is selling your stuff to them . 
  better selection . 
  probably could have become a leet hacker software pirate and ordered it from amazon , but i found out you could bribe austrian shops by giving the person at the counter money , and if you give them enough , they let you take whatever you want . 
  could n't pass that up . 
  nonsense . 
  you 're already commenting , but you have nothing of worth to add so you try to generally discredit the argument , hoping no one asks you for specifics . 
  when ? 
  why are n't people on the streets now ? 
  at what point are people planning to get pissed ? 
  yes , 10 % of 17 million is 1.7 million . 
  getting 1.7 million people to do something is hard , especially when there 's no one to rally around and doubly so when the official word is `` of course , as soon as we 're ready . '', 
  every day that goes by , people will care less and less . 
  sure , an outright refusal might have consequences , but i see no indication anyone cares about perpetual delays . 
  so she wo n't do anything proactive , but she does n't have to . 
  stall until the next election . 
  it 's really not hard given that there 's no one in the uk pushing for a quick exit . 
  find a crisis that `` must take priority '' . 
  wait until a general election where someone else runs on a platform of not invoking article 50 . 
  they win .

  possible . 
  yugoslavia was ahead of ex-soviet states . 
  way ahead . 
  we just want our voices to be heard . 
  we do n't expect everyone to know why , but we will provide information needed to understand what we are saying . 
  not really , there is too much bias in most . 
  and some of us had to ** live ** with these pictures because people he celebrates made us ? 
  these are the images of my youth ... these are the things people he celebrates did ... . this . 
  i am sorry you had to see a few pictures . 
  ** i had 5 years of war to live through **, 
   i know that he made it . 
  i 'm sure he has his reasons . 
  but that 's his sub and he can do with it what he chooses . 
  lol  is he extreme ? 
  perhaps . 
   has he always been civil in presenting his opinions , however extreme ? 
  as far as i know , he has . 
  and if paveli\u0107 was polite and discussed his view in civil manner , you would like him ? 
   again , i see no reason whatsoever for preventing someone from becoming a mod or removing them from the position solely based on their opinions . 
  i do . 
  let 's invite some mods from stormfront as well ? 
   that 's absurd and very undemocratic . 
  lol . 
  added . 
   i didn \u00b4 t wanted to be engaged in that whole discussion , because i don \u00b4 t know enough about it . 
  fair enough . 
  ok , no problem . 
  will add warning . 
  what happened in 1990 's can only be understood when you go back to 19th century . 
  there are reasons within reasons . 
   although the yugoslavia example is particularly acute because you went from being a completely unified nation ( well , when viewed from the outside ) of civilised people , to suddenly war . 
  that 's the thing . 
  it was n't really . 
  and the worst thing is that serbs and croats did n't even fight before yugoslavia . 
  there were different political views when we joined in 1918 and it was a fuckup since then . 
   i do see a lot wrong with celebrating arkan . 
  what i do n't see , however , is why one should be disallowed from becoming a moderator based on his opinions . 
  that0s where we disagree . 
  do you know that / u/crnaruka also made / r/hercegbosna ? 
  this is the shit in the sidebar of that sub :  check your serbophobia . 
  in spite of the historical hostility between serbia and croatia , we can not lose sight of the fact that it is the bosniaks who are preventing herceg-bosna from rejoining croatia or at the very least receiving an official status as a separate entity of bosnia-herzegovina . 
   but i 'm sure you have better things to do than to get offended at comments on the internet , do n't you ? 
  do you have friends who died in the war ? 
  have you been woken up by rockets falling on your city ? 
  have you been with your gf when she had to identify her father dug up from a mass grave after 5 years ? 
  do your friends have ptsd ? 
  did your gf 's father had to take 5 pills every day just to function ? 
  how many graves of your friends do you visit ? 
  anyone supporting ** fucking war criminals ** should n't mod / r/europe . 
  very simple . 
  and if you serbs do n't see anything wrong with celebrating arkan than there is really nothing more to tell you . 
  the guy was a fucking criminal even before the war ... professional killer , interpol most wanted ... and yet ... `` oh why are you against us poor serbs , he is a nice guy who did nothing wrong '' are you fucking serious ????? 
  well ... these are the thing a person supposed to moderate / r/europe supports . 
  people simply do n't understand what his banner meas ... `` oh , some balkan fucks there , nothing to see '' . 
  these are the cosequences of what people he celebrates did . 
  real people ... dead . 
  fathers , mothers , children ... killed ... and that fuck is celebrating it . 
   it 's just that a lot of users would like things to just be sorted out . 
  which is something we all want . 
  absolutly . 
  they were all terrible . 
  in br\u010dko more than 3500 people were killed . 
  in manja\u010da ( and omarska and keraterm ) concentration camps more than 10 thousand people were killed . 
  siege of sarajevo killed 14 000 people . 
  and so on ... 
  it was brutal and it was terrible . 
  and he celebrates people who ordered it and took part in it . 
   did n't even notice arkan . 
  still , the second part of my comment stands . 
  how does it stand ? 
  you did n't notice him ? 
  weird ... he is the first guy in that banner and he is ridiing a tank with his fellow war criminals , tigers . 
  kinda hard to miss ? 
  we understand that . 
  it 's not like you have to take `` balkan history '' in class , but also this the reason why we oppose him as a mod . 
  he is a troll , he is n't even a serb and yet he posts the worst nationalistic garbage in / r/europe, 
  no problem . 
  we do n't expect everyone to know every shitty thing that happened , but when we come out like this , maybe there is a reason ? 
  the guy made a banner with people who were killing civilians after taking towns . 
  arkan is the worst piece of shit war criminal in the balkans and he put him on a banner of his sub . 
  that 's like making a banner with hitler , goebels and goering and people saying it 's ok . 
  the people in the banner are directly responsible for ** genocide ** . 
  for fucks sake ... genocide ... these are the people who went into bosnia and killed anyone who was n't a serb . 
  8000 men killed in few days ? 
  worst massacre in europe after ww2 ? 
  that 's the people he celebrates . 
  this is very ignorant comment . 
  do you have friends or family members who have died in wars ? 
  i do . 
  i have friends who were in concentration camps . 
  i have ex-gf whose father was dug up from mass grave in vukovar . 
  i have class mates who had to quit high school and who died in the war . 
  and you have some fuck celebrating people who did that . 
  so , fuck off with these comments . 
  should we make fun of `` troubles '' or war in ukraine ? 
  would you find london bombings funny ? 
  there is a statement that dr is n't a mod anymore , but nothing on this . 
  we wanted to make ourselves heard . 
  why we oppose this . 
  why is he such a bad choice .

  just the other day , i did n't even trust myself . 
  it was a good call . 
  yeah , blame it on the peasants !, 
  damn those crop frolicking farmers !,

  direct democracy got hitler 's nsdap elected . 
  around 43 percent of germans voted for him or 17 million people . 
  ca n't you think bigger ? 
  or read a history book ? 
  you do realize that the founding fathers were not into direct democracy or direct voting because ... `` a democracy can not exist as a permanent form of government . 
  it can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury . 
  from that moment on , the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy , always followed by a dictatorship . 
  the average age of the world 's greatest civilizations has been 200 years . 
  these nations have progressed through this sequence : `` from bondage to spiritual faith ; from spiritual faith to great courage ; from courage to liberty ; from liberty to abundance ; from abundance to selfishness ; from selfishness to apathy ; from apathy to dependence ; from dependence back into bondage . '', 
  ( emphasis added ) http://www.democrats.com/node/807 '' `` n an article , are we a republic or a democracy , professor walter e. williams of george mason university , explains how our founders strove to create a republic instead of a democracy , and why . 
  the following are some excerpts : james madison , federalist paper no . 
  10 : `` in a pure democracy , `` there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual . '', 
  at the 1787 constitutional convention , edmund randolph said , '' ... that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy . '', 
  john adams said , `` remember , democracy never lasts long . 
  it soon wastes , exhausts , and murders itself . 
  there was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide . '', 
  chief justice john marshall observed , `` between a balanced republic and a democracy , the difference is like that between order and chaos . '' '', 
  ec is there to ensure two-party system stays put no matter which one `` wins '' , everyone else can go eff themselves because direct democracy is a mob rule game anyways .

  by making it a big deal , they all but admit that they think it 's not a big deal . 
  enough of what ? 
  bailout money ? 
  you do realize there was a very serious movement trying to kick greece out of the eu or at least the eurozone . 
  it would be beneficial for everyone if greece just left , everyone but greece , because their debts would stay . 
  if they defaulted or payed back with a devalued drachma they would still need to borrow more money . 
  they have a primary surplus , but only do to austerity . 
  if they start spending like normal they need to borrow and no one is giving them money under any remotely favorable condition . 
  at the same time , every greek who 's ever thought about moving away suddenly sees that their window of opportunity is closing so they bail . 
  every greek with savings in euros panics because they < know what 's going to happen when they switch to the drachma . 
  the government will need real money to pay for imports so they 'll take it from the only people they can force to exchange it for the drachma . 
  anticipating that , anyone with savings will do what they can to hide the money abroad . 
  now you have capital flight , a brain rush and an economy that 's in the shitter with very limited means of getting a cash influx . 
  the greek market is hardly worth the attention of any large economy so favorable bilateral trade would be hard to arrange and just to put a cherry on top , you have a turkey growing more belligerent by the day right next to you with no formal backing from the eu . 
  sure , there 's nato , but turkey is in nato . 
  while one could argue that greece might have avoided this economic mess were it not part of the eu , leaving the eu does nothing to fix it . 
  had the paralyzed man not bought a car , he might not have gotten in to an accident , but never driving a car again is only making his life worse . 
  even more importantly , you need people who are likely to vote . 
  it does n't the 30-40 % of the population that stays home can unanimously agree on an issue and it would n't matter because you need to vote for your vote to count . 
  this is exceptionally difficult to do if you 're not local . 
  turkey was modern and progressive just a few years back . 
  hell , russia was searingly moving in the right direction just a decade or so ago . 
  `` oh , it 's just a small change and people are acting like the sky is falling '' said the moderates of every country turning totalitarian ever . 
  and to make matters even more silly , the brits were on the writing team . 
  they 're more responsible for the echr 's content than any other european country , possible more responsible for the content than anyone . 
  the story of how even in the face of humanity , compassion and love for thy fellow man , in the end political ideology will triumph and turn not only stranger against stranger , but friend against friend . 
  i know that this is supposed to be a positive message , but really what it tells us is that even though the men on both sides did not hate or even truly dislike each other , the powers that be had little issue when forging regular people in to murders capable of killing others who were far more similar to them than the politicians and generals giving them orders . 
  this truce shows us that these people were not under a spell . 
  they were not brainwashed . 
  they made a choice to toe the line , follow orders , choose the path of last resistance . 
  i mean for god 's sake , here you have millions of people , armed to the teeth , living in conditions unfit even for live stock realizing that the soldiers on the other side are not their personal enemy , knowing that the war is of no personal benefit while asking for sacrifice after sacrifice and they still find it easier to point the guns at the stranger on the other side rather than turning against those who would send them to die for no reason . 
  these men lack even the pretense that they were coerced by force since they them selves were the strong arm of the state . 
  what does it say about man kind when it 's easier to go fight in the trenches than it is to defy established authority ? 
  as far as i know , the institute exists in every eu country , but it 's only in regards to children who 's parentage ca n't be determined . 
  basically , if you find an abandoned infant , since you have no way of knowing the parents the child risks being stateless so in order to prevent that it 's given citizenship based on jus soli . 
  that 's the only circumstance that was covered and to my ( admittedly incomplete knowledge ) that 's the only situation where jus sangui would not be applied . 
  fair point . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  to find out what ? 
  shockingly people have done the leg work and we know how to place solar panels properly . 
  they do n't even try to claim the pannels are as efficient as normal panels . 
  all they could prove is that it 's possible to have panels on a road where they function without breaking which is n't really relevant since you do n't want them on roads in the first place . 
  should we be testing deep sea panels ? 
  who knows what advances we could make in underwater solar ? 
  this is no experiment . 
  it 's a political stunt . 
  want to save the planet ? 
  inflate your tires , insolate your home 's , buy regular roof panels . 
  this is the government scale equivalent of buying a huge recycling sticker and slaping it on your non separated trash can . 
  it 's worse than doing nothing . 
  it 's pretending like your doing something while doing nothing . 
  this is exactly the kind of nonsense that kills legitimate but less `` sexy '' ideas . 
  someone is going to come up with a sensible solar solution that 's going to get rejected because `` remember solar roads '', 
  except on roads because for the hundredth time , they are a shitty place to put solar panels , because the angle is shit . 
  what 's so hard to get about solar panels needing actual sunlight ? 
  ok , so the rode is less wide meaning you need more of it to get the same square footage . 
  you have less than 10 square kilometers worth of main road and less than 32 square kilometers worth of secondary road . 
  that gives you a generous 40ish square kilometers of road in a country with a surface area of 41,000 square kilometers or 0.1 % of the surface area . 
  one lane of 1km of road costs 5.2 million euros to repave in solar panels . 
  both lanes would be 10.4 million , 4 lanes would be 20.8 million . 
  for the low , low price of 51 billion euros you could repave your highways and for just 83 billion more you could repave secondary roads to achieve a coverage of 40 square kilometers total , for some 134 billion euros a rectangle 4km wide , 10km long . 
  here ( http://solarelectricityhandbook.com/solar-angle-calculator.html ) you can see the optimal angels for the netherlands . 
  in the winter , roads are 14 degrees off the optimal angel to collect solar power . 
  in the summer they 're 62 degrees off optimal . 
  here ( http://www.mpptsolar.com/en/best-angle-for-solar-panels.html ) you can see how much efficiency you lose . 
  between 30 % and 70 % just from having the panels installed in a shitty location , before even accounting for the fact that some roads are permanently in the shade do to being surrounded by buildings or trees or hills or mountains and are being constantly covered with dirt , rubber and oil from passing vehicles . 
  here you have a 1 square kilometer solar farm . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agua_caliente_solar_project ) it cost 1.8 billion dollars including land to build . 
  times 40 get 's you to 72 billion dollars or 68 billion euros . 
  that 's using industrial solar panels with an efficiency of 29 % as opposed to commercial panels that are 20 % and these panels that the article states already start with a miserably low 15 % , again , before taking in to account the additional loss do to poor angling . 
  even allowing for the lowest possible loss of 30 % , the regular panels are still 3 times as efficient . 
  twice the cost at a third of the output assuming it works perfectly , which it wo n't because we 're still not accounting for the cars . 
  now , you can say that tech will advance and prices will go down , but that wo n't matter because the same advancements will reduce the price of regular , non stupid solar panels as fast or faster and all the advancements in the world wo n't change the fact that solar panels really , really need sunlight so you should put them in the sun . 
  you would think that , but a road panel simply does n't get sufficient light , unless it 's on the sunny side of a hill . 
  the difference between a flat panel and one at an angle is huge . 
  even being a few degrees off optimal sees a very relevant drop off in efficiency , to the point where it 's recommended you adjust the angle at least twice a year . 
  as far as space goes , i did the math . 
  the average road is roughly 4 meters wide . 
  you need 250km to cover an area of just 1 square kilometer . 
  to cover an area of 9 square kilometers ( 3km high , 3km wide ) you need 2250km of road . 
  if you add the fact that areas where there 's a lot of road over a relatively surface area tend to be cities where the traffic and shade from the buildings further decreases the already poor performance of flat panels , you 're left with just roads between major population areas where land is both cheap and relatively abundant . 
  putting solar tracking panels next to major roads , where the state already owns the land and there are no obstructions to the sun , that makes sense . 
  they can function as wind breaks , sound barriers and protect drivers from glaring sunlight in addition to providing a very high degree of efficiency . 
  that 's the stuff that allowed for explosive growth when we reached a fairly decent level of development . 
  without roads we do n't have large settlements and by large i mean , we do n't have settlements beyond a village of a few hundred people . 
  you are correct that in absolute numbers , advancements in production , medicine and aggro chemistry gave us some 6 billion extra people , but the road connected cities to farms and cities to other cities . 
  even coastal cities that relied on trade via ship would be non viable , since without roads , getting sufficient lumber is not practical . 
  roads are the arteries and nervous system of humanity, 
  they 're not building the road though . 
  they 're repaving it . 
  if they were building it from scratch it would be 2-3 million plus the 5 on top , minus whatever it costs to put on the asphalt . 
  edit : 10 million on top . 
  forgot they only built one lane . 
  those wast area 's covered in asphalt are one of the most important inventions in human history and are one of the main reasons you , me and most of the people on this thread are currently alive . 
  it 's a road . 
  it 's brilliant in it 's simplicity . 
  make hard to pass terrain easy to pass . 
  rooftops are wasted space . 
  empty areas around roads are wasted space . 
  areas above parking lots , walkways and bike ways are wasted space where you could build panels that provide shade and cover from the rain .

  ( dead carp is still very popular , though ), 
  classic answer , both have nothing to do with the croatian liberation . 
  we 'll still keep celebrating the [ anti-fascist struggle day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-fascist_struggle_day ) as a national holiday and it 's clear [ who the liberators were ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans ) . 
  it would be absurd to ban their symbols . 
  the point is in equalizing of ideologies that were never and will never be equal . 
  red star is a symbol under which territories with hundreds of thousands of croats were liberated from the occupation . 
  the swastika is a symbol under which those territories were given away . 
   driving his vw van with a nazi flag hanging out the window and pictures of ** mussolini ** most definitely not a croatian hahah, 
  as the tag says , this is n't about acceptance ( even though i do n't remember that people complained about the lgbt parade here in zagreb ) .

  she said that islam is becoming more radical in bosnia and then some famous bosnian comedian made a bunch of sexist jokes about her . 
  poor kolinda , she 's been getting a lot of unnecessary criticism this week , first from bosnia and now from serbia :'|, 
  i understand why it 's '' controversial '' , but the point is that it 's just a chocolate . 
  and another article says that it 's a factory with 20 % of croats and 60 % of hungarians employed in subotica . 
  good for you , not my favourite , unless you consider * bajadera * a chocolate . 
  but your question '' are we really fighting on a piece of chocolate now ? '',

  at least they have obvious examples . 
  also , i 'm sceptical about the croatian '' \u017divi zid '' party . 
  i do n't think so because he would n't put croatia in the group of the most slavic nations then , as slovakia , czechia and russia have more '' yellow '' than us . 
  lol , looks like they 're more slavic than you and serbia, 
  how tf is belarus the most similar to us ? 
   poles , croatians , belarusians and ukrainians are the most slavic nations . 
  '' south slavic '' is not really slavic , i have no idea where the belarusians got so much blue from . 
  it 's actually a haplogroup originating from the ancient people who lived here before the slavs came .

  if that is n't a peninsula than neither is balkan .

  why not draw a line from hamburg to genoa and call everything west from it a peninsula .

  the first one is closer to the meaning , though . 
  no , adriatic is going to be the new nordic in 40 years . 
  that 's how advanced we will be . 
  well not only croatia according to your article , but also hungary , slovenia and greece . 
   i do n't know about you , but bosniaks are n't culturally almost the same as us . 
  not that it matters , we got used to it . 
  i do n't think that was the point . 
  for example , croats from the north and croats from dalmatia are culturally miles apart , if you look at their music , national costumes , cuisine ... 
  but their basic values are identical . 
  oh wow , looks awesome . 
  does it also have a moon door ? 
  i need some of that green, 
  that 's not where kl is, 
  i love portugal but there is space in the baltics , too . 
  well , not if serbia is closer to the bottom value and slovenia to the upper value of the $ 1000 - $ 2000 range ... 
  did you know you had ancestors from iberia , britain ... ? 
  or was it a surprise ? 
  it was a revenge for the north brabant flag, 
  it probably came alive because hungary was ruled by an admiral while having no sea access , but that 's just guessing , i could n't find any info about its origin . 
   i believe it is the same case with poland , slovakia or hungary . 
  or even slovenia/croatia . 
  yes , but for us it 's mostly * western balkans * that causes an eye-twitch . 
  why not just switch places with macedonia ? 
  there is nothing in that phrase that would suggest croatia and hungary are not friendly countries , it 's more like * not my problem . 
  it 's a phrase . 
  * you/i do n't give a fuck about hungary not having a sea . 
  * , basically not giving fuck about something . 
  slovenia would claim the bay of slavonia due to copyright issues,

  ** i can make the same argument about murder . 
  ** i could , in theory , grab a knife and kill the next person i come across . 
  yet i am not in prison . 
  why ? 
  because i did not murder anyone . 
  if you want to tie marriage and procreation so closely together you need to make it law . 
  if you want children , you have to marry and if you want to marry , you must have children . 
  as long as this does n't apply , everyone should have the right to marriage . 
  no , you ca n't make the same argument about murder . 
  my english is not so good to translate `` deliktna sposobnost '' from croatian but it means `` the ability to pay the price for your crimes '' bascially . 
  so , a severely mentally retarded person will not be punished for a crime . 
  same for marriage . 
  a mentally retarded person can not get married . 
  however , straight couples can by definition have children . 
  they can get married and have children , they can have children without getting married , they can get married and not have children and they may not get married and not have children . 
   by your logic , if you do n't plan on getting children , you should n't have the right to have sex . 
  what makes you say that this is my logic ? 
  i never said or implied that . 
  having sex and getting married is optional . 
   and i never claimed they will . 
  you on the other hand claimed that same sex marriage will hinder the growth of mankind . 
  i said it will either hinder or have no impact at all . 
  and i asked if it 's a gamble that we 're willing to take just for a gesture . 
   this entire thread is about germany passing the law . 
  you are arguing about this being a bad thing in this very thread . 
  my bad . 
  i should 've pointed out that i am talking about gay marriage in general , not just in context to germany . 
   men do n't carry the child in their belly and men also do n't give birth to it . 
  a lot of people come to a similar conclusion regarding gay marriages . 
  gay couples are inherently unable to procreate , why would they have a right to the institution of marriage ? 
  considering the fact no one has contested my claims of marriage and procreation being strongly interwined , i 'll go ahead and presume we agree on it . 
   i quoted the whole thing but to be honest , only the first word of it matters . 
  _ technically _ . 
  it 's possible in _ theory _ but if you 'd know anything about germany you would know that this will never happen . 
    this will never happen yeah , that 's how a lot of bad stuff happened . 
  it is a loophole and it is exploitable . 
  found this gem though :  in 2005 , brian kalt , a professor at michigan state university , published an article `` the perfect crime '' describing how no crimes committed in the idaho portion of yellowstone national park would be constitutionally prosecutable because of these constitutional clauses . 
  an excerpt from prof. kalt 's article is below : `` say that you are in the idaho portion of yellowstone , and you decide to spice up your vacation by going on a crime spree . 
  you make some moonshine , you poach some wildlife , you strangle some people and steal their picnic baskets . 
  you are arrested , arraigned in the park , and bound over for trial in cheyenne , wyoming before a jury drawn from the cheyenne area . 
  but article iii , section 2 plainly requires that the trial be held in idaho , the state in which the crime was committed . 
  perhaps if you fuss convincingly enough about it , the case would be sent to idaho . 
  but the sixth amendment then requires that the jury be from the state ( idaho ) and the district ( wyoming ) in which the crime was committed . 
  in other words , the jury would have to be drawn from the idaho portion of yellowstone national park , which , according to the 2000 census , has a population of precisely zero . '', 
   thus , there would be no eligible jury that could convict you for the serious crimes that you have committed , and you could not be constitutionally prosecuted for crimes committed in the approximately 50 square miles of yellowstone national park located in idaho . 
   people wo n't stop making babies because gay people can get married . 
  and straight people wo n't suddenly become gay because that 's not how it works . 
  neither will gay people start making babies ? 
  then what 's the point ? 
  well , it goes both ways . 
   we have paid maternity leave for men in germany so your example is invalid for your argument . 
   you have to be 25 or above to adopt a child in germany . 
  other than that there are no age restrictions for adoption . 
  so again your example does n't work in this case . 
  first of all , believe it or not germany is not the center of the universe . 
  secondly , men do not have maternity leave . 
  they have parental leave . 
  thirdly , to my understanding , there are inequalities in parental leave :  mothers are entitled to full pay during the six weeks before , and eight weeks after , the birth , known as `` mother protection time '' . 
  men do not have full pay six weeks before the child is born , nor eight weeks after . 
  in response to the maximum age for adoption in germany , the practice heavily restricts adoption to people over 40 years of age . 
  and again , germany is not the alfa and omega ( for you though , it may very well be ) , because in croatia , the maximum age is 39 ( adopted child can not be over 18 , the adopters can not be under 21 , and the age difference must be 18 years ; 21 +18 = 39 ) edit : this is just lack of empathy and reason on behalf of german lawmakers . 
  technically , a 90 year old couple can adopt a new born baby , they die in 1 year , the baby can be adopted over and over again until it reaches 18 years of age . 
  by that time , the child would have had 36 foster parents . 
  how would that reflect on the child 's mental health ? 
  peak german efficiency . 
  we really should model our laws after german laws . 
  ca n't argue with that . 
   it exists , and has existed for many other reasons . 
  yes . 
  the main one is procreation . 
   definitions are ours to change . 
  yes . 
  does n't mean we always should . 
   and by that stupid logic , infertile people should not be allowed to marry and all marriages where the woman has gone through menopause and any existing children are adults , should be dissolved . 
  now you go back and read my comment again . 
  read it twice . 
  then come back and read the following : i said that by definition a man and a woman can always procreate . 
  ** by definition ** . 
  by definition , they have the organs which are necessary for procreation . 
  ** by definition ** . 
  infertility is not understood by definition . 
  it is an exception . 
  a worm in an apple is not , by definition , an apple . 
   please explain how exactly are we doing the opposite ? 
  marriage is central to procreation . 
  procreation is only available to heterosexual couples . 
  by giving marriage to non-heterosexual couples , we are nullifying the last atoms of meaning and importance left in the institution of marriage . 
  if there is no same sex marriage , it goes neither here nor there for procreation . 
  if there is same sex marriage , it either hinders procreation or makes no impact at all . 
  making a gamble like that for a symbolic gesture is an incredibly vapid thing to do . 
  edit : bolded words for dum dums, 
  you ** literally ** have the entirety of human knowledge under your fingertips . 
  i wo n't compensate for your laziness . 
  your posting history coincides with your points . 
   tldr : the only thing important in life is popping out babies showing high reading comprehension and a wish to make a meaningful contribution to the discussion . 
   i assume you are practicing what you preach and doing your duty to mankind by making lots of babies , instead of sitting around and getting stoned while playing video games . 
  first of all , the username is a reminder to myself . 
  changed my habits bit by bit . 
  and yes . 
  i will do my part when the time comes .

  no , but i 'm on the other side in this case . 
  far from me to never participate in serbia-flaming , but in this case you 're far off the mark . 
  you 're talking like they 're preparing for yet another war in the balkans ... this is n't the 90 's ( or the 80 's either ) . 
  if you do n't believe in their `` honest intentions '' or whatever , look at it this way ~ no , they will not be annexing half of bosnia . 
  because that 'd punch yet another hole in their budget , the ship for that sailed in the 90 's , regardless of what dodik is barking whenever he 's displeased . 
  ( same goes for herceg-bosna and croatia . ), 
  so , you can chill a bit now . 
  being angry at issues like srebrenica is understandable , but you flaming about `` serbs are coming hide yo wife hide yo children '' on every post regarding serbia is frankly tiring . 
  and another thing : you end up looking just as * balkan * as they ^ tm do !, 
  yeah , but for the example of montenegro , take a look at a comparable case : [ croatia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_enlargement_of_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) the vast majority of our chapters were opened and closed within 1-2 years , with only 3 exceptions . 
  and anyways , it was n't actually `` so many chapters being so problematic '' that held us down for a long time , but two big issues : cooperating with hague , and the angry border dispute with slovenia . 
  meanwhile , montenegro has closed 2 chapters , has 7 yet unopened , and is currently working on 24 opened . 
  as far as i 'm aware , they have no major issues with borders/bad neighbor relations/hague and so on . 
  they 're in nato as of yesterday , so they have less of a `` conflict of interest '' as far as the west is concerned . 
  and to that you can add that their landmass and population is so tiny that adding them to the eu may look like a statistical error , i do n't see why other eu members would block them . 
  i mean , yes closing all those chapters + the 27 doing the ratification within the next 3 years is a stretch , but - not impossible . 
  [ right you are , comrade !, 
  italy gib back rightful jugo clay !,

  why not both ? 
  i mean , our side is stuck until we build the pelje\u0161ac bridge . 
  after that , i do n't expect it 'll take ages to finally connect dubrovnik and the rest of the far-south , we 're losing tourist money by not having a motorway on all of our coast . 
  montenegro is developing its own tourism too , and they 'll have increasing access to development funds from eu in the following years ( for example eu will pay for 85 % of pelje\u0161ac bridge ) , so they can use that to build their own coastal motorways , one between dubrovnik and kotor would certainly help . 
  and so on . 
  as for bosnia , yeah i 'm kinda annoyed by the lack of development there too , connecting osijek to sarajevo/zenica to split/dubrovnik ( and extending it to pecs in hungary ) would be dearly welcomed . 
  so , idk , lobby with the eu to help with that ? 
  :p but i do n't see it happening before the coastal roads . 
  `` bih '' is short for `` bosna i hercegovina '' . 
  i think it 's good that english versions of that never caught on , what would it be ? 
  that 's just painful . 
  and yes , bosnia has a tiny strip of coast on the adriatic , bisecting croatia . 
  it all started hundreds of years ago when the republic of ragusa ( dubrovnik ) felt nervous about bordering venice ( cause they did a lot of annexing ) , so they sold a strip of land to the ottomans . 
  more than 300 years later , eu will cough up some 85 % of the money needed to build a big bridge [ over the pelje\u0161ac peninsula , ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/images/vedran/untitled%20folder/220117_peljesac.jpg ) thus making croatia ... whole again . 
  ( well , `` navigable by road '' does n't have the same ring to it . ), 
  \\* ode to joy intensifies *,

  because they expect it 'd never be used against them . 
  after all , they consider themselves * innocent * , which apparently makes them different from all the muslims living in uk , so there 's no way that their government would use it against them . 
  naaaaah , governments are always * honest and fair * when given powers of `` guilty without trial '' . 
  i swear to god , the `` logic '' of some of the people posting here drives me up the wall !, 
  i guess he imagines they 're ethnically cleansed `` into the sea '' . 
  another word for that is genocide . 
  or uk invades whatever is their - or their parents or grandparents - country of origin and dumps them there . 
  `` well , maybe this one wo n't be from t_d ? 
  it can happen , right ? '', 
  < checks  `` yes , of course this one is from t_d , fine concerned citizens that they are .

   there was the srebrenica massacre as there were many others done by bosniak muslims against serb civilians .

  [ false equivalence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_war#/media/file:ethnic_makeup_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_before_and_after_the_war.jpg ) narrative [ strikes again !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_war#rdc_figures ), 
  you think wrong . 
  i was in primary school in the 90 's , so keep in mind that this was during tu\u0111man 's propaganda time , and we certainly did n't skip over jasenovac , or paveli\u0107 being hitler 's ally . 
  nowadays i hear about it every other day , as i said elsewhere , if i did any more remembering i 'd be german . 
  and yes , that does n't apply to just redditors , you have commemorations there every year , and it 's certainly mentioned in the news . 
  now , wwii being essentially both an international and a civil war here ( at the same time , such special olympics ! ), 
  is another thing , same for the disputed numbers of victims ( on all sides ) . 
  and the narrative is further complicated by the fact that while partisans may have had a righteous goal ( it was that , beyond doubt ) , their actions - and the communist dictatorship that came after - were n't exactly clean . 
  it 's sort of like ... partisans were less like the western front , more like the red army . 
  look at how eastern europe feels about its partial collaboration with nazis and `` liberation '' by ussr today to see why the issue is n't some kind of good vs bad . 
  just googled `` head of state '' a bit . 
  apparently it 's always the monarch or the president , and that means they tend to be ceremonial roles , real power usually goes to the pm . 
  the `` head of government '' is the more relevant role in many cases ... though if you ask me , to someone who 's not informed , the words `` head of state '' sound more powerful than `` head of government '' . 
  yes and no . 
  that is , we 're not going to get rich from tourism alone , and that 's not what 's happening anyways : for all that people only mention `` they live off tourism '' , it 's around 20 % of our gdp , maybe less . 
  industry is at 26.6 % , which is n't actually that bad when you look at [ european averages . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vejb5 ) as for higher-class tourism ... what do you mean ? 
  we 're no vegas or dubai , but we 're never going to be that , and i do n't think we should ever try anyways . 
  but . 
  in the late 90 's , yeah i 'd say we were the `` sea and sun '' lame tourism . 
  nowadays , whenever i answer in our r/croatia megathread , i can basically always find whatever activity the tourist is looking for . 
  from historical tours , romantic views and quiet places , to adventure sports and endless parties . 
  and for every wallet , at that . 
  yep , rosencrantz and guildenstern . 
  i felt like shakespeare was trolling by the end there , sort of like a `` ps . 
  so 95 % of the main actors are dead , and just in case you were wondering , the two stooges are dead too ! '', 
  my 16-year-old self was very impressed , and the username combination stuck with me since then :d, 
  that 's an increase of 14 % compared to last year . 
  for context , we have a little more than 4 million people living here . 
  i think we can officially stop calling croatia `` a hidden gem '' by now ... even [ the uae have launched daily flights ] ( https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-to-launch-daily-flights-to-croatia-91252 ),

  the origin and history of the word `` whore '' is interesting ... `` barbara walker , in her dictionary of woman 's myths and secrets , points out that the hebrew word hor means a cave , pit , or dark hole . 
  the spanish word for whore , puta , derives from the latin term for a well , but the latin term for grave , literally `` a hole in the earth , '' is puticuli , meaning womb of rebirth . 
  these terms for whore were not derogatory . 
  the latin term had its root in the vedic , an early sanskrit language , wherein the word puta is defined as pure and holy . 
  the cave , the pit , the hole , and the bottomless black lake were metaphors for the great goddess , she who is unnameable , that darkness primordial from which all life ( light ) is born . 
  she is the everything and the nothing -- hole-y , holy , wholly . 
  the sacred whore at work was , in fact , the manifestation the great goddess . 
  today these ideas are not completely lost . 
  the hebrew folk dance named the hora , a tradition at jewish weddings , is named after the circle dances of the sacred harlots . 
  such holy harlots were often `` brides of god '' similar to modern nuns , the `` brides of christ . '', 
  the holy harlots were set apart to give birth to sons of god . 
  in other words , these women had the job of changing human-animal into human-god . '', 
  `` typical example . 
  the horae of aphrodite -- her `` celestial nymphs , who performed the dances of the hours , acted as midwives to the gods , and inspired earthly horae ( harlot-priestesses ) to train men in the sexual mysteries '' * -- were magically transformed by the church into virgins ( the kind who do n't have sex ) , martyred , and turned into three maiden saints -- agape , chionia , and irene . 
  done . 
  another example . 
  in iceland , a very matriarchal society at that time , every woman worshipped the goddess in her own home , on her own hearth . 
  this woman was known as a `` hussy , '' and typically shared her `` hus '' ( which meant both home and place of worship ) with more than one `` hus-band . '' but when iceland agreed in about 1000 ad to become christian , guess what ? 
  the word hussy became a derogative term . 
  done . 
  the christian patriarchy seemed to be all about taking the power to choose away from women , a woman 's power over her own body being a prime example . 
  at first glance one might think , how can anyone take one 's power to choose , or to control what she does with her body , away from a woman ? 
  we all know how it 's done today . 
  through public opinion , rape and the perpetuation of rape culture , legislation , and any number of societally accepted norms ( from pay scales to product marketing ) that marginalize and diminish women , or try to . 
  and often succeed . 
  as the catholic orthodoxy rose to prominence in western and eastern europe , a woman with a lover became indistinguishable in the eyes of the church from a professional prostitute . 
  both were considered `` whores . '' in fact , women who gave their love and body freely to a lover were tortured in hell as viciously as the reviled prostitutes . 
  st. augustine and others depicted the torments reserved for sexually active women ( whether lovers or whores ) as being among the very worst -- [ greater than those for murderers , for example .

  nope , time does n't exist like you think it does ... http://www.physicscentral.com/explore/plus/timeless.cfm `` philosophy and physics may seem like polar opposites , but they regularly address quite similar questions . 
  recently , physicists have revisited a topic with modern philosophical origins dating over a century ago : the unreality of time . 
  what if the passage of time were merely an illusion ? 
  can a world without time make sense ? 
  while a world without the familiar passage of time may seem far-fetched , big names in physics , such as string theory pioneer ed witten and theorist brian greene , have recently embraced such an idea . 
  a timeless reality may help reconcile differences between quantum mechanics and relativity , but how can we make sense of such a world ? 
  if physics does indeed suggest that the flow of time is illusory , then philosophy may be able to shed light on such a strange notion . 
  british philosopher j.m.e mctaggart advanced this idea in 1908 in his paper titled , `` the unreality of time . '' philosophers widely consider his paper to be one of the most influential , early examinations of this possibility . 
  looking through mctaggart 's philosophical lens , a reality without time becomes a little more intuitive and , in principle , possible . '',

  a merican living in zagreb write a bit about just that [ here ] ( https://zablogreb.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/the-problem-of-work/ ) . 
  his blog is interesting in general , cause he points out not just the flaws ( i know them all ) , but also the positives , some of which i never properly thought about ( people do n't appreciate what they have ) , and the kicker is - many of the positives he points out are lacking in usa . 
  that always gives me a strange feeling . 
  like when my friends spent a year in working in london though erasmus . 
  they had plenty of good things to say ( obviously , london/uk are much richer and just * bigger in everything * than we are ) , but they also added a lot of `` but , you also have ... [ bad thing ] '' . 
  like working 9-5 , which kinda ruins your whole day . 
  endless crowds , traffic jams . 
  certain parts of the city being unsafe ( as in , `` better not risk it '' ) after 9 pm .

  stuff like that being good/better here , we like it but we take it for granted . 
  well , we have 28 days of paid vacation , plus 13 annual public holidays ( hopefully they do n't fall on the weekend ) . 
  maternity leave : `` 28 days before the expected day of birth , then until the child turns six months of age '' , so that 's ... 31 weeks ? 
  98 days is obligatory . 
  not entirely sure how they calculate time not at work , we have 40-hour workweeks ( ignoring the illegal overtime , that comes to extra 1-2 hours daily in worst minimum-wage jobs ) . 
  crowds usually are n't so bad that we need an extra 2-4 hours to get from/to work , let 's say another 1-1 .5 hours daily in most cities . 
  as for our misery , that 's because we do n't have enough euromonies and we 'd complain even if we had them , anyways . 
  i 've heard it said that `` us french go on a strike to complain about x , and then go home and complain about the strike . '',

   i 'm italian too but 186cm blonde with blue eyes a number of roman emperors were tall blondes . 
   the romans had to recruit barbarians into their ranks because their population simply could n't sustain their army . 
  that is far from the case , they were one of the most populous political entities on earth . 
  it is merely that the tribes kept migrating within roman borders and the most logical step seemed recruiting them into the military machine . 
  the persian empire ( and others ) did this for centuries and it worked pretty well ( while the empire lasted ofc ) . 
   their tax base also was n't large enough to sustain the empire , so they had to get slaves to do all the work it is the reverse , mass slavery is what destroyed the tax base and the roman peasant . 
  if they made slavery illegal and focused on making everyone citizens within the empire , they might have survived for quite some time . 
  no , because they would all leave there asap , back to where ever they came from .

  i believe that in ` prosinac ' it is actually the meaning under d for [ pro- ] ( http://hjp.znanje.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=dl9nxhc%3d&amp;keyword=pro ) :  proces kroz koji \u0161to prolazi u punom opsegu radnje , zavr\u0161nost radnje and in that sense ` prosinac ' would refer to ** becoming ** grayish/ashen-like/light bluish/white . 
  at least that is what i think as it snows ( or at least it used to ) and everything becomes white/blue . 
  yes , but it is how korean/chinese/japanese would be if written in latin script , so it is n't really based on a particular language . 
  in some part it does rely on english , for instance , ch is pronounced like you would in english [ t\u0283 ] and not like in french or german , but then again x in chinese is something closer to [ \u0292 ] . 
  yes , it would be much clearer as to how to pronounce if everything was done with ipa notation , but unfortunately only few would actually understand it , i believe . 
  that 's the origin of the greating : bolan ne bio !, 
  yes , but i could n't find that verb in skok 's etymological dictionary and he has an impressive and quite extensive list of croatian words , be it dialectal or archaic . 
  [ brezen ] ( https://hr.wiktionary.org/wiki/brezen ) existed in croatian as well . 
  it 's just that o\u017eujak was much more common and therefore chosen as standard name . 
  russia is not in eu . 
  this is about countries that are already part of ** european union ** . 
  not about every country in ** europe ** . 
  it 's the first time i heard of this etymology . 
  i think this is incorrect because in some dialects there were other form attested , such as [ ` la\u017eak ' , ` l\u017eujak ' , or ` la\u017eujak ' ] ( https://hr.wiktionary.org/wiki/o\u017eujak ) , and each of this forms points to the word for lie . 
  explanation of croatian name for march : the word * o\u017eujak * [ ipa pronunciation : o\u031e\u0292uja\u0308k ] is derived from older form l\u044a\u017euj\u044ck\u044a . 
  the root of this word is word l\u044a\u017e\u044c , which in contemporary croatian is * la\u017e * , and it means * a lie * . 
  it 's because the third month can be quite tricky . 
  it can snow , it can appear warm and sunny , and then suddenly it turns to rain , so people named it * a treacherous month * . 
  i do n't believe he was ethnic croat . 
  his ethnicity is serbian as the majority of evidence points to that , even though you can never be 100 % sure with that , and he had american citizenship . 
  he was born in croatia though , which was part of austrian empire at that time . 
  and i also believe that he can be celebrated by croatians as well - even though he was a serb - for what he did , not for what stood on his birth certificate . 
  we should be more inclusive , not exclusive . 
  he di n't choose the place of his birth , and he did not choose to whom he would be born . 
  if that little tool ( :p ) you posted is used for woodwork ( i 've no idea honestly ) , then it is the same . 
  and it 's not surprising since romanian word is borrowed from some slavic language . 
  [ and that tool on the left is tesla in croatian . 
  yea , of course . 
  same as ketchup . 
  yes , but in latin and/or greek . 
  you go hungary . 
  people rarely appreciate translation of words and adjusting it to one 's language over simple borrowing ... 
  your remarks stands . 
  i was n't trying to prove you wrong . 
  mention of dislike was to explain the change in the meaning and it has nothing to do with todays relationship between people or nation and dislike with each other . 
  the word is not from yesterday ... 
  if [ skok ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_skok ) is right , then both words ( tuka/tukan and \u0107urka / \u0107uran ) are of the same origin . 
  in his etymological dictionary he derives it from tur\u010din ( turk ) - it also corresponds with the english name for the animal - and it also explains the reason why tuka can be used as a derogatory word ( meaning stupid person , mostly used for females ) - while puran/pura or purica can not - because slavs did n't show love for turks ( ottomans ) in the past . 
  it was supposed to be y , i think at least . 
  maybe it was a mix up 'cause american keyboard has y after t . but then w is also missing . 
  yea , you 're right , i did n't even check the year of his birth , i just assumed it was during a-u . 
  ups . 
  well , austro-hungarian then . 
  there was no austria at that time , unless you want to irritate hungarians . 
  not exactly . 
  in english you use pronoun ` they ' for gender neutrality . 
  in croatian pronoun ` on ' is referring to a noun * du\u0161manin * , not to a male person . 
  croatian nouns have grammatical gender , a feature modern english does not utilize anymore - that 's why ` he ' only refers to men . 
  as can be seen in the previous sentence , theword * enemy * is in singular , therefore this grammatical discrepancy - between enemy ( sg . ), 
  and they ( pl . ), 
  - has to be build semantically and with context , which is here given . 
  yea , i remember the same thing when i learned the russian . 
  they do n't use verb ` to have ' ( imati/imeti ) , but rather a phrase ' y menya est + g ' . 
  the same expression is understand in the same way in croatian ( is it same for slovenian ? 
  ) , but it does sound a bit `` poetic '' . 
  well , not much different from this . 
  continental part would be central europe , and the coastal is southern . 
  many croatian themselves will point the * cultural * differences between continental and coastal croatians . 
  they do have horse archers . 
  makes sense actually . 
  both are/were amazing riders and title ` khan ' sounds similar to ` khal ' . 
  croatia centre and south-centre . 
  case closed !, 
  no need for new maps, 
  this is almost exactly how i view the europe . 
  some countries simply ca n't be just ` eastern ' , ` southern ' , ` western ' ... 
  proto-slavic and latin are cognate , and also english word wit came from the same word making word witness ( which is also the meaning of greek histor - `` the one who saw knows , so can testify '' ) . 
  similarly we have svjedok ( s-v\u011bd-ok ) `` the one with knowledge '' . 
  yea , probably true as it is same in croatian . 
  in croatian word for chemistry is ` lu\u010dba ' which is from verb ` lu\u010diti ' which basically means to separate or to discern . 
  well , it 's not a coincidence . 
  ` saga ' comes from a verb which means ` to talk ' , ` to say ' ( german ` sagen ' and english ` say ' are of the same origin ) . 
  same way our word for history ` povijest ' is derived from ( \u010dakavian ) ` povidati ' which means to talk . 
  what 's even better is that germanic words for talking/saying is related to the words for seeing . 
  same as in croatian [ povijest < v ** \u011b ** d ( znanje ) ~ v ** i ** d ( sight ) ] , and in greek : histor `` the one who knows and/or sees '' . 
  wtf is kozovperstk ? 
  does it have to do with goats and fingers or what ? 
  probably the weirdest slavic name for months . 
  can we into nordic now ? 
  can we into nordic now ? 
  do you also have an english word for hamster ? 
  there is always an option of returning that piece of land they do n't know what to do with so that the bridge does n't have to be build , and the problem is solved . 
  what was the joke ? 
  it can . 
  and it was . 
  it was written with special type of cyrillic called bosan\u010dica / arvatica/western cyrillic/croatian script ... 
  croatians call it ' \u010dudnovati kljuna\u0161 ' ( not kljunar ) which translates to english something as peculiar beak mammal . 
  what if he puts the car in the swimming pool and fills the car with water and then opens the door , and then he repeats it until pool is full and car is washed ? 
  that 's madness . 
  and there 's also glavomet ( glava = \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432a ) . 
  but rukomet is fine , right ? 
   lest it catch ~ ~ es ~ ~ you lest is a special conjunction , it requires subjunctive . 
  something that real music should not be about firework but feelings , and this shows that real music wins . 
  or something like that . 
  you 've missed two asses . 
  did he just shit on everyone ? 
  dem taxes on points . 
  jury is such a circlejerk ... 
  we are on the left side at least . 
  so only bulgaria has a real shot ?

  we focused mostly on europe but also studied some major world events . 
  we usually did the system of learning about some period in europe in general and then the same period in croatia, 
  i think i know why . 
  what 's the most popular alcoholic drink there ? 
  the acceptable times are either for lunch , afternoon coffee or dinner . 
  first the guests are asked if they want coffee . 
  while the water boils some kind of liquor is server , usually rakija or a weaker fruit brandy . 
  then comes the meal which is usually intentionally made so that there are leftovers . 
  after that it 's coffee time served with some cookies . 
  the guests are expected to stay around 3h with the exception of staying to drink together which results in sleeping over . 
  everytime a factory shuts down their workers protests a bit and that 's pretty much it, 
  they do n't work in my country, 
  usually they do n't check but you might get some bad luck and they do, 
  it started way before it , it hit us hard and we still did n't get out of it . 
  the only economical growth we had was the few months this year we had no official government, 
  well it was n't even a state , let alone a country . 
  i 'm just sticking blindly to the question until the op clarifies, 
  war nope , except the usual rednecks not getting over the past . 
  economical state is way worse than in 2004 unfortunately, 
  it sais country . 
  there was a croatian kingdom but i do n't count that since it was so long ago it really does n't have anything to do with modern croatia , besides that the only country we had was this one . 
  yeah , our army still uses the same tanks and planes and stuff and everyone has war stories and the ones that are too young have parents who did survive it . 
  my favourite one is about my great grandmother who refused to go the shelter and just screamed how she survived the two world wars and that what 's a small border conflict gon na do to her xd, 
  it sais country , not nation . 
  the country itself is only 25 years old, 
  royal republic - the president daughter plays in the background, 
  i feel this question is so unfair considering how old some countries are and then there 's us edit : op added the edit sooo i 'm gon na go with the whole end of yugoslavia story . 
  bbc actually has a really good set of documentaries about it, 
  typical croatian citizen does n't give a damn about some old pots and stuff . 
  but wow a new mall , that 's gon na bring in the tourists or smth idk the logic, 
  is okay op , borrow some of our cities . 
  our government even started knocking some ancient ones ( literally ancient , ancient greece to be more specific ) to make room for shopping malls, 
  to me personally not but to the majority it means everything, 
  like anything directly under the government it 's absolutely amazing . 
  used to think forcing us to pay for our education which should be free according to the constitution is horrible , but the deeper in the system i go the less it surprises me, 
  we read no books or poetry here . 
  just half-brained textbook articles, 
  am dating an australian . 
  she 's quite different from a typical croatian girl but i like that, 
  whoa i had no idea . 
  why did google skip germany ? 
  to our exes , to our future sweethearts and everything in between, 
  that 's genius :') i 'm surprised they did n't try that already, 
  and the accents , do n't forget the accents, 
  i guess the capitals but honestly you would get a better idea of what is europe by chilling on street view than visiting just 2 cities, 
  not really , mostly because half of our military equipment has a 50-50 chance of randomly failing due to age . 
  to show off a single country with 2 cities is a real task , to show the whole continent is just impossible, 
  yeah it would . 
  it 's not super common to hear in a normal conversation but not really weird . 
  ( after the standard grammar changes to djevojka ), 
  in countries like ours , you live near the border unrelated to where in the country you live, 
  [ not even a full week ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/57qgox/how_much_of_your_country_can_speak_english/ ), 
  not very popular in general but still has a nice user base and a large number of young people heard about it . 
  i know quite a few people that use it but that 's mostly due to me going to a computer engineering school, 
  does the live feed of the croatian parliament count ? 
  a conservative christian country , what do you think ? 
  yeah same here or is it ? 
  probably just in zagreb . 
  most schools do n't have swimming pools among old people outside of big cities it 's quite common, 
  there 's a difference between the two ? 
  i do n't think about tourists , i think about their wallets, 
  check the list please before you talk out of your bum hole, 
  there are always old people who never been to the sea , even in countries that have access to the sea, 
  nooo that would never happen to us , we are najja\u010di afterall yes that 's how it 's really written, 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_official_languages the more you know , there 's a list for people like you . 
  but i do understand your frustration they are quite similar, 
  i 'm just waiting for us to start using the write as you say rule xd, 
  serbian and croatian are n't the same languages ... 
  there was a whole war about that , remember the pew , pew , boom ? 
  oh yes , those are really works of art xd memorijski pruti\u0107 ( usb ) , dodirnik ( touchpad ) , zvjezdi\u0161te ( router ) etc. 
  our croatian teacher gets a stroke every time she hears some new word has been added, 
  well the political speeches we hear really are wonders but i 'm thinking that 's not what you 're implying xd, 
  5,6 m according to wikipedia , check again hint : croatian , not serbo-croatian, 
  we 're actually at 5,6 million but i guess it does n't hurt to comment . 
  movies are always subbed , cartoons usually dubbed . 
  a lot of books are translated no problems with that not counting the company sites and some forums we really just use internet on english the language is going in a bad direction just like the country itself . 
  luckily for me i hate the language ( except the fact that it 's like the best language to swear in ), 
  rakija ( very strong homemade brandy ), 
  sounds like a normal afternoon in croatia, 
  casually leaves out serbia ? 
  the croatian parliament, 
  poverty no , how rich they are yes . 
  like there was a post on reddit recently about what to do when you get the urge to just carelessly spend money ( mass impulse buying ) . 
  words ca n't describe how abstract that is to me education ehh there are universities that are best in the world and there are horribly bad schools . 
  i guess they just do it differently, 
  http://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/vukovar/sights/museums-galleries/place-memory-vukovar-hospital-1991 http://www.dark-tourism.com/index.php/15-countries/individual-chapters/162-ovcara-memorial-center-vukovar they are not giant , super modernised museums . 
  though the impression they leave on you will leave you speechless . 
  being built on the actual places of tragedy helps that atmosphere a lot . 
  unfortunately poets are viewed as useless members of the society and seen in a bad light in general . 
  you said how the line is when the government is n't appointed democratically . 
  does it apply to the whole government or if the line is crossed already when some of the ministers are appointed that way ? 
  does being picked democratically means being voted for by the majority or does being picked through the law of a democratic government but not the majority also count ? 
  either i 'm stupid or that answers nothing , but i fear it 's the first one, 
  depends on what you mean by appointed democratically, 
  not all but quite a few points you made here 's here are already being done in a lot of modern democracies edit : * checks your points again * my country is so f * cked, 
  error 404,

  that guy was a fanboy of a warcriminal ? 
  i 'm glad they got him . 
  hope he rots in jail . 
  copkillers in the us . 
  that 's basically a death sentence . 
  what ? 
  really ? 
  wot why ? 
  wow thanks for the photomath one it 's really cool . 
  mate look . 
  i get it . 
  i understand your points . 
  but if i tell you that it wo n't work you ca n't just say try harder . 
  these people refuse to intergrate . 
  look at the roma population in sweden . 
  sweden of all places and they ca n't even intergrate there . 
  look at the large populations of turks in the netherlands/germany/austria . 
  many have free higher education , free everything basically and yet they are still at the bottom of the barrel societywise . 
  now look at the balkan and eastern european countries . 
  you would think developed first world nations would be able to intergrate all these different people but they did n't / could n't / failed/called it multiculti . 
  how do you expect croatia or serbia to tackle the roma problem then ? 
  we barely have functioning governments and are plagued by corruption and yet our primary concern should be educating roma ? 
  we have programs for them . 
  they do n't show up for school etc. 
  what are you gon na do sterilize them so they do n't have 20 children ? 
  criminilize begging or soliciting ? 
  take away the children on what basis . 
  i admire your sense of iddylic vision but you also have to be grounded in reality . 
  also dude you should change your username that shit is fucked up . 
  good . 
  i really hope orban gets kicked out of his position as soon as possible . 
  he 's like a russian cheerleader . 
  hungary needs a leader who actually cares about hungary .

  i do n't get it ur-namma objasni lipo molim te . 
  that was during the revolution and stalinist purges . 
  look at russia before 1900 '' . 
  hell they were on par with most of western europe . 
  even during soviet times they were cranking out quite a few bright minds . 
  stop downplaying russia . 
  i do n't like where they are headed but give credit where credit is due . 
  right . 
  i mean it says right in the article that she is n't particalarly fond of her job so i just thought why not just live off the dole if you do n't have anything else . 
  makes sense now . 
  oh god . 
  i know my history . 
  you bring up some fine points but remember there is the host country and as well as the attitudes of the roma themself . 
  also  crnaruka you fokkin w0t m8 ? 
  i see . 
  wow . 
  i like how you generalize all the albanians for what happens inside international crime cartels mate . 
  should i also think lowly of portugese because of what some of your brothers or sisters are doing or have done ? 
  wot the flying fuck . 
  why would you resort to prostitution in denmark of all places . 
  do n't you guys have like a super efficient ss service ? 
  wot . 
  nothing ??? 
  women are nice tho . 
  gib clay . 
  i know . 
  i 'm just saying it 's more like ceuta or mellile then oh let 's say hong kong or macau . 
  it still is more oriented towards relaxation and vacationing rather then work . 
  but overall you are right . 
  topkek . 
  montenegro it is then . 
  falklands is nice . 
  what about straya ? 
  why ? 
  i mean do n't get me wrong . 
  cyprus is beautifull but these kind of islands are more for relaxation/retirement/raising children rather then work etc. 
  basically he was the head honco and supported the corrupting infrastructure . 
  without him the chain breaks and collapses . 
  also the void he 's leaving behind will not be filled up with another carbon copy of himself but rather be distrubuted throughout the city . 
  thanks for the compliment mate but croatia is not nearly finished shedding it 's former socialist corruption skin . 
  i 'd argue that slovenia is in a better position . 
  you guys managed to keep your country together without serious war and on top of that jump right in the eu . 
  big props to slovenia . 
  do n't downplay your country brate . 
  maribor is bootiful btw . 
  topkek m8 . 
  where are you from ? 
  no really i was just having a jab at you . 
  obviously you arent retarded as well . 
  living uo to your username . 
  god is a serb right . 
  atleast our capital was n't burned to the ground 44 times . 
  you guys started so many wars and lost all of them . 
  face it the only thing you had to show for it were dead serbs and territorial loss . 
  fact is that i 'd rather turkey join the eu then serbia . 
  so mad . 
  jasenovac best day of my lyfe . 
  u mad chetnik ? 
  well . 
  you are n't european . 
  you also will never be . 
  is it so hard for you to understand ?

  [ 5 ] he objected to the persecution of jews and nazi laws , helped jews and others to escape and criticized usta\u0161e atrocities in front of zagreb cathedral in 1943 . 
   handball ( close to 450k ) . 
  please , cut down on handball a bit . 
  said he from bosnia . 
  seriously , do n't speak in others ' name . 
  most of them are from zagreb , except this [ one ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/old-photos-same-locations-then-and-now-ognjen-ivanovic-croatia/?image_id=pula-arena__880.jpg ) and this [ one ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/old-photos-same-locations-then-and-now-ognjen-ivanovic-croatia/?image_id=pula-forum__880.jpg ) . 
  i believe they 're both from pula . 
  i personally liked the stark contrast of this [ picture ] ( http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/trg-zima__880.jpg ) , the snowy blizzard of the past vs the sunny days of today . 
  lol , how did you get here ? 
   all the culture shocks when actually meeting americans i think it 's a bit of an exaggeration . 
  the biggest dividing factor would be their social system . 
  dok-ing is also developing electric cars named [ loox ] ( http://www.dok-ing.hr/products/automotive/loox ) . 
  these should be a bit more affordable to general public . 
   sdp = social democratic party huh , we got a party with the same name . 
  actually , they 're in charge now . 
   imo people in zagreb spoke kajkavian as the result of degermanization/pan-slavism started after national movements in 19 . century , together with anti-class movements in following century . 
  it 's not my opinion , kajkavian was always there . 
  germanization just came on top of it , pan-slavic people were more prone to shtokavian , but none of them were born shtokavians ( when we 're speaking of zagreb ) . 
  furthermore , even between pan-slavists there were disagreements about what dialect to choose and many opposed novoshtokavian . 
  this is incorrect . 
  kajkavian most definitely was not a * peasent * dialect . 
  it was spoken by everyone , and there were many noblemen ( zrinski for example , they even had * ozaljski knji\u017eevni krug * , which was on kajkavian ) . 
  ljudevit gaj first published his works on kajkavian , but then switched to shtokavian due to pan-slavism . 
  people in zagreb also spoke kajkavian , choosing herzegovinian shtokavian had more to do with pan-slavism . 
  now i want to try some , but it 's 3 a.m. - , -, 
  hm , i think \u0161trukli and fritule are something else . 
  we do have [ \u0161trudle ] ( http://i708.photobucket.com/albums/ww87/flavija/dsc02538_resize.jpg ) ( they can be with cheese , cherries , etc. 
  ) , but they are generally sweet ( the cherry one is kinda sour-sweet ) . 
  i tried it in southern germany . 
  it 's good , but i do prefer pizza ( heck , i prefer pizza to everything , haha ) .

  i was just joking . 
  no harm intended . 
  nice idea . 
  it would actually be interesting if / r/europe had more surveys ( and as sticky threads ) . 
  'cause we big , they irrelevant . 
  nice tips . 
  am i in danger if i 'd want to use flash while taking a few photos of them ? 
  i do n't know how * flash * sensitive they are . 
  but that whole episode with ustashas would have been avoided . 
  nah , slovenes ( yugos ) are really agressive and hostile . 
  the slovak did him a favour with this tip !, 
  we 're `` of '' ? 
  edit : haha , got it from other comments now . 
  we da great wall of china !, 
  it 's zagreb . 
  the scaffolding are here more than a decade now , i do n't honestly know what they 're doing . 
  but he was primarily talking about gotovina . 
  that was his point . 
   i guess it just gets filtered out at this point . 
   he kinda has a point . 
  could you be so kind to point out the point regarding gotovina ? 
  because after returning to croatia ( he was deemed innocent ) , he explicitly told people `` past is past and that we should look to future '' . 
  he secluded himself , got a fishing business going and never got involved in politics again . 
  he even helped out some illegal imigrants and gave them a job . 
  now , if all that makes him an ustasha/fascist . 
  well ... 
  even more hilarious are people comparing him to seselj . 
  no more gemi\u0161tek for you today !, 
  not a grand master plan , just hypocrisy and dishonesty . 
  it was just an example that could have been found on r/europe as well . 
  well , i tried to gauge the public opinion , somewhat . 
  obviously , people very fond of russia and anti-west are n't that few and far between . 
  i read some weird comments here as well , and that was n't coming from the samoserem/jedemslaninu/ramos trio . 
  i think it was from ` mrcavendish ' ( smthing like that ) , that one really baffled me . 
  i ca n't seem to find his account , but if it pops around here , i can try searching for the comment . 
  it was something along the lines of `` we got ta play pro-west to have approval for what comes next '' . 
  edit : i 'll have to correct myself , here 's the comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zmqp2/when_did_you_first_feel_european/cpkuhpb?context=3  smiri se bolan . 
  sad nam je vreme da cekamo u miri pa smiri se malo na r/europe  chill out , dude . 
  you sound like an extremist and the last thing we need is that europe thinks we 're still some small russian extremists . 
  there 's time for fighting and then there 's time for waiting in peace . 
  now is the time for waiting in peace , so chill out on r/europe . 
  would you also classify various commenters on different serbian sites as anti-serbs ? 
  what i 'm reading from him is exactly what i could 've read on b92 , which is supposed to be lefty . 
  some of them getting to reddit is n't a massive stretch of imagination , you ca n't downplay numbers of people with this sentiment . 
  however , this account probably is someone 's double . 
  napoleon also united italy , i 'd say both of these backfired for them . 
  damn , we were doing good . 
  :p fun fact , there 's sort of a [ statue ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/granica_ilirskih_pokrajina_zagreb.jpg/800px-granica_ilirskih_pokrajina_zagreb.jpg ) in zagreb that represents the borders between french ( illiryian province ) and austrian empire in that time . 
  pls , no yugos allowed . 
  if it makes you feel any better , i consider all of it turkish food . 
  hm , ordering from us is a mild annoyance , plus you got ta account for customs and pdv ( vat ) - i got ta agree on that . 
  where do you usually order from ? 
  i presume it 's the board games you order . 
   close contact of the whole upper body , basically rubbing nips - vs - light cheek-to-cheek touch . 
  but you 're wearing clothes so there 's no skin contact :p i 'm really not fond of hugs as well , it 's more of a `` if you insist thing '' . 
   a good internet connection , easily available boardgames , having no problems with international shipping ... and people actually respecting red lights . 
  never had a problem with what you listed . 
  where do you live ? 
  internet is `` just fine '' at worst in zagreb , perhaps you should check with your internet provider and look into the available options , and what infrastructure your building supports . 
  most international sites ship normally , i did n't have too many problems . 
  as for red lights , apart from some senile geezers ( they really stand out ) and assholes , they are pretty much respected . 
  granted , if there 's no traffic , people will cross it regardless . 
  as for board games , i do n't know if you 've heard of [ carta magica ] ( http://www.cartamagica.hr/ ) . 
  they 're relatively close to the centre . 
  you can get various board games in toy shops , but i figure this is what you 're looking for . 
  they also have magic tournaments , game nights and else what you 'd expect from a local game shop . 
  you should pay it a visit if that 's what you 're into . 
  so excessive . 
  what 's wrong with a handshake , or a hug ?

  forget the number . 
  how many is secondary and we can always just say there 's no room . 
  who we 're getting is the more important issue . 
  we can take 10.000 people is those people are skilled workers with a decent education in fields where we have deficits . 
  if we can get them everything is fine , but what i suspect will happen is the germans taking everyone they can use and dumping the rest on to us . 
  10.000 professionals is a boon , 1000 unskilled laborers is a riot waiting to happen . 
  there is one thing about quotas we should be talking about now . 
  how the winners and losers in the `` new home country '' lottery are getting picked . 
  as i mentioned in a comment above , my principal issue is n't with taking in people . 
  as long as the quotas are reasonable , 1-3 thousand people at first and maybe up to 10k over a few years it 's doable , but under once condition . 
  we pick who we 're getting , no exceptions . 
  there is no way in hell we can let germany hand pick the people they can use to enrich their economy and then dump the dregs on us . 
  i guarantee that they 'd even have the gall to say how we 're the ones fucking up because the trained and educated work force they took on is working out splendidly . 
  we get skilled labor that fills holes in our economies and the refugees get to know they 're going to a country that expressly wanted them , rather than getting dumped on to an unwilling host and germany get 's it 's quotas . 
  it 's a win for everyone ... as long as everyone is being hones about their intentions . 
  stupid , no . 
  call me conspiratorial , but what i see here is a two step plan . 
  1 ) invite as many people in to germany under the guise of providing humanitarian aid 2 ) select the qualified workers , the quality human resources , the young and educated among them and distribute everyone else to other countries i 'm not saying everyone is in a grand conspiracy . 
  i am saying that it seems fishy they would be pushing so hard for quotas when it 's clear the people coming to germany will not want to go somewhere else and also saying nothing about how people will be selected for redistribution . 
  i know there are some idealistic morons who do n't understand that sending a refugee to eastern europe is about as generous as sending them to turkey , but i ca n't believe most of them do n't . 
  they see opportunity and a way to turn this in to an advantage . 
  what 's worse . 
  after the redistribution is over the 'll get to show how well the people they hand picked are doing and that failure to integrate , poverty and all the other problems surrounding the people they 'll dump on us are obviously out fault . 
  values like forcing people out of their chosen country and in to certain poverty in eastern europe . 
  yeah , that seems noble . 
  this is true , but even if it were n't it should n't matter . 
  why should we care about other countries taking in our immigrants . 
  we want people to stay . 
  we did n't go anywhere . 
  do the syrians who stayed in syria owe us anything ? 
  they are n't being offered safety and can make a good chase why the mess is our fault . 
  helping people in immediate danger , fine . 
  taking in the families of soldiers fighting isis , widowed women and orphaned children ? 
  of course , but for everyone else there needs to be a local solution . 
  we need to work with turkey and help with the camps there . 
  we need to work with assad and carve out a safe zone in syria . 
  a large area we can secure with our militaries . 
  everyone not from a warzone get 's kicked out . 
  everyone who commits a violent crime get 's kicked out or sentenced to jail depending on severity . 
  make it clear that europe is offering humanitarian aid only . 
  we 're not america 2.0 . 
  we are not the land of second chances , we are not the land of opportunity so opportunists best stay away . 
  this last part is n't a proposal . 
  it 's cold hard fact . 
  europe has no need for 99 % of them . 
  people who were poor at home will be poor here . 
  people who were middle class at home will likely be poor here . 
  these are n't tribes people living in huts . 
  they already had basic western standards of living . 
  they are n't impressed by electricity , running water and standard household appliances . 
  those not running for their lives want a middle or upper middle class life , and that 's just not on offer . 
  try to see it this way . 
  europe can only help so many people . 
  there will be a selection criteria and `` has committed no crimes '' has to be on top of the list . 
  the reason zero tolerance does n't work in the us is that it was ether set up to prevent litigation ( no anything marginally similar to a weapon in school and all participants in a fight get equal punishment ) or were deliberately made to fill prisons ( in which chase they are working as intended ) here , when people want zero tolerance it 's in reference to the european human rights charter that forbids the deportation of people to anywhere dangerous even if they 're dangerous criminals who committed serious crimes in their host country . 
  it 's zero tolerance applied after a fair trial . 
  yes , it might be abused if charges get trumped up , but the current system makes it impossible to deport a rapist , terrorist or murderer . 
  seeing as there are ten of thousands of people who committed no crime in desperate need of help , kicking out anyone even slightly violent would not be a big loss . 
  people are going to be put under a lot of stress . 
  they think everything will be great if only they get to germany , and it just wo n't . 
  many are going to be as poor or poorer than they were at home . 
  the jobs they 'll get will be hard and will pay little . 
  their accommodations will basically be tents and cots for a good long time . 
  germany is colder in winter than anything they had back home and anyone over the age of 15 is going to have one hell of a time fitting in . 
  if violent people stay , there will be riots , fights with the locals and the police and a general worsening of the situation for everyone . 
  fewer people means less pressure on the system and keeping people with a cool head means there 's a chance things get to stabilize and eventually normalize . 
  a ) the people who left may have a moral responsibility , but why on earth would we have any obligation to pay forward for the people who left for greener pastures ? 
  b ) france and england may be the most responsible , but they are n't the ones affected and germany is doing it 's best to redistribute the problem on the balkans ... also known as the former private colonial holdings of the emperors of the hre . 
  if you want to help , by all means , send people to register them , send ships , buses and train to pick them up , do something instead of asking us to slow them down while/if you get ready . 
  no , they actually very correctly think that austria will kick out everyone who 's not a syrian and kick out the syrians when the war ends . 
  they 're not looking for short term help , they want a new life and the word around town is , that 's what germany is offering . 
  the ones who want free stuff go to sweden . 
  the ones who think there 's a job waiting for them go to germany . 
  as opposed to the piles of international laws that only came in to existence after ww2 . 
  also , as does every head of state of every nation ever . 
  if the un made the rules and we did n't have the security council you can be sure the laws that would get passed would look a lot closer to what hitler did than what we make our selves . 
  the un is an institution that gives actually genocidal dictators a say . 
  actual f-ing dictators that exterminated people , would get a say in how our nations are run . 
  we take in everyone we can and when the camps are at capacity we move the overflow forward . 
  my understanding is you guys do mostly the same and so does hungary . 
  if it were official , this would be a decent system . 
  the people who get registered ether get to travel directly to their country of choice or get deported if they do n't meet the criteria ( e.g. 
  are economic migrants from kosovo ) and the rest are moved one country up where they 're taken in to camps until those are at capacity ... and finally germany hopefully get 's it 's shit together . 
  seriously , they asked us for more time . 
  how on earth do they imagine croatia being able to pull off anything of the sort . 
  our top end is 1500 people a day and that 's after tripling it since the crisis became big . 
  we would have to quadruple the current amount , that 's already on the edge of doability to make this work and even then , all we could do is ... ship them off . 
  you ca n't stop this number of people without shooting them . 
  you ca n't keep them from moving on without shooting them . 
  stop train and buss travel and they clog up the roads , try and put them in camps and see them overflow in a day . 
  these ingrates should be kissing our feet for so much as lifting a finger to help clean up their mess . 
  we did n't invite anyone and no one came here because of us and yet somehow this is now our problem . 
  that 's not even half of it . 
  the cities are n't empty because there 's no one to fill them . 
  there are hundreds of millions of people in china for whom those would be huge upgrades . 
  they are n't getting filled because they set the cost above the buying range of anyone remotely interested . 
  they do this because they can then take an empty apartment building and claim it 's worth 100 million usd when they could realistically only sell off the apartments for 25-35 million . 
  it 's hollywood style accounting that creates the illusion of regional gdp growth that the regions have to maintain by mandate from beijing . 
  not only would housing refugees defeat the purpose of this cities , but the chinese citizens living in poor conditions would probably be less than happy that some random outsiders got a better deal than them . 
  china can afford to piss off the urbanites because if things ever get too bad , they can use the rural population to beat them down with the promise of new spits opening up in the cities .

  i think writing stuff like bi-bi-si ( bbc ) , si-en-en ( cnn ) and \u0110asjing-\u0160aosjing ( jiaxing-shaoxing ) is retarded . 
  because i think it makes more sense to write things as they are pronounced . 
  i do n't think it 's retarded . 
  i think it only seems retarded because we have learned to write milwaukee while hearing milvoki or schweinsteiger while hearing \u0160vajn\u0161tajgr , or because our news mostly comes from english sources ( news portals and news shows will just translate ( mostly ) articles in english or use them as a source whenever discussing events around the globe ) . 
   it makes finding foreign , and especially chinese , places on the internet really hard . 
  it makes it hard to find because it 's not being used .

  some ww2 bombs pop up here and there , usually during construction in cities which were heavily bombed . 
   here 's a yugoslavian stamp with the name . 
  the map on the stamp shows the kingdom of yugoslavia 's administrative division between 1939 and 1941 . 
  the stamp probably commemorates the cvetkovi\u0107-ma\u010dek agreement and establishment of banovina of croatia in 1939 . 
  [  from 1929 , the kingdom was subdivided into nine new provinces called banovinas or banates . 
  their borders were intentionally drawn so that they would not correspond either to boundaries between ethnic groups , or to pre-world war i imperial borders . 
  they were named after various geographic features , mostly rivers .

  similar to what ? 
  i thought your question was in general . 
  if you mean which language is easiest to learn compared to those you stated you already know , then i think your best bets are dutch and swedish or estonian , finnish and turkish . 
  croatian has the easiest grammar , the easiest vocabulary . 
  i 've seen babies who could n't speak a word pick it up . 
  croatian is the easiest to learn , most useful are english or spanish .

   i come from a country where most guys ( esp . 
  the younger ones ) shave their pits . 
  what country would that be ? 
   i hope i do n't offend someone here , but why exactly did n't bosnia and croatia join up after the war then ? 
  are they simply too different after the ottoman influence ? 
  if i remember correctly , the dayton accord provided an option for croatia and bih to establish a confederacy but it never got to that .

  makaze and \u0160kare really make no sense . 
  thats because they 're borrowed words from other languages . 
  menwhile no\u017eice make perfect sense it 's it 's sort of a `` mini knife '' or `` many knives '', 
  to je ono kada se pravi \u010cobanac . 
  but this is a perfect example . 
  he wrote something in english and you had no idea and it was simply a c instead of \u010c, 
  i speak both czech and croatian and i would say that figure is n't even 50 % try watching slovenian tv and you 'll see that you do n't understand nearly as much as you think you do . 
  simply because the vocabulary is different . 
  some words have no meanings or similarities to our own . 
  others have totally different meanings and make no sense and are rather really confusing . 
  so here is literally something from a can of monster energy on my table . 
  and its actually quite confusing . 
  you 're going to be in a moment fast somewhere alone ? 
  what ... it actually means it 's going to make you fast in a moment or ubraz \u0107e vas u trenutku . 
  now when you see the translation it 's `` ahh makes sense '' no , no it does n't and it wo n't if a slovene tells you this in real life you 're gon na look at him weirdly ... the fuck did he just say going somewhere fast alone ? 
  i think people are way off on these figures and we do n't nearly understand as much has we 'd like to think . 
  for example here my case . 
  i speak both czech and croatian . 
  let 's take this one . 
  polish . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upbgfwzvquk witam was - that i understand as `` i welcome you '' jestesmy w otoczeniu , kurwa , zamkowym - we are in `` something '' , bitch , castle . 
  something could mean many things but it sounds like okolini in croatian that means like surrounding now i would n't understand it written here but i got it once he said it ... widizimy tutaj dwoje ksiazat - we see here two `` something '' if i had to guess i 'd say two crosses but it turns out it 's princes . 
  i 'm walking up to one from `` soemthing '' and i ask good day , how is the mister/gentelman feeling ? 
  - this i would n't understand if he said it out loud . 
  but since i can read i can see good day , i 'm feeling great `` wspaniale '' - now i know it 's great but i have no idea how i do ... some sort of mix of czech vyborny and skv\u011ble . 
  then later in the video it says mowie cos , mowie cos - i 'd never guess from writing that hes actually saying basically czech `` mluvim neco '' and that means i 'm saying something . 
  polish generally is for me really hard . 
  i can understand the intention of what they 're saying but i have no idea what they 're actually saying . 
  i would say i understand barely 50 % of polish . 
  let 's czech our ruski . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zei0a7gkpu8 now here i have no subtitles so i ca n't actually confirm what is being said maybe some russian anon can check if i 'm right . 
  hes like i greet you , we 're going to be doing origami with our hands today . 
  `` something '' i 'm guessing table ? 
  najabumaga - no fucking idea what this is noznjice - scissors but again if someone said this to me without showing a snaping motion i 'd never guess it 's scissors because to me this literally sounds like `` small legs '' since thats `` no\u017eice '' in croatian and yet it 's n\u016f\u017eky in czech so i 'd eventually make the connection but if i only knew croatian it would take some time to guess it 's noz - knife and then adding something make is scissors . 
  then he says something that i ca n't make out yet it sounds like `` nu princ pir bajehole '' * note i 'm using slavic latin here not english or it would be `` bayehole '' again no idea what he said . 
  ah blyet i can guess because dota . 
  vstrojem djecki praznik i 'm gon na guess it 's we 're making childrens holiday/party . 
  zajebisi origami palpshice thats how it sounds . 
  no idea it 's maybe `` fucking origami into paper '' thats how it sounds . 
  vostrojem \u0160kolski praznik - we 're doing or more specifically we 're assembling childrens holiday/party nu \u010co kak ? 
  - so how is it ? 
  blaza mi krasna to blyet zapalit - my face is nice but damn it burns . 
  here see . 
  nie suka shit pita - no bitch shit gay man so yeah i woud n't say i get even 50 % of russian . 
  i can sort of get very basic stuff but here the vocabulary is simply too different . 
  with polish i at least have czech to fall back to to compare . 
  russian just has too many different words that i never heard and i ca n't make sense of . 
  i am positive that our country would simply cease to exist 20 days after publishment of this type of data . 
  i mean that cola is probably the same as our cheap shit . 
  ours costs 0.5 $ but fuck how do they make it so disgusting . 
  i can never drink the lowest brand of sodas . 
  they 're just not drinkable . 
  yeah but there no tensions really . 
  russia is currently in the conflict to test out new weapons and secure the/a mediterranean harbor . 
  it 's also a weapons selling campaign something it really needs . 
  us is there to spread it 's sphere of influence and because all of it 's big allies do n't want assad so saudis and turkey . 
  technically the us could n't give 2 shits about syria . 
  and in reality they do n't if they did they 'd be boots on the ground afghanistan or iraq style . 
  nothing , just like theres nothing wrong with the newspapers , the problem is people that use these mediums are old and well old . 
  if you asked my grandmother if syria could lead to ww3 she would say sure . 
  then again she 'd say that for every single conflict on earth . 
  and here i was thinking there would be no more wars in the balkans and these guys basically planned to go in and execute people . 
  the balkans ...

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw1qltdrr5u by our powers combined we are hapsburg !, 
  no but i do consider german , czech and english to be separate yes . 
  i would n't say smart . 
  i 'd say i speak 4 languages . 
  and since i learned most of them at a young age it was easy . 
  after 15 i tried learning french it was hell . 
  and now i 'm struggling with japanese for years . 
  aww jee wizz what am i going to do now ... 
  i speak 3 languages learning a 4th . 
  and i do n't mean i can sort of speak em i speak em fluently . 
  meanwhile these red guys are struggling with basic english . 
  because they never get to hear it . 
   croatia i 'm surprised as you i never even heard of it . 
  but we do make that sarma a whole lot more . 
  same here i never heard of it ... 
  pbs i 'm sold . 
  watching now . 
  diocletian not tesla hmm ... 
  so nothing changed ? 
  you 're sleeping in an airplane . 
  is a few hours more not worth 100 or 200 $ saved ? 
  plus dohas airports is stunning . 
  trip is 365 $ ( return trip ) via qatar or was in october . 
  airbnb house for 6 people was like 120 $ for 1 week . 
  kyoto house was like 80 $ for 3 days and then tokyo house was 80 $ for 3 days . 
  7 days railpass was 250 $ . 
  so thats about 900 $ . 
  and then you spend how much you want there on food . 
  and since japan is piss cheap and if you eat mostly kombini food or stuff like yoshinoya , matsuya , sukiya , coco curry and local ramen/soba/tempura restaurans a meal rarely costs about 600 yen or 5.3 $ you really have to order like big portions with tons of vegetables ... edit : i just went to qatar i could fly next week for 465 $ not that much more ... you just have to watch the prices on airline tickets ... 
  see the fact that it 's not huge yet it 's literally a senior developers or doctors salary here is why you got top spots . 
  shit i went to japan for 2 weeks and the whole trip cost me only 1000 $ germans could afford to go every year . 
  me every like 5 or so ... 
  probably because say people who do n't speak german go to work in some shabby german construction company as gastarbeiters and literally earn as much as croatian doctors or college educated people in general ... 
  so being 18 straight out of high school if you went to a non gymnasium one i 'm going to say that you 're gon na easily earn 1500 $ ~ 2000 $ a month doing say carpenters work or something similar . 
  let 's not forget the youth unemplyment in croatia is like 60 % and german statistics are more like 10 or 5 or something, 
  wow big company ca n't buy politics with cash oh no !,

  because , to my knowledge , most learn the language and most accept the american identity . 
  the us is very good at assimilation in my opinion . 
  alright . 
  a croatian in germany should learn to speak german . 
  good points , but i believe my statement still stands at least to some extent . 
   american cities are extremely segregated and have sky-high homicide rates not because of migrants . 
   and those murders are mostly committed by blacks and latinos . 
  they have serious gang problems . 
  they are mostly committed by blacks who are american and most gangs are blacks , who are american . 
   immigrants in europe are never seen as european . 
  because nobody told them they should become one . 
  in america , there is this worldview of america being the best and america being awesome , nothing like that in w. europe . 
   that statement has been false for a long time . 
  the majority of us hispanics are assimilated in no time and they are the largest migrant group for the past few decades . 
  anyone who comes in the us is basically immediately american , ca n't remember the last time i saw a `` i got my citizenship yay :d '' post online about some european country . 
   the us filters better for immigrants than the eu then the eu should also filter better . 
   so reports about heroic german soldiers fighting on the eastern front in ww2 would not be war propaganda either ? 
  these are ukrainians dying in ukraine though . 
  the very fact this is needed shows how utterly pathetic european countries are at assimilating newcomers . 
  that is what you get for going to far into the left .

  dude , you are just like all the tourists coming to croatia and telling us how we are living in a paradise , only to be visibly shocked when they learn we work for 2-3 dollars an hour while living a stone throw away from western europe and just slightly lower living expenses . 
  your experience is utterly skewed by what you are , dear wealthy american citizen and i am indeed entirely right .

  they were horselords before it was cool . 
  insane how many people you had last time . 
   when they moved to the balkans they where turkic tribes , not slavic . 
  genetic research found basically no trace of turkic in bulgars , they were not turks when they came to bulgaria , they probably were not even turkic when they were in ukraine either . 
  how about fucking border enforcement ? 
  you know , that thing , called `` the rule of law '' ? 
  i read about it somewhere in a book about how countries function . 
  well , they look light brown to me . 
  her eye color is brown . 
  that is a misleading issue that comes from studies analyzing depigmentation genes . 
  it is argued that pale people came around 9-7 000 years ago . 
  however , the woman in the image is not pale . 
  again , that is tied to the study about the genes slc24a5 and slc45a2 that lead to depigmentation and pale skin , meaning whitey white . 
  that does not mean that homo sapiens remained dark skinned for over 30 000 years living in europe , including the great glaciation ffs , they became lighter and had lighter skin , just not the pale faces of the northern half of europe today . 
   did you notice they did not even cover the genes related to skin and hair colour ? 
  or actually read it ? 
  you do realize that i was merely answering your statements in the above reply ? 
  i was not tying neanderthals to homo sapiens having blondes and redheads already in the early upper paleolithic . 
  the fact remains that your links speak of pale skin and depigmentation , not people merely having lighter skin . 
   we do n't know enough about neanderthal genes to say that they had light skin . 
  we do actually . 
  they even had gingers . 
   neanderthal having been light skinned ( and possibly redheaded ) also does not tell us anything about early european populations homo sapiens and neanderthals inbreeding is a proven fact . 
   as those genes are not among those found in current populations . 
  yes , yes they are ; https://phys.org/news/2016-02-neanderthal-dna-subtle-significant-impact.html, 
  i believe you have issues with data discerning pale skin and blue/green eyes with just people having lighter skin . 
  the team that did the reconstruction are experts and humans have been living in europe for tens of thousands of years by that point , even passing through a major glaciation . 
  there is also the issue of ignoring interbreeding with neanderthals , who had pale skin and light hair/eyes before homo sapiens even reached france . 
  again with this meme . 
  dude , those links speak of pale skin through depigmentation genes . 
  pale is not the same as just lighter skin , and the woman in the image is not pale . 
  not to mention that even those studies are contested and there still is no consensus . 
  also , even neanderthals had light skin and hair [ 40 000 years ago . 
  ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/601/60159.jpg ) the team that did the reconstruction of the woman is deemed as one of the most skilled in their field on earth at the moment , so i doubt they messed up .

  the reason these serbs relocated is because a military conflict was on-going , and combined with the fearmongering from your side `` usta\u0161e will kill us '' and so on , these people fled .

  currently ? 
  we used to be a force to be reckoned with while autonomous , even making the venetians pay us so they could safely trade in the adriatic , and even helping the serbs with the bulgarians out . 
  under hungarian rule we too accomplished great things , like for example protecting alongside hungary europe from the ottomans for cca 400 years and being the first county named antemurale christianitatis . 
  not to forget nikola tesla was raised and ** schooled ** too in our country ( yes he was of serb descent it 's shared history ) .

  yes the are , because the long term effects of what they did affected far more people in much worse ways . 
  not if those citizens did not leave the russia or the us . 
  these murdered people were mainly fascists or thieves that left yugoslavia as to not be prosecuted . 
  first of all stop taking a moral highground by indicating fallacies . 
  you are talking about a subject that you have bo idea about . 
  many people still have nostalgic feelings about tito and yugoslavia even in croatia . 
  you know what ? 
  yes it 's ok they slaughtered those people . 
  the only sad thing is that they did n't slaughter milo\u0161evi\u0107 , tu\u0111man and all the other fuckwits that screwed everything up too .

  also what massacres are you talking about ? 
  the west did n't massacre us haha , yes ww2 did cause genocide but that did not contribute to the hatred as much as the earlier preset factors . 
  they divided us by religion , spheres of influence and other ways during the years , put us up against eachother and basically caused all of this hatred . 
  on the topic of yugoslavia , you have to differentiate what the jna was ( at the time of the war ) - not a yugoslav army , but a serbian army , that was led by one of the fuckwits i mentioned earlier and many more i did n't mention .

  that 's just the way that things are done in the east , as far as i can tell . 
  i hear that its the way that things are developing btw the ukranians and the russians right now as well . 
  look , you obviously think we started the chain of persecution against the roma , which in turn causes them to breed contempt and turn to crime so i 'm not really gon na go into detail here , if you 'd like i could give you a short history lesson and the reasoning behind it if your interested .

  okay :  it was only mid 19th century when `` national wakening '' happened that the slavic language was accepted as universal so , no , slavic language was already universal before that .

  [ \u017deljko kerum ] ( http://cdn-static.rtl-hrvatska.hr/repository/images/e/0/e062205803e1eb11c41347ce3fea50a6.jpg?v=20 ) - former mayor of split [ kolinda grabar kitarovi\u0107 ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/kolinda_press_21092016.jpg ) - the president . 
  i do n't have anything against her dressing like this , everyone has a right to dress as they like , but i have the right to notice that she very often dresses like a starlet . 
  diminutive of * \u0161os * , which means skirt, 
  no , translated to croatian that 's '' central croatia '', 
  watching at other people 's car at the stop light or as you overtake them , owning a bmw x6 , '' reserving '' a beach spot with a towel , not allowing your dog on the sofa, 
  like question , like answer . 
  afaik * kaj * , * \u010da * and * \u0161to * and all of their alternatives are all slavic . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , only in slovenia and croatia we use * kaj * . 
  i know most languages have loanwords , just wanted to point out that it does n't mean kajkavian and chakavian are any more purer slavic than shtokavian because they do n't have turkish loanwords . 
  if anything , [ thanks to this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_linguistic_purism ) , they probably are n't . 
  btw , i 'm from the kajkavian area and i fully agree with everything else he said .

  haha , that 's an odd choice of words . 
  i 'll translate it in case anyone is interested in what they mean . 
  no , not really . 
  * rt * - it means * cape *, 
  it 's still blue . 
  well it 's still happening, 
  maybe he 's a porn star . 
  aww, 
  hercegovci do n't care huh ? 
  you should visit bosnia, 
  i 'm croatian and ca n't pronounce * r * properly . 
  i pronounce it like you guys i think . 
  exactly !, 
  fuck the croats !, 
  yeah ok but it still took you more than three weeks , i would 've done it in three days, 
  well that was quick edit : wtf there 's nobody from kazakhstan on this sub ? 
  never believe a serb . 
  wtf does socialism have with this ? 
  bbb ai n't no joke buraz, 
  lol slovenia has regions, 
  stalin did it intentionally . 
  our national football federation president 's greediness is the reason we 're not in fifa , we did qualify . 
  dude wtf, 
  hey fuck you ok ? 
  i 'm not sure but i think it 's croatia . 
  have you ever been in syria ? 
  i think this thread wo n't take off, 
  yea fuck the uk it should all be about croatia, 
  how close are you to him ? 
  oh come on , just because you do n't agree with him does n't mean he 's a troll . 
  good luck serbia !, 
  we have the same thing in croatian , you are not that special :p, 
  yeah but many european languages have 2 words for the same thing , not only english . 
  ca n't argue with that !, 
  hey man do n't be jealous, 
  i found a girlfriend . 
  lol no kosovo stronk independent country who dont need no serbia, 
  but they were not autonomous regions in yugoslavia . 
  needs more colours , he should add kosovo and vojvodina . 
  / r/windowshots might also help you , 
  if you surrendered , you should n't be killed . 
  regardless of if you were fascist or not . 
  yeah ok , all people killed by him were war criminals , right ? 
   it should be illegal in every western democracy . 
  why ? 
  why not both ? 
  but you can kill thousands of innocent people . 
  we are at something like 53 % , right ? 
  . . in what way was he a hero ? 
   at least it apparently recognizes some kind of limited partnership . 
  nope , not yet . 
  croatia did that last month . 
  english is much more important than german or french . 
  me too , it was qbasic . 
  he has obviously never watched cobra 11 . 
  well ... it 's not really doing well , we are on top of the table ( for the 8th season in a row ) but it 's very complicated situation regarding dinamo here ... our league sucks , the chairman is the biggest asshole in croatia ( ** everybody ** hates him ) , national football federation is corruped ... the only good thing in croatian football is our national team . 
  i was joking too < 3, 
  omg racism !, 
   i think it 's fairer to say that you need n't downvote that which you do n't agree with i agree , but since this post is a question i think it 's fair to upvote comments that answer the question , no matter what they say . 
  of course , you * do n't have * to do that , but i do n't think all of those who upvoted comments that are kinda eurosceptic agree with them . 
   i do n't get why this is being upvoted so much . 
  because you should n't only upvote things you agree with , that 's stupid . 
  i would . 
  or swedes . 
  vienna definitely !, 
  immigrants are ok . 
  within the schengen area * there are still border checks between slovenia and croatia , for example , and they are both in the eu . 
  i want to visit all three countries you mentioned . 
  black tomislav is probably my favourite croatian beer , although it 's not very popular . 
  i was pretty surprised to see it here honestly . 
  fuck them too . 
  ( happy new year ! ), 
  who said this was eu ? 
   we know that god does n't live in the sky and that it 's impossible for him to live there . 
  if you knew anything about christianity , you would know that christians do n't believe that god literally lives in the sky , sky is just a synonym for heaven . 
   i can see you have no other arguments to add , so i 'll call it a night . 
   would n't you consider delusional somebody that believes , * actually * believes , that there are unicorns and dinosaurs on jupiter ? 
  yes , i would , because we know that they do n't live there and that it 's impossible for them to live there , whilist we do n't know if god exist . 
  you ca n't seriously think that believing in god is the same as believing in space unicorns . 
   not beliving in god is logical . 
  i think believing in some kind of higher force is logical . 
  if you want to call it god , so be it , i do n't think that 's illogical . 
  and it does n't make you stupid . 
   there 's a study that showed that atheist people are generally more emphatic , they donate more blood , they 're willing to help people more . 
  if there was a study that showed that french are generally more emphatic , they donate more blood , they 're willing to help people more than germans , would you think less of germans ? 
   a person can have actual faith only in 2 cases . 
   a ) he 's stupid . 
  b ) he 's delusional . 
  i do n't really want to talk about god and his existance , but i think that person does n't have to be stupid or delusional to believe in some kind of higher force . 
  nobody knows for sure if god exists , including you . 
  do you think that believing in god is more delusional that not believing in him ? 
  i do n't think any of those options are delusional . 
  if you 're a christian , that 's does n't make you delusional and it certainly does n't make you stupid . 
   what i require for respect is my business completely , and while in some cases , if the person shows other great qualities , i might respect them , i do n't like dumb people i agree with you here , respect is a very subjective thing . 
  i do n't lose respect for people based on their religious beliefs , like you , because i think that 's a bad thing . 
  we should n't judge people based on just one thing , like their race , sexuallity or ** religion ** . 
   tolerance is a good thing - let 's tolerate terrorism then . 
  oh wait , it 's not always a good thing , now is it . 
  of course it 's not always a good thing , but when it comes to religion , i think it is . 
  religion is not equal to terrorism .

that seems to be the most obvious solution . 
  this whole situation is a huge cluster fuck with no visible end to it all . 
  something has to be done about it , if it means fencing of entire europe so be it . 
  as long as refugees are safe and can apply for asylum in asylum centers there should be no problem . 
  europe should fund camps instead of taking waves of refugees , providing people with supplies and education seems way more rational than letting them all in , but that 's just my 2 cents . 
  well about that : http://www.24sata.hr/svijet/bih-ako-ue-vise-od-5000-izbjeglica-zatvaramo-granicu-437987 basically bosnian minister of defense said they 'll close of the border if more than 5k immigrants enter the country . 
  how will they do it , or will they be able to do it i do n't know , but there 's that, 
  somebody already mentioned it but there are bears , mines and well . . just the clusterfuck that bosnia is , also a very long part of our border with bosnia consists of river sava and mountains . 
  translation : same option is mentioned in serbia as well . 
  according to news paper `` vecernje novosti '' , which are in close relationship with government of aleksandar vucic , problem will continue if croatia moves on to the next option , the so called `` plan d '' , which would imply raising a wall facing serbia, 
  if you 're a native or a foreigner with enough money then sure , you could lead a life like that , but as a refugee i do n't think you have a chance to move out of camps, 
  except there wo n't be 100k , once word starts spreading that slovenia and hungary closed its border they 'll turn to alternative routes . 
  the ones already here have 4 weeks to apply for asylum or they 're btfoing out . 
  i see this whole crisis as a great marketing , more people hear of croatia --  more people google croatia --  more people see our coastline --  more monies . 
  haha serb talking , get lost, 
  something something never forget 700k something something croats biggest monsters world has ever met, 
  yes, 
  would n't adding the - uh ( prijatelju ? ), 
  transform the word in dative/locative/vocative case ? 
  the nominative case does n't have the suffix - uh at the end, 
  `` pree - german ja - te ( like in tennis ) - ll ( english `` million '' but soft ) '', 
  bravo estonia, 
  realized it few minutes later after i posted the comment , felt stupid but would feel even more stupid deleting or editing the comment . 
  it 's hard to tell sarcasm on the internet sometimes  . , 
  definitely slovenia . 
  it 's comfy , i like mountains and colder weather , it neighbors my homeland , the language is similar , developed and safe nation ( one of the safest in the world ) with beautiful scenery and cities . 
  alternatively finland for memes , language , more cold , m\u00e4mmi and kiira, 
  modern day macedonians are slavs , not greeks . 
  1667 best day of my life, 
  that 's true , we 're all neo-nazis here , or should i say the * true * nazis , the heirs of ndh . 
  the hate towards jews and serbs is encouraged by our church and politicians , after all our prime minister is a declared ustasha . 
  and to top it all off 99 % of croats are in fact huge thompson fans ( the rest one 1 % are the goddamn serbs ) , i myself have his name tattooed on my left arm and i regularly visit neo-nazi meetings where i get drunk , sing cavoglave and shout `` ubi srbina '', 
  new diablo3 season , i guess, 
  b a s e d, 
  also massive panic caused by possible immigrant swarms, 
  `` r '' acts as a vowel in serbo-croatian , for example : vrt , tvrd , kr\u010dma , cvr\u010dak . 
  that makes it a bit easier to pronounce the words and also makes the language softer , we do n't really hate vowels :p, 
  most based language in the world, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.njuskalo.hr/nekretnine/kuca-pitomaca-visoka-prizemnica-310-m2-oglas-15435171 ) was the most expensive thing i could fine , tho it is outside the main city and is located near ( or rather in ) the satellite city, 
  all i hear is : `` davaj blyed '', 
  few hundred people were shouting , are you trying to label the entire nation ? 
  why, 
  croatian , fluent english ( vidya james , cartoons , movies , dank memes etc. 
  ) , a bit of german ( currently learning it in school ) and also trying to self tutor myself korean, 
  why ? 
  there is no military and economical force in the world strong enough to face nato , seems to me like scaremongering to buy american equipment, 
  are u feeling ok, 
  not in mainland europe , anyways . 
  brits are usually butthurt if you call them europeans , they do n't like to be associated with us mainlanders, 
   pica haha, 
  rusija do tokija, 
  bakeries, 
  what the fuck moldava, 
  except macedonian is much closer to bulgarian than serbian , the fuck are you on , have you ever heard spoken macedonian , or even read it ? 
  saruman gathers his army in isengard, 
  why not just annex eu ? 
  rule britannia !, 
  you 're retarded, 
  comon now , no need to be tsundere, 
  i know our countries do n't have any special ties and you 're the popular kid in the school , but i love you czechia . 
  prague absolutely blew me away , and your language is very melodic ( i guess that happens when you turn everything into a diminutive ) albeit hard as fuck . . everyone i met in prague was very kind and helpful , and the word i used the most was well : `` djekuji '' . 
  thank you for showing the rest of europe that a slavic country can prosper as well !, 
  p.s : flip-flops are not adequate mountain hiking equipment, 
  reminds me of a video where a guy talks about how slovenia and croatia are still under tyranny of tito , it just shows how uninformed and blinded by lies these people are , they see europe as germany , nordics and poverty stricken wastelands in-between them, 
  i 'm sure the number of immigrants who would free willingly stay in v4/bug/rum / cro/slo/baltics is rather small , you have nothing to fear for . . 
  the title makes it sound as if rapists are croatian ... ... ... 
  zzzzzz balkans gon na balkan who the fuck even cares what he says , why is this getting any attention ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsz49mzcvg0 spoiler : it 's not the coastline : ddddd, 
   but no one in sweden would really care all that much half of nation cries over a drowned refugee , but they would n't care about millions of people getting nuked ? 
  yeah while i was on a school trip to prague 2 years ago getting weed was super easy , i guess other stuff would be quite easy to get as well, 
  what reasons ? 
  butthurt ? 
  we have been seeing huge growth in industry sector as well as increase in gdp in the last 3q , how 's serbia , who by the way has a much smaller base , doing ? 
  pls anschluss , i for once would welcome our overlords as long as you do n't sell our coastline to pay your debts again , 
  whenever i see american poster on either reddit or / int / i just assume he 's going to say some stupid fucking shit and i 'm right 90 % of the time, 
   honestly , eastern europe is as big a problem for europe as the mass islamic immigration is t. pakistani, 
  so you 're proposing turning a whole country into a huge immigration camp ? 
  how about we turn budapest into immigration camp , does that work for you ? 
  [ dubrovnik ] ( http://makstravel.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/slider-dubrovnik-2_1600x828.jpg ) , [ rovinj ] ( http://makstravel.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/croatia-istra-rovinj-old-town-aerial.jpg ) , [ vara\u017edin ] ( http://blog.uniline.hr/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/varazdin-panorama.jpg ), 
  how exactly ? 
  edit : i 'm an idiot , i thought you were talking about kosovo which does n't look that bad in terms of demographics, 
  wheres spurdo, 
  nice mods, 
  i do think eastern europe has a chance , just look at czechia , but that chance seems so slight , and with every passing year it 's as if it is fading further and further away due to brain drain . 
  some regions are just doomed , like balkans , but v4 and baltics have a real chance of catching up to west in few generations . 
  i do hope one day ee becomes as prosperous as west and people wo n't have to escape their countries to clean toilets , but for now as much as it saddens me economic emigration is a day to day reality , i know a lot of people who left my town , and i myself will move shortly . 
  to keep it short some words are similiar , by connecting those words into a sentance or adding words from your language you can come up with something comprehensive . 
  sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't , for me personally i can understand very little polish , but can understand a lot of slovakian and slovenian, 
  that 's easy , just deny them citizen rights such as health care and welfare , although i suspect crime rates would skyrocket as it would be their only source of income, 
  as yung lean would say `` stock town ghost town '' oh wait, 
  besti looks really comfy , definitely a country i 'm planning to visit, 
  cunt : flag favorite : magyar ciganys / slovenia least favorite : bosnians ( especially herzegovnas ), 
  aye , that would be neat !, 
  though croatia already has so many beautiful national parks that are n't on our coastline such as plitvice lakes and kopa\u010dki rit , i 'd leave mountains and winter tourism to our neighbors :d, 
  mostly yeah , however our industry sector is seeing massive recovery , so some of it has to do with that . 
  keep in mind this is in august , when unemployment is usually at its lowest since it 's peak of the tourist season and a lot of people get seasonal jobs , actual unemployment is around 18 ~, 
  someones meme page got postblocked,

  create a new european union . . within eu !, 
   sausage  bacon savages,

  both of our countries are quite conservative when compared to rest of the europe , and it 's hard for people to understand that this is a process that will take time , while currently it 's being forced . 
  yes . 
  look at my creepy face ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you mean no quotas at all or having an option to refuse quotas ? 
  that does n't stop me from liking you . 
  - close schengen borders - support hungary , croatia and serbia in closing their own borders to refugees - send back all the refugees that refuse to register - open refugee camps in syria and libya safe zones - asylum has to be asked from refugee camps in syria - no country shopping , they get moved based on quotas - do n't shit on countries that refuse to take them - better border control on mediterranean sea - sink smuggler boats , save refugees but deport them back to libya/syria to apply for asylum the normal way . 
  - explain to merkel she 's not the supreme ruler of eu . 
  never understood what 's with the hate for the gays . 
  it leaves more free women for us !, 
  eu policy based on ideas of this [ guys ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/cheer_bear.jpg ), 
  yep . 
  but main problem is that there really is no alternative . 
  either you vote for incompetent government or you vote for a government that 's competent in stealing . 
  that 's 2 options currently . 
   as they prepared to get off the train , a drunken skinhead stumbled past with a glare that made 11-year-old raghad huddle closer to her mom . 
  damn germans , being bald and glaring at people . 
   the five members of the habashieh family took a taxi to the asylum center assigned to them by a computer in berlin . 
  it was a former army barracks used by the soviets and by the ** nazis ** before them , surrounded by towering fences topped with barbed wire . 
  not all germans and german soldiers were nazis , but sure , best to remind the readers about germans and ww2 and camps and all . 
  so , you pass through south-eastern part of europe , you get fed and clothed on the way to germany . 
  you have governments organizing transportation so that you get to your destination faster . 
  you just pass through countries , refusing to register , ask for asylum , just so you can get to germany . 
  you get there and you are angry that you ca n't stay in the capital , the moment you get off the train you see german people as threats . 
  you complain how there is only 3 mosques on 14,000 `` foreign people '' in that town . 
  what is required for you to be satisfied with a country that took you in , fed you , clothed you and gave you a place to sleep ? 
  also , probably a club . 
  it 's easier to organize people within a club then individually . 
  yes , he was disapointed how our `` christian '' neighbours treated migrants . 
  first they say they had a deal , now our pm admits there were no deal and that we 'll keep sending refugees to hungary . 
  awesome foreign policy !, 
  you prove time and time again that you are incapable of having a civil discussion . 
  therefore i will stop talking to you . 
  we have 350k unemployed in croatia , they 'd be quite happy to get jobs somewhere . 
  has no idea mostly . 
  `` our '' plan was to send them to slovenia . 
  but , that went wrong since slovenia closed borders and is actively sending them back . 
  there 's been some talk about `` plan b '' , but no one knows what that is . 
  oh , but you should support `` brain drain '' in syria ? 
  since , i do n't know if you understand that not entire syria is at war , also , quite a lot of mentioned countries there are not at war . 
   even you should be able to understand that you 're an arrogant prick , are n't you ? 
  and we send them right back and cause diplomatic incidents . 
  same thing as happened in croatia , that would happen . 
  albanians have it shitty as well ? 
  why no compassion for them ? 
  how can you accept afgans , somalis , iraquis , iranians , palestianians and pakistanians , but hey , albanians and `` people from balkans '' looking for brighter future are not welcome . 
  around 20 % are actual refugees , rest are economic migrants , and quite aggressive at that . 
  they came to croatia , we placed them in a hotel ( hotel porin , check it ) and they were throwing shit over the balcony and protesting because we do n't let them go to slovenia , which closed the borders . 
  they were informed , they know about it but they do n't care about law . 
  they are fighting with each other and police just to enter buses , attacking journalists when they try to record them `` in action '' . 
  they make a mess and we did n't even use any intervention police , because we get called `` inhumane '' by people like you , that love everyone else more but people that they live with . 
  please look at reports from journalists in hungary , serbia and croatia , and tell me how small of a minority is acting aggressively . 
  problem was that there is no way out . 
  while there was a way out for immigrants , he was using big words . 
  the moment slovenia closed borders ( meaning nowhere else to go from croatia ) , shit got real :d, 
  he meant it more in a `` we wo n't be bothered by this now '' , but since he 's an arrogant prick , we 'll he said what he said with eagles and flies . 
  call it as you will , if you need to label people in order how they agree with you , that 's fine to me . 
  here , i 'll even help you . 
  people that agree with you , let 's call them good guys . 
  people that disagree with you , let 's call them bad guys . 
  it 's much more simple then using the big words like `` far right bigots , racists '' and such . 
  just call them `` bad guys '' . 
   you far right bigots  you racists you forgot nazi/fascists as well . 
  please , keep up to the standards , he 's disagreeing with you , you must call him a nazi as well . 
  we have a pm that half of the time does n't even know what he 's saying and rest of the time he 's blaming the opposition . 
  so yeah , stance would be something awesome , but i doubt we 'll see that . 
  i just do n't understand how no one thought that a common solution between those 3 countries would be the best thing . 
  i mean , hungary closes the border with serbia and then we take refugees from serbia and send them to hungary . 
  how can that be a solution ? 
  croatia , serbia and hungary playing a game of hot potato . 
  should 've sat down , talked and presented a solution together . 
  also , current croatian government at it 's finest . 
  first criticising hungarian and serbian treatment of immigrants , saying how `` we are prepared '' while doing close to nothing . 
  croatian prime minister even said on tv : `` those countries call themselves christian and look how they treat those poor people '' , and now when shit goes south , he expects help from hungary or serbia ? 
  slovenia was direct at start , they told us to piss off and that they wo n't take any refugees . 
  and here you have an example of people who did n't integrate through centuries . 
  in zagreb we also have them doing the same thing . 
  in my neighbourhood you have multiple examples of apartments being built and before the state sells the apartments , romas move in and they ca n't kick them out then . 
  they just claim them . 
  for centuries they were romanian problem , now , they are everyone elses problem as well . 
  news, 
  11,000 refugees in croatia , 0 people applied for asylum . 
  best humor is the inappropriate one, 
  do what we should 've done . 
  wait for them on the border with a feast . 
  free pork for everyone !, 
  okrenite odojka !, 
  any information on why did he attack ? 
  btw , nice tackle , hah . 
  during yugoslav wars croatia accepted around 600,000 refugees from bosnia . 
  our country was at war as well . 
  europe and west were very slow to respond to that refugees crisis as well . 
  not to mention that certain european countries did n't accept croatian refugees . 
  also worth mentioning , during the start of the war our country got embargoed by west , since they hoped the war would end quickly and if they sell weapons to croatia , it would just last longer . 
  but , that was war time which i do n't like discussing , since it gives bitter memories to everyone in this area , and i prefer having good relations with our neighbours , since no one would like to repeat that again . 
  we accepted more refugees then what was demanded of us , we 're a small country that 's still in recession , with population of 4,5 million and 350,000 unemployed people . 
  what history exactly should make us sympathetic ? 
  wait when our politicians say `` it 's too much , close the border '' , then the fun starts !, 
  world news focus on croatia , ca n't wait for fascist/nazi accusations . 
  i 'm sure it 's quite illegal to have a boat with 5000 people on board when you ca n't even support 1000 . 
  you have them in most coffee shops/bars .

  not koran . 
   in the same light , most christians wo n't believe that the world is 6000 years old . 
  the bible does not state that the world is that old . 
   and all that jazz ... 
  yes , all that jazz of modern revisionist trying their best to remove the fact that there are direct sentences of his wife 's age . 
   jesus encourages suffering and praises weakness . 
  he encourages self harm and letting people hurt you . 
  so , it is still obvious , as the question was ;  which is more likely to be ** non-aggressive ** and virtuous ? 
   according to luke and matthew , who made the story up . 
   jesus also had brothers and sisters . 
  i love this sort of argument gymnastics . 
  very entertaining . 
   when she was betrothed/married to joseph christianity is not centered around joseph as a prophet though . 
  also , whataboutism . 
   but if she was 12 , that was definitely normal back then normal but not the norm . 
  contrary to popular belief , most marriages at the time were still started between 16-20 year olds . 
  also , an important point is that the marriages were usually between the youth of families , meaning both the boy and the girl would be roughly equally young , while the marriage of mohammed , being a 50 year old marring a 6 year old , was not the norm at all , even in that period . 
   so if you have basically any hero from medieval or pre-medieval times , he will probably count as a `` pedophile '' . 
  ridiculous statement , a swarm of medieval figures did not marry young , some until into their 20s . 
   the contradiction comes from whether she was 12 or 9 with ` authenticity ' more likely going for she was 9 . 
  i thought that the issue was between 6 and 9 , not 9 and 12 ?

  well , then why the hell did they stay there for 400 years ? 
  they perhaps brought what they needed by boat from the continent . 
  true , however , it was during the [ medieval warm period ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medieval_warm_period ) when temperatures were high all over the place , so , you never know . 
  what are the chances of global warming turning it into the next new world ? 
  that is interesting , i did not know that was the case . 
  they all became american though and started identifying themselves as such quite quickly . 
  no , they just replied to me so i reply back . 
  not annoyed , just commenting . 
  i do not live in either regions so not my problem . 
   the children of immigrants first generation is at 35 % . 
   clinton did get 3 million more votes true . 
  a lot of those posts are from people coming from developed countries to the usa . 
  also you are ignoring the multitude of people in europe with a non-european background , and they show very little emotional connection to the political entities they are living in . 
   speaking english is not assimilation . 
  your claim was that they do not learn english . 
   so you know because ... you know ? 
  it does exist . 
   there was never one american identity . 
  wrong . 
   sure , but that does n't mean that millions of former liberals suddenly voted for an idiot except a ton of swing voters that voted for obama voted for trump . 
  for fuck sake , a third of latinos voted for trump lol . 
   because of identity politics . 
  it was the major issue , lefties went apeshit with the transgender bathrooms , pronouns , safe spaces while trumptards demagoged about jobs , security and ` murica . 
  it does not take a genius to figure out which one was the more appealing and active image . 
   how ? 
  the rates of fluent english speaker are 35 % , 91 % and 97 % for first , second and third generation migrants . 
   how would you know ? 
  are you american ? 
  i know , because there absolutely was and is an american identity , it is not an ethnical identity , but it still exists . 
  uneducated gullible nonsense ... whatever you say . 
  the only reason trump won is because hillary was the dem candidate , if bernie was the candidate he would have trumped trump . 
  thank you for the info . 
   governments provide official documents and services in multiple languages . 
  where ? 
  which documents ? 
  are you talking local municipalities or ? 
   no , nobody tells you what language to speak . 
  i mean that literally . 
  well , you were right in your last reply , the weather is fine up there . 
   you can research more if you want . 
  your own link contradicts you . 
   the concept of `` american '' is not one identity . 
  it is . 
  it is the identity tied to the usa as a political entity . 
   there never was and is n't an `` american identity '' . 
  ridiculous statement . 
   the white trash who voted for him do n't care about that . 
  sure thing buddy , all those millions , including swing voters that formerly voted for obama in the past two elections , all racist white trash hahaha . 
   the less education you have , the more likely it is you will support right-wing politicians . 
  more like , the less education you have , the less money you make , the less money you make , the more you are affected by politics and the more pissed off you become so you rather vote for neeto cheeto mussolini instead of the blonde harlot that could not give less of a shit about you if she tried . 
   nobody in the us tell people what language to speak satire surely . 
   if you 've ever visited california you 'll see that many areas accommodate people in multiple languages yeah , because there are literally millions of illegals in the southern border states , i am talking about regular immigration . 
  ... and even then , those illegals are often far better ingrained into the society than a lot of second generation migrants in w. europe . 
   so do public institutions . 
  really , how so ? 
   the weather is fine . 
  ... that is not a good comeback , you just admitted that you are up your own ass . 
   they leave people the hell alone as long as they do their job . 
  in what world are you living in ? 
   europeans apparently being triggered by hearing people talk in a foreign tongue . 
  yeah , that is sure a problem ... tell me , how is the weather there , up your own ass ? 
   most first generation latinos never learn english . 
  do you have data on that ? 
   most live in latino communities and never attain citizenship . 
  source ? 
   most latinos identify by the country they came from rather than american . 
  source ? 
   that does n't even take into account true melting pots like nyc were there are domincan parts of town or somali communities like in michigan . 
  to my knowledge , those cultural areas do not nullify the assimilation of those people into the american identity . 
   i think you 've been informed wrong . 
  perhaps . 
   but it sure does give us crazy people like trump . 
  no , `` gender is a social construct '' and `` 60 gender pronouns '' people gave you trump . 
  in what way do they not assimilate ?

  they can be together in a relationship , and through cohabitation after 3 years be considered a couple that is more or less `` married '' , but they can not achieve a full , legal , marriage . 
  [ see here . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_croatia ) life partnership is really just another [ civil union . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_union ), 
  agreed . 
  no , i think the west would have backed yugo . 
  yugo received a lot of money from the west after cutting ties with the ussr , and the allies supplied the partisans in the last few years of wwii . 
  there was an english officer who met with tito and spoke highly of partisan defense against the germans and italians and recommended back to his superiors that the allies should be supporting the partisans and not the chetniks ( serb royalist movement ) . 
  ok cool , gotcha . 
  thanks for the talk . 
   it makes no sense to me to put them in the eastern bloc if they had nothing to do with it from the first three years which is the point i was trying to make . 
  i 'm assuming that eastern bloc just generally means `` any socialist state in europe . '', 
  does n't germany sort of enable what erdogan is doing ? 
  by saying all these people want asylum , they 're essentially telling him `` hey , there 's x amount of people looking for asylum here , come get them . '', 
  they obviously are n't seeking asylum for no reason . 
  i thought cereal meant stuff like reese 's puffs and froot loops , lol . 
  i thought all cereal was was [ this kind of thing . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2b/froot-loops-box-small.jpg ), 
  the constitution actually banned gay marriage in 2013 , hdz is extremely christian and would not allow that kind of thing . 
  gays can serve in the army however , which is kind of ironic , because they can potentially die in a war on behalf of the country but can not marry who they want . 
  i addressed another user and i think his point is that eastern bloc referred to socialist countries in europe . 
  eastern bloc also usually assumes close ties to/reliance on the ussr . 
  but imo , yugoslavia was not reliant on the ussr due to two things , the first being it was basically the center of the non-aligned movement because it was founded there , and the second being it received money over a long period of time from the us ( and other western countries ) and enjoyed fairly good relations with the west . 
  there were also few travel restrictions to and from yugo , unlike east bloc countries where you were questioned for wanting to leave the country for whatever reason . 
  if the point you 're making is `` east bloc = socialist country in europe '' then ok , i agree . 
  the thing is , eastern bloc countries were more or less dependent on the ussr and yugoslavia was not . 
  i do n't like the term because it makes it look like yugoslavia was tied to the ussr , which it was not , yugoslavia was closer to the west , if anything . 
  too many people seem to think yugoslavia was a kind of pawn of the ussr , yet our people were bold enough to actually stand against them , the second biggest power in the world . 
  yugoslavia was still , however , a buffer against the soviet union , and that 's why i do n't view it as eastern bloc . 
  yugo was a `` satellite '' for 3 years after wwii , which is more or less negligible . 
  [ yugo was pretty much done with the ussr after 1948 . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tito\u2013stalin_split ) the ussr also attempted multiple assassinations against tito after this time , none of which were successful . 
  yugoslavia then went on to be a founder of the [ non-aligned movement , which is still fairly active today ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-aligned_movement ) and it was formally declared in 1961 in beograd . 
  i just do n't see how yugo could have been a satellite when things went sideways so bad . 
  but how does that make it cereal ? 
  slovenia was not eastern bloc either , it was non-aligned as part of yugoslavia . 
  but yes , they 're most likely the first in that general area to allow same-sex marriage . 
  that kind of thing will not gain much traction in , say , croatia or bosnia . 
  why is cereal so popular in bosnia ? 
  slovenia is not eastern europe . 
  fuck , good point . 
  you got me there . 
  i 'm not saying anyone should be thrown in jail , but to let it go seems shitty too . 
  why ? 
  i personally do n't think anyone should be burning anyone 's scriptures . 
  if you hate it so much , just ignore it . 
  going to the length of burning it says a lot about an individual . 
  and thank you , as long as the law applies to people who burn all books , i 'd say it 's fair . 
  i do n't see what makes the danes cowards . 
  can you provide me instances of bible burning going unpunished ? 
  would he get the same treatment if he burned a bible , torah , or other religious text ? 
  i thought i would at least ask a dane . 
  yes , muslims rule over denmark , a country where roughly half of the people have no religion but believe there is some kind of higher power . 
  they run a shadow government from a series of underground mosques located under copenhagen . 
  yeah , sure . 
   no bosnian in the slavic group  ree, 
  it 's so cool how slavic languages share words but are still different lol, 
  yurop mast stay stronk against populist swine . 
  populist swine create false narrative like `` swedistan '' to undermine integrity of yurop union . 
  populist pig can only reee as yurop become more stronk . 
  not sure i follow . 
  and in my opinion , that 's the way it should be . 
  i believe in integrating and i also believe in retaining the native tongue/culture . 
  but there should be a balance , and it should definitely not be pushed onto others . 
  you 're right , iran is not as bad as places like iraq . 
  their women dress in jeans and t-shirts but i think they still wear hijabs . 
  afaik they have a toned down sharia as well . 
  it 's also worth noting how iranian diaspora is . 
  in my area , all the girls were very ... `` open '' and both the men and women drink * a lot . 
  * what i 've also noticed , especially among the younger diaspora , is that they almost have a `` shame '' of their identity . 
  so they drop it , and they act like westerners , some of them even completely drop their native farsi and adopt their new country 's language , whereas some keep both . 
  i do n't agree with every part of his policy . 
  banning entry of people who are legally allowed to come in with green cards or visas or what have you is unreasonable . 
  you may be familiar with the yale student who i believe was from iran ( i think it was iran ) not being able to go back and continue his education . 
  he was visiting family there while the executive order was placed , and was then not able to come back . 
  this is something i 'm * very * against . 
  however , had europe practiced a policy like this , people would not be complaining about the things they are currently complaining about . 
  i firmly believe and understand that there are people who genuinely want to move to other countries from these regions , but at the same time , there are `` plants '' coming from the middle east who are causing trouble in europe . 
  it 's a shitty situation , and so far , no one 's solution has been great . 
  islam is the majority in kosovo , albania , and bosnia . 
  their cultures are all very secular . 
  i ca n't speak on kosovars or albanians , but i know the bosnian diaspora in germany for example is well adapted and respected . 
  generally speaking , we ( bosniaks , and south slavic people ) adapt fully to the cultures of the countries we inhabit . 
  we 're not retarded , we are europeans after all . 
  the problem with muslims from the middle east is that they are not wanting to adapt to the countries they are living in . 
  there is a huge `` disconnect '' if you will . 
  they intentionally do not want to adapt . 
  for example , it 's my understanding that the nordic countries offer courses for foreigners to learn the languages , yet they do not want to learn the languages and somehow insist on speaking arabic . 
  why is this ? 
  they 're very odd people imo . 
  if it were a muslim ban in america , indonesia would have been number 1 on that list . 
  obama also did something similar , targeting specifically iraq , i believe , and no one said shit . 
  his particular ban lasted 6 months . 
  this is also coming from a muslim , even though i am not particularly religious . 
  or maybe it 's just middle eastern people . 
  muslims from south europe do n't cause much of the same trouble that middle easterners cause . 
  wi pipo are a genetic mutation n sheit, 
  ugh , i do n't do n't have a youtube account so it wants me to sign out . 
  can you tell me what the song name is ? 
  chances are , i already know it lol .

  like , ok so trump won , that 'll have effects . 
  meanwhile , in the last 100-or-so years , my country went through monarchy , another monarchy , fascism , communism , and finally democracy + capitalism . 
  and this within austro-hungary , yugoslavia , independence , and finally eu . 
  so i 'm like `` whatever , business as usual , the more things change the more they stay the same '' at many of the shitfs . 
  if that makes sense . 
  another maybe-distinct european thing is the way many euros [ punch above their weight , ] ( https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2015/03/15.png ) but i think usa inherited that ( look at everything they accomplished in the last few centuries ) , and in any case i think a lot of that comes from our convenient geography , native animals ( you can do a lot more with horses and pigs than bisons and llamas ) and so on , so not sure how much that applies . 
  oh it was different for sure , but so were hungary , romania and moldova . 
  even croatia was `` distinctive '' ( whether it was quality music all in all is another thing , vocals were obviously impressive , the rest is dubious ) . 
  and yet they were treated quite badly by the jury ( except for moldova , and even they were n't at the top 5 ) , so the argument that portugal won because it 's distinctive does n't hold to me . 
  then there 's the [ disparity between jury and public for us . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xibiirm.png ) a bunch of those - 56 out of 103 public votes - are n't even balkan , so you ca n't even say that the public vote was excessively `` balkan block '' . 
  in any case , it was n't any more regional or political than cyprus and greece or uk and australia ( etc. . . ) in the jury . 
  popular only : portugal 376 bulgaria 337 moldova 264 belgium 255 romania 224 italy 208 hungary 152 sweden 126 croatia 103 france 90 azerbaijan 42 poland 41 belarus 33 cyprus 32 norway 29 greece 29 ukraine 24 armenia 21 netherlands 15 uk 12 denmark 8 israel 5 spain 5 germany 3 australia 2 austria 0, 
  oh he was outrageously fabulous ~ and i un-ironically think those crazy high notes are more interesting to hear than the samey-same pop , and interesting music and maybe-music should be the point of contests like this one ( if i want safe and easily digestible music , i 'll browse the top 10 popular lists ) , buuuut i 'm not sure that the people who know more about `` music and diversity and quality '' would agree with me . 
  i am a simple redditor . 
  i hear rap-yodeling or a gypsy dude singling/rapping in hungarian/romani ~ i call 6 times for each < 3, 
   the only song that did n't follow the eurovision formula would win hungary would like a word . 
  it was generic pop . 
  if i did n't know i was watching eurovision , i 'd say `` turn off the american idol , will you ? '', 
  and that 's not just the netherlands , i watched both semis this year and i 'd say half of these songs were forgettable generic pop . 
  neither good , [ nor so bad it 's good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov3xp5zxsya ) , certainly not memorable or interesting or in any way `` celebrating diversity '' . 
  first step in fixing some of the damage would be forcing countries to sing in their native language ( just subtitle the damned thing and there goes the ireland/uk advantage ) . 
  ok , portugal won both the jury and the people , that 's fair . 
  bulgaria was doing well with both , ok . 
  the rest is bullshit by jury . 
  they 're supposed to be there to make sure that `` quality '' gets through ? 
  or better yet , to give unbiased voting outside of blocks ? 
  so why the hell did the quality jury ^ tm make sure that greece gave 12 to cyprus and australia 12 to uk ? 
  [ this is the state of the points after jury . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7frs1wl.png ) note that france , croatia , hungary and romania are in the 2nd half . 
  also note that in the 1st half , you have azerbaijan ( 42 from the public ) , norway ( 29 ) , netherlands ( 15 ) , uk ( 12 ) , denmark ( 8 ) , australia ( 2 !, 
  ) , austria ( ** 0 points from the public , 93 from the jury ** ) .

  what the actual fuck !, 
  be less obvious in your politics !, 
  here too . 
  iirc it was 12 for hungary again . 
  thanks for nothing guys !, 
  if you 'll go for ballads , bulgaria was better imo . 
  yes , you 're welcome hungary . 
  thanks for nothing . 
  ukraine is a better ( non ) neighbor than you !, 
  bah , whole balkan is n't voting for itself . 
  because as we all know there 's no political voting in eurovision ... that explains hungary being so low . 
  have unlimited calls this month so i used all 20 ~ azerbaijan , armenia moldova x2 belarus x4 hungary and romania x6 i expect the popular vote will go to ballads and stuff like that , so \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  yes but sax guy first showed up years ago , during the time the yodel girl was still in primary school ~ the newness of memes matters !, 
  rap yodeling because : why not ? 
  hungary or romania ( memes will vote for epic sax guy anyways ) but then hungary, 
  ok either my musical taste is backwards , or there 's something more afoot here ~ why is for example italy favored over france ? 
  i get it in the case of for example bulgaria , ballads are n't my thing , but i can recognize that the kid has perfectly pinch-able cheeks and that he sings * very * well . 
  but i do n't get why italy in particular . 
  the ghost of harambe ? 
  ( lyrics that i do n't understand anyways ? ), 
  i like it both ironically and un-ironically . 
  ironically because , well , that should be obvious . 
  un-ironically because it 's catchy , generally sounds good , and i think yodeling is a 100 times more interesting and `` muh diversity '' than the usual bland pop-ballads . 
  omg i learned english by watching friends too !, 
  20 years instead of 3 weeks ago !, 
  ** he 's one of us ~ **,

  i thought it would n't work when i heard your song will be in hungarian . 
  not what i 'd call a musical language ( alright , we think your accent ? 
  inflection ? 
  is weird/silly af ) . 
  but it works out very well in the song , imo , 
  i 'm almost evenly and ( un ) ironically split between hungary and romania , and then armenia and belarus . 
  ( i expect none of them will win . ), 
  so i did some maths and divided my 20 votes among them , bless the multiple voting !, 
  ( it still works for the finale , right ? 
  idk i 'm half watching on tv , half on youtube , halp pls ),

  the lowest tower seems like a crossbowman 's dream come true . 
  correct , the sassanid rule was borderline satire during the period of the arab invasion . 
  they actually let a 12 year old ruler decide things without a regent . 
   they did in fact manage to field extremely impressive armies against the arabs but still lose . 
  well , the numbers are quite unreliable and the quality of the army and troops would be doubtful at best . 
  you are correct about the arab cavalry supremacy being a major factor , but it is also true that the roman army during this time was utterly pathetic in all but size . 
   italy ( at least parts of it ) they did not fully lose their italian territories until 1071 , meaning they held on to italy for over 400 years . 
   polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  for how many years of the 250 year habsburg ottoman conflict were they allied to austria ? 
  also , they are not nearly the `` half of europe '' , southern france alone had a larger population . 
   it is no secret that vienna was about to fall when polish managed to reach to siege site thanks to the betrayal of crimean army and managed to stop ottomans . 
  vienna was nowhere near surrendering or falling when the poles came . 
   first siege was not serious pathetic revisionism . 
   the goal was to just test the waters ridiculous statement , you wreak of nationalism . 
  armies so huge are not mustered unless total conquest is the goal , and the ottomans failed miserably . 
   which two are you even talking about sulejman returned 3 years later with an even bigger army but was halted at kiseg ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_g%c3%bcns the invasion failed . 
  some decades after that , another invasion of vienna was planned and led personally by sulejman , but was halted at siget ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_szigetv%c3%a1r the army was hampered and the army retreated after a costly victory . 
   would n't matter either way . 
  it possibly could have mattered quite a lot . 
  you can not wage ww2 without enough oil . 
   they defeated the ottomans with the help of half of the europe . 
  which half ? 
  you mean some small states ? 
  because france , the most powerful military on the continet , was another enemy of austria , not to mention all of protestant europe for quite some time . 
   if they were alone vienna would have fell . 
  they were alone at vienna the first time and it did not fall . 
  the next two times the ottomans failed to even reach vienna . 
   no country came close to their power . 
  the habsburg empire did . 
  to be fair , it took the ottomans nearly a 100 years to take them out . 
  then it took them nearly 100 years to take out the hungarians and croats . 
  that is quite a slow down if you ask me . 
  you are correct about the mamluks , but technically , egypt was still a province of the empire and not a vassal state , so you would need a third color to represent it . 
  you have to open the file to get the direct gif link . 
  also , those balkan conquest borders are incredibly incorrect . 
  uh , i do n't think the territory of hungary was in peace for any significant amount of time . 
  the inner balkans and their portion of the middle east though , yes . 
  but taking baku would be much , much easier and it would result in a collapse of most of the soviet oil supply regardless .

  well , hitler was a moron and chose stalingrad instead . 
  yes , even without the eastern conquests russia was twice as large , with about 2 million km2 .

  the kingdom of england was a major threat to larger france for quite a while , that does not mean france was less developed than england . 
  russia was larger from the moment the tsardom was formed . 
  other than that only the roman empire and frankish empire come to mind . 
  beautiful . 
   russia entered in 1917 you mean left ? 
  i thought you meant the usage of it online in general . 
  i fail to see how usage of it in germany could have got people triggered . 
   that is the fault of those getting triggered at merely mentioning the phrase . 
  no , it is the fault of a lot of people using that term being utter cunts . 
  you forgot something ? 
  lol no , they had nearly 4 million square km during the fascist rule ( mostly african territory ) . 
  the [ kingdom of romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_romania ) during the 20th century was larger than modern day romania until 1940 . 
  territory 295,049 km \u00b2 compared to the modern 238,391 km \u00b2 . 
  sweden . 
  the scumbag steve of the 17th century . 
   there wo n't be any streams today . 
  well , i 'd rather ze germans took over . 
  i heard croats employed here in kaufland and lidl have it a lot better than those employed by konzum . 
   america has no `` far-left '' , it barely has a left . 
  yes it does , it has quite a large number of antifa groups , also socialists , communists and a loads of various other similar groupations across the country . 
  quite the [ interesting bunch ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uxn4sb3.jpg ) the lot of them . 
   show me european far-left supporters `` blaming white people '' . 
  lol are you serious ? 
  ever heard of volkstod ? 
  well , shit . 
   american democrat `` far-left '' , that was funny . 
  that one is . 
   ignoring that the american dynamic is irrelevant in europe . 
  what is the difference between her and imbeciles of her likeness doing basically the same here ? 
  far left in europe is antifa and the likes , not your average friendly democratic socialist . 
  [ sure thing buddy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zdnh0eoqsi ), 
  i have no idea . 
  i did notice african girls that come here to croatia during the summer smell like freshly cut grass and coconut though . 
   the far left blames the ones responsible ; large corporations ( for the most part ) .

  you still believe majority of crimeans do n't want to be a part of russia ? 
  but we 're goodies an they 're baddies . 
  we do n't need democracy - our leaders can be trusted . 
  democracy is for bad countries . 
  our minorities do n't need a bigger voice , they 're fine . 
  baddies need to give their minorities bigger voice . 
  yeah but crimeans are in dark begging kiev to take them back . 
  quietly , of course , because they are afraid of russians . 
  right ? 
  yup . 
   and it will also provide better trade with russia when things calm down * and they eventually will . 
  * yeah , many are trying to make sure that does n't happen . 
  take a listen at discussions held at us congress or almost anything coming from baltic and polish right . 
  they 'll fucking go ballistic if we ever normalize relations with russia . 
  lol sure ok . we 'll be hearing about krim a lot in next few years , in a positive way . 
  you obviously know next to nothing about krim . 
  it 'll probably be the florida of rf . 
  lol those stupid corrupt russians have no roads like at all amirite guys ? 
  misleading title . 
  they bombed * the station * with damage to the adjacent building housing police and their families . 
  only purpose of all the buildings in the complex is housing ? 
  main building is not a police station is what you 're claiming ? 
  so they attacked the enemy police station and civilians happened to be in the complex or they deliberately targeted civilians , as aljazeera turk article headline suggests ? 
  so they attacked the enemy police station and civilians happened to be in the complex * or * they deliberately targeted civilians , as aljazeera turk article headline suggests ? 
  can you read turkish or you 're just believing the op 's headline ? 
  search for news containing `` pkk '' in the last 24 hours in english or in your preferred language and see there 's a debate over who killed who and blame shifting . 
  can you read turkish or you 're just believing the op 's headline ? 
  search for news containing `` pkk '' in the last 24 hours in english or in your preferred language and see there 's a debate over who killed who and blame shifting . 
  i also heard some do n't like that we call belarus b ( j ) elorusija . 
  which cases ? 
  you understand the main players benefit in the long term even if it 's them footing the bill ? 
  or to put it another way , presence of russia in some country x is seen as a possible danger and any other scenario is seen as a win . 
  he 's talking about krim there . 
  hm , did n't notice it . 
  it says * libyan * in the follow-up though . 
  you know so little about these countries you have to resort to generalizations like * in africa they ... * or * in middle east they ... * . 
   and syria was a mess long before the west started to bomb the country . 
  it became a mess when arms started to flow in . 
   let 's not even mention the vast amount of war crimes we helped the rebels commit . 
  remember all those haunting videos and photos of sub-saharan africans hauled into trucks ? 
  i 'll never forget those . 
  what was the domestic reaction to not vetoing the un decision ? 
  it 's not smart for every country to borrow at every moment . 
   yeah and the same people that are shouting that overthrowing gaddafi has been a bad idea would have gave the west an hard time if nato did nothing . 
  definitely not the same people . 
   even if the west had n't shipped ak47 to libya , the rebels would n't have had too much difficulty getting some weapons . 
  all those governments have opposition , some moderate , some very extreme and violent . 
  however , coups happen almost exclusively when opposition is encouraged , armed and led by outside country . 
  why has n't there been an armed rebellion of massive scale in saudi arabia or iran in recent years ? 
  well , no foreign entity decided to encourage and arm the opposition . 
  i somehow doubt putin could n't convince medvedev if he wanted to . 
  my guess is , aside from few infrastructural and arm deals , russia did n't have very much to gain from libya one way or another so as sign of good relations with france chose to look away and not get involved . 
  they thought they had more to gain from good relations with france than from good relations with gaddafi . 
  source is us government , hosted on webpage dedicated to freedom of information act related files . 
   ( and especially hurts europe ) , which is also their goal . 
  you have to be careful with these easy , broad , black and white conclusions . 
  while there is some level of competition between various us and europe 's oil companies and financial institutions , they are mostly on the same page when it comes to foreign resources . 
  libyan economy distancing itself and encouraging other african nations to distance themselves from us&uk ( `` western '' ) institutions leading to massive propaganda campaign followed by nato attack and murder of head of state - muammar gaddafi . 
  consequences for libya : relatively prosperous ( compared to other african countries ) nation with very left-leaning , social policies of education , housing , medical care now in state of constant war between various islamist and * sell-everything-to-westerners-and-bring-mcdonalds-to-us * factions . 
  standard of living falling drastically , population measurably worse than pre-2011 . 
  oh and by the way - fuck you russia and china , for not vetoing the decision . 
  hate speech is illegal only on paper . 
  hate speech directed at perceived `` haters '' , for example , is not illegal and is seen as positive . 
  yeah , russia is totally irrelevant . 
  nah , it usually stays for a week . 
  more if another storm comes by and if it 's below 0 . 
  this is the most popular video of zagreb under heavy snow ( 2012 ) . 
  [ ** winter in zagreb ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6yvhvu4fc0 ) really worth watching . 
  dubrava , at the east ( northeast ? ), 
  of the city was built in socialism too . 
  yet , it 's much prettier than anything south of the sava river imho . 
  well , communism definitely did n't slow down progress in area of multi-cultural relations . 
   fully ** 80 % ** of russians have never travelled outside the former soviet union yet , in 2014 , ** 59 % ** participants said they 've never traveled outside former soviet union . 
   and only ** 5 % ** speak a foreign language at conversational level . 
  yet , in 2014 , ** 16 % ** participants said they fluently speak at least one foreign language . 
  do n't know about yalta ? 
  artek children camp ? 
  do n't you watch movies bro ? 
  just to give people the perspective , that 's like ** 3 ** whole minimum monthly wages . 
  airbus also had more orders than boeing in 2015 . 
  do n't push for those rotten resolutions in the first place . 
  you have no business turning secular dictatorships into pseudo-democratic chaos . 
  no way . 
  yeah ... about that . 
  nuclear states do n't do that to each other . 
  are those much higher than general minimum wage ?

  can you explain this part :  the notion that linguistic socialization into a speech community lies at the heart of lado has been argued for by linguists since 2004 , and is now accepted by a range of government agencies ( e.g. 
  switzerland , norway ), 
  please provide any source on these good practices for determination of origin . 
  i 'm being serious , ca n't find anything at all . 
  i demand a state-wide referendum for the sake of belgium 's territorial integrity !, 
  that 's the only way secession/accession can be done in civilized world !,

  used to not care about that because my cave was the coolest room in this house , was always at least 10 c less than outside , but now i moved to a different part of the house and it 's nice that i have double the space ( whole upper floor for me , * finally * ) , but . 
  feels like my soul is melting away ~ but since i 'm ranting about heat already , philosophical question : how can anyone be * productive * in this horror ? 
  ac and shade are neat and all , but they 're not helping with most of the outside world . 
  how do greeks and egyptians and so on ever get anything done ? 
  it 's 10 am and 33 c here already . 
  they say it 'll go to 39 c today . 
  pls send help ; - ;, 
  well , if greeks somehow managed to copyright democracy , they would n't be listening to the chorus of `` pay denbts '' nowadays , now would they ? 
  give it some years , and you too will have to decide whether you feel embarrassed or oddly proud when our god-emperor juncker slaps important people ^ tm around . 
  literally slaps , that is . 
  hm , i 'd disagree somewhat . 
  we do talk politics a lot for sure , but we also talk a lot about quality of living - all those ppp , hdi , education results and such maps . 
  plus , if we 'll look at this as a place for interesting information ... me finding out that china matters is no news at all . 
  i see all the stuff in stores that 's made in china . 
  i know they 're geographically large . 
  i know that basically every fifth person in the world is chinese . 
  so , a big nominal gdp is `` i could guess that on my own , thank you very much '' . 
  usa is certainly more interesting , because their ppp is keeping up with their gdp ( enough ) . 
  or , for example , ireland is even more interesting , because they do n't have a large population or geography or internal resources . 
  well , not more perspective , but maybe just `` the other side of it '' . 
  china in nominal gdp is a beast , and you treat it as such when doing business . 
  but per capita is a different story . 
  meanwhile , that argument does n't work for usa , they 're yuge in both nominal and per capita gdp . 
  no , i said i 've seen racism from all sides . 
  and i said you should n't generalize . 
  ok , let 's take it step by step . 
  racism , xenophobia , this ranting against muslim , all such discrimination that tends to come from narrow-mindedness and/or people having a few bad experiences and thereafter generalizing the whole group from these few experiences , right ? 
  and it 's wrong to generalize all muslims based on relatively few terror attacks for example ? 
  are you pulling my leg , or do you struggle with reading comprehension ? 
  the person who attacked those bigoted attitudes in this post is eastern european . 
  the upvotes/downvotes are quite unlikely to be majority eastern , because of reddit demographics . 
  and same for people who participate in immigrant threads . 
  i 've seen all sides rant against those immigrants ... in fact , if anyone will be interested in ethnic cleansing of muslims irl , then it 'll be the west , because most of said muslims are in it . 
  but it appears i 'm wasting my time with you . 
  you go on , believe you 're so much more enlightened than those bigoted easterners ... while you 're practicing the exact same type of bigotry . 
  i saw two eastern euros arguing about muslims and roma . 
  and one of them , the downvoted serb , is asking `` what the hell , subreddit ?? '', 
  as he rightly is , such upvotes are worrying . 
  and i think it 's highly unlikely that eastern euros are to blame for those votes , iirc nordics , germany , benelux , uk , ireland and such dominate in absolute numbers . 
  mind you , i do think op is naive about r/europe in general . 
  i have rather uncomplimentary opinions on the `` enlightenment '' of the people who frequent this sub ... any immigrant topic , they 'll be a hair-breath away from suggesting ethnic cleansing . 
  but i 've almost given up on arguing about that , the hive mind is such that i 'm not getting anywhere . 
  well , in the few months i 've been here , most of the people from my country are either neutral , or even faintly defensive of the muslims . 
  to give more details , on one hand we physically ca n't afford to take in many immigrants , and they do n't want to stay here anyways ( the issue of economic migrant vs refugee gets rather clear when half a million of them pass through your country in one month and most only ask `` which direction for germany ? '' ) . 
  on the other hand , the `` all moooslims the same , ewww '' notions get preposterous when you live next to bosniaks and albanians . 
  and i do n't see why i should be obliged to argue with random eastern euros about their attitudes . 
  i mean , we were one tribe some 1500 + or 2000 + years ago ... my country has more to do with germany than it does with random easterners . 
  there 's no such thing as `` pan-slavic unity '' or whatever . 
  and when it comes to either random euroskepticism that lies on the issue of immigrants , or bigotry against immigrants in general , i 'm seeing about even amounts from west/east . 
  * some * easterners are more triggered by muslims than westerners . 
  on the other hand , same westerners are triggered by immigrants period , be they from eu , non-eu europe , or outside of europe . 
  and when it comes to actual results , i think brexit speaks enough for the east/west divide ... same for wilders and le pen even being an issue . 
  perhaps you ought to speak up against wilders and euroskepticism in your own country first , eh ? 
  well , the boycott is a problem because qatar is a small desert . 
  for starters , food will be a problem , i think most of theirs was delivered through saudi arabia ? 
  but at the same time , qatar is a petrostate with iirc the highest gdp per capita in the world . 
  so , they certainly have money to buy stuff like navy vessels . 
  which all goes to show that money alone is n't everything , but that 's a philosophy for another time . 
  our coast , sure , but there 's way more to croatia than that . 
  the coastal inlands ( think - the lower , diagonal side of the `` v '' ) is mostly cattle/sheep grazing , then there 's a whole other , continental side , in the upper/horizontal side of the v . that one has a completely different climate , plus soil , it 's part of the fertile panonian basin . 
  think hugary . 
  and we 're not using up our potential , could produce so much more food than we do . 
  mind you , other effects of climate change will likely disturb things . 
  fires in the south , flooding in the north , storms and droughts getting more frequent , damaging and basically unpredictable . 
  and it appears that my `` cunning plan '' to move to bumfuck nowhere , sweden , wo n't work . 
  apparently these more northern lands have poor soil ( . _ . ), 
   fish proteins are essential in the diet of some densely populated countries where the total protein intake level is low , and are very important in the diets of many other countries . 
  worldwide , about a billion people rely on fish as their main source of animal proteins . 
  dependence on fish is usually higher in coastal than in inland areas . 
  about 20 % of the world 's population derives at least one-fifth of its animal protein intake from fish , and some small island states depend almost exclusively on fish . 
  in regards to sea/oceans , it 's not the variations in temperature that are a problem ( though they will be , for us euros in particular - the gulf stream getting screwed will be a problem ) , but the acidification . 
  sea is literally getting more acidic ... which is killing corals , 50 % died in only 30 years , and with corals go all the fish species that live around them . 
  that means serious food shortages ... * for 1 billion people . 
  ahh ... armchair psychology time !, 
  everybody is selfish in one way or another . 
  the reason for that is obvious , resources are and were always limited , `` got ta take care of myself '' . 
  '' ... myself , and my people '' . 
  we 're social animals , and if we had n't evolved to be social animals , we would n't have gotten anywhere . 
  you need divisions of labor , which means the need to communicate , assign tasks , build mutual trust , etc etc. 
  so , that means we 're all * tribal * . 
  the problem with modern society is that it 's way too large for our still-primitive brains , i read somewhere that our brains are on the level of `` 200 people or thereabouts '' . 
  that 's the size of the group we can get to know , trust/tolerate , etc. 
  the rest are all strangers , to be viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion . 
  fortunately - for society in general - we went past 200 . 
  the division of labor gets more and more profitable the more of us participate . 
  at some point , we needed writing . 
  also increasingly complex politics . 
  invented ideologies , like religion and `` culture '' and `` this is how our big group is supposed to be . '', 
  then , mass education and mass communication . 
  it all keeps us in check ... sort-of . 
  or , we 're `` civilized enough '' , most people in 2017 function ok-ish in this humongous world of 7 billion . 
  but , since our brains are still rather primitive , and since * everybody likes to feel good about themselves * , we like to identify with groups that define themselves against * those other people * and obviously , are `` superior '' to those other groups . 
  communists vs capitalists , believers vs non-believers , lgbt vs anti-lgbt , etc etc. 
  obviously , some ideologies are more enlightened than others . 
  but the regular members of the `` progressive '' group feel the same self-satisfied rush when bashing those they consider `` non-progressives '' , like the non-progressives do when it 's the other way around . 
  observe , for example , the militant atheists . 
  majority of them to me sound just as close-minded , smug , know-it-all and unintelligent as believers do . 
  [ more about groups and how they work ~ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3j_rhkqjc&amp;t=1s ), 
  again , you seem to be confusing certain countries for some others . 
  my country is eastern , and we increased our migrant quota .

  extremely cheesy, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://en.as.com/en/2016/03/15/football/1458053087_660971.html ), 
  attack on a hospital is a war crime, 
  no , they were not hostages . 
  the hospital was bombed . 
  yeah , hrvoje would be more like a stereotypical name , rather than the most common one . 
  like janez for slovenia or mujo for bosnia . 
  i was n't talking about litral translation , but when you name an average british man it 's john smith . 
  when you name an average croat it 's ivan horvat . 
   pretty sure the roma could get help to get out of their clans if they wanted to . 
  if you were an uneducated and backward roma person , and the majority of them is , there is a big chance that you would do nothing else than obey the person who is blackmailing you . 
  what about those ` doctors without borders ' who were killed in syria by us bombing ? 
  i wonder what would happen if some other non-us ally did something like that ... 
  maybe they 're not starving . 
  maybe they are begging so they do n't get beaten up later because they did n't bring enough money to the boss/owner . 
  i do n't know , but they certainly need that money , desperately . 
  yes . 
  ivan horvat is croatian for john smith . 
  true , it 's very often organized among roma beggars . 
  i do n't know what happens to those who do n't collect enough money , but they are probably so persistent for a reason , maybe even a worse one than starving . 
  greece is ` new europe ' ? 
  no , i 'm saying they do n't have time to think about humiliation . 
  they have other things on their minds , like feeding their children , so they do n't have a choice other than taking the money . 
  their problems are bigger than the problem of being humiliated , that 's why they became beggars in the first place . 
  i know , i did n't literally mean that they are croats , but i always thought horvat was exclusively croatian surname . 
  beggars do n't have time to think about humiliation . 
  if they do n't take the money they will starve , which is not a choice . 
  they do n't have a choice . 
  bless you, 
  ` dobar tek ' in croatian . 
  i know that in bosnia and serbia they say ` prijatno ' , which means ` pleasantly ' in literal translation . 
  [ bon appetit !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjjjzmoxzq ), 
  that makes sense . 
  we also have surnames like \u010ceh ( czech ) , ma\u0111ar / ma\u0111arac ( hungarian ) , bo\u0161njak ( bosniak ) , hercegovac ( hercegovian ) and rus ( russian ) but they are not the most common ones . 
  yes , that 's where we came from , apparently ... 
  are there that many croats in slovakia ? 
  yes , yes . 
  in croatia we buy 10 extra tvs just in case . 
  every time when i was at my grandma 's during a storm we had to turn off the tv in the middle of something interesting and unplug every single plug , roll down the blinds on the windows and be sure to wear slippers . 
  also , you had to hide from the plugs because we believed they would absorb the lightning and shoot the electricity at us . 
  if you do n't change your swimsuit after exiting the sea/pool you will get bladder infection which will lead to infertility . 
  that 's german, 
  she also lived in medvedgrad castle near zagreb and left a big influence in northern croatia . 
  well it 's not really a romantic legend . 
  i mean , i do n't know if it counts as a tragic love story , but she was apparently known for murdering her lovers in gruesome ways . 
  she got the adjective ` black ' because she was always wearing black and doing black magic , and the fact that she was very cruel . 
  the legend also says she sold her soul to the devil so that he would save us from the turks . 
  after her death she became a snake which is now looking after its gold hidden in the zagreb 's underground tunnels . 
  hayir , i already watched it all . 
  turkish soaps air in prime time so it 's not my fault !, 
  what about hurrem and suleyman ? 
  am i watching too many soap operas ? 
  i 'll try to learn russian and see what happens . 
  there is no f ****** way i 'm learning chinese . 
  we also have a legend about fridrik and veronika . 
  more popular tragic love story is the one told in zlatarovo zlato ( goldsmith 's gold ) . 
  it 's about the forbidden love between dora krupi\u0107eva and pavao gregorijanec . 
  more popular legend related to fridrik and veronika is about fridrik 's sister , barbara celjska , better known as crna kraljica ( black queen ) . 
  do you have legends about her ? 
  well that escalated quickly !,

  there is a party called \u017divi zid ( human blockade ) in croatia and they always compare themselves to m5s . 
  they are populist af . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  amazon , ebay and fashion sites . 
  it 's kinda annoying that they usually do n't ship large items outside of the country where they 're located . 
  whereas in [ croatia ] ( http://www.index.hr/black/clanak/kurva-pivo-i-zabranjena-biljka-ovaj-rijecki-semafor-je-totalni-hit/877833.aspx ) ...

  you forgot the queen of socialism , [ mamutica ] ( http://zkahlina.ca/cro/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mamutica01.jpg ), 
  we hate everyone . 
  we are a mix of different people groups , that 's the scientific consensus . 
  there is n't a historian consensus . 
  our language definitely did not come from iran , it came from slavs . 
  there are different theories of croatian descent , some even suggest that we 're goths , but dna does n't lie , according to which we are mostly slavic . 
  that 's a lie . 
  the attack happened during winter months , when montenegrins are in the deep state of hibernation . 
  they are building a fence on slovakian and mexican border . 
  you were wrong, 
  thank god there are no unesco world heritage sites around , otherwise they would go full bomb-mode . 
  * cough * dubrovnik * cough *, 
  in today 's croatian it is usually linked to word ' \u0161iba ' , which means ` rod ' or ` stick ' . 
  so \u0160ibenik means ` surrounded by sticks ' . 
  since croats came from places around carpathian mountains , they used a word similar to ' \u0161ibenik ' to describe a place where people were executed . 
  today a word like that is not used , but it is still in use in other slavic languages . 
  so it 's likely that the city was named after a hill , which is today above it , where gallows were . 
   prettiest coast in adriatic sea bitch , you did not, 
   russian state pollster wciom reports i am suprised it 's not 98 %, 
  yes, 
  because australia would then use slovenian ports instead of croatian . 
  it 's more similar to novi sad than belgrade , in my opinion . 
  yeah , not the best idea to go on that game since dinamo and hajduk are big rivals and fights are not rare between torcida and bbb . 
  do n't go on a game if you go to zagreb because the stadium is embarrassing .

   and the `` not-giving-a-shit '' of the slav wat ?

  let me tell you , mikhail is a good comrade !, 
  never complains about pulling my cart uphill both ways . 
  ( but gustav was a fascist spy , politburo took him away . 
  they told me he 's going to eternal grazing grounds , though . ), 
  yea i think you 're right , it 's just a marketing gimmick . 
  the standards are quite rigorous ( to the woe of many a local producer that had to adapt ) , and the product is of the same quality , so there should be no reason for bias . 
  and yet bias exists , it 's fairly common for people from the outside of europe - or from west eu , tbh - to think of the east as `` sadness , commie blocks , poor af '' etc etc , so they 'll judge products as `` sadness '' too . 
  i mean in the early 2000 's , tourists boards and reviews were acting like croatia came into existence in 2002 , so you 'd hear stuff like `` they have * surprisingly * beautiful nature and old history '' and even people being baffled that we have motorways . 
  like , no shit sherlock , did you expect afghanistan ? 
   czech republic why you so sad though ? 
  people keep telling them they 're eastern europe ? 
  and even the arguments against you joining schengen do n't make much sense imo . 
  so apparently the problems are your corruption , and your difficult borders . 
  so you 're unreliable . 
  meanwhile greece is in schengen , their debt crisis is endless ( so much for being reliable ) , and their sea borders with turkey are logistically impossible to police ( not their fault , but there you have it ) . 
  the paris of croatia ... or at least , from what i hear of paris , the situation is similar . 
  i 've last been there in 1997 , and do n't get me wrong , it 's a nice city to visit !, 
  but even then it felt pretty tiny , like it ca n't handle very big crowds , and you can see most of the sights in a day , two maximum . 
  ditto for what i hear of their increasing prices/tourist trap business model . 
  our coast has a bit of a problem - you have beautiful sights and clean sea , plus the hipster-appeal ( * italy is soooo 90 's !, 
  * ) so you want to attract tourists with that , but the more tourists you attract , the less quaint and clean it gets . 
  one good-ish side-effect of the tourist boom is that there 's more to do if you 're not into `` sea and sun '' tourism alone ( so more parties for students ) , and being popular is nice , but i liked it more in the 90 's where you did n't have to struggle for beach spots ( as much ) . 
  tbh the best i can advise is : come in july or september ( crowds are smaller ) , and rent a car - it 's worth it to drive a bit further to the less `` popular '' towns/beaches . 
  because it 'd take some time and money to bring european armies to the level if usa pulled out of nato ? 
  mind you , that does n't mean we should allow ourselves to be pushed around ( well , more than usual ) , or that we should accept fictional debts . 
  and i wonder how much of that military spending is necessary , my impression is that usa has been at war every other tuesday for the last 60 + years , presumably eu would n't care for that - we just need to defend ourselves and our `` oppressed russian minorities '' and such . 
  oppressed turkish minorities , maybe ? 
  meteors are a chinese hoax !, 
  i know , and at least here most of the people i know think positively about the eu , if for nothing else , then because - well , our corrupt/incompetent politicians have less breathing room for their hijinks because of the pressure eu puts on them . 
  ca n't pull out a lot of money from eu if your public sector is inefficient , or a suspicious amount of the money `` goes astray , what sorcery is this '' . 
  but while i 'd say we 're progressing , rome was n't built in a day . 
  the slowness of our judicial system for example , it 's still years off from western-eu standards , and you ca n't just import that , regardless of money . 
  on the other hand , meanwhile we 're doing well when it comes to the percentage of green energy ( passed our 2020 goal in 2014/15 iirc , we 're at 29 % right now ) . 
  i think it 'll depend from case to case . 
  hopefully the majority of the cases will be something we can do . 
  i 'm repeating my arguments from other threads , but anyways ~ if the choice you point out is just a matter of will , as in what politicians decide ( in regards to more federalization for example ) , then that 's perfectly fair . 
  but if practical issues come into the story , it 's different . 
  let 's say common-project-x needs certain infrastructure , efficiency of public sector , percentage of gdp spent on it and such , and it needs to be implemented within let 's say `` 2 years '' . 
  the poorer or the less organized members can have all the goodwill in the world , it 'll be a fact that project-x ca n't physically be implemented in those 2 years . 
  so the better-off members say `` whatever , call us when you catch up '' , with this catch-up time likely growing because the better-off only get richer and the divide widens . 
  i * hope * that it 'll just be a matter of political cooperation , but we 'll see how it 'll actually work in practice . 
  true , he 'll go away . 
  but it 's not just trump , think the controversy of the war on terror , the clusterfuck that 's today 's middle east , for which usa gets a big part of the blame if you ask people ( whether they 're right or not , that 's the perception ) , the spying scandals , hell even the lack of cooperation in regards to important issues like global warming ( chinese hoax , of course ! ) . 
  if trump was just seen as an aberration , his statements of `` america first '' would n't get so readily parodied all across the west ( and further , i was tickled pink when * namibia * of all places joined up ) . 
  i mean , i hope usa - and the `` western '' alliance - eventually pulls through . 
  but i think a lot of the faith in it has been shaken . 
  well , historically yes ? 
  but , christianity spread all over the world , same for secularity , preference of science , development of tech - in my mind , countries like usa , japan etc are just as strong in tech and education ( on average ) . 
  and if we 'll go by historical developments in science , rule of law , human rights etc , it 's not like we were the only bastion of light in the world , arabs and china come to mind . 
  for a specific example , i do n't see why i should feel closer to nordics than canada , when canada shares many of the same values , my uncle emigrated there 30 years ago , he brought his canadian so over here to meet us , and i get a lot of exposure through phone calls , postcards etc. 
  meanwhile i never met a finn . 
  this is n't anything against finland , but i just do n't experience some sense of `` european = common identity '' , when it 's some specific european countries ( like germany ) that i interact with , while i do n't with others . 
  i imagine the first downside would be reorganization , not just of the eu armies ( that 'd need to grow in number of soldiers , also you have the training/facilities/tech to consider ) , but also the fact that most of us are in nato and you ca n't just pull out of such an agreement in 5 minutes . 
  then , i expect most would end up paying more , usa shoulders a disproportionate cost of nato spending , while i do n't think the same would happen in eu ( or at least , not in the same measure ) . 
  the biggest benefit - well . 
  usa has a spotty track record of wars since vietnam , and europe sometimes gets dragged into it . 
  also they 've recently elected a meme into office , same meme that 's palling around with putin , so even the nominal `` usa defends europe from russia '' goes out of the window . 
  and i guess people may feel that for example a german soldier or politician will care more about the baltics ( or insert whatever other nationalities ) than the usa does . 
  i still ca n't get over how ridiculous he sounds and looks . 
  like the no-handshake bit , bloody hell if the pm of papua new guinea comes to meet you , you 'll shake their hand * because this is what adults do * , regardless of who 's more powerful in the situation . 
  it 's common politeness . 
  then look at the tweet , the language he uses :  `` despite what you have heard from the fake news , i had a great meeting with the chancellor angela merkel . '', 
  capitalization ? 
  * fake news * ? 
  what is this , the youtube comment section ? 
  some kid you accuse of something and he goes on shaking his head , saying `` nuh nuh , it was n't me mom , timmy was lying '' ? 
  i mean i get bad politicians , but this is a new low . 
  if it continues like this , i expect geopolitical negotiations will consist of tweets containing `` u mad bro ? '', 
  in the future . 
  eh , at least over here , the dictatorship was political - everyone had to be a good little comrade espousing how awesome the politburo was . 
  but workers ' rights were more protected than in glorious capitalism . 
  mama rusija was euroskeptic before it was cool !, 
  ok , what is europe ? 
  it 's just a continent , same as all other continents . 
  being `` european '' is the equivalent of living in some street , where you never interact with most of the people , aside from the richest/closest ones . 
  i do n't get people who say they `` love europe , but not eu '' , when europe by itself is - what ? 
  is there some strong * european identity * i somehow missed meeting by accident ? 
  if we 'll go by identity/culture/economy / politics/army , i have more interaction with usa or china than most european countries . 
  the eu on the other hand , is a common economic/political project , so then we can talk about europe like a thing that matters to the common people . 
  it think the truth is somewhere in the middle . 
  in my experience , the easiest way to rob the people you 're supposed to govern is to wave the national flag with one hand , while the other rifles through their pockets . 
  on the other hand , i think it 's in human nature that power corrupts and there 's only so many people you can care about , so giving more power to fewer people will usually harm the `` periphery '' , the lands/people that are more distant from whatever capital of power . 
  so in that sense , having more of the `` smaller-governors '' , which in this case translates to national politicians , is better for the common joe .

  amazing how you felt the need to fire up your alt ( i assume ) to share this bit of well-explained wisdom ... 
  you 're probably on the right track , with the regulations and the can-do attitude . 
  i 'm seriously generalizing here , but my impression is that usa has more faith/desire in `` making it '' , becoming one of those super-successful millionaires that `` pulled themselves by the bootstraps '' , started from nothing , and invented something awesome . 
  and the regulations side of the story supports that `` winner take all '' schtick . 
  while us euros seem more conservative/less idealistic when it comes to believing in those success-stories . 
  mind you , i think this has the other side , too . 
  again generalizing , but since europe in general believes less in `` anyone can make it '' , we 're friendlier to the concepts of social security nets for everyone . 
  or at least that 's how i explain the usa 's allergy to universal health insurance , free universities etc. 
  if you believe that anyone can make it , you 'll likely be more suspicious of `` those lazy freeloaders '' . 
  hmm , good point . 
  when i think of media , i think of hollywood and the various tv channels like hbo , who ( again , according to my impression ) blow all of europe * put together * out of the water ( brits are the 2nd in that , but without them i ca n't recall many european movies/shows that are popular across the world ) . 
  then innovation , i was thinking computer science which is again mostly sponsored by usa , same goes for nasa or even the more recent-ish spacex . 
  not sure about other areas , aside from german cars ( plus east asia ) mostly dominating their field .

  when chetnik forces who were killing in croatia and serbia use it as their song and when they actually made drina flow red with blood of innocent people they slaughtered on bridges over drina ... well ... maybe , just maybe ... it 's not the best song to represent serbia . 
  as for `` lijepa na\u0161a '' , there is no blood in it and nobody is marching anywhere . 
  `` mar\u0161 na drinu '' is serbian nationalistic poem that sings about blood in river drina . 
  to understand why it might be a problem you have to see where is drina - border between serbia and bosnia and the word `` mar\u0161 '' ( march ) is used for military formations . 
  the biggest problem is that is calls for blood in river drina and serbian chetniks used to kill muslims on bridges over the drina river and dump bodies in the river . 
  they did that in ww2 and during bosnians war 1992-1995 . 
  srebrenica , place of worst massacre in europe since the end of ww2 in which serbs killed over 8000 men is also located by drina . 
  here is what was going in fo\u010da , another town on drina . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fo%c4%8da_massacres  the fo\u010da massacres , also known as the fo\u010da genocide , were a series of killings committed by serb military , police and paramilitary forces on bosniak civilians in the fo\u010da region of bosnia and herzegovina ( including the towns of gacko and kalinovik ) from april 7 , 1992 to january 1994 . 
  in a 1997 judgement against novislav \u0110aji\u0107 , the bavarian appeals chamber ruled that the killings in which he was involved in june 1992 were acts of genocide . 
  [ 1 ] -  some 2,704 people from fo\u010da are missing or were killed during the massacres period . 
  [ 2 ] additionally , serb authorities set up locations - commonly described as rape camps - in which hundreds of women were raped . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] so ... when serbs sing about river of blood in drina ... their neighbours might feel unconfortable .

  panonian sea ?

  still , it 's a damn border crossing and some weird guys asking her for her papers did n't ring a bit of alarm ? 
  and if she did n't have her passport how would she cross it anyway ? 
  i just do n't see how would this happen . 
  maybe ljubljana ( slovenia ) , but zagreb ? 
  not so sure . 
  true . 
  northern republics had pretty high standard of living and even those that were considered under-developed in yugoslavia were better than any ex-communist country . 
  we still have n't reach pre-war industry output and average salary . 
  1990 's were shit . 
  how the fuck it 's revanchism if they fled before anyone could even touch them ? 
  what bullshit ? 
  did serbs cleanse their territory from every other nationality ? 
  need pictures ? 
  did serbs massacre over 8000 people just in srebrenica after taking the town ? 
  did serbs leave towns and villages in krajina ** before ** croatian forces entered ? 
  yes or no ? 
   jerusalem lol . 
  it 's funny how serbs want kosovo because it 's theirs historically , but also want parts of bosnia and croatia because they are majority there just like albanians in kosovo . 
  these same serbs who now live in bosnia and croatia came here after serbs lost the battle of kosovo and ran from turks , maybe even from kosovo itself . 
  if you check maps of greater serbia you would find towns in croatia that were never part of any serbian entity and never had serb majority . 
  i am not speaking about current situation or situation in 1990/1991 , i am speaking about ** never ** in the history . 
  under 1974 constitution of yugoslavia kosovo had a right to secede . 
  historically ? 
  not even close . 
  just as serbs claim kosovo as their heartland , croats claim same for areas in northern dalmatia where this so called krajina existed for a few years . 
  you forgot to mention who cleansed who first . 
  it sounds awful to hear how poor serbs were `` cleansed '' ( by the way , term `` ethnic cleansing '' was introduced by serbs to explain their planned politics in greater serbia once they create it and we could see what it means in srebrenica ) , but fails to mention it was these same serbs who cleansed their territory in the first place and than they ran in front of advancing croatian forces . 
  unlike serbs in 1991 who forced people from their homes at gunpoint ( if they did n't kill them ) , serb population in 1995 fled together with serb military forces before croatian forces entered their towns and villages . 
   i wonder if it 's because our drunk idiots go to the mediterranean . 
  no need to wonder . 
  that 's it .

   do they want people to be uneducated and afraid of sex ? 
  off course they want that . 
  without shaming people for their `` sins '' and sinful thoughts ... how would they control them ? 
  suppressing sex and education is one of their main goals . 
  if people thought sex is natural and there is no shame in it . . why would they go to confessions ? 
  if people were educated why would they believe in invisible sky daddies ? 
  that 's probably the fastest way to get them out , telling germany wants them to do something . 
  i just ca n't understand what are they trying to achieve here . 
  it 's education for kids and there is nothing wrong with it . 
  should priests teach kids about sex ? 
  a guy begging on a busy intersection was making twice as much money as average croatian . 
  source : the guy himself, 
  american policies are so far right that their moderates and centrists would be right to extreme right in europe . 
  this is just another example of it . 
  us constitution was written 250 years ago , in time when well regulated militia was able to fight regular army . 
  both sides had muskets and there were no tanks , helicopters , cruise missiles , combat drones and so on . 
  there is no well regulated militia armed with just assault rifles that can fight modern military . 
  modern military would wipe the floor with such militia very fast . 
  and please do n't use syria as an example because syrian army is fucking retarded . 
  we could consider hezbollah as well regulated militia that was able to hold the line against modern military , but that 's only because they were armed to their teeth with latest weapons supplied by iran and syria ... most importantly at weapons and new tactics to use them behind fortified positions in their territory . 
   they point out that you will never know if someone has a firearm and therefore will not attempt to harm/rob them . 
  what actually happens if that people robbing them will certainly have guns and are ready to use them .

  why ? 
   the guys who beg on the streets of paris are n't the heroes of the groups we marginalized , they 're the representatives of those who have been otherwise consistently refusing ( or worse , mocking ) help for the last 20 years or so .

  why should any society allow this ?

  - 14 year old girl was sold by her parents for a horse ro\u0111ena sam u velikoj , desetero\u010dlanoj obitelji u romskom naselju u pi\u0161korovcu . 
  - i was born in a 10 member family in roma village . 
  i wanted to go to school when i was aged 6 , but parents wanted me to work at home `` you do n't need school , we will merry you '' they told me . 
  - first days of school i was dirty , my cloths were torn , but i knew what i had to do . 
  home was hell , father abused our mother and he got 2.5 years of prison for it finally . 
  - i fell in love aged 16 , but my father had other plans ... he had a guy for me ... ha gave me away for a box of beer and so on ... that 's the culture we are speaking of here . 
  that 's how they live .

  belgium has a coast haha . 
  i do n't .

  yesterday is n't just the past it never happened ... or it 's the most important day in history , all depending on what the interest demands . 
  that does make a huge difference . 
  we could certainly handle 5-10x more ukrainian refugees than refugees from the n. africa and the middle east . 
  the reason is that you can safely distribute them without leaving them to fend for them selves . 
  that 's a horrible idea . 
  you 're a refugee . 
  you do n't speak the language , you do n't have any extended family to help you , you 're a stranger in a strange land and then suddenly you 're ripped appart from the only other people you know . 
  completely isolated and with no way for the government to efficiently provide help , you 're basically on your own in a nice house or apartment but with no direction or idea what to do next . 
  if you happen to end up in a particularly xenophobic neighborhood , you are fucked . 
  both concentration and distribution are bad , but concentration is temporary . 
  idealy you effectively use resources to help people build the foundation of a future and gradually distribute them as they manage to assimilate to an acceptable degree , but that takes years . 
  there simply is n't a good solution . 
  the refugees did n't want to leave home and we have no way to integrate people over night . 
  the whole thing is like a bad injury . 
  we 're rich enough to make it not fatal , we 're even able to fix it , but all the money and good will in the world is n't going to make it not hurt . 
  what 's the alternative . 
  spread the people out and you have a few ten thousand people who do n't speak the language all alone in a foreign land with no idea what to do and no way for the government to help them as any resources earmarked for them will be so scattered as to be useless . 
  having them in one place is best , but they need housing . 
  building or finding housing for that many people is a practical impossibility and even if we did , we 'd basically end up with the american housing projects . 
  as far as most of us former east block countries go , we do n't have our own shit together and are barely making our homes in to places where young people born here would want to stay . 
  unloading the people who do n't want to be in our countries in to places that do n't want and more importantly , do n't know how to care for them is a recipe for disaster . 
  you wo n't find one country in the former eastern block where people have n't already had experiences with forced resettlements and redistribution of peoples and the local populations above the age of 30 are reasonably paranoid about any such move . 
  you ca n't convince people that this is n't a ploy to make the economically weaker countries even more dependant by flooding them with immigrants . 
  we 've had centuries worth of experience that tell us such moves are always to be regarded as malicious . 
  the only way this could ever work is if we got to cherry pick who we wanted . 
  basically we take the professionals , the technicians , the best educated and lowest risk refugees . 
  anything else and the first time a refugee commits a serious crime the accusation will arise that you cherry picked the good ones and sent us the criminals , the potential terrorists and everyone else you did n't want to deal with and even if it 's not your intention to do so , that 's how it 's going to happen . 
  no one wants to send away potential assets or keep liabilities . 
  no one is going to actively try and send us people that would sabotage us , although that 's going to be the perception , but any half way fair system for the refugees is by necessity going to treat staying in a rich country as a reward so by definition , any desirable person will have a much higher chance of staying , while anyone undesirable will get shipped to us . 
  personally i firmly believe it is our moral obligation to help those in need but i am in the minority that understands that we are no longer those people and that we should do our best to help others . 
  for the redistribution of refugees to have any prayer of working both they and we need to feel like we 're getting a good deal . 
  they got picked by us rather than rejected by you . 
  we choose these people , rather than have them dumped on us . 
  really ?!, 
  people who share a common cultural background have more in common than those who do n't ? 
  do you honestly not see how homogenous culture is not just in europe , but everywhere ? 
  you have more in common with the average person in a city in china than someone from coastal france had in common with someone from inland france 300 years ago . 
  we have the same clothes , cars , appliances . 
  eat the same food , live in the same kind of houses , listen to the exact same music , watch the exact same movies and tv shows . 
  a few decades back we all turned in to regional flavored ice cream . 
  some were fruity , some were sweet but we were all ice cream . 
  now we 're all vanilla . 
  your arguing that irish toping and english toping and australian toping are more similar to each other than spanish toping is to german . 
  i say , who cares , it 's still all f-ing vanilla . 
  the societies that our grandparents paid for with their blood are dead , long dead , dead and buried and i will bet any amount of money that the wast majority of them would see this nonsense as proof positive that they should n't have bothered . 
  you 're still making the same naive assumption . 
  you think that this exhibition has something profound to say and it does n't . 
  our `` bubble '' is currently the size of the whole planet . 
  people are fully aware that there is a world over dam dar hills and it 's important , but they also know that there 's nothing they can realistically do to change it outside of their immediate vicinity . 
  it takes a special kind of delusion to think that the place to see the shadowy truth of the world is n't in a hospital , a prison , a factory , a school , a dark alleyway or a government building , but in a gallery , in a curated exhibit . 
  this is complete and total bullshit . 
  you 're making an argument so flawed , you need to stipulate multiple times that you do n't mean this or that just to make clear to the reader you have n't fully lost your mind . 
  you write a wall of text that basically states , this exhibit is good , because it might be interesting . 
  it might , but it 's also in horrible taste , and since i 'm a cynic i only see the political equivalent of snuff pornography . 
  attracting those looking to get off on a combination of controversy and a sense of superiority because you , unlike us other mortals , do n't live in small bubbles . 
  you see the world as it really is and if we would just think like you we too could one day hope to join you . 
  the hardest lesson in life is that sometimes things really are that simple . 
  good people died for no reason . 
  the bastards who killed them were deluded assholes . 
  you can discuss it forever and i can guarantee you 'll conclude it 's every other problem under the sun that 's really to blame , from global warming to pandas going extinct just so you do n't have to admit that terrorists are just bad , because that 's what a pedestrian thinks and you 're so much smarter . 
  nothing says progress like treating the violent murder of innocent man , women and children as a teachable moment about the different cultural perceptions of self sacrifice . 
  now i am of the opinion that art should be given lots leeway , but only as long as the artist is `` punching up '' you want to criticize the powers that be , mock and belittle them , satirize and parody them , go ahead . 
  be as offensive and as inconsiderate as you like . 
  explore any idea you want , but this is n't punching up . 
  at best this is the naive and egotistical disregard of others for the sake of their personal `` artistic expression '' at worst , and more likely , this is scandal baiting . 
  getting free press by deliberately doing something outrageous , for the sake of fame and money . 
  there was a time art was revered , but then again , that was a time when art was good . 
  because turkey controls russian access to the open sea . 
  a blue water port has been a russian goal since forever and turkey is in a perfect position to stop them from sevastopol being that port . 
  that 's basically it . 
  strategically convenient . 
  i swear to god , i 'm going to make censoring art a recognized art form just so i can complain that by not letting me censor art , you 're censoring my art . 
  never forgive , never forget . 
  let hatred burn inside you . 
  let it be your light in the dark times . 
  if you have nothing else to live for , live to see those who wronged you fall . 
  forgetting is a privilege of the victors , forgiveness a virtue of the strong . 
  when grass starts to grow on your enemies grave , that is when you forgive their deeds , that is when you forget their name . 
  not what you would call `` healthy '' in the classical sense of the word , but , hey , it works . 
  sure , but reproduction for the sake of reproduction is the ideology of things that do n't want to go extinct . 
  700 million is fine , but what happens if 300million of that is above 60 years old and 200 million is above 45 . 
  what happens when the whole population is old because birthrates have only gone down . 
  everything too top heavy eventually falls . 
  at some point the young will be forced to abandon the elderly to their fate because we are giving them a burden they simply can not carry . 
  there are places in canada where murders are impossible do to a population of 0-1 people , so that 's certainly true . 
  not possible unless you want to kill everyone when they become 50 years old . 
  if you reduce the birth rate the population ages to the point where the system collapses so that angle is a non starter . 
  this only leaves cutting from the top , but people generally dislike death so that 's a problem too . 
  the yanks not caring about optimal yields per acre because they have more farmland than they know what to do with , where as we do care about optimal yields do to spacial constrictions . 
  it 's because the us made it clear that they were backing taiwan even if they permit the chinese to save face by not making it official . 
  the us navy has been conducting naval exercises for decades to prove this very point . 
  they do n't invade taiwan because war with the us would be all but certain , while with hk they had confirmation that the us was not going to intervene and the uk was hesitant to put up a fight . 
  that 's a very big gamble to make . 
  from your end , staying is a bluff . 
  you ca n't hold hk and china knows it and they know you know it . 
  they would need to ask them selves if you could get the us to care enough to go to war over hk after you acted in bad faith and my guess would be that the risk of that is low enough and the reward high enough for them to go forward . 
  the only reason china has n't tried to invade taiwan is that at least for now , such an action is almost certainly doomed to fail , but both the us and taiwanese governments are convinced that the presence , not just the threat of force is absolutely critical . 
  china has proven to be aggressively expansionist and pulling out was almost certainly the best outcome for all involved . 
  mind you , this is how it should be . 
  you ca n't convict someone on the accusers word alone .

  the man made a lot of batshit insane claims/statements , but he was on point about one specific droplet ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx3ezcvj2xa, 
  interesting . 
  though , they should have also asked about the north part of kosovo specifically , which is serb majority , as to whether they would support a conflict of separating it from kosovo . 
   a really nationalist and crazy russian girl uh , the best kind . 
  china has almost no power projection outside its region military wise , they neither have that much interest nor actual ability to fill those vacuums . 
  yes , we are good at something .

  now you are being facetious . 
  a hat is a far better example to compare to the hijab , would n't you think ? 
  because you are using straws and false equivalences so i just responded with the initial and obvious reason why all your blabbering is nothing more than a false equivalence . 
  you actually used a sauna/bathhouse as an example for clothing expectations in an argument tied to a political visit , of a countries politicians , to another country . 
   no , it is obligatory covering of the whole body ugh . 
   this is something we have decided in our culture and values and it is not the same in every country . 
  the women in the image are not in a mosque . 
   go look at some tribes where people are naked or half naked everywhere they go . 
  the women in the image are not in a mosque . 
   germans go to the sauna in mixed groups , totally naked , even with children , the women in the image are not in a mosque . 
   there is quite a range on how we view the human body across the world . 
  the women in the image are not in a mosque . 
   okay , walk into any parliament building in the world with a bikini and see how things play out . 
  you are n't even allowed in restaurants in canada without a shirt . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  you are comparing regular clothing with obligatory covering of the head . 
   put on or take off - what 's the difference ? 
  a major one . 
   it 's still a rule about what someone can wear . 
  imagine if you were forced to wear a hat wherever you went and that you were socially scorned for not wearing it whenever you took it off . 
  ( and even that is not an equal comparison )  i have a jewish friend who was offended when he went into a touristy church again , the women in the image were not in a religious building . 
  choosing a city that never had a serb majority instead of knin . 
  being that much of a failure at banter . 
  ooo flower of scotlaaand ... 
  they are not in a mosque . 
  the false equivalence you presented is pathetic , even with the ** taking off ** the hat in the church . 
  coming from a dude who 's countries capital was founded by foreign sailors . 
  basically every source i ever read on forced conversion mentions firstly the resistance of the catholic clergy and obviously the serb population itself . 
  count into that the fact that the ndh had barely any control over most of the serb populated areas during the war and you run into serious issues of those numbers being correct ( the conversions , not the killings ) . 
  world war 2 in yugoslavia was utter anarchy , with 200 000 croats dead , 300-450\u00a0000 serbs dead , tens of thousands of others , all with four factions in a complete military free for all . 
  this is why i doubt such figures for conversion , especially so after nobody really managed to ( to my knowledge ) find a single catholic that is a result of serb converting after the war . 
  it was all a complete farce from the croat side amidst the circus that was the ustachi movement and government . 
  should n't you be begging for istria instead ? 
  the amount of polandball comics this will produce ... 
  would n't the pineapple on pizza piss off italians even more ? 
  to my knowledge , not a single study actually went into this , the number usually cited is taken out of air . 
  the above figures are serb deaths in total in the whole territory of yugoslavia , that source claims the same in the limits of the ndh . 
  what is that ? 
  that is not a citation of a source . 
  it is also false , as the serb casualties on the whole territory of yugoslavia are stated as 340,000 to 480,000 depending on the source , which includes military casualties . 
  looks basically the same . 
  surreal .

   the question is why do they do it . 
  what conditions lead to this outcome ? 
  because ethnicity means a whole lot more to a whole lot of people than westerners would like to believe . 
  that is why turks/kurds in germany are still turks/kurds and why slovaks and czechs living in croatia for over 200 years are still slovaks and czechs . 
   if you have an exclusionary society , how can you expect integration to succeed ? 
  that is what you get with progressive multiculturalism . 
  nobody is even asked to assimilate , so why would they ? 
  no melting pot , just a bunch of lumps . 
  they do this themselves . 
  i applaud the danes for this . 
   how would you define it ? 
  one defines himself . 
  as you might have read , the issue is 2nd , 3rd generation migrants not identifying themselves with denmark or being danish . 
  if one assimilates into the native culture and declares himself a dane , than he can indeed be considered a dane , however , most of the migrants are not doing that . 
  yes .

  [ implying they would need it ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyx0k4wrelo ), 
  yes , but the original scots are a tribe from ireland that migrated to scotland and overtook the picts , to my knowledge . 
  well , the scots are an irish tribe anyway so why not , 
  technically that would work . 
  if scotland separated and was then immediately annexed by ireland , they would become a part of the eu . 
   with a population larger than any in europe except russia . 
  wow this is true , they doubled their population in 40 years . 
  i thought they were in the 20ish million range not 90 . 
  the usa has nearly 7000 of them , it would be easier getting a couple theirs in some kind of nato trade .

  accepting such a deal is political suicide . 
  if poland says no , the rest of the east and south says no , that deal is gone . 
  you can try and make it ideological , but in reality , people in britain simply fundamentally do n't get the union . 
  you treat it like some kind of monolithic entity with an evil emperor in brussels or berlin , when it 's actually 27 nations with 27 agendas , all of which have a disproportionate amount of power here . 
  no one is stopping you from leaving , but you do n't want to fully leave . 
  you want to renegotiate and feel free to ask china and the us how much fun negotiating with the eu is . 
  any deal needs to be so good , no member can afford to say no . 
  the deal the uk is ready to offer is absolutely unacceptable to over half the members and of the rest , none are particularly enthusiastic . 
  if you want to just walk away your legs are very much in tack , but if you want to make a deal , get some knee pads and lip balm because you 're going to have to kiss a lot of ass . 
  it 's not about winning . 
  it 's about being able to take the pain . 
  the point of the negotiations is to make sure a deal is struck that allows for trade to continue without issue , but the side that can best afford to walk away with no deal is the one that sets the tone .

  wait , why is there a school assignment about making provocative clothing ? 
  i do n't mind students using assignments to do something provocative , sticking it to the man is an important part of becoming an adult , but assigning it seems counter intuitive . 
  if your teacher likes it you obviously did a bad job since it did n't provoke the intended audience . 
  if it was intended to provoke others by means of sharing it on various forms of media , then it 's not a school project , it 's a political statement made from inside a school and should be subject to scrutiny like any other similar statement . 
  this is weird on so many levels .

  companies that want to save money will simply outsource whenever possible . 
  100 % of the workforce is british , but 90 % of the work is done oversees . 
  those that ca n't outsource will make shell corporations to hire the foreign workers and contract them out to the main company . 
  the shell corporation will be a desk , phone and p.o. 
  box and the main corporation will again be 100 % british with foreigners doing most of the work . 
  the only people who will get screwed are those honest idiots who think that just because they have a legitimate need that ca n't be filled with british workers , they wo n't be targeted with by belligerent morons .

  he was never elected . 
  hindenburg made him chancellor and he used that power to first run a massive state backed propaganda champagne , then use the brown shirts to suppress the vote , then simply disband the communist party so that their 10 % of the vote did n't count and finally form a coalition with the prussian militarist party to get a bare bones majority and that 's before going in to the alleged voter fraud going on in nazi strongholds in a addition to all of this . 
  i 'm as mean and nasty to brexiters as they come and you can check my post history if you do n't believe me , but comparing it to the rise of national socialism is simply not supported by the facts .

  what has the echr ever done for us ? 
  sure . 
  that 's the site : http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/malnutrition/by-country/ it looks like something not updated since the 90 's but they sourced the numbers from the who in 2014 . 
  the death rate in greece is 11.2 per 1000 which is 0.4 lower than germany . 
  it was around 9.5 since the 90 's and while it did go up , i 'd hardly call those numbers dramatic . 
  no , it really does n't . 
  greece has a malnutrition death rate of 0.17 per 100.000 citizens . 
  for comparison , the us has a rate of 0.58 and france is at 2.25 . 
  people are not dying . 
  you 're basically comparing breaking a leg with catching the plague , a man made horror that was only rivaled by the genocidal madmen of the mid 1900 's to a few really bad years for the economy . 
  you ca n't compare the crisis in greece to the great depression , let alone the famine , and if you can you 're literally hitler . 
  because the internal political structure of the uk is far from clear cut . 
  the lack of a formal constitution and the transfer of some powers from westminster to local parliaments in ni and scotland create an unclear situation . 
  ultimately , parlament can revoke all powers granted to scotland and ni , but the question asked is , do they have to , because doing so would come at a hefty political cost . 
  these area 's are n't regions . 
  kent for instance , could n't try and block anything , but ni is currently testing if it has a right to veto and if they do , they force parliament to take active action . 
  no one in europe wanted it to happen .

  brussels had a negotiating team and a plan ready 2 days after the fact . 
  the irish surplus could n't even begin to cover the banking losses where as germany can pay up and still be billions in the black . 
  this is a bank , not germany . 
  germany has a budget surplus and that surplus alone is enough to make db whole . 
  the question is n't if germany can , but weather it should bail out the bank . 
  there will be fallout , but if the bank is fundamentally rotten , letting it fail and using the money for damage control is the best course of action . 
  if db fails and germany manages to prevent major harm to it 's people , it sends a very scary message to other banks . 
  fuck up and you die , because there 's no need to keep you alive . 
  the flip side is that the damage ca n't be contained . 
  banks start playing it way to safe , stop loans even for solvent clients and the economy takes a big hit . 
  and ? 
  tradition dictates that those demanding action have a plan in place to execute said action . 
  the leave camp should have had negotiators ready with signed commitments , a list of specific demands , a timetable , you know , the absolute basics any halfway intelligent human would have ready or would demand be ready before voting for it .

  aight , point conceded . 
  though i 'd disagree on your first point - the reason why switzerland can do what albania ca n't is simple : money . 
  i respect your emotional distress , i honestly do , but the dutch have not apologized for srebrenica . 
  they are not the ones to blame for it , of course , but they did not apologize for failing to prevent it . 
  indeed , that video shows non member states , but only those that have already started the membership/negotiations/accession process . 
  of course , the eu has no business promoting states which have not started an application ( i.e. 
  however , my point is that , by willing to * one day * become coextensive with the continent , the eu is sending out an expansionistic message which has * not * been agreed to by non member states who are part of the council of europe , that is , the geographical europeans have never agreed that the eu will one day become coextensive with the continent . 
  or if they have , please correct me , i might be wrong . 
  in that case , a country is given a pretty forceful message from the eu . 
  what are the long-term options for moldova , except for eu membership ? 
  and mind you , i am speaking in strictly non-economic terms . 
  i am aware that a small poor eastern country has slim survival chances this way or that way , but i 'm just asking . 
  as a bosnian ethnic minority , i can confirm that for a dutchman , it does n't really matter what happens elsewhere . 
  ... and rs has not been the most reconciliation-loving peacemaker these last couple of years . 
  * whoooosh !, 
  * you totally missed the point , did n't you ? 
  i do n't care what the * eu 's plan * is , that 's the thing !, 
  the way it is set up , the eu is set to encompass all of the continent in a scary and programmatic way which leaves eastern europe no choice but to join . 
  what eastern country can afford the independence of , say , switzerland ? 
  the us-irish analogy does n't work . 
  imagine canada releasing an ad about the wonders of america . 
  that whole festival was so , so good !, 
  it makes me so , ** so ** sad to see that the eu has abandoned any option of claiming there is a europe apart from the eu . 
  i 'm completely pro-eu , but i ca n't grasp how this can be pushed as an official tourist video and it basically tells foreign nationals that eu27 = europe . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong ( and i very well could be ) , but europe used to be the continent of europe . 
  there 's no definition that could say that moldova is more `` european '' than portugal . 
  nowadays , the expansion of the eu means that if you do n't set your country 's course to join the eu , you basically lose `` membership '' in europe . 
  or am i wrong ? 
  as much as i loved the imagery , i hated the ideology behind it . 
  it 's been less conservative in a modern , political sense of the word , but you 'd be surprised at how * totalitarian * the religious rules were . 
  let 's take sex for an example - everyone knows some tidbit about the freeee and happyyyy gay sex that went on with greece , right ? 
  not only was that a social ritual which meant that you , as a 13/15yo athenian boy , need to be assfucked by some older man for a month , but it was also extremely proscriptive . 
  oral sex ? 
  abominable . 
  anyone found receiving ( or worse , giving ) oral sex faced big problems . 
  and you can find many other examples - corruption ( how do you think they got the money to fund the parthenon ) , bigotry , misogyny , etc , all found its principal excuse in religious stances . 
  i can understand your anger , but let me give you a quick ( and maybe surprising ) lesson : ** disclaimer : i 'm an ancient art historian , also atheist . 
  ** the only reason why we today have the parthenon , pantheon , colosseum , etc. 
  are precisely those christians . 
  first , they turned ancient monuments into churches , thus preserving them far better than if they had been left on their own . 
  an overwhelming ( i 'd guesstimate around 90 % ) of still standing temples are alive because the christians reused them . 
  and they have n't modified much , when they reused them !, 
  secondly , even * legally * , as early as 5th century , the christian authorities in rome made strict laws outlawing any sort of desecration of pagan architecture . 
  of course , the people on the streets would sometimes act otherwise ( which is why many heads on the relief marbles are knocked out ) but the laws were surprisingly `` tolerant '' of the splendor of antiquity . 
  that 's my two cents . 
  please , someone try proposing it to the balkans to join together their foreign policy , security policy , etc. 
  it would n't work . 
  `` just '' as in a couple moths ago . 
  compared to centuries of old laws .

  especially the architecture , i do n't get it at all . 
  let me just comment with the wise words of lithuania 's 2010 eurovision entry , `` eastern european funk '' :  yessir we are legal , we are , though we 're not as legal as you  no sir we 're not equal , no , though we 're both from the eu  we build your homes and wash your dishes ,  keep you your hands all soft and clean  but one of these days you 'll realize eastern europe is in your genes !, 
  not to mention that , if i understood the news correctly recently , slovenia is looking at a pretty shaky year , no ? 
  yes , cause `` greece ii '' would definitely come from a poor , new member , and not one of the founding members like , say , italy ... 
  see , people like you are why we slavs ca n't have nice things . 
  that does not necessarily have to mean much . 
  look at croatia 's numbers through the years : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_european_union_membership_referendum,_2012#opinion_polling because we learned the hard way ( lol ) , our constitution from after the war mandates that from now on , a referendum had to be put out for every time croatia decides to join any other state ( to prevent a third yugoslavia , i guess ) so we had to vote on the eu as well . 
  up until 2-3 weeks before the referendum , it was still very unclear what was gon na happen , with polls ( and mind you , polls only reach people who own telephones t_t ) showing around 50 % support . 
  then , a massive aggressive promotional campaign with the president , prime minister , the foreign affairs minister , the educational minister popping up on the tv every 2-8 minutes telling us to vote yes , and voila , 66 % voted yes on the referendum . 
  unfortunately , i know that it 's not * that * great . 
  at least 1 % of croatian youth is still outright fascist ( advocating destruction of all serbs ) and another 35 % or so is right wing , saying stuff like `` i do n't have a problem with them as long as i never see them and they never come to croatia . '', 
  i will have to find the official poll figures , but it 's quite sad . 
  well , yes and no . 
  most nationalists are morons . 
  serbia and croatia have about the same percentage of them , it 's just that serbia has more people so that 's why you maybe notice them more often . 
  it 's not * great * , but it 's no israel - palestine . 
  a good deal of the under-25s have resumed cultural connections across the borders , so that 's good . 
  you guys wait a sec , we 'll go first and tell you how it goes . 
  i 've always wondered whether people think kajkavian sounds cute . 
  to me , it always * sounds * super childish and adorable , but it must suck not being taken seriously if that 's really the case . 
  we should totes just go to war over this . 
  croatia 's millennial sausage history will not be humiliated this way !, 
  precisely my point . 
  i said reportedly as in `` the official stance of the state '' . 
  culturally indistinguishable , apart from the tiny aspect of * religion * ? 
  dude , i 'm a completely atheistic 22-yo liberal gay croat and even i will tell you that religion structures ( if not creates ) a huge part of croatian culture . 
  my relationship to my family , my free time , my school curriculum , the architecture of my city , all of it has its ties in the religious culture of the past . 
  i do agree with you on language , though . 
  however , in the balkans there is no stand-alone culture fully detached from religion . 
  completely false . 
  here are some facts : 1 . 
  people were reportedly atheistic in yugoslavia until 1990 . 
  since 1990 , both your and my country became * extremely * religious - your orthodox mania is only surpassed by our catholic extravaganzas . 
  now , either people suddenly became fervently religious ** at the moment when an semi-oppressive ( or at least very structured ) regime fell ** , or they resumed their previously tamed religions . 
  if anything , it is the post-yugoslav generation ( of which i am part ) that is markedly , and statistically , less religious . 
  so , last night i went to see sch\u00e4uble speak at my uni yesterday about the future of europe and he talked a bit about enlargment , basically saying that the balkans `` are n't a problem '' . 
  they will , eventually , all join , he said . 
  in the same lecture , he proudly said that there had been peace in europe for over sixty years , `` the longest period of peace in europe in history . '', 
  needless to say , as a croatian , i was immediately offended , and i do feel like i have every right to be , as such a statement implies either that the 140 thousand dead across the balkans are n't europe , or that they do n't belong in history . 
  i was n't * seriously * offended , just a kind of like `` oh . 
  wow . 
  thanks , jerk . '',

  have you seen what is `` antifa '' doing in the us ? 
  what about antifa in germany in the 20th century ? 
  your bias is showing . 
   intellectuals til i am an intellectual if i do not understand economy . 
  or far-left . 
  any `` far '' movement . 
  edit : not far east movement tho, 
  yugoslavia was visited by [ leonid brezhnev ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wpnkl ) . 
  all of the traffic in zagreb had been stopped . 
  my grandparents were in a tram , waiting for more than 30 minutes . 
  suddenly my grandfather turned to my grandmother and said , in a normal speaking voice , `` why do we have to miss our appointments for a hairy monkey '' or something like that . 
  the driver had heard him , left the tram and called the cops . 
  my grandfather was imprisoned for a week and was fined a hefty sum . 
  good times , no ? 
  haha an anonymous board with unlimited free speech wow haha dark side of the internet amirite ? 
  check out the rules of this sub, 
  reading the second part made me feel so uneasy . 
  i had to pause and go for a smoke . 
  the sad things is most people not only in this sub , but in europe are so short-sighted and blisfully unaware of the possibilites . 
  if you state these kinds of thoughts publicly or on reddit you will be called names and labeled racist , nazi et al. 
  aristotle said `` tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of a dying society '' . 
  can you tell me where you got that paragraph from ? 
  they see what they want to see, 
  try harder . 
  you 're becoming stale . 
  your perseverance is outstanding !, 
  love your comment history . 
  / u/foreurope , the `` victim on duty '' of r/europe . 
  / u/wxsted said that * acts * of islamic `` extremism '' are banned , rather than just being a follower of islamic `` extremism '' . 
  acts of ie are usually murders , and murders and banned in civilized countries by default ( meaning not by lex specialis , or any religious law ), 
  this time i posted a reliable article in the english language , as a mod requested . 
  probably a translation error . 
  i really do n't think he meant women will be ** forced ** to wear hijabs . 
  the sad thing is , it 's not an unimaginable question anymore . 
  if someone has a better version please do post it . 
  muh revisionism, 
  radical centrist haha, 
   alt-right `` everyone who sees through my bullshit is a neo nazi !, 
  waaaah waaah it 's just terminology ! '', 
  really cool how you failed to defend your cocky statement ( youre in for a shock xddddd ) and resorted to ad hominem attacks . 
  heheheheheheh i base my political worldview in popular culture references : --------- d le pen is voldemort and macron is harry potter, 
  wait . 
  i 'm confused . 
  you said if someone judges by ethnicity they are a racist . 
  but a racist discriminates by race , not ethnicity . 
  and now you say race * does n't exist * ? 
  can you make up your mind ? 
  maybe stop reading buzzfeed and similar ideology peddling shitty sites . 
  next you will tell me gender does n't exist . 
  who wouldve thunk, 
  ethnicity = race oh man , you have some reading to do . 
  did you remove your comment ? 
   you really think the croats who left and now live in vibrant , exciting cities elsewhere want to come back ? 
  who needs the reality check ? 
  i think i can imagine your worldview when you use common buzzwords as `` vibrant '' . 
   and did n't your country recently bring back some expat croat from canada to fix everything ? 
  how did that work out ? 
  yes . 
  our president is a higher official from nato and a member of a masonic order as stated by her colleague and friend on national television . 
  our prime minister is a bruxelle 's pawn . 
  those are their qualifications . 
  and look how great they 're doing  is n't your diaspora pretty right-leaning anyway ? 
  i thought they all voted to ban gay marriage . 
  that sort of religious bigotry is a terrible way to entice intelligent , creative people to your country . 
  no wonder so many bright young people are leaving . 
  i 'm all for stopping the diaspora from voting . 
  and you talk like an idiot if you thinm that young bright intelligent creative people are leaving because of a referendum to not let gay people get `` married '' but rather have a civil union . 
  notice how i said you sound like an idiot , i did n't call you an idiot because that would be breaking the sub rules . 
   let 's go back to the beginning though . 
  croatia is a mess because of your populist , nationalist , right-winger tudjman thought it would be a good idea to give all the countries wealth to 100 ( 200 ? ), 
  yeah . 
  now you want to double-down on populism and nationalism by closing your borders . 
  good luck with that . 
  the right will just fleece you again . 
  closing borders = populism and nationalism . 
  you 're so bright . 
  all in all , you comment had too much strawmen for me to engage in a conversation . 
  do your research and then ask me to talk to you . 
  just looked it up , marine said banning abortion is not a part of her plan . 
  can you stop pulling stuff out of your ass and actually offer examples to back your point or do you submit to me ? 
  little boy, 
   former soviet country you triggered me for insulting my neighbours . 
  really ? 
  could you link me some sources ? 
  i did n't see or hear anything about mlp or fn fighting against women 's rights .

  what two rich entities are you talking about ? 
  would be more fun if they were ordered by a drunkard from eu to contradict the decision made by representatives of people . 
  i sincerely wish you a good night and do n't forget to drink water . 
  and do n't over-eat tomorrow .

  i too would have plenty of reasons to hate serbs but i do n't give myself that right . 
  i have decided to take other way . 
  ** edit : ** btw . 
  also , spent beautifull times with even more beautifull girl from slovenia in netherland . 
  [ serious ] flair . 
  off topic : in what relations is romania with it 's neighbouring countries ? 
  but i wont beacuse i am familiar with situation in croatia , but not in serbia . 
  also croatia is not in bad relations with neighbouring countries , except serbia . 
  ok , tensions with slovenia are a bit high but when we #finally resolve question of savudrijska vala things will calm down . 
   i have actualy.met people from macedonia . . they in fact do lpve serbia . 
  you see i met few of them too . 
  and read something about their history . 
  serbian historical denying of macedonian culture did n't do much good to their relations . 
  only one thing is curently bring them together : albanians . 
  - `` enemy of my enemy is my friend . '', 
   rrepublika srpska is an internationaly recognozed political enthety and a crutial part of bosnia . 
  to which president is refused visa for usa . 
  and key word is `` enthety '' . 
  which means only one part of a country which you repeatedly `` decreasing '' . 
  it 's name is bosnia ** and hercegovina ** . 
  also , serbs are not bih . 
  croats , muslims and serbs are bih . 
  1 of 3 will can not be 3 . 
   and if i remembre correctly serbia didnt run a train with armed man into hungary . 
  what are you saying that croatia invaded hungary ? 
   both were genocidal maniacs supporded by the croats . 
  and you know that dr. tu\u0111man was `` genocidal maniac '' how ? 
  i am not his big fan , beacuse of other things , and would like to hear you explanation . 
   stop doing it than . 
  seriously , how old are you ? 
  are we discusing or throwing random childish sentences ? 
   we killed our nazis an threw them down pits . 
  antifascist battle against the occupying forces and it 's servents in croatia began before slovenian one . 
  i know that very well beacuse my relative was member of that partisan unit . 
  i am not minimazing slovenian antifa battle but that 's the fact . 
  before that our comunists ( and i belive yours too in slo ) were performing multiple diversion in cities across ndh ( i recommend you series `` nepokoreni grad '' which shows it very well ) . 
  like is ' t not the fact that all croats were ustashe and all serbs and slovenias antifascist . 
  history is not black or white . 
  and no , nobody deserves to end in pit no matter who certian i am that my cause is right and others wrong . 
  that makes you better than the other side . 
   oh but you do . 
  the ndh denial is stron in . 
  may i remind you that you havent payed reparations to this day . 
  you also keep policies and spirit of it alive by debying serbs the right to ther krajina ... 
  it is strong but does not and will not prevail . 
  reparations to who ? 
  ourself ? 
  ndh did n't invade any country . 
  seriously , you in debate about ndh you bring out rsk these ? 
  `` country '' with no historical basis and not a single internatioln recognition . 
  true . 
  but * democracy is the worst form of government on earth except for all the rest what does it mean . 
  *  how about the constant discrimination minoreties face in your country to the point they can not even use their own language ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  probably serbian issue , but which one ? 
   i saw it on tv where was the poloce to beat the shit out of that so called church ? 
  must admit i do n't understand fully this statement . 
  police were there beacause it was ** rally in the center of the capital ** . 
  by our laws , police always monitors or at least give you permision to rally . 
   face it pall you people are nazi sypmathozers from the get go . 
  wrong . 
  it 's like i say `` all serbs are chetnics , all germans are nazis '' or `` all slovenians are bjelogardejci '' . 
  generalising is only one more step to hatred . 
  subject of my last `` stru\u010dni rad '' ( i do n't know how to translate it ; is more than regular seminar , but under scientific work ) in law school were children concentration camps in ndh . 
  my grandfather was non-commisioned officer in jna , and other relatives were in partisan movement . 
  some of them wore title `` prvoborac '' . 
  i think you know what it means . 
  also , i know lot of young people who opose extreme-right politics . 
  not because their political orientation is similar to mine , it 's because they can see the difference between good and potential evil ( if we are talking about current situation ) . 
  what then makes us `` nazi symphatizers '' ? 
  you have something against croats . 
  * it can be seen from an airplane * and i am sorry about that , because sloveans are frequent and welcomed tourist in the croatian region from which i came from . 
  serbia has great relations with only serbian part of bih , so we can rule that ~ ~ country ~ ~ out . 
  macedonia ? 
  do you know anything about macedonian history ? 
  ever met someone from there ? 
  ~ ~ loves serbia ~ ~ hungary is protecting it 's own borders , not aiding serbia . 
  be reasonable . 
  same situation in croatia . 
  but it 's not situation like in baltic states were if you say something positive about stalin people look you differently ( in bad way ) . 
   paveli\u0107 was a military man . 
  you , however voted for dr. tu\u0111man what dr. tu\u0111man had to do with paveli\u0107 ? 
   defaced by croats constantly . 
  you are talking like 4 million croats are going around croatia and destroying exyu named streets and statues . 
  come on man ... 
  the stuff you say is dangerous and toxic . 
  it 's like that you have something against croats . 
  yes there are regions and cities ( victims of war ) which removed exyu street and square names , but for example in istria most of the names and statues are intact . 
  in center of pore\u010d there is still statue of partizan joakim rakovac and mayor 's office is still in streets that holds the name of marshal tito . 
   and that you take responsibility for your crimes . 
  in croatia we have saying : `` prvo po\u010disti u svom dvori\u0161tu . '', 
  you know what it means . 
  our people are opening eyes and facing the truth about horrors that ndh and ustashe commited and we do n't need anyone from outside to remind us on that all the time . 
  ustashe are my shame , not yours so leave it to me . 
  yes , there is minority that are refusing to see to truth about ndh and praise it as `` expression of the centuries-old struggle of the croatian people for freedom '' , but which countries do n't have fascists ? 
  even slovenia had and has them now , however small she is . 
  democracy and freedom of speech has it flaws and can be bitch  recent memorial plate to fascism ceremony in jasenovac . 
  the so-called `` orthodox church of croatia '' rally in zagreb , to name just the recent ones . 
  do you know how many people came the that ortodox christmas rally ? 
  not even a houndred .

  my national tv said 20, 
  so now i voted for hungary , belarus and romania a bunch of times , and i 'll be personally salty if they do n't go through !, 
  especially hungary . 
  the rap at the end was a bit awkward , but otherwise a cool performance . 
  and thankfully not in english . 
  called `` my friend '' . 
  that 's like the definition of forever alone, 
  ohhh come on it 's better than the billionth bland pop ballad i forget as soon as it 's done . 
  if we ca n't get * good * songs ( like [ bosnian lejla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlin3mcsh4 ) for example ) , may as well have fun :p, 
  destiny 's children edit : omg it 's ** child ** !, 
  ca n't believe i forgot o.o, 
  \\  `` well why not ? '', 
  oh , his voice is great , that 's for sure . 
  it 's the rest that i have doubts about ... not just the lyrics , but also how the performance will go . 
  just look at what these idiots did with nina last year  . <, 
  so about our song . 
  ... i do n't even know what to say or think . 
  * yes * , jacques is singing `` my friend '' to himself in two different voices and languages . 
  make of that what you will, 
  haha , i heard . 
  it 's one of the few lists where germany somehow miraculously manages to be even worse than we are , and lord knows we 're lame \\ ^ ^ and yeah , the whole nato thing would be a problem in regards to the eu army project . 
  most of us are in nato , and as far as i know most want to keep it that way . 
  so ... would that mean 4 % total ? 
  or somehow just integrating whatever sad remains are left after the 2 % ? 
  idk . 
  but it 's a common example of a problem , many say that it 'd be * nice and wise * if europe could take care of itself and not depend on usa so much ... implementation , however , is nowhere near . 
  so the basic idea is : everyone and their grandmother can tell that eu is n't properly functioning atm . 
  some want more integration , others want less , and it 's not even entirely split into west vs east , more depends on the particular issues , for example iirc denmark is very much against the euro , while poland for example would want more army-integration . 
  so many of the projects fall though because one or several members perpetually drag their feet , in which case it 's not fair to strong-arm them into something they do n't want , but it 's also not cool for those that would want to integrate further . 
  ok , so far so good . 
  that makes sense , eu needs reforming but trying to strong-arm the reluctant would split it at the seams . 
  but as you say , the picture is n't entirely clear . 
  the 4 freedoms will stay for all , cause they 're the foundation . 
  ** but what about the money ? 
  ** would this lower/slower tier get punished for not being part of whatever project x ? 
  and i do n't mean `` direct '' sanctions , but let 's say that simply , though some time , most of the current eu development funds get redirected towards projects xyz . 
  but more importantly than that ( cause well , if you refuse to be part of whatever project , obviously you wo n't get the money for that project ) , ** will it just be a matter of goodwill ? 
  ** from what i can tell , merkel & co love to coach the issue in gentle terms like `` coalitions of the willing '' . 
  but let 's be realistic for a moment , and imagine that project z needs a certain level of infrastructure , workforce , etc etc , and if you do n't have those , you ca n't be part of it regardless of * wishes * . 
  just a basic example , let 's say the eu army needs 2 % of gdp given to it ... germany has money to spare and can afford those 2 % , we do n't have money to spare , at all . 
  or for another example , the renewable energy issue . 
  well croatia has yet more untapped hydro , solar and wind to put into gear , we 're almost at 30 % now and * i guess * we could go up to 50 % in the next decade ... poland or czechia , not so much . 
  and more examples like that . 
  i do n't think the eu has been very clear about what 2 speed will actually mean in practice , so i 'm withholding judgement . 
  imo it could be salvation for the whole block ... or it could be yet another way to make the divisions in europe not just a fact in practice , but also further * legalized on paper * . 
  it 's all the gastarbeitern !,

  except i just cited `` article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of `` sufficient resources ... not to become a burden on the social assistance system '' . '', 
  i can pack up and go to ireland right now . 
  if i do n't find a way to take care of myself there within 3 months , i 'm done , ireland wo n't pay me benefits , that 's absurd , literally all of our unemployed here would just permanently resettle there if it was true ( they 're an army ) . 
  what actually happens is that people move , try to find some decent job , most find it , but if they do n't , they move back . 
  ( the other option is to be homeless in the streets , and in that case it 's better to move back here into mom 's house . ), 
  permanent residence without conditions applies only after you 've stayed there for 5 years , and you ca n't stay longer than 3 months if you do n't get a job within those 3 months . 
  / u/lookingfor3214 showed an example of another loophole [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6aewiw/swiss_limit_immigration_from_bulgariaromania/dherni0/ ) in any case  you have free movement of people and goods . 
  does n't sound that simple to me . 
  there 's those that work or study or just travel like tourists , and then there are the unemployed . 
  if we equaled people to goods , the workers and students would be the equivalent to wares you sell in supermarkets , the welfare tourists would be closer to ... garbage . 
  i seriously doubt we can dump our garbage wherever in the eu and make the other country take care of it . 
  hm , that assumes that we 'd all share the same concerns . 
  to add us up to the size of germany , you 'd need ... bulgaria , croatia , czechia , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia , slovenia ... also finland , sweden , denmark . 
  that 's roughly equal to germany ( a bit larger ) . 
  to get up to germany + france , you also need to add austria , belgium , cyprus , greece , ireland , luxembourg , malta , netherlands , portugal . 
  the leftovers are spain , italy and poland , large countries . 
  so we could throw out a lot of the smaller fish that i added to the first two lists if us small fish could somehow mobilize spain , italy or poland to fight for our cause ... but then we 're back to the beginning . 
  ca n't help ourselves , begging for someone to intercede . 
  and in any case , many of those on the list are `` europoors '' , including poland ( biggest user of eu funds ) , and spain and italy do n't have a voice compared to france ( even though italy has a similar population to france ) . 
  * in practice * , the big/rich have more right to decide where this ship is going . 
  ( for example , eu council is made of 28 - 27 - `` equal '' members . 
  but my pm is never going to disagree much with what the bigger ones want . ), 
  so this parliament ... the higher representation just makes sure we 're * mostly * powerless in practice , not * absolutely * . 
  ninja edit : i think it 's kinda similar to your electoral college . 
  it started out that way because the `` fly over '' states were scared of the coasts , right ? 
  only unlike the eu , i think you could do away with it now - you 've been a * real * country for centuries . 
  ok , either i 'm too tired to think this late , or something does n't make sense . 
  could someone explain the whole welfare system in regards to the 4 freedoms ? 
  so in the article :  the swiss cabinet was particularly concerned that a high proportion of workers took on seasonal work with above-average unemployment rates . 
  this could result in immigrants working for short periods and then drawing unemployment benefits for the remainder of their stay . 
  ok , that 's a valid concern . 
  but i 've just skimmed the 4 freedoms article on wiki ( free movement of persons ) , in it :  second , article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in another member state , whether economically active or not . 
  ** article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of `` sufficient resources ... not to become a burden on the social assistance system '' . 
  ** articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions . 
  then example :  however , in dano v jobcenter leipzig , the court of justice held that the german government was entitled to deny child support to a romanian mother who had lived in germany for 3 years , but had never worked . 
  because she lived in germany for over 3 months , but under 5 years , she had to show evidence of `` sufficient resources '' , since the court reasoned the right to equal treatment in article 24 within that time depended on lawful residence under article 7 . 
  so this woman that did n't work for 3 years ( ! ) . 
  how come she * was n't * `` a burden on the social assistance system '' , if she was n't working for 3 years in a row ? 
  that 's the definition of a burden , she should n't have been allowed to stay after her 3 months were up . 
  as far as i can tell , the whole free movement thing basically translates to : random tourists etc can move freely , those that stay over 3 months need to get a job , obviously .

   i read somewhere that croatia was offered a membership in v4 early on , but our dumbass government declined it . 
  oh , how [ fun ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ul77s8r.gif ) of our government, 
  yes , they arrived when czechia and croatia were in the same country , austria-hungary . 
  they settled mostly in the strongest agricultural county in croatia . 
  due to the very fertile soil , they bought the land there after the collapse of croatian nobility . 
  so you feel that poland is equally close to slovenia and to belgium ? 
  when i go to another slavic country and i see words that i recognize , i feel much more '' at home '' than in italy or france . 
  maybe i 'm being subjective , but i 'm pretty sure that 's how the majority feels . 
   do you automatically think `` oh those are our people '' yes , but , obviously , i feel the closest to the slavs around croatia and czechs are dear to our hearts for some reason, 
  i do n't agree . 
  slavs have always felt closer to each other than to other groups . 
  yes , but the protests started too late considering all the affairs this government has had since it took power . 
  especially with the pro-nazi minster of culture . 
  i wish we would learn from iceland . 
  good thing the government is counting its last days . 
  yes , we 're known for that . 
  i believe croatia was very much a part of the yugoslav nation . 
  anyway , does n't make much of a difference . 
  nothing and no one can ever stain tito 's legacy . 
  he is the greatest and the most widely respected politician croatia has ever had . 
  i feel no pity for the nazis he killed because i know what kind of horrible things they did to people just because their ethnicity was not correct . 
  fascist regime will never ever be equalized to the communist one , despite the high efforts of certain people . 
  this is my last post because i think further discussion is unnecessary , you can either accept his undeniable achievements or be butthurt about them . 
  that 's true . 
  all of the ex-yu nations should be grateful to him . 
  i did not miss anything . 
  tito is a national hero , despite the nazis he killed . 
  the japanese obviously care , as they asked for an apology from the us and obama . 
  no , i find using nuclear weapon even worse , especially considering that overwhelming majority of the fatalities were civilians , not soldiers like in bleiburg . 
  no one apologized for hiroshima and nagasaki, 
  okay , sorry , i should 've known it 's a very sensitive subject for you slovenes . 
  they 're still bigger than your coast !, 
  croatian exclave separated from the mainland by the ` bosnian riviera ', 
  henry truman threw two fucking atomic bombs on japan . 
  but americans still respect him because he stopped the war . 
  and from the recent news , obama has no plans to apologize for hiroshima and nagasaki . 
  tito is the best croatia had at the time . 
  no , i 'm just gon na agree with you that paveli\u0107 was a horrible leader for croatia and a quisling . 
  making the one who managed to retrieve the lost territories back to croatia - the most competent and the most worthy leader in the recent history of croatia . 
  tito , that is . 
  you mentioned a month-old state . 
  this was 14 years before ndh . 
  our neighbours will agree that it goes well with our personality, 
  https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rimski_ugovori_ ( 1941 . 
  i ca n't even, 
   nazi/fascist croatia was established in 1941 . and those territories had been lost in 1920 . 
  have you ever heard of the roman treaties : https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rimski_ugovori_ ( 1941 . ), 
  croatia is missing . 
  yes , well , having seen the video now , i understand what you are talking about - i have no clue why someone would put an actual carpet on the wall . 
  it 's called tapestry . 
  it was quite popular in europe hundreds of years ago , especially in richer households . 
  today , i think it 's very rare . 
   btw , neighbours , why are these croats `` singing '' in slovene ? 
  i think \u0160e\u0161elj explained it quite well . 
  north-western croats speak slovenian and they belong to slovenia , the rest of croatia speaks serbian and they belong to serbia . 
  same here . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hate ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ us ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 'cause ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ai n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ us, 
  why is everyone so critical about our customs ? 
  some cultures spank their women on easter while we prefer to do some ethnic cleansing . 
  no one is , everyone avoids it . 
  but i hate to always [ remind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtga0jvhp2a ) about our common destiny ... 
  i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  please , anschluss us !, 
  i ca n't believe our plan is working , soon we will be living in germoney !, 
  please , you 're larger than ever on this map, 
  '' god that coat of arms is oversized and tacky ! '', 
  no and no, 
  no , you did n't . 
  you can not into adriatic . 
  to be fair , some croats from the island of hvar eat fried dormice . 
  but to be fairer , they were under italian influence throughout history , 
  because [ hdz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivo_sanader#arrest_in_austria ) . 
  they 're ruling today again , btw . 
  because we 're smart people . 
  error 404, 
  they 're korean , idiot, 
  my grandma taught me that you eat cats ... 
  that 's a huge number of european countries wasting their time and money to ruin movies ... 
  what does the fox say ? 
  he 's croatian, 
  yeah but there is a better chance of changing that by not becoming a presidential dictatorship where the president will just appoint his puppets as prime ministers, 
  well if someone manages to enter second round , then maybe the people will be more motivated to go out and vote . 
  i do believe there will be a second round , all those polls that i have seen do n't seem realistic at all . 
  but who knows , maybe he really is that popular . 
   croatian academy of sciences and arts also rejects this declaration oh , another surprise !, 
  i am shocked !, 
   also overwhelming majority of ordinary croats . 
  source ? 
  or from your head ? 
  i do n't deny that the public is appalled by this , ** but that does n't change the fact that - standard - croatian is just a dialect of a broader language . 
  ** maybe we should change the standard croatian to what it should have always been ? 
  then i would agree with you . 
  of course they wo n't commit a political suicide by saying to balkanian tribes they actually speak the same language . 
   we altogether cherish our croatian language with all grammar and spelling . 
  not me . 
  \\ #freekajkavian, 
  this has literally nothing to do with yugoslavia, 
  ok , ok but they should come up with a different name . 
  * polycentric \u0160tokavian * sounds weird . 
  adriatic ocean best ocean !,

  all the reports and media attention to this issue have not been helpful to us . 
  in fact they have not been helpful to anyone . 
  '' [ 9 ] this still falls deeply into propaganda teritory of milosevic regime untill it is proved otherwise . 
  i believe it is much more hate oriented toward albanians then substituded by concrete evidence as pointed out numerosu times from your linked article from wiki . 
  is there any actual proof and/or court convicton for aalleged `` organ harvesting '' of serbs by albanians or is it milosevic era propaganda still alive today ? 
  but were n't serbs the ones convicted for genocide and ethnic cleansing over bosniaks and croats by international un courts ? 
  who is nazi and who is jew in bosnia , let just see what is going on here . 
  they look like grain silos , spiritual yet economical . 
  also , propaganda with friendly female faces who are in the army/joining army hardly fails . 
  if nothing it certainly helps . 
  do n't worry everybody is doing it . 
  you 're seriously justifying this cunt with some military action 25 years ago ? 
  there is also no mentioning that he is `` refugee '' but it says he was reported to the police several times for domestic violence . 
  how about doing something about widespread black market of automatic weapons sales in serbia ? 
  also brutal murders are not that uncommon in serbia and i am sure that someone would make great social study of why is that happening over there . 
  well now i for one wish you farewell . 
  steer away from those rocks will you ? 
  it is likely scottish will ask for new independence referendum after brexit and this time realy leave . 
  then we have northern ireland joining up with ireland . 
  wales remains but for how long ? 
  this will be bad for england and possibly drastic decline in its political and economic power in the world . 
  welcome to the age of capitalism my russian comrades . 
  those are not happy sausages . 
  oh boy , still fighting about colonies and such are n't we . 
  i really do n't think germany is `` against '' serbia . 
  if anything they have showed repeatedly support for serbia 's eu ascension . 
  there is just so much anyone can do against legally and democratically elected leader . 
  nobody can expect for eu to do work for serbia . 
  change has to come within serbia itself but democratically and gradually with true reforms and with developing of democratic institutions . 
  congratulations to montenegro and for having strenght in making very important and beneficial long term decisions for your own nation . 
  we were n't best of bros in the recent decades but also we as neighbouring states are increasingly sharing common view 's of democracy and prosperity through peace . 
  so montenegro welcome to our nato ranks from croatia and hope to see you soon as eu member state too . 
  suprise , it 's like russia has been ruled as mafia state with head capo and his lieutenants . 
  i am interested though from where is this investigation coming from ? 
  i can not imagine it being from within russia itself , is this guy a dissident or something ? 
  so , you guys are still defending campaign of murder , genocide and expulsion of non serbs from bosnian lands in order to create greater serbia as some kind of righteous ideal serbs fought for . 
  taking that into consideration you `` deserved '' what exactly ? 
  but sadly you are right as you were really awarded with 49 % of the territory for all atrocities done by your `` brave fightings '' from the hills of sarajevo or while entering un protected enclaves . 
  the truth of the matter is that you ca n't sell this shit to anyone outside your now `` cleansed '' territories . 
  facts and evidences with plans of your leaders are widely available from un court verdicts so do n't bullshit us about your wargoals and plans . 
  yep , he was slobodan 's favourite quisling when montenegro was considered staunch serbian ally . 
  they want their military navy acess to the open sea over our marine border while being nasty and totally disregarding international sea laws . 
  it is all the master plan for conquering of the mediterranean by slovenian nationalists . 
  i do not wa n't to meddle with german elections , these are dangerous times and one could be accused of anything . 
  like influencing it 's outcome or something similar , thus changing the course of german history . 
  that is 1,460 days and he has made so much chaos in first ten . 
  good luck anyway , to all of us . 
  its actually not another story since selling it to people would have been hardest part if it werent for serbian rearmament . 
  in this way it will pass much easier with voters who are concerned with other issues . 
  i commend you on your knowledge of internal croatian and balkan policy in general sir . 
  if i may ask , is it your personal interest in the matter or maybe professonal ? 
  you are wrong , those are separate matters and decision has already been made of keeping this ability . 
  funds are non issue when cooperation between nato countries is required and we are not exactly serbia level poor country . 
  yeah , we were looking into purchasing of new or second hand fighters for years now . 
  it is pretty much done deal now after serbia is pulling its russian ties to rearm its army . 
  prime minister and president are supporting the idea and minister od defence even vowed of keeping fighters as his main mandate goal . 
  its matter of national pride now and its easy score with voting base , money will be found . 
  i am sure there are various ways and models for purchasing since we are members of nato . 
  it really depends of eu members , if we are satisfied with results of reforms . 
  ascension to membership is really slow process as we here know from first hand , even if it meets no major political obstacles . 
  i personally have opinion in case of serbia those obstacles might be pretty high from various stances and points . 
  i would like for serbia to become member as soon as it can be possible but process must be thorough with real changes taking roots within serbia . 
  that means political , economical , jurisdicial and if you would like societal which will come as consequence of those mentioned before . 
  still a long time to go but it is in everyone 's interest to have serbia as an ally not as adversarie . 
  even worse if they are * decepticons * who forged deal of overtaking earth with serbia , belarus and rus as our earthly overlords . 
  serbia will not sent troops or police to north kosovo , it 's all play for internal politics purposes as seen many times before . 
  simply because that would lead to fast crumble of current regime filled with ex . 
  milosevic cronies and they know it very well . 
  people of serbia do not wa n't another war they are tired of lost wars but there is enough leverage for nikoli\u0107 and his likes to play against nationalistic sentiments as was now famous `` propaganda train '' . 
  i fully expect more then a few similar stunts in the future with their neighbours till the elections . 
  it has all been drilled till perfection to the point that serbian regime knows exactly how far they can step the line with international community but not to overstep it for more serious consequences . 
  in that way they still can call small victory over state owned media even if they get slapped on the fingers . 
  serbia is `` pillar of stability on the balkans '' my ass . 
  it 's rather powder keg of unresolved/unrealised extreme nationalistic ideologies which lash out regularly towards it 's neighbours . 
  retaliation shall be swift and ruthless , trade embargo maybe ? 
  that should make france collapse . 
  splitting of bih is impossible without war , bosniak 's would never accept it because too much blood was spilled for it . 
  keeping bih together was the main motto of bosniaks during whole war , other entities had different opinions but were forced by usa to sit and negotiate . 
  croatians are the least of the problem here although their status is unsatisfactory . 
  i really do not understand what and who is behind this constant warmongering from serbian side but i bet dodik is not visiting moscow few tims a year for nothing . 
  did n't they learn absolutely nothing from the past filled with misery of people on all sides , genocide , mass war crimes ? 
  i bet dodik has already secured/was given nice little dacha somewehere in russian steppes if poop hits the fan . 
  in our hospitals mothertruckers have got `` independent '' leechers who are renting tv-s ( daily , weekly , monthly ) so you have to pay for someone to come and turn tv on . 
  giggled more at afrika , as in entire continent . 
  tis ' better today , yesterday and the day before tho it was fun . 
  merry christmas mexico !, 
  serbia signed what was necessary , it 's not the first time nor will be the last time . 
  let 's move on into greener pastures and open new chapters . 
  our serbian friends need to understand this is a process , it will last for a while longer . 
  * romania has spent eur 628 million for the f-16 program . 
  the price paid to portugal for the aircraft was about eur 120 million while the rest was the cost of upgrade and logistic support . 
  * over 500 mil eur for upgrades and spare parts alone seems to me a bit excessive . 
  did nato participate in costs in some way maybe ? 
  helping with infrastucture at least ? 
  since we have to replace our own vintage airplanes , this is interesting read as we are probably going the same path as romania . 
  it 's not like we have a lot of options without decent ammount of money for new airplanes anyway . 
  meaning second hand usaf f-16 airplanes with additonal upgrades to better equipment standard , hopefully block/50 -52 . 
  here it is in 2 parts since it can not fit in one post . 
  continuation from part 1 : almost every state has recently experienced serious unrest as people lose faith in the power of the eu to deliver them from their current state of hopelessness , poverty , and corruption . 
  adding to these tensions , minorities are trying to take control of their destiny by demanding the right to a separate territory in countries where the central government inevitably prioritizes the interests of the majority group .

  we have [ our own eltz castle ] ( http://www.turizamvukovar.hr/slike/sadrzaj/2015_11_12_81_61616148_b.jpg ) in vukovar . 
  of course there is significant difference in quality and design of products of the same brand for western and eastern market , as usual , so germans got fairy tale gothic type of castle on the hill , while here we have boring flatland oversized house type of castle that reeks of `` i could n't make it more dull '' approach of the architects . 
  sometimes you just have to cancel your plans for evening and read a dozens of wiki articles about medieval slavs it seems . 
  i suppose in medieval times you take what you can get when democracy is concerned . 
  certainly it was more democratic than after moscow conquered it . 
   republic of novgorod  democracy was n't novgorod some sort of aristocratic republic with well established families taking turns in key positions of government ? 
  nonetheless , it is a city with a fascinating history . 
  and what exactly would you qualify as racist there ? 
  probably . 
  but racist ? 
  come on . 
  it could indeed . 
  title suggests he swam half of mediterranean and whole of adriatics just to drown in venice . 
   italian media said mr sabally had residency papers for italy and had sailed from africa two years ago oh . 
   at least three life rings were thrown into the water near him , but he did not appear to reach for them , raising speculation he wanted to kill himself . 
  really , keep using the term `` racist '' in situation like this one and it wo n't be long until we will need to invent a new word for actual racists . 
  you lead !, 
  it 's been a long day . 
  so if a pole who works there and pays the taxes and contributes to nhs gets sick , he should , as a non british citizen , do what ? 
  go to poland ? 
  try to not get anschlussed this time . 
  seriously , do n't get me wrong , but austria might have bigger problem on the horizon than stalinism or russia . 
  i 'm aware of that , i 'm asking him as a finn , to my knowledge they are n't part of nato . 
  why would he care about new potus nato policy , or suggest some scenario , when even non nato finland spends less than 2 % of their gdp on defence . 
  why would you care about nato members defence spending ? 
  it kind of is , but effects were n't so long lasting as in rest of eastern europe . 
  you can not into balkan . 
  we are full , sorry . 
  i 'm just interested in line of reasoning where being part of yugoslavia for 70 years , which left almost no traces , except maybe in socialist architecture - and even that is n't part of `` balkan image '' - matters more than 1000 years in holy roman empire . 
  what traits do slovenia and i. e. macedonia share ? 
  getting your ass kicked once does n't qualify you as a boxer . 
  what you basically say is that slovenia belongs to balkans because it 's inhabited by speakers of south slavic language . 
  it is n't even matter of `` belonging '' , more of pattern recognizing , and slovenia just does n't fit in balkans . 
   historically you 're part of the balkans care to expand that a bit ? 
  was it part of byzantine or ottoman empire ? 
  what does `` historically part of balkans '' even mean ? 
  did slovenia took part in balkan wars or what ? 
   geographically it 's a stretch since you 're at the very edge but it is n't a stretch to consider it part of balkans . 
  interesting . 
  yeah , no . 
  still , a very good show . 
  what about mother ? 
  no pay for space station , no photo . 
  they make baby jesus cry . 
  he was from somewhere in dalmatia ( which was bigger than modern region of the same name ) , probably of illyrian background , although heavily romanized since romans conquered that area couple of centuries before . 
  illyrian kingdoms were contemporaries of alexander the great and roman republic , today modern albanians are closer to them than croats really , i. e. linguistically speaking ; genetically every people that lived here left some material , so our heritage is rather mixed . 
  when slavs settled this area , western roman empire was long gone , but you still had basically roman cities on the shore under formal sovereignty of eastern roman empire , a. k. a. byzantium , walled and defended . 
  it took centuries to mix newly arrived slav barbarians and civilized city folk . 
  cities were more prone to epidemics and sack , city dwellers had less children than hinterland half barbarians , so with time population became more and more slavicizied and croatized . 
  in that sense one can say we fixed their demographical problem , yes . 
   did n't they let barbarians settle within their borders that was more a symptom and consequence than cause . 
  it was because of internal turmoil in late 3rd century that northern limes was left virtually unmanned , which basically opened the empire to barbarians , although not immediately to the fullest . 
  nice part of european nobility claimed some relation to charlemagne , and there were times when noble knights sired bastards all around the place , so i would n't really be surprised if there were really millions with charlemagne as their ancestor . 
  i agree , it 's just that i thought more about famous people descendants , i. e. emperors and such . 
  funny thing is , he may even be , but we have no way to prove it . 
  i mean not just commodus , there has to be significant number of modern people whose ancestors are famous , considering a treatment of conquered women and some slavery related sexual practices . 
  genome was spread much wider than official way enabled ( i. e. through marriage ) . 
   it was the migration that destroyed them and of course they became to lax when it comes to their army and will to fight the moral was low more complex yet . 
  mentality played significant role in demise of the empire , sure , but shift was slow and lasted a couple of centuries , and it was influenced by politics , economy , diseases and disasters . 
  one could argue that elites became complacent maybe , but that is really hard to measure scientifically . 
  every comparison with modern situation is , however , very limited . 
   is it though , why ? 
  i do n't know , it echoes modern spread of certain intolerant ideology in rather tolerant part of the world . 
  i think you oversimplified entire process a bit . 
  roman society of 3rd century was a troubled one , and christianity seemed to offer some solutions , otherwise it would n't succeed , regardless of imperial will . 
   inclusive and tolerant i do n't think they were especially tolerant in modern sense , it is just that exclusivity as we know it today just did n't exist yet . 
   they allowed the existence within the empire of cults that sought the destruction of all other ideas , mythologies and ideas and their forcible replacement by their own moronic brand of worship this sounds parabolic a bit . 
   jackasses who threw it all away it 's not like they woke up one day and said `` fuck this shit , i 'm going tribal , and to hell with infrastructure and civilization . '', 
  support for eu membership has nothing to do with cooperation between polling institutions unfortunately . 
  that would be nice . 
  you rarely measure a country without its heart . 
  almost same is true for us and slovenians . 
  i would n't gloat too much . 
  thanks merkel ? 
  well , yemen would catch a break i suppose , nepal is mountainous so there really is n't any change , laos is still almost landlocked , and montenegro finally gets people with skin colour that goes with the country name . 
  however , it seems map is flawed , at least when croatian and serbian gnp is concerned . 
   serbien i hope whoever made this giggled a bit . 
  this submission and most of the thread is so wrong on so many levels . 
  well i think that is a common knowledge , opportunism of large percentage of migrants that is . 
  i mean you can find that refugees crap in the news outlet here and there sure , but they are fooling no one any more , not really . 
  now if you count as refugees people who come from the countries with active hostilities , i bet even there you can find not a small number of individuals who are n't actually from the area exposed to war . 
  those need to be filtered too . 
   camps in southern europe where potential refugees are held and there is your problem right from the start . 
  you do n't make such a facility in the mediterranean , you build it somewhere with fog and swamps and cold and rain , and generally miserable weather . 
  those who really need refuge would n't mind . 
  well if a bear ate you and consequently shat you after it , and you spent some time being a part of that shit before you manage to free yourself again , then it takes considerable amount of time for everyone to forget you were indeed once a part of foeces . 
  and nobody calls the bear a part of shit because he eats what he wants and shits where he wants , because he is a fucking bear and he can . 
  also is heavily armed and nuclear . 
  while technically correct , in the last 10-15 years it does n't mean a crap . 
  if someone today feels uneasy because of terrorism you can be sure he does n't picture mildly suspicious looking septuagenarian veteran of ira or raf as a source of threat . 
  certain demographics is more prone to terrorism and specific type of crime , you can mask it however you want but it wo n't make a difference until certain facts change . 
  get help , seriously . 
  i 'm hardly a fan of current eu immigration policies , but  italy 's migrant centers are run by cooperatives based on government contracts . 
  several of them already faced criminal probes for corruption and fraud . 
  maybe that `` europe '' they are facing is n't the best one . 
  i mean `` government contract '' is almost a byword for `` theft of tax money '' in certain parts of europe , and i doubt italy is n't part of that special club . 
  so maybe if you take some obligations , and your tax payers give you money for it 's implementation , then do the job way it should be done . 
  well if families of the victims get some closure then i guess it can never be to late , but this kind of stuff always has some political background unfortunately . 
  and there is always `` but what about * our * victims in _____ '' . 
  if they are gulity of course .

  and pretending you do n't understand english ? 
  and you anschluss the beaches in early mornings !, 
  the tax-haven bullshit is also not very nice , so much about `` our common interests '' . 
  and you messed up the migrant flood !, 
  and that nigel farage , how can you not be embarrassed by him !, 
  & nbsp ; you get my drift ? 
  news : `` eastern eu making trouble again ! '', 
  facts : it 's v4 . 
  or not even v4 , but hungary and poland alone . 
  so , to make it fair , should n't you , an italian , * do something * about uk 's strange life choices ? 
  + laziness , you toss the colors in mapchart or wherever , though even that sometimes takes time , because countries often do n't care about putting themselves in neat boxes + too many small states - between poland and greece , also benelux , gets hard to write out the numbers sometimes, 
  i figure italy would get salty about istria again , so maybe better not :3, 
  [ so it is :3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6k1bkd/monument_to_potato_in_me%c4%91imurje_county_croatia/ ), 
  [ tell me about that purity , will you ~ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gll0m9y.png ), 
  because croatia is considered eastern when it comes to simple east/west divisions ( you * might * argue that we 're central or southern , but nobody will ever say we 're western ) , and you lot are more to the east than we are . 
  the problem starts with russia being so huge . 
  if you divided europe in even boxes , the center of europe would end up being in poland . 
  or even belarus . 
  and nobody thinks that some parts of poland or belarus are `` actually western '' . 
  but if italy and ottomans and napoleon do n't count , how does serbia count then ? 
  wait , what are you even counting for serbia ? 
  90 's annexation of bits ? 
  ( that 's the same as venice and ottomans . ), 
  sfry should n't count at all . 
  or are you talking about yugoslavia1 , when king established his dictatorship , dismissed the parliament ? 
  wait , but yugoslavia1 ceased to exist , is there anyone who even `` inherited '' it ? 
  i think the problem is something similar to the dialect continuum when it comes to language . 
  ( as in , slovenians will mostly understand the kajkavian speakers , similar goes for the south/east parts of serbia and macedonians ( i think ? 
  ) , while slovenians and macedonians do n't understand each other . ), 
  just on our example , coast is closest to italy , north-west to slovenia/austria , slavonia to hungary but also vojvodina , but then the other parts of serbia ... not so much . 
  bosnia is its own story , split on 3 or more lines . 
  then going with the continuum , i seriously doubt that slovenia is somehow closer to/more influenced by macedonia or even serbia than it is by austria . 
  macedonia is closer to bulgaria ( and pretend-greece ) than the rest of us . 
  we have the food we `` borrowed '' from turkey . 
  and ex-yu rock , i guess . 
  and endless arguments . 
  except even those do n't work for everyone , montenegro seems to get along with all . 
  other similarities , like the difficult transition to capitalism , i listen to the rest of ex-commies and it 's the same thing repeating almost everywhere . 
  besides . 
  the biggest `` cultural influence '' all of us share is n't each other , but usa . 
  sigh . 
  it 's just frustrating . 
  balkan as a geographical term is just that , only geography ( though vaguely defined ) . 
  problem is the very negative stereotype , which no-one sane wants for their country and people . 
  yes , i did hear stuff about the criminals from multiple western countries , but the thing is - they were n't * ours * ... 
  i do n't even hear anything about our gastarbajter , unless it 's `` there are a lot of them '' and `` they receive less social welfare than even the native germans '' ( i do n't have anything for netherlands ) . 
  and i 'm about as responsible for these criminals as you are for the french striking and pretending not to understand english . 
  or brits brexiting . 
  you get my drift ? 
  you would n't want to be lumped in with someone else 's shit either . 
  especially if you 're a small country where reputation matters a lot . 
  our politicians choosing who will rule , first with hungarians and then with habsburgs ? 
  varying degrees of autonomy , dependent on circumstances ? 
  [ tesla 's passport ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/putovnica_nikola_tesla_01082.jpg ) well , that works for croatia , i 'm not * that * informed on slovenia . 
  i assumed you concluded it was n't that bad in retrospect , because of the - let 's say , favorable - opinions on austria that today 's slovenians display . 
  ( favorable is putting it lightly . ), 
  my bad . 
  we did n't do nuffin russia told us red-white-blue are a totally legit slav thing now that 's my story and i 'm sticking to it, 
  i have my opinions on that bit of whining . 
  yes , we have it too , narrative about `` hurr durr 1000 years ' dream of independence '' . 
  that narrative was established mostly in the 19th century , during the nation-building that happened everywhere - go figure . 
  i hold that you * do n't * stay in a union with someone for 800 years ( !, 
  ) , with hardly a rebellion to speak of , if it 's `` help help i 'm being oppressed ! '', 
  and i have something to compare a-h with , venice and ottomans annexing our bits . 
  there were rebellions and wars concerning those `` every other tuesday '' . 
  came here to be criminal ? 
  seriously ? 
  keep dividing every year ? 
  again , which ones ? 
  yeah , i know many of us speak the same language so it gets harder to tell the difference , but that 's no excuse . 
  irish and brits speak the same language , but try to tell them they 're the same or put them in the same box , see how well that goes . 
  and that 's our problem with these `` balkan '' generalizations . 
  everything you said for greece is true for most of croatia . 
  if we can go to the effort of not lumping * belgium * with netherlands or france , then really ... 
  ah , i hear you , but i still think a lot of these divisions are arbitrary cold war - that is , commie and not-commie ones . 
  slovenia and croatia spent 800 years in some version of union with hungary/austria ( and bits were occupied by venice/italy at times ) , and were catholic which meant they were culturally turned towards rome . 
  while the rest were turned towards constantinople , and spent time under ottomans . 
  you can see * that * border on croatia 's modern borders . 
  and yet , we 're grouped with balkan and ex-yugos because of only 73 years of yugoslavia . 
  which was n't even in any block during cold war ... it 's just because of the commie-thing . 
  people jak about `` culture '' , and yet zagreb looks more like vienna than skopje . 
  greece is as geographically balkan as it gets , if there 's any country that ca n't escape from balkan , then it 's greece . 
  yet they 're not called balkan . 
   my point - to reiterate - was that it matters what politicians do , as you can clearly destroy progress in war or through disastrous economical policies . 
  happy ending is not guaranteed . 
  oh , sure . 
  to expand a bit ... 
  i do n't know if bulgaria has anything like that , over here we have these `` yugonostalgics '' . 
  people who argue that the old system was n't that bad , or was actually better in some ways . 
  ( looking at how we lost worker 's rights after the fall of our communism , they do have a point . ), 
  and among the many arguments is `` well , look at all the industry/etc etc that was built '' . 
  and i think giving a lot of credit to tito for that is a fallacy , because industry was coming - would have come - anyways . 
  obviously , politicians do n't like to talk like that , you wo n't find them saying `` well , this recovery would have just happened '' , nooo they 'll take credit for everything that 's good . 
  and i feel like something similar might be happening in the west . 
  i also feel that if we 'll look for politics doing a lot for science , then we need to go way back , to the time where patents/copyrights for inventors were established . 
  that might be the more relevant turning point . 
  but back to your point about war ~ yes , obviously war destroys progress . 
  but i 'm not sure how having only one power , or having multiple powers affects that . 
  did we avoid wwiii because of politics , or because of * nukes * , which are again a technological invention ?

  what 's happening with the source-countries atm is the equivalent of our baby boomers . 
  kurzgesagt gave a good tl ; dr of the process [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsbt5eqt348 ) . 
  and in any case , falling fertility is a good thing long-term . 
  we consume far too much , and with the growing robotization , we wo n't even need that many kids to do the same jobs to keep our standards of living . 
  and if the picture does n't turn out to be that cheery , i suppose the first thing that 'll happen will be the 3rd world war for resources . 
  or roboapocalypse . 
  demographic/cultural changes are a distant-ish 3rd concern imo . 
  and if they do happen , well over here we did the same to the native illyrians ... similar goes for most of europe . 
  whether that was a good or a bad thing is up to debate , no ?

  iirc in the latest presidential elections , he won with curious tactics . 
  vast majority of the tv-pr was for him ( he was pm at the time ) , some 300k ( or some number like that ? ), 
  of * dead people * voted for him , him and the state employ a lot of useless/poor people in state jobs , so they get a loyal army of voters and internet-bots , country keeps sinking/stagnating , but the loyal army stays , and on and on it goes . 
  he 's otherwise well-supported by the west/the eu because he gives them cookies in the form of cooperation regarding kosovo . 
  he 's pretty good at pr stunts . 
  [ exhibit a. 
  ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/kolinda_fah_210620161.jpg ) ( that 's our prez . ), 
  i mean , for the clueless , that looks like an awkward dweeb trying to hit on the prom queen . 
  so adorkable . 
   `` when lithuania sends its people , they 're not sending their best '', 
  well for what it 's worth , eu does n't get extremely involved with local politics much , i mean the most they send is sharply worded protest letters for orban & co. 
  the only times they were * moderately * firm is with turkey recently , and from what i hear , vu\u010di\u0107 still has ways to go before he 's full erdogan . 
  do n't get me wrong , yeah i also think merkel & co should be more lukewarm in their support for vu\u010di\u0107 , but - the only country i see joining around 2020-ish is montenegro , and they 're so small when added to eu that they fall under `` statistical error limits '' . 
  if vu\u010di\u0107 has enough clout/will to resolve kosovo , yeah he 'll be tolerated . 
  it 's shit , but the west has been invested in kosovo for far too long to let it fall back into serbia at this time . 
  would make everyone involved look bad . 
   kako to ? 
  hm , i just looked up the stats . 
  our gdp per capita in 2000 was 4919 usd , by 2013 , our date of joining , it rose to 13 574 . 
  your gdp per capita is currently 5 396 usd . 
  so ... that 's 13 years :d except - at the date of joining , romania was at 8 214 and bulgaria at 5 932 usd . 
  so you do n't even have to theoretically wait another 13 years , resolving the chapters - corruption etc - plus the situation with kosovo should be nominally enough , if you raise your gdp per capita some more . 
  theoretically you could get there in 5 years , as long as there 's will on both sides . 
  ( for skepticism on the side of eu , your population is n't so large that you 'll create another massive wave of `` dey took our jerbs '' or a hole in the eu funds . ), 
  well sure , but that 's because the levels of unemployed/poor are still `` acceptable '' . 
  once you get half of the eu/japan/china working age people without a job , you 'll have riots and revolutions . 
  or not half , maybe third . 
  the owners ^ tm are aware that you ca n't actually build a wall against 99 % of the people ( if for nothing else , then it 's because they love to travel and * be admired * by us lesser creatures ) . 
  so , the capitalism as we know it will have to give , it 's not a question of if , but of when . 
  ( or else we have another great migration period because of the climate change + another world war for resources , but in that case you and me are probably gon na die anyways , so * whatever * . ), 
  that stopped being a comfort a while ago ... besides , you lot have room for improvement . 
  more of it that we do , anyways . 
  basically post-2000 the one and only goal/hope was that eu will pick us up ... except . 
  as workers we 're not as cheap as romanians for example . 
  ( and a lot of large industry moving towards china & etc is a given . ), 
  we also do n't have a lot of people ( like romania and poland ) , so we 're not even profitable for large industry that needs a lot of people . 
  we also ca n't and wo n't get immigration of cheaper workers to pick up the production - because obviously those target germany , ireland etc. 
  so we have brain drain , no way to drain someone else , our producers are barely keeping afloat under all the taxes & etc , those taxes exist to lower the state deficit , the other way of lowering the deficit would be firing all the useless paper-pushers working for the state , but that would hurt our politicians - those are the always loyal voters . 
  not gon na happen . 
  we ca n't even devalue our currency cause we have large private and state debts in euros/dollars/etc . 
  we 're basically stuck . 
  does n't serbia at least still have a respectable amount of industry in gdp ? 
  if you manage to keep that for the next , idk - 10 years ( ? 
  ) , you could position yourself as the `` new romania '' , for a starting boost . 
  yes , we are stagnating , very badly . 
  we were stagnating - no , actually falling apart - in the 90 's . 
  and the late-ish 80 's were an economic disaster too . 
  in fact , in the last 30 + years , we maybe had 4-5 good years of growth in the earlier 2000 's , only i seem to remember that a lot of that increased industry , consumer spending etc was - tourism getting back on track ( so , back to the 80 's levels ) , big construction projects ( that do n't last forever ) , and state and private borrowing ( which is now coming to roost ) . 
  that does not make us `` a shithole '' . 
  [ another example .

  western europe is amazing , decades ahead of us . 
  that does not make everything between western europe and shithole africa `` a shithole '' .

  and it does n't help that the non-socialist - right-wing - is actually mostly a kleptocracy . 
  the difference is that they seem to take more loans , buy more social peace/voters etc ( yes , our right wing is somehow more social than our left wing , it 's stupendous ) . 
  so you have a nation of middle aged and old people ( youth are either demotivated/lazy or leaving for greener pastures , with some few-ish exceptions ) who are prone to voting for the robber barons of right wing , cause that same right wing won us our independence . 
  the fact that they did nothing good since then ... seems less relevant to voters because once the left wing got in power 2011-2016 , they also mostly did a load of nothing . 
  the only government of the last 25 years that i 'd grade as `` maybe somewhat good '' was the same left wing in early 2000 's ... problem is , that pm is literally dead . 
  nowadays they 're lead by an autist , and i think that might be an insult to autists . 
  oh , and we also tried a macron-lookalike 3rd party in the last two elections . 
  they promised a lot , also mostly did nothing .

  greece has already been a basket case economically , italy was pretty unstable too . 
  they ca n't handle the hordes they have at them moment , and the `` solutions '' from all the rest of us have basically boiled down `` yeah idk what to do either , could you catapult them elsewhere , anyways la la la it 's not my problem '' . 
  so as to not have greece and/or italy economically imploding again ( or just bussing their hordes to the border , in a reenactment of 2015 , where most of us did that ) , germany and co are just now trying to `` catapult them elsewhere '' . 
  we ca n't handle greece imploding again .

  i wonder how they 'd feel about `` vardar macedonia '' . 
  northern/upper and such directional qualifiers remind me of usa states , plus they 're not very creative imo .

  italy is a weird one .

  they also have strong naval traditions . 
  it 's pretty amazing how overlooked they are in the eu . 
   does n't seem to match up with their size and defense obligations . 
  60 million people . 
  8th largest economy in the world . 
  4th largest in the eu . 
  italy also has two functioning carriers . 
  and three amphibious transport docks . 
  that 's 5 flat tops in its service , the most in europe . 
  the british pound is down and inflation is up : this signals danger ahead for the bank of england and u.k. banks . 
  more than three months on from the brexit vote , the first hard data showing a slowdown in lending is emerging . 
  banks will give more details with third-quarter numbers from next week . 
  so far , the u.k. 's decision to leave the european union has pushed up some defaults and added pressure on profits , but the bigger risks of rising credit problems still hang over the sector . 
  in the past three months , defaults on unsecured consumer loans have suffered the sharpest jump since the second quarter of 2009 , according to the bank of england , but this has n't spread to other types of lending . 
  however , more problems are likely over next year and beyond due either to rate rises or higher living costs and a slowing economy . 
  the u.k. 's major vulnerability post-brexit is its reliance on foreign investors to fund its yawning current-account deficit . 
  if foreign investors flee , the pound will fall further and yields on u.k. government debt rise , while sky-high property prices would take a hit . 
  analysts believe an interest-rate increase to attract investors and defend the pound would be the last resort for the bank of england . 
  such a move could cause an increase in defaults among highly indebted u.k. consumers , especially recent home buyers in london and the southeast . 
  there are hopes this wo n't happen because the falling pound will shrink the u.k. 's current-account deficit , which stands at 6 % of gdp . 
  but this wo n't be achieved by normal avenues of higher exports or because the country attracts safe-haven flows . 
  u.k. exports compete on quality not price and the pound has n't historically behaved like a haven currency . 
  what should help in the near term is the international investment position , where the fall in the pound will lift the value of overseas assets and income . 
  a 20 % decline in sterling could cut 2 percentage points from the deficit , according to morgan stanley , though that is predicated on a eurozone economic recovery . 
  the rest of the economy already has higher input prices for manufacturers and higher food and energy prices for everyone , which hurt . 
  the other short-term impact of brexit is lower demand for credit across the board , according to the bank of england . 
  some banks have seen commercial loan demand recover during september , but do n't know how sustainable that will be . 
  the summer interest-rate cut has helped the economy but at the cost of bank profits . 
  for banks , the really damaging risk of foreign capital flight and a current account crisis probably remains an extreme one . 
  but the broader slowdown and pressures on consumer income that will make life harder for borrowers is under way . 
  even in this relatively positive scenario , banks come out losers . 
  they are too lazy to type anything into google . 
   i do n't see why they would drop the pound as a reserve currency it 's losing value . 
  and it will continue to lose value long-term . 
   take 15 % off of the workers wages . 
  pound already did that . 
   but admittedly we do have some common cooperative experience producing warships ( including modern ones like aquitaine/bergamini ) horizon class frigates are also joint italian and french project . 
  british type 45 destroyer came from that same project , but brits needed bigger ship so they left . 
  european navies have too many types of frigates and other ships with r&d costs way too big to build just 3 , 4 or 5 ships in a class . 
  spain , italy/france , the netherlands , germany , denmark all developed a class of modern frigates . 
  and all are fucking expansive because they needed to do all r&d alone . 
  in the end , even if uk manages to get `` soft brexit '' ( and i am sceptical ) it will still be in a worse situation than now . 
  it just does n't make sense . 
  weird , just weird . 
  it will never make sense to me . 
  i know . 
  i just do n't understand how can anyone think that quitting the wealthiest free trading area in the world would be good for economy . 
  that was the thing that really bothered me even before the referendum . 
  just look at car industry in uk . 
   about 78 % of the cars built in uk factories in the first half-year were destined for other countries , with the eu the biggest market . 
  hmmmmm ... that would mean accepting freedom of movement and paying into eu ? 
  making this whole shitshow a lose-lose for uk ?

  i just love how right wingers here ( after destroying the economy ) are trying to stir nationalistic agenda because they are fucking clueless on economy and have no fucking idea what to do other than borrowing money and spending it for a cut . 
  and people buy that shit . 
  infuriating . 
  maybe to get land rich in albanians from serbia ? 
  southern serbia has few places bordering kosovo with albanian majority . 
   i highly recommend budapest/prague/berlin for part of your journey . 
  the three cities are easily accessible by train , affordable , historic , and a great time . 
  southern spain is also beautiful , affordable , and fun , but it 's super hot in the summer . 
  since he 'll be coming in the summer , i would suggest going to the coast . 
  it 's a few hours drive from budapest to adriatic and there are some really nice places on croatian coast . 
   people roaming around , killing and pillaging is not what i would call civilians . 
  i would call them criminals and i feel that we caught and brought to justice far too little of them , in the end . 
  agreed . 
  it was n't really encouraged , but no prosecutor ever prosecuted war crimes on our side , so it was more or less allowed . 
  highest ranking officials knew what was happening and they kept silent . 
  i do thin tu\u0111man should have faced war crime charges . 
  \u0160u\u0161ak even more , \u0160eks , glava\u0161 , mer\u010dep ... norac ...  while i understand that such things always happened and still do ( look at syria ) this is actually one of the things that needs to change . 
  people doing such things need to be punished instead of being celebrated as war heroes . 
  when you have bishops claiming you ca n't do war crimes in a defensive war there is a lot that needs to change . 
  maybe if we could just let others do what they want and stop shoving religion / ideology onto other people . 
  i really do n't want some religious idiot deciding what i can and ca n't do ... or an ideologue . 
  if you take a closer look , religion and communism were the same thing , even their hierarchy and dogma were mostly copy-paste . 
  it all boils down to controlling the people with fairy tales while living on their expanse .

   ) )  propaganda sux - i agree with that it sucks when you see people buying it . 
  it does n't suck for those who abuse it , it allows them to achieve their goals . 
   americans also suck , even though they do n't see it alot of the time i just do n't understand how they get so scared all the time . 
  and their media is awful ... all that screaming and shouting , like they are in a saloon in wild west . 
   nationalism ! = patriotism - i do agree we had to stay and fight ; i do support the idea of oluja and bljesak , but not necessarily the way it was implemented in practice ( driving around and shooting civilians ) actually ... civilians were killed after both operation when the control loosened and when you got all kinds of people roaming the territory , some trying to steal , some trying to settle old accounts . 
  both oluja and bljesak were executed really well and our main fighting force were guard brigades ( gardijske brigade ) , professional soldiers trained by americans and they were really top notch . 
  but as they moved to bosnia ( specially after oluja because we had to liberate large parts of bosnia as well ) local troops came and started doing crimes . 
  that 's when most crimes happened . 
  you had similar thing happening in ww2 with russians . 
  their front units were top notch , but what came after them raped and stole and committed a lot of war crimes . 
  there were even stories of russian front line soldiers from elite units warning german women to watch after they leave because what is coming behind them is a nightmare . 
  you are not understanding what is said . 
  it 's not normal and that 's why it took a long time to get to war . 
  reason has nothing to do with this ... it 's how people react when being bombarded with propaganda . 
  when the fuck did i say there is no guilt on our side ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  what were we supposed to do when they started to roll tanks and put blockades on roads ? 
  leave our country ? 
  look at americans and how they support torture and drone attacks and how their precious freedom is taken from them ... it takes time . 
   g\u00f6ring : why , of course , the people do n't want war . 
  why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece ? 
  naturally , the common people do n't want war ; neither in russia nor in england nor in america , nor for that matter in germany . 
  that is understood . 
  but , after all , it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship .

  as croatian nationalism woke up , it allowed milo\u0161evi\u0107 to feed more fear into serbs and radicalize them ... as they got more radicalized croats got more radicalized . 
  tribal mass hysteria in its basic form . 
  it took about 5 years to get to the point of full out war . 
  there were also other factors involved ... global politics , like the fall of berlin wall and situation in ussr , economical ( croatia and slovenia were the most developed in yugoslavia and were giving more into federal budget than what they were given from it ) . 
  a lot of factors created a perfect storm for war . 
  it takes some time to brainwash people into fighting and war and death ... people do n't actually want to fight and die so you need to use a lot of propaganda over some time to get them there . 
  history is important because it can tells the causes of things happening around us . 
  if you ignore history you will repeat it . 
  biggest mistake in 1990 was repetition of history . 
  instead of working together and finding a solution both sides were busy drawing lines in the sand and arming themselves . 
  things happen . 
  usually there is a cause . 
  it 's good to know the cause . 
   i am all for stopping with the nationalistic bullcrap , but what sometimes annoys me with the croatian take on things is that there 's kind of an excuse and righteousness in how the croatian state acted in the war in the 1990s . 
  you do know that 35 % of croatia was under serbian control ? 
  that the country was cut in half at maslenica ? 
  that there were mass expulsion of croatians in krajina ? 
  i am not trying to start flame war here , but whatever happened has a timeline and if we are going to talk about serbs leaving krajina than we need to talk about croats being expelled from it in 1991t o1995 . 
  also ... croatian army did n't expel anyone . 
  serbs ** left before we entered the krajina ** , while serb forces forced croats out in 1991 . 
  i am not even denying that we were happy to see serbs leave ... because we were , i just want to establish a timeline of what happened . 
   200 000 civilians got banished from their homeland in which they lived for centuries precisely because they were border `` guards '' for centuries between two empires . 
  no empathy , no protection for minorities etc yes , but did croatia expel them in 1991 or did they rebel against croatia ? 
   i do n't think the serbian people in the croatian krajina felt good when seeing croats waving ww2 ustasha flags around in the 90s . 
  lol ... ok , our current flag is fucking retarded because we had to design it ** not to look like ustashi flag from 1941 ** . 
  personally , i fucking hate this design , it 's awful . 
   and how come that autonomous provinces were made in serbia for other minorities , and no provinces were made in bosnia and croatia for the serbian minority ? 
  oh ... here we come again ... do you know what was offered to serbs in croatia in 1995 under `` z-4 '' plan ? 
  country within country , bigger autonomy than kosova or vojvodina had . 
  krajina would be basically different country . 
  ** serbs refused ** we accepted . 
  americans got fucking annoyed and allowed us to start `` oluja '' . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/z-4_plan just read ... and please complain again that serbs were n't offered autonomy :  the plan was meant to allow for the reintegration of the republic of serbian krajina into croatia by offering wide-ranging autonomy through most of serbian krajina . 
  in addition , the plan called for the return of all croatian refugees . 
  however , the plan would have required unprofor to extend its mandate in order to implement the agreement , and the croatian constitution would have to have been amended to accommodate the requirements of autonomy . 
  some aspects of the proposed autonomy included the following : - total monetary independence , which would have included fiscal policy and a separate currency pegged to the kuna . 
  - krajina would have been a free trade area with no tariffs ; this was meant to encourage economic growth in krajina . 
  - elements of statehood including a coat of arms , flag , anthem , and police . 
  - eastern slavonia , baranja and western syrmia would not have been included as part of the autonomous krajina but would have undergone a separate reintegration process and would have had the presence of international troops for a period of five years .

  hopefully 2-3 offsprings spring up . 
   the funny thing is people like you who harp on about same sex marriage being wrong because of `` procreation '' would shit a brick if you accidentally got a girl pregnant . 
  the funny thing is people like you who harp on about prejudice and assumptions and then go on reddit and do exactly those things . 
  yeah , i would shit a brick if i , as you conveniently put it , ** accidently ** got a girl pregneant . 
  is that hypocritical or wrong ? 
  i do not get where you 're coming from . 
  maybe another non sequitur like the rest of your ramblings . 
  edit : you mentioned in one of your comments that r/europe mods banned 2-3 of your accounts . 
  so this is an alt account you use to post on a sub that has banned you ? 
  does that warrant a site-wide ban ? 
  i have a screencap, 
   the difference is that the word `` maternity '' by definition excludes men . 
  now you 're entering a very grey area . 
  by your logic , `` woman '' excludes `` man '' , so what you are stating is that men can not become women and vice versa . 
  is that transphobia ? 
   marriage is a binding contract between spouses , and it 's definition is flexible enough to include gay people . 
  so why should n't we let them do what they want ? 
  there is * no * discernable downside . 
  marriage , from a societal viewpoint , began and continuted to exist only to control , regulate and preserve the obligations and responsibilities of procreation - by definition . 
  a man and a woman can , by definition , procreate . 
  a man and a man or a woman and a woman can only masturbate in company and can not procreate . 
  there is absolutely zero benefit for the society as a whole to make a symbolic gesture towards 2-3 % of the population . 
  any sane and apolitical logician can tell you that . 
  furthermore , it would be more beneficial for everyone ( including lgtb ) to make a symbolic gesture ( the literal bare minimum ) of promoting procreation , because once a society stops procreating it is in a state of extinction . 
  meaning no more gay , straight , bi , lesbian or any kind of human . 
   if you want to desperately cling to the vestiges of a `` traditional '' time rather than accept progress in your country , then the future will not have much else in store for you . 
  sadly , `` progress '' has become a platitude to be thrown around in discussion in order to shame or vilify the other party . 
  you ca n't seem to grasp that without procreation there will be no future . 
  instead of encouraging people to procreate , even symbolically , we do the opposite . 
  is that progress ? 
  perhaps followers of scientism prefer having test tube gub gub babies . 
  a lot of users posted sources and links . 
  if you had a genuine curiousity and really wanted to leave your bubble i could n't have been able to write this reply because you 'd be reading the materials you were given . 
  instead , you are shitposting , refusing to read up on whatever the `` right wingers '' believe , patronizing etc ad nauseam . 
  enjoying your smugness tbh , bye . 
   should men have paid maternity leave ? 
  misandry . 
   should very old people be able to adopt children ? 
  seems like a summary of your thoughts . 
  spare me the prejudiced assumptions . 
  using wikipedia as a source ... 
   not wanting the institution of marriage extended to homosexuals = homophobia keep it rational r/europe,

  http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/27/angela-merkel-caught-on-hot-mic-pressing-facebook-ceo-over-anti-immigrant-posts.html feel free to do some googling yourself, 
   no i am not and i do not think posts critical of terrorism should be removed if they remakn somewhat reasonable . 
  that 's what the op was referring to . 
  remember the new year 's eve in germany in 2016 ? 
  koln ? 
  when actual victims were fined/arrested for identifying the criminals ? 
  when police officers were censored ? 
  zuccbook has a history of removing even posts that are moderate in criticising immigration . 
  maybe a dum dum would write a comment like you did . 
  in case you 're not just baiting or being deliberately obtuse , the op is talking about critical facebook posts about terrorism . 
  as i understand , the `` recruitment posts '' do not come after an attack . 
  what we see after attacks are valid criticisms of immigration laws and immigrants themselves . 
  go back to r/politics, 
  are n't posts visible only after previous ascent from the mods ? 
  one of the mods recently showed screenshots from the interface even mentioning certain keywords which certainly stop the post from showing up without approval . 
  he said `` holocaust '' was one , i 'm guessing `` jihad '' is there as well . 
  are you not doing your job , or is there some mistruths going around ( either here or in the other mod 's comment ) ? 
  okay ... should nato send soldiers to die over there ? 
  not going to watch the entire thing . 
  give me a time stamp, 
  and my first comment was refering to your editorialized title ( wonder why mods do n't take this down , like they do with a lot of other `` editoralized '' titled posts ) , stating that they are simply `` europeans '' . 
  holding a few pieces of paper in their hands will never make them `` european '' , unless they ** fully ** integrate ( even then it is contentious ) . 
  at least in my eyes and everyone else who holds even a tiniest bit of respect for their homeland and the way of their ancestors . 
  this is the worst timeline . 
  you 're most likely pretending to be a dum-dum , or maybe not . 
  either way i 'm not going to debate you . 
  instead , i 'll c/p a comment from this thread by / u/fikifik  `` that person is european '' can plausibly mean at least three different things : \u2022 that person is a citizen of a european country . 
  \u2022 that person is a member of one of the native european ethnic groups . 
  \u2022 that person is culturally european . 
  they are all orthogonal concepts , you can be any of those without being the other . 
  however , people , such as yourself , would like to abolish the latter two , and insist that only the first exists . 
  anyone who talks about the latter two will be constantly questioned , nitpicked at and harangued in an attempt to obfuscate . 
  if i show you an article that says the sun is blue , does it make it true ? 
  it 's called `` populism '' . 
  but this is the right kind , so le upboats to the left, 
  how is he bullying us ? 
  yeah , but do a referendum for it !, 
  `` europeans '' ? 
  if we get a shot of mutti merkel 's multikulti medicine , i 'm signing up for bbb . 
  helping africa to develop and industrialize will help stop global warming ? 
  is this a sick joke ? 
  the amazon rainforest , among other carbon dioxide absorbers is our only hope for an effective , palpable and certain change in the near future . 
  installing solar panels in africa or helping them industrialize is a money siphon as well us shooting ourselves in the leg . 
  he 's goddamn right . 
  we want gibsmedats in order to keep russia as it is . 
  sad state of being . 
  no , no ... 
  i am happy to let them live in their habitat . 
  just not around my house , really . 
  how would you solve it ? 
  that 's fine .

  do n't do it . 
  it 's a trap !, 
  exactly . 
  muslims chanting how they are gon na take over europe and convert the world etc etc. 
  some loonies shooting up paris multiple times . 
  while this is horrible in and of itself . 
  it 's just background noise compared to the big picture . 
  they forget that europeans had slaughtered eachother on a industrial scale for two world wars . 
  our business is war , and we do it well . 
  topkek, 
  can you send some to croatia as well ? 
  i do n't care anymore . 
  are you serious ? 
  it 's pure trash and racist to boot . 
  well in that case i do agree with you . 
  i could n't care less what some american says or thinks . 
  they have their own problems of migration from south america . 
  we have ours from africa and asia . 
  different problems , different attitudes and different solutions . 
  to equate the two would be outright laughable . 
   frontex is a piece of shit . 
  i 'd rather my goverment send you some money then have that cancerous agency in charge . 
  is this a problem ? 
  i would go out on a limb and say that it 's one of the most sensible things to do . 
  i think we should revise the charter concerning refugees and go with the turkish interpretation . 
  you guys had the right idea . 
  soon brate . 
  yours is entirely irrelevant . 
  atleast people are discussing shit . 
  they think because they had their secular bosnian drinking buddie bring a bottle of rakija that suddenly all muslims are a-ok . 
  spoiler alert , they 're not . 
  w-w-what does that even mean ? 
  with what ? 
  broomsticks and german girls ? 
  over my dead body , kraut . 
  good . 
  you wo n't mind a couple million more then . 
   stormfront every damn time . 
  did you ever stop and realize that maybe people do n't want mass immigration from third world countries ? 
  or is it the scary nazi boogyman that 's brigading your precious echochamber ? 
  god , i see you in every thread defending mass immigration . 
  where are you even from . 
  insufferable . 
  a patriotic citizen that is concerned about his nation and people ? 
  same here . 
  after the shitholes in limburg for cheap rent . 
  never again . 
  rather have less purchasing power and pay more in rent . 
  now i just look for nice neigborhoods first . 
  rest is secondary . 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  if it means anything , i 'm sorry dude . 
  i 've seen the list of terror attacks in india . 
  you guys have it rough . 
  nice . 
  quick and painless . 
  keep doing what you 're doing . 
  we need to step up our own border security slovenbro . 
  that made me smile czechbro . 
  mostly albanians and gypsies . 
  it 's hardly a exclusive polish sentiment . 
  people still have a lot of beef with austrians as well here . 
  thanks za info . 
  austria 's fence is n't a fence . 
  it 's a obstructive barricade , do n't you see ? 
  completely different / s, 
   only ? 
  are you kidding yourself ??!, 
  dont you know what the hell happened to indigenous people ? 
  yea grass is always greener on the other side . 
  like i said . 
  british would have been better in every way . 
  they were christian like us . 
  the enlightenment helped a great deal . 
  also way more advanced then the backwards ottoman empire . 
  so having your firstborn taken is ok because you get to keep the rest ? 
  do you have children of your own ? 
  how can you even casually say this like it 's no big deal ? 
   `` unfortunately '' dont worry you killed , displaced most of them . 
  including my own grand grandparents . 
  while i 'll admit that everytime i read about the first balkan war that it gives me goosebumps imagining how we kicked out the turks out of europe . 
  remembering how we handled the helpless colonizers just leaves a bad taste in my mouth . 
  yes , i admit we we horrible to them . 
  the looting , killing and rapes are unjustifiable . 
  imho we should have either given them an option for safe passage to anatolia and confiscation of property or conversions and intergration . 
  the `` unfortunately '' you misunderstood . 
  it 's not like i condone it . 
  the communities that are left are extremely disadvantaged . 
  they are either in gangs or commiting petty crime and the women prostitute themselves . 
  it 's a lose-lose . 
   lets compare centuries of turkish rule vs a few decades but very very intense british rule . 
  i 'd wager a guess that the balkans would have been better ruled by the british then the turks . 
  they only wanted resources which are easy to come by . 
  turks wanted taxation and blood tax which had crippled the balkans . 
  manpower does n't grow on trees you know . 
  plus , you saying we removed our turkish populations is patently false , as there are unfortunately still large minority populations of them scattered around the balkans . 
  african nations removed their british populations as well . 
  they still get aid so pay up turk . 
  a swede defending eastern europe ? 
  i think i 'm in love .

  it 's a fact that a responsible , educated , and armed society does just fine . 
  chicago enacted very strict gun laws . 
  they quickly became the most violent city in america subsequently . 
  you ca n't conceal a rifle . 
  a pistol , however , is concealable . 
  in the states , most people can get rifles at 18 . 
  however , you need to be 21 to purchase a handgun from a licensed store . 
  that does n't mean you ca n't be 18 and inherit one from say , your grandfather , though . 
  primarily for children 's safety . 
  i live in the states and even though my gun is in my safe , i do n't keep it loaded ( not that it 's required to be like that , but it 's the safest way ) . 
  if you 're responsible and not a fucking retard , guns are fine . 
   they do , rs is an autonomous entity . 
  they 're already an insolvent shithole , and that 's as a part of bih . 
  if they secede i give them a month before they start starving . 
   a serbian country for serbs . 
  they have that , it 's called serbia . 
  bosnia is for bosnians . 
  ah yes , foreign corporations looking for cheap workers in poorer countries . 
  sounds very familiar . 
  yeah , yugoslavia is gon na come back , too . 
  this time around slovenia and croatia will join yugoslavia and leave the eu for better economic opportunity outside the eu . 
  lol . 
  cyka blyat , rush b use p-90, 
  he was a * hard * motherfucker man , if we put his dirty laundry aside for a minute . 
  damn , we posted that almost at the same time , lol . 
  basically . 
  while he did fucked up shit , he was a badass too . 
  * escaped from a russian prison in ww1 after leading an uprising in said prison . 
  he then escsped russia via train and ran into russian police on the train and only escaped because he learned russian fluently from reading books . 
  his russian was so good he fooled the cops into thinking he was russian . 
  * later in yugoslavia , stalin tried to make yugo a satellite . 
  tito said `` nah , fuck that . '', 
  so stalin sent something like 5-6 assassins and all of them were caught . 
  tito then said to stalin , `` stop sending people to kill me , we caught them all , i 'll send one person to moscow and wo n't have to send another '' and stalin never tried shit again . 
  he said that to the leader of a world power and lived to tell the tale . 
  i think that 's incredible . 
  yeah , he actually was not `` best buddies '' with stalin . 
  soviet assassins tried * several * times to assasinate him and were never successful . 
  * the soviets * tried and could n't get rid of the leader of a nation of only 20 million . 
  `` which one of you is marko ? '', 
  `` we are all marko . '', 
  is there a problem in your country ? 
  was there some sort of election interference ?

  `` well what will we do with the old ones ? '', 
  `` get rid of them . '', 
  `` so we 're gon na sell them ? '', 
  `` no , scrap that shit . '',

  lol no worries dude , it 's the internet .

  well i can assure you i 'm not one of them but i know what you mean . 
  was * sorry grammar nazi . 
  yeah , i stopped watching the video about halfway through . 
  extremely cancerous . 
  yugoslavia is a * completely * different situation . 
  also , the war being based on ethnicity solely is probably one of the biggest misconceptions in history . 
  hundreds of thousands of people identified as yugoslavs . 
  his little tirade about bosnia was funny too . 
  prior to the war , no one gave a shit about your religion . 
  people willingly participated in each other 's holidays . 
  not to mention all the interreligious/interethnic marriages . 
  i myself am a bosniak and have half-serb cousins . 
  one of whom is actually a professor at the university of belgrad . 
  we were all just talking about something like this yesterday with the whole burka thing . 
  there are simply just too many of them who do n't want to adapt to the culture of the country they are in . 
  hey . 
  hey , guys . 
  let 's move to romania . 
  i 'm a bosniak . 
  i agree with you though . 
  not many croatians convicted , when there was clearly shit going on, 
  shit , you found me again ? 
  it was a joke bro .

  they do n't care , because they have no reason to care . 
  put together , we 're somewhat bigger in population than romania . 
  we 're not exactly poor ( well , there are differences among ex-yugos , but nobody is africa-level ) , but we do n't have that much potential - small population , difficult terrain , barely any internal resources worth mentioning . 
  yugoslavia ... one of the reasons it stayed together was the external pressure , dipshits to the east , dipshits to the west , us deciding to be the buffer zone . 
  once soviets fell , nobody cared anymore ( the non-aligned movement lives to this day , and it 's about as relevant as the african union ) , economy was shit , we were tired of tolerating each other 's bullshit , that artificial `` brotherhood and unity '' nobody really bought melted away . 
  the rest is history . 
  if you 're anything like us , you barely have any blacks or asians , and the rare ones that live here - i never once heard of them making any problems . 
  muslims mostly mean bosnians and albanians here , not the radical lunatics from the middle east , so that probably affects our `` whatever , ok i guess '' . 
  i 'd be a bit weird to think very badly of the guys that keep their bakeries open 24/7 and therefore save you when you 're starving drunk at 3 am . 
  jews ... eh , do n't have that much of them either , and same as blacks and asians , they do n't make much trouble . 
  heh , i do n't think so . 
  the [ sheave ] ( https://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/8/8f/the_eyrie-tn.jpg ) looks about [ the same ] ( https://roaminroeck.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dsc_0705.jpg ) , tho ' ps . 
  try to find the [ ossuary ] ( https://ssl.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000mb1vssgu4js/s/650/650/angier-1209-meteora-greece-6513.jpg ) if/when you go there . 
  i feel like vale should be greece ~ they have about equally high mountains , indented coast , also i * think * the irl inspiration for eyrie was [ meteora . 
  ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=meteora&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj5o5cxkndvahwqj5okhdmoaxsq_auicigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818 ) side-note : meteora is so awesome , if you can only visit one place in greece , honestly skip the acropolis ( as hard as that decision is ) and go to meteora . 
  those pesky italians tried to get their mitts on our city of king 's landing many times , no can do ~, 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  everyone and their grandmother knows that greece is special , whether it 's because of the bits of ancient culture you managed to preserve , the language and alphabet , or even your geography which forces you to be a maritime culture ( unlike most of the rest of balkan ) . 
  and afaik our neighbors do n't call it `` greek influence '' but `` byzantine influence '' . 
  and this byzantine influence appears as relevant to their nation/culture building as rome/vatican does for us . 
  that 's not to say that greece is strongly tied to its balkan neighbors now , but ... 
  i do n't know , have you visited some of these countries ? 
  i have n't regretfully , but i did visit budapest , vienna , prague , plus i 've been all over greece . 
  to me , greece felt * very * unfamiliar , with perhaps the exception of mentality ( your people 's temperament seems similar to our coastal folk ) . 
  on the other hand , the former a-h cities felt like a copy of my northern cities . 
  so , if the influence of the now long-dead a-h is so visible in former a-h ( ditto for italy and our coast ) , would n't something similar work for former byzantine empire and its satellites , plus whatever traces the ottomans left ? 
  but of course , that all depends on what you consider culture . 
  geographically , you 're as balkan as can be . 
  some of the rest might argue that they 're central or eastern - the north/west/east borders of balkan are n't 100 % clearly defined . 
  but you 're on the very southern tip of the peninsula , it does n't get clearer than that . 
  and yes , you are different , ancient greece is older than these divisions . 
  enough of that ancient culture was preserved , alright . 
  after ancient greece , there was the byzantine empire - does that count as your heritage as well ? 
  i thought it does . 
  so , this empire and rome divided the rest of the balkans in their spheres of influence , military/economy/religion / culture . 
  some of us leaned towards rome , others towards constantinople . 
  then , you all had the misfortune of being occupied by ottomans ( unlike some of the rest ) for a long time , that left a mark . 
  so saying that you ca n't be culturally grouped with central and eastern balkan which modeled so much of itself * on your example * , or shared so much of the circumstances with you , is weird at best . 
  it 'd be like italy claiming it has nothing to do with our dalmatian coast , or that it has more in common with portugal than dalmatia , despite the fact that you can * see italy * in our coastal towns . 
  or , italy claiming that the dalmatian coast has more in common with bulgaria and serbia than with italy . 
  `` because balkan , ewww '' . 
  it 's nonsense . 
  geographically ? 
  russia is too big , the geographic center of europe - and there are several , disputed ones - is much more east than what people think . 
  when you ask `` where 's the dividing line ? 
  '' , people will say germany or maybe czechia , but that 's geographically very incorrect . 
  historically or culturally ? 
  we had about equally little to do with both uk/france and russia . 
  most of `` central '' europe had more to do with germany/austria , who are called western , and yet if you called slovakia/croatia/etc western , people would stare at you . 
  sooo , where do you put us ? 
  slavs are east ? 
  but geographically , czech are almost equally west as austria , same for slovenia , and what do you make of the non-slavs on the other side of the iron curtain ? 
  latin/cyrillic alphabet ? 
  [ does n't work . 
  ] ( http://www.eurfedling.org/maps/alphabets_europe.jpg ) religion ? 
  [ does n't work . 
  ] ( https://churchpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/traditional-religions.png ) basically , the term central europe is very nebulous , but it seems necessary if we 'll define europe according to east/west/north / south . 
  i hear you . 
  and it goes beyond the wars for us . 
  yugoslavia was a good idea on paper at the time , and well at least it kept us safe from our `` loving '' neighbors , we industrialized ( though that would have happened anyways ) . 
  aside from that , given its many and varied failures , to be honest - to hell with any idiot who thinks it 's a good idea to `` get strong ties with the region '' . 
  from my point of view , that 's as stupid as , well - ex-ussr deciding that their progress lies in russia instead of the eu . 
  experiment 's over , we 're back to our old political alignment . 
  one side-note/partial correction ~ austro-hungary did n't stop at czech republic and slovenia . 
  slovakia and croatia were a part of that too . 
  in our case , we spent 800 years with first hungary and then the combination , which is imo more relevant than the 71 years of the failed yugo experiment . 
  and if you 'll consider religion as part of culture , which is the correct thing to do because in the past religion was much more tied with politics and culture , and then draw the line rome/constantinople or catholic/orthodox , we 're on the western side again . 
  aside from that , good comment . 
  ehh , calling slovenia balkan appears to be a more effective trigger than calling them alpine croats , so i rather doubt they like being called eastern as well . 
  `` we 're central '' , they say to everyone and their grandmother . 
  heh :d good map , anyways . 
  and for what it 's worth , over here baltics are baltics . 
  people do n't mention you in terms of east/west/north , but just baltics ... probably because you 3 stick with each other , and you 're odd ducks in general , not slav , not `` viking '' , not xyz . 
  tbh you 're kinda lucky in that , `` baltics '' does n't have negative connotations . 
  on the other end of the continent , we get to be eastern or balkan or occasionally southern ( of the recent pay denbts !, 
  infamy ) , * joy * . 
  / u/h2ppyme , were you making a lighthearted joke , pointing out unfortunate ignorance through sarcasm , or ... ? 
  bah , i just used your comment to get the point across . 
  `` hurr durr you should n't be ok getting grouped with nigel farage '' . 
  people go like `` well why do you lot get triggered by being called eastern '' , easy to say when you 're in the west and people go to the effort of distinguishing your country from other western countries . 
  and `` west '' does n't mean a crapton of negative stereotypes which are n't even true half of the time . 
  and that they have no clue , i know that . 
  we 're irrelevant to them . 
  but most of the west is equally irrelevant to us , and yet i do n't see the same amount of gross generalizations . 
  bloody hell south america could n't matter less to me , and yet i can point to at least some of the differences among them . 
  given the long history italy had on the other side of the adriatic , which only really ended after wwii , you 'd think at least you lot would know a thing or two ; - ;, 
  your flair points to a place in italy , unless i googled the name incorrectly . 
  and in op 's map with which he 's making a point , italy is part of western europe . 
  so , you say `` you 're ok with this '' , being part of western europe i assume . 
  and * my point * , and op 's point , is how unfair it is that countries that rarely have much to do with each other are grouped together so often . 
  i see that every other day , generalizations like `` eastern eu/europe does [ insert negative thing ] '' . 
  and when i ask around , it usually turns out that * some specific country * from the east is doing that negative thing . 
  so , why does n't it go `` specific country x '' , instead of `` eastern europe '' ? 
  i listed out some negative events or stereotypes that come from western countries . 
  and to draw an equivalent , i grouped the west together , instead of saying `` uk messed up here , france there , etc etc '' . 
  because that 's what happens with us . 
  saying `` east is n't cooperating on migrant quotas '' is just as dishonest as saying `` west is threatening to break the eu '' ( farage , wilders , le pen ) . 
  well , shame on you then !, 
  why is your western euro country constantly striking against something ? 
  and threatening to break the eu every other tuesday ?

  i have seen asian orthodox priests for example who do n't have a beard , because they ca n't grow one . 
  does n't stop them from doing their job !, 
  they are not required to get married and technically speaking , they can not get married . 
  but a married man can become a priest . 
  orthodox take it seriously when they mean a husband and wife become one in marriage . 
  bishops were usually monks in the past , or they are widowed priests who became monks and then bishops . 
  yeah bishops as a rule are celibate . 
  it 's not dogmatic per say , but it 'd a strong tradition . 
  it was basically a necessity in the time when bishops served a geographical large area and had to be on the move . 
  now i guess it 's possible , but they are still very busy !, 
  we have altar servers , who help the priest celebrate the divine liturgy , but they are not as a rule boys or young men ( many are just middle aged men who like to help out ) . 
  and our priests are not perfect ( i mean they are human ) but orthodoxy never had a systemic child abuse scandal . 
  i 'm from the balkans !, 
  chances were one of my ancestors was enslaved by a person of colour , raped by a person of colour and they were most definitely oppressed by a person of colour !, 
  but people in north america connect me to the rascism of a culture that is n't even related to me !!, 
  and relevant places celebrate / mourn the events . 
  in russia there are many statues for individuals who stood up against the mongol rule . 
  many saints days are celebrated for saints who did the same , and the terrible legacy of the mongols and the bravery of the saints is recounted in sermons . 
  as you said though , this is culturally relevant to russia , i would n't expect sweden to make statues for these people and have sermons about them !, 
  edit : jao vidi down votes !, 
  well again i do n't know , i surely know the canadians attest to it happening ... 
  the only reason they would lie about it would be to say in 1999 `` look at how shitty these balkan people are . 
  no more peace keeping , just bomb them to surrender . '', 
  however the mission was n't really talked about at that point . 
  as for the war crimes not sure if that 's fair ... 
  i mean sure attacking armed forces , but the canadians found burnt villages with desecrated bodies of old people . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cshsa4f_mhk kaj to kazes ? 
  even then , depends on the region . 
  i could tell a dalmatian like no one 's business , same with someone with a kajkavian accent . 
  however if they are dinaric croats from lika or bosnian croats it would be a a lot harder . 
  same with serbs ... really depends on the intensity of the dialect and who they learned the language . 
  the more exposure you have , the more ambitious your dialect becomes . 
  in short people hate me . 
  never croat or serbian enough . 
  oh it happened ... where was he stationed this ? 
  this happened in the medak pocket . 
  as well , it was kept pretty quiet . 
  no one punished them because it was truly self defense . 
  however , canada just before that had a failed peace keeping mission in somalia so at least in canada , the story was kept very very quiet for about 10 years . 
  tko me jebe s ovim alternativnim accountom ? 
  yeah well , that 's war . 
  everyone lost a lot for little gain . 
   know of no books where the writer says `` bog vas kleo pogane vlasine , sta ce vlaska vjera medju vamp '' well no duh , it wasn ; t written in a south slavic language , it was written in arabic . 
   quran is not taught at any bosnian schools , except at religious studies . 
  what about the jizya my family had to pay and the blood tax !, 
  oh please , they read the koran as part of opening of the school day . 
   and fbih does n't have isis villages either . 
  or bosnia as a whole . 
  the salafi villages are in brcko district , maoca village . 
  oh nice technicality , as if `` brcko district '' is anything but a de fecto fbih canton made to cut up rs, 
   we do n't need weapons or massive monetary support . 
  nothing except nato 's promise to intervene if there is any war . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  you can ; t just `` join '' nato . 
  nato isn ; t just a club where you get your friends to join you if a bigger meaner country attacks you . 
  in order for nato to function you need to train with nato ( spending money on exercises ) to coordinate missions your army needs to be compatible with nato ( again buying equipment ) and when you are part of nato your troops will probably get dragged into a war that has nothing to do with their country ( see croat , czech , slovak troops in afghanistan ), 
  because the croats were shooting at them . 
  they were going to finish the job against the badly beaten krajina serb militias.did some bad stuff in between ... canadians could n't just watch, 
   let bosnia into nato and then hopes of separatism and territorial expansion will be dashed against the rocks and such rhetorics would stop . 
  do you realize the costs associated with this ? 
  look at my country and nato and how we have to get rid of perfectly fine equipment that we could defend our country with and now spend tons of money buying foreign equipment to match nato . 
  croatian army doesn ; t need fancy stuff to go fight in foreign wars , neither does bosnia . 
  even if they just entered nato it won ; t stop the country from imploding . 
  its another bandaid solution . 
  bosnia-herzegovina is fundementally flawed . 
   `` bog vas kleo pogani izrodi , sta ce turska vjera medju vama . . '' if i am not mistaken , this is taken out from gorski vijenac ... 
  it was written by a man who lived in a state totally surround by a global empire that treated christian serbs as second class citizens ? 
  what do you want ? 
  for him to congratulate muslim ? 
  now that said , i must agree the education system is horrendous in bosnia-herzegovina . 
  firstly in that it segregates kids and allows this kind of thing to be taught . 
  don ; t pin this just on the serbs though , it happens in all bih schools . 
  thanks to this sort of thing ' bih is just sowing the seeds of a future conflict in the new generation . 
  yeah but the things is , no one wants to fix bosnia-herzegovina . 
  it was doomed the minute someone had the idea of turning something that was historically an administrative district , into a state . 
  it functioned as an eyalet , it functioned as a banovina and it functioned as a republic in a federation , but right now bosnia will not work , with or without rs . 
  until people realize this , there is nothing to talk about . 
  canadians are the best ... 
  nothing happened on their watch , and in my country they actually opened fire against croat forces to keep the peace during a fragile cease-fire . 
   because doing so would only fuel the flames of ethnic hatred implying that the current situation is n't already doing so ... 
   but then again , if someone told me you were a russian shill i 'd probably believe them . 
  after all , reddit has had plenty of them and there do n't seem to really be many people in this thread disagreeing other than you . 
  after things like this are said , there is really no point going . 
  i could be spouting golden truth , but you ; ve made up your mind . 
  enjoy your night-mares and muscovite boogeyman . 
  edit : how do i know you 're not a shill ? 
  i 've had this account for longer than you . 
  you could just as easily be some state 's agent trying to `` curate '' the `` right '' opinions on reddit . 
  again as i have said to others , this argument is silly and is indicative of your inability to accept other 's opinion or malicious intent . 
   you mean things like `` article 50 will be triggered when your country gets attacked '' , right ? 
  after all , we ca n't believe it at face value . 
  that 's a treaty obligation not just a government statement . 
  apples and oranges . 
   you know what else was/is `` in the sphere of influence '' of moscow and historically has been ? 
  estonia . 
  so please , take your `` sphere of influence '' stuff elsewhere . 
  estonian territory was under russian rule for a long time . 
  so how does your argument not apply to estonia then as well ? 
  `` oh , estonia has just always been part of the sphere of influence or russia . 
  so it 's natural that russia would annex them . '',

  it does n't just go away after such a short time . 
  and the serb minorities are further complicated by what they - or some other serb minorities in the same area - tried to do in the 90 's . 
  a bit hard to * trust your loving neighbors * after that , you know ? 
  but in any case . 
  we do n't like you much , you do n't like us much . 
  but i do n't think that this makes serbia `` xenophobic in general '' towards non-serbs , i know that you get along well with romanians , greeks etc etc. 
  i just looked up what they 're referring to - the `` patriotic coalition '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriotic_coalition_ ( croatia ) winning 33 % of the vote . 
  except as you can see that was basically hdz and a few other minor seats , same hdz is the run of the mill conservative right-wing party . 
  are we talking the usual pissing contests with serbia or xenophobia in general ? 
  racist ? 
  for heaven 's sake we do n't even have `` races '' here , we 're all white - because no colonies and economic migrants are n't interested in us , except for bosnians , and they all happen to be white ... and sometimes muslim . 
  we get along with them . 
  not that much in detail , sadly . 
  do n't want to cheat with too much checking of wiki , so off the top of my head ... + very small population , a bit more than 300k . 
  it 's basically 3 times my own city , which makes me wonder - how does such a small country function ? 
  though i guess it 's the same question a german or a pole may ask about many european countries , so : shrug : they function well as a country all in all , though of course there are lots of jokes about `` dammit , it 's a cousin * again * '' .

  ahh , finally we have a romanian place that sounds weird in croatian !, 
  bogata = rich ( female adjective ) . 
  it 's not on the level of pula , but it 's better than nothing . 
  hm , maybe you should better try the stickied tourist-thread on r/croatia . 
  more likely that someone in-the-know will respond . 
  in general about the camps in croatia : yeah , there are many , i 've been in some around istria and on murter . 
  they 're generally built like : so they have the `` public '' toilets , showers and stuff ( imo there are always plenty in every camp , not like you 'll wait in lines , and they 're regularly cleaned and stuff ) .

  my theory about the virgin-obsession in general is : virgins are usually younger and therefore probably prettier to such men , plus they do n't have any comparisons to draw . 
  not like she 'll rate you as `` lame lover '' if she does n't know better . 
  well over here the issue would n't be `` racist '' but `` anti-church '' . 
  cause priests are disproportionate among pedophiles , and they 're all white . 
  it 's more about the system not being helpful in protecting against the `` holy cows '' like minorities , racial minorities , churches , the politicians , the rich ( especially the rich ) and so on . 
  not that the system is very helpful to rape victims in general . 
  reminds me of george carlin 's rant on [ soft language . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o25i2fzfgoy ) as coincidence would have it , he mentioned : `` it 's getting so bad that any day now i expect to hear a * rape victim * referred to as * an unwilling sperm recipient * ! '', 
  mm , i do n't feel very happy with how eu/west handled ukraine . 
  i mean i get it , it 's not feasible/logical to send france and russia to war with each other because of ukraine , but on the other hand as far as i 'm aware that whole mess started because ukrainians tried/wanted to get closer to eu and west , turn away from russia . 
  goes to show that we 're not safe/worth it for the border-lands ... and it brings into doubt as to what would happen if vlad tried to `` rescue some oppressed russian minorities '' in the baltics for example . 
  cause i do n't feel that eu/nato would try hard to go to war with russia for the sake of estonia either . 
  as for the non-intervention thing . 
  yes , i usually agree that we should consider distance ... but also : culture and complexity . 
  i feel that the venezuelan problems are much easier to understand than the clusterfuck in the middle east that took the `` top complicated '' award away from the balkans by a mile . 
  like - * who do you even support in syria ? 
  because that worked out well in srebrenica for example . 
  non-intervention is n't always the answer either . 
  you typed that while being raped and robbed simultaneously , have n't you . 
  they probably took your car and goat as well , now you 'll have to go uphill both ways , right . 
  wait .

  or worse , a putin-shill ??!, 
  that 's because `` the other parts of the world '' left the middle ages . 
  easier to `` grow '' when you start from the bottom ( most people living off subsistence farming ) , than when you 've already gone though the industrial revolution . 
  and the gdp/ppp share of the eu in the world will decline further , with our shrinking population , and * their * increasingly industrialized economies and a population finally just catching up in the demographic shift we 've already gone though with the baby boomers . 
  * this is a good thing for the world . 
  * in any case , the falling market share would happen to european countries anyways , with or without the eu . 
  if anything , eu alleviates many of the problems of us euros becoming `` too small for the world '' . 
  depends on where you 're standing . 
  if it was n't for the concepts of nation , religion , culture , self-interest etc etc , over here we 'd be turks now . 
  or italians . 
  or hungarians , they literally tried to turn us into that . 
  or serbs even . 
  and no , we would n't be better off as such . 
  the periphery is always neglected . 
  i do n't think so . 
  share of renewables in 2014 : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_renewables_in_gross_final_energy_consumption,_2014_and_2020_ ( % 25 ) _ yb16.png so bulgaria , lithuania , romania , estonia , croatia , finland , latvia etc are doing well in renewables and they 're cheap . 
  apparently same goes for norway ( so said the norwegians up in the thread ) . 
  sweden seems to be a mild exception , and then you have cheap and dirty like poland , so it 's probably more affected by taxes and whatever else . 
  well , you also need to consider that uk would n't have the equally special status as it did before . 
  so they 'd be obliged to eventually adopt schengen and euro , and afaik those are quite large issues for them . 
  also , the old folks who voted leave also once upon a time voted to enter - so who knows how the current middle-aged and young will think in 10-20 years . 
  also eu will likely integrate even further in the meantime ( or else fall apart if it does n't ) . 
  not to say that i entirely disagree with you , i could see it happening , but if it does it 'll be much more difficult than it was the 1st time . 
  and yet their government is blocking a common-military eu project that they 're not going to be part of anyways because ... elections ? 
  harming/annoying the eu while they can ? 
  none of which has to do with free trading . 
  i do n't even know . 
  i do n't feel like watching the video again atm , so going off my memory ~ those that are somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd stage , still .

  germany was trying to move banks to frankfurt for years . 
  put a few more regulations through european parliament and get it done . 
  like this ? 
   meanwhile , german mep manfred weber , from the party of chancellor angela merkel , insisted on a tough line for the uk : `` there can not be any special treatment for the united kingdom . 
  leave means leave . 
  the times of cherry-picking are over . '', 
  btw , i agree with him . 
  and they voted over that ? 
  haha ... this is true ? 
  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/f00c4a58-384a-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7.html  international banks have started looking at office space in frankfurt as they consider whether they will need to shift some of their european operations out of london if britain votes to leave the eu . 
  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/23d576b0-386a-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f.html  over the past 30 years the city has become much more international , with us and other global banks now dominant . 
  crucial to their presence in london is the eu principle of `` passporting '' , which allows them to access the european single market without restrictions . 
  several banks have warned that brexit will undermine the logic of basing so many staff in the uk . 
  ** jpmorgan said it could axe up to 4,000 uk jobs , while hsbc has suggested up to 1,000 posts could move to paris , where it has a sizeable subsidiary ** . 
  many other employers said in private in the run-up to the vote that they would move jobs to continental europe . 
   if people were to flee the london financial industry to europe there is no `` if '' , they will flee because uk wo n't be in the eu anymore . 
   the uk financial industry is built on good banking arrangements with the eu it 's built on being in the eu .

  https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/4p5hq3/i_am_sebastian_mallaby_senior_fellow_for/ pretty good explanations on what is going on . 
   we need a federalist model , but it needs to be extremely decentralized model of federalism , perhaps like the relations between the provinces and federal government in canada . 
  that would be pretty nice setup . 
   car manufacturers as well . 
  they 'll probably move to eastern europe . 
  russians have natural resources on which they can build any industry they want , uk not so much . 
  at least you are free . 
  because eu rules . 
  if you want to do business in the eu you should be in the eu . 
  pretty simple actually . 
  germans are probably opening champagne right now cause this is what they needed to boost frankfurt . 
  very good ama on brexit -  https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/4p5hq3/i_am_sebastian_mallaby_senior_fellow_for/, 
  just wait till financial institutions start moving from london to eu . 
  this is just a beginning . 
  i think eu will survive and move to federal state . 
  i am already a fan of federal europe and with brits out we can start working toward that goal . 
   i hope it does n't affect the eur too much . . 
  it 's crashing against euro as well . 
  very good read on brexit : https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/4p5hq3/i_am_sebastian_mallaby_senior_fellow_for/ ( probably the best i have seen ) .

  more than 7 % fall and still falling . 
  you can move to venus and check what happens when there is too much of it in the atmosphere . 
   you have slovenia . 
  nope . 
  we have border disputes with them . 
  and slovenia ... well ... let 's just say their highway construction was a bit lacking along certain border . 
   as does reading the article hahahahahaha ... article ? 
  i come here for titles . 
   if merkel was to say nice things about the uk then it would convert a few of them . 
  why would she do that ? 
  brexit is in german interest . 
  germany will get tighter europe and uk will have to negotiate with germany to get less than what they have right now . 
  germans have been trying to push frankfurt as the financial center of europe for some time and brexit is a god given gift for them . 
  with uk gone germany becomes the leading force of more integrated europe . 
  merkel will probably open a bottle of champagne if there is brexit . 
   i 'm an euro federalist that hopes that britain finally fucks off . 
  i 'd like britain to negotiate those treaties , though . 
  they 'd end up in a norway-like situation , where they 'd have to pay to the budget , follow our laws and have no say in the matter . 
  we 'd finally be able to centralize further without them acting as a fifth column . 
  same here . 
  i am for more federal europe and ca n't wait for britain to get out and stop opposing tighter union . 
  what we need is more integration , not less . 
  wtf ? 
  i laughed at german jokes ?

   a much too large percentage of americans to honestly share his sentiment . 
  that 's what makes him a successful troll . 
   there 's still an ongoing border dispute shit , we have to go to war with slovenia , bosnia and montenegro as well . 
  i know . 
  this happened in bosnia as well , saudis came and brought wahhabism . 
  now you have bosnians fighting for is . 
  saudis are true cancer of this world .

   i 'm not saying that we 're right next door and our beaches are better ... we are closer . 
  and we like germans unlike ... our competition . 
  i am surprised people still fall for him . 
   i 'm belgian [ is this you ? 
  romanians like pula , do n't they ? 
   europe a ` rotting continent ' let 's stop turkish trade to this rotting continent and see what happens . 
  which side will be more rotten . 
  hi guys , croatia welcomes you . 
  we really feel your pain .

  we have 3 main dialects . 
  standard language is based on one , \u0160tokavski . 
  the other two , kajkavski & \u010cakavski have pretty much an equal amount of history , literature , regional stubbornness & etc behind them ... so trying to force these other two to `` speak standard '' would produce howling about murderous oppression or something . 
  plus , even the people who speak `` normal '' \u0160tokavski have their differences from standard language which is perceived sort of like ... pompous snobbery made up by dusty linguists . 
  they ai n't taking our `` real talk '' away from us !, 
  [ can we borrow your ideas , crazy explorer senpai ? 
  :3 ] ( https://thevieweast.wordpress.com/2009/05/16/communist-czechoslovakia-planned-construction-of-underground-tunnel/ ), 
  my opinion is that i do n't have a firm opinion - i do n't know much about the issue . 
  ca n't judge because i know i 'm missing facts . 
  is it about money ? 
  cultural and/or historical differences ? 
  mismanagement of these regions by the central government ? 
  all of the above ? 
  in general , i 'm not a complete fan of self-determination arguments , because they can lead to absurdity , whichever patch of land declaring independence the moment they feel displeased ... that 's chaos . 
  on the other hand , keeping people inside some country they do n't want to be in is no good either . 
  ideally both sides would agree to the secession , like the example of scotland where iirc london is obliged to let it happen if the scots vote to get out . 
  so , apparently spain - the central government , anyways - wo n't agree to let that happen , to no surprise ( which sane country wants to get weaker and smaller if they do n't have to ? ) . 
  i guess that then the referendum needs to have strong enough results ( 2/3 at least ) , plus it 'd help if there 's some legal loophole/historical background like what uk/usa/germany / switzerland/etc have with their parts . 
  gah , bosnia is a present-day problem cause their roads suck in comparison . 
  so not only do we have the stupidest country shape this side of chile , taking the shortcut from north-east to south-east is n't entirely smart . 
  and also , their neum is a legit problem . 
  we 're lucky in that eu will give most of the money for the bridge around it . 
  emigration has been a thing here during communism also ( we were n't behind the wall ) , and before communism . 
  basically , it started being a problem , uhhh , when steam ship tickets got cheap enough ? 
  something like half of us live outside croatia . 
  and getting into eu only made it worse simply because getting elsewhere is even easier now . 
  it 's not just the unemployed leaving , but employed also , people want bigger paychecks , and we wo n't get on germany 's level any time soon , even with minor miracles . 
  so ... we have too few doctors . 
  too few engineers . 
  and this is all young-ish people we educated with our tax money . 
  there is a silver lining , mind you . 
  even though we have many unemployed still , labor shortages are visible in many fields already , so now the employers have two options : import bosnians , or raise wages . 
  both are a good ( ish ) thing . 
  as for the aging population , and `` wait who 's gon na finance the retired people in 20-50 years ??!, 
  '' , that is a problem , but i think a greater problem is automatization that 's been killing jobs for a while now - and will continue to do so . 
  so i feel like our current model of jobs/retirements/whole economy will have to change anyways , with or without the demographic crunch . 
  uh ... the other half of the country . 
  no , seriously . 
  there 's more than just the coast to croatia ( in the lower , diagonal part of the `` v '' shape ) . 
  and the plus is that the continental part is n't overrun by tourists , which tends to make tourists complain ... about themselves ( ??! ) . 
  now , i guess people are n't as interested in the continental part because it 's `` samey-same '' when compared to hungary , austria , czech republic ( it 's like we shared a country for 800 years or something !, 
  ) , but that complaint is also kinda odd - the coast is samey-same when compared to italy . 
  i guess it 's the lack of promotion ... or the lack of sea , poor sun-deficient northerners just want a tan during vacation . 
  anyways , some exhibits : + [ vukovar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/vukovar_turm.jpg ) with its lingering war-damage and [ memorials ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/7fb78956-1f1f-4382-8067-5825dfce4f12_l.jpg ) ( there 's where the `` but i thought balkan is war-like !

  are we properly friendly even now ? 
  with our competing interests ? 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  eu functions enough so far , because we have enough common interests and benefits of cooperation . 
  but even with those , just in today 's threads you have the divisions between nord stream ii and the three seas initiative . 
  there 's that old saying - `` nations have no permanent friends or allies , they only have permanent interests . '' so let 's say the whole structure that 's keeping us civilized enough breaks apart . 
  what 's stopping any and all of us from pursuing our specific , competing interests ? 
  mutual benefit ? 
  * but we just broke the eu * , which was the best structure for the insurance of said mutual benefits . 
  in this disturbing what-if scenario , apparently we or our politicians or both decided that neither the increased economy nor the increased safety/peace that the eu brings are relevant anymore . 
  so , it 's `` every man for himself '' then . 
  all of us being small fish - yes , even germany and france - means we 're easy pickings for bigger/more belligerent powers . 
  i can only hope that my country in that case gets to be usa 's yes-man , instead of china 's or russia 's , or bloody hell , turkey and saudis have been sniffing around bosnia lately . 
  and that 's before the immigrant crisis gets into full swing . 
  these last few years , that was * nothing * . 
  assuming that humanity does n't figure out a technological way to deal with global warming ... we 're heading into another great migration period , i think . 
  only , if i 'm still alive at that point , i 'll probably join the wave that starts in africa and tries to get north . 
  this last week , for the first time ever , forest fires reached the outskirts of split , our 2nd biggest city . 
  meh , so many of our debts - both public and private - are already in euro . 
  before euro , it was deutsche mark . 
  so any theoretical sovereignty we have over our kuna is just another sad delusion , kuna has n't been independent since its inception . 
  devaluing it for the sake of exports or whatever would just make our debts go boom , so that 's not happening - period . 
  all the `` difference '' we get is just the name of the currency . 
  meanwhile , switching to euro would make travel and tourism easier , so ... we lose nothing , only potentially gain something . 
  i think you misunderstand . 
  this conversation started with `` every summer there 's a few '' , to which you responded with that being an understatement . 
  `` there 's a few '' according to what most people remember ... according to what is news-worthy . 
  tiny localized fires happening in dalmatia has n't been news for probably a thousand years now , it 's about as remarkable as `` hail falling in the north for a few minutes '' . 
  * this latest wildfire * is certainly news-worthy and it will be remembered within the sentence of `` every summer , a few wildfires '' . 
  well i guess it depends on how we count . 
  `` so a hill burned down '' is n't exactly news-worthy . 
  we need a few hills and/or houses threatened to properly remember it , otherwise it 's somewhere in the ranks of `` crazy czech tried to climb biokovo in flipflops '' . 
  this one is co-owned with hungarians , but anyways - [ the siege of szigetv\u00e1r ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_szigetv%c3%a1r ) . 
  because : + defenders : 2300 -- 3000 . 
  attackers : 100 000 -- 300 000 . 
  + casualties : everyone on the defending side , the last 600 in the final charge . 
  20 000 -- 30 000 on the attacking side . 
  then suleiman died in his tent of old age while it was happening , ottomans went back constantinople to get a new sultan , and basically vienna was n't threatened again for more than a 100 years . 
  zrinski was a general badass , too . 
  i think some hollywood editing ( throw in a romance there or at least a lot of manly bonding ) could make it a new this is sparta . 
  boring answer , but what can i do , imo it 's definitely the most beautiful : [ plitvice lakes national park .

  to tell bih and serbia apart : remember that bosniaks are muslims . 
  our idiotic country-shape is like that because those were the old military borders against ottomas . 
  so that 's why it looks like we 're trying to eat bosnia . 
  aside from the obvious people listed ( switzerland etc ) ... turkey ? 
  people , we are n't getting constantinople back . 
  it 's gone .

  you gon na let argentina have falklands ? 
   the right to self determination and self governance . 
  sounds great , but you end as what ? 
  small country dreaming of empire and outside anything important ? 
  but !!, 
  ... we have commonwealth ... sure you do , but would really have that instead of eu ? 
   the right to self determination and self governance . 
  who is taking it away from you ? 
   he would most likely say that there are too many problems with the eu and eu institutions . 
  what problems exactly ? 
   if he was a farmer a huge amount would be about the cap . 
  i am not a farmer , so i 'll pass on this one . 
   if he was a builder it could be about the influx of eastern europeans working in the building trade . 
  geeeee ... like mexicans in us , doing gardening . 
  that 's it ? 
  other people taking shittiest jobs ? 
   i have tried to be pro europe and was for quite a while . 
  however i have looked at both sides and currently i would vote to leave . 
  why ? 
  what would you gain if you left ? 
  really ? 
  you have n't mentioned one single advantage of leaving . 
  it 's just `` ohhhhh ... dei steeeeeel our jobbs '', 
  ya , thought so . 
  i am not bashing anyone or arguing ... i really just ask what people in the uk think is a benefit to leaving eu ? 
  i think people from uk are better suited to answer this than the rest of us ... why is leaving eu so popular in the uk ? 
  i am pro-eu because i really do n't want another war here and i think that common market and common laws can only help me and my country . 
  i know people here who say eu will take our country away , our sovereignty , our rights , our independence and so on . 
  people who fear brussels is some sort of conspiracy to take out resources and that foreign bankers are out to get us . 
  but , when i ask them , what benefits would we have if we do n't join i get same stupid talking points without any data and anything real . 
  `` they 'll steal our coast '' ... . retarded , but some think like this . 
  so ... again , what do anti-eu people in the uk think they 'll get if uk leaves ? 
  # 1 would uk in this position economically if it was n't in the eu ? 
  did common market hurt uk or not ? 
  is germany in trouble ? 
  would city rise as it did if there was no common market ? 
  would would happen to uk exports to the eu ? 
  # 2 freedom ... would uk actually be more or less free if they leave ? 
  in the world that is becoming multipolar , with us , china , india , russia , eu , brasil as powers or emerging powers how would uk fare ? 
  many europeans already see uk as less free than the rest of europe with you special relationship to the us and if uk leaves eu ... do you really think it would be this independent world wide lion people think it is ? 
  what is freedom these days ? 
  which countries have most freedom ? 
  # 3 scots i think they want out because they see these things and understand that eu is more about freedom than any other major nation state or block on the world scene . 
  i can tell what people who are against eu in croatia think and i am fucking surprised anyone is that retarded , but that 's for another discussion . 
  i am not asking you personally , i am interested in what those in the uk think they will get when they leave eu . 
  why is leaving eu beneficial for the uk for some people ? 
  what are your anti-eu people saying that some people think they are right ? 
  how would uk benefit from leaving if you ask a bloke who would vote to leave ... what would he say ? 
  all nice and well , but i still have n't heard one single benefit uk gets when they leave . 
  right wing , left wing , chicken wing ... what do people in the uk think they will gain if they leave eu ? 
  it 's a really simple question . 
  what are the benefits of an independent uk as opposed to uk being a member of the eu ? 
  voice ? 
  to do what ? 
  you actually confirmed what i am saying , there is no real reason for uk to leave eu . 
  i have been reading these topics and there is rarely more than `` we are an island so we want to be independent '' reasoning . 
  yes , i can understand it , but what would you actually gain if you left ? 
  i have n't heard one single ** benefit ** in any answer i got so far . 
  what are the benefits of uk leaving the eu ? 
  at least one ... name one . 
  i can understand it , there is large percentage of people who are against eu just because we left yugoslavia and there was a war for independence . 
  personally , i support joining eu ** because ** we left yugoslavia and decided we want this . 
  eu has its shortcomings , that 's bloody true , but what 's the alternative ? 
  go alone ? 
  against behemoths like us , china , india ? 
  europe 's only chance is to unite and forget all those wars and work together otherwise we will all have to learn chinese very soon . 
  there is also question of russia and how to deal with them . 
  let us not pretend that russia is some benevolent supplier of natural resources for us ... they have their own agenda and they work on it . 
  imo ... europe is n't about nation states , it 's about human rights and prosperity . 
  it 's about believing in its own people and giving them as much as possible . 
  no other nation state or group of nations takes care of its own citizens as good as eu ... . 
  i want my kids to live happy lives and enjoy their time on this earth . 
  i have seen war and i really do n't want it for my kids . 
  if we can have peace by joining eu than let us join ... and live ... enjoy ... travel ... meet other people , see the wealth of culture europe has . 
  why would anyone leave this ? 
  good for you , but what benefits are there for you if you leave eu ? 
  is n't that the question ? 
  you being an island nation is all wonderful and great and so on , but why do people in the uk think it would benefit them to leave eu in current political and strategic situation ? 
  how would uk compete with china , india , russia , us , eu ? 
  why do you think it 's better to go your own separate way when everything points that staying in the eu would actually make uk stronger ? 
  let 's talk falklands ... do you think uk is stronger in any kind of negotiations as a part of eu or if it is alone ? 
  london city ... do you really think your financial industry would benefit from saying eu to fuck off ? 
  france and germany ca n't wait for you to do that . 
  what exactly do you think you would gain ? 
  i just do n't see what would uk get if they leave ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  dreams of british empire ? 
  that wo n't happen ... so , in a world where you have china and india as rising powers with billion + people , us with its military , russia with its natural resources and eu as biggest concentration of `` first world '' conditions for its citizens ... uk would be a small player . 
  even south american countries are trying to do some sort of union and remove borders ... how would uk benefit from leaving the eu ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
   in ukraine , serbia and other countries where the russians have influence people are forced to vote between a pro-eu party and a pro-russian party you really found shining examples of democracy . 
  somehow i think their elections would be sham even without russian oligarchs . 
   it most definitely does not call for muslim killing etc. 
  really low shot by you trying to blame the serbs for everything , as usual , silence_hr . 
  jesusfuck ... poor serbs , being blamed again . 
  i never said it calls for killing of muslims . 
  the problem is that those killings happened and song sings about blood in drina . 
  i can understand why would bosnian muslims feel unconfortable when it was played . 
  you prolly have less militaristic songs in your culture , why not use those ? 
  as i said , and you can deny it as much as you like , it was inappropriate to use it because of those idiots .

  that is not the point , the right of the private organization to disinvite him does not nullify the issue of disinviting him nor the reason behind disinviting him . 
  nobody is arguing that the organizations do not have the right to disinvite him . 
   that does n't matter it really does though . 
   look , christians have the same rights as everyone else . 
  if they want to start an outcry , they are free to do so , and private organizations are free to listen or ignore it . 
  holy hell you are beyond me . 
  so it is perfectly alright for religious groups to decry private persons and for private organizations to act upon those desires if they chose so and we should all just shut up and be ok with that ? 
  move on , nothing to see here ...  do us a favor and stop your crusade against our freedom under the guise of fighting political correctness . 
  because that is what you are actually doing . 
  wtf are you talking about lol ? 
   rules are the same for everyone . 
  just because they sometimes favor someone you do n't agree with is no reason to abandon them . 
  i am not arguing about the legality of it , i am arguing about the background of political correctness behind the actions of those who disinvited a dude who obviously did not participate in hate speech . 
  ridiculous . 
   does n't a private organization have the freedom to decide who they let speak ? 
  yes it does , but it does not change the fact that they actually invited him and then disinvited him after being called by the internet feels police . 
  this is completely different from simply not inviting him at all . 
  it shows that correctness controlled their actions , even without proper cause . 
   how many christian-conservative radio stations invited dawkins and let him speak , and if they do n't invite him , are they politically incorrect ? 
  erm , firstly , the look up who disinvited him over the years , you are comparing secular apples with religious oranges . 
  secondly , a number of christian organizations to my knowledge , he even debated a number of them on invitation . 
  thirdly , was he ever disinvited because of christian outcry ? 
   and if they do n't invite him , are they politically incorrect ? 
  again , the places he gets disinvited from are not religious organizations or institutions , he got disinvited from kpfa berkeley ffs , not muslims r ' us . 
  i was not rebutting that point , i was merely adding nuance to the fact that political correctness towards islam in the west is a real issue despite the obviously ridiculous tunneling of trump holding a glowing orb with the saudi ruler like some bond villain while his followers are advocating a complete nuclear destruction of that entire peninsula . 
  you do realize that ethnic or cultural homogeneity does not require a 100 % purity margin right ? 
  you just need an overwhelming majority that dominates the identity of the minorities . 
  you reap what you sow . 
  if a guy like richard dawkins is getting his appearances revoked because of merely criticizing islam , then you do have an issue with political correctness . 
  [ they are here .

  probably that at first but we will probably nullify or at least lower the effects of aging on the body within the next few decades . 
  you will perhaps still look older and older on the outside ( unless skin aging is also fixed ) but your body will remain strong and healthy for longer . 
  then it 's inevitable hot war with soviet union instead of the cold war . 
   to be fair , it is still kind of crazy eeeh , sounds like the ultimate goal of globalism to me .

  also , no bidet . 
  no bidet , no deal . 
  the rurik dynasty themselves ordered a chronicle that wrote that they were invited there . 
  also , the first list of the rus army assembly we have mentions 12 slavic tribes as warriors alongside the varangians , this was not an army of foreigners in those lands . 
   like they are fleeing for something . 
  getting payed 3-4 euro 's per hour regardless of which degree , experience or knowledge they have . 
   novgorod does n't matter anyway . 
  it does though . 
  it was one of the major rus states and made up a large portion of what later became russia . 
   the modern state of russia is a result of the unification of the principalities by the grand duchy of moscow , which was a vassal of the golden horde that is not the point . 
  by that notion , russia did not exist during the mongol conquest so the argument is moot from the start . 
   your way of thinking is like saying that rome did n't conquer gaul because it did n't conquer all the celt lands . 
  see how absurd that is ? 
  ridiculous reasoning , as gaul was a regional term , not a political entity , with numerous tribes within it and did not constitute anything outside the borders of what was then considered gaul , first as a regional term and then as a roman province . 
  tributary does not mean conquered territory or vassal state . 
  novgorod was not even under direct yoke . 
  your arguing would be like saying that the roman empire was part of the hun empire during attila because rome payed tribute to them to leave them alone . 
  damn , i have been discovered .

  sooometimes , all i need is jihad that i breathe allah to love you, 
   some say he did it only for glory at home , while others see it as an example of power projection to scare his opponents . 
  it was probably a show of power to the germanic tribes who were always looking at gaul . 
  he knew he would likely spend the next years either conquering britannia or settling scores down south , so he had to secure gaul . 
  he released 20 000 gaul prisoners and sent them to their families for the same reason . 
  [ even if you are the mongols . 
  yelets was a part of the golden horde at the time and had basically nothing to do with the rus though . 
  not really , that is more of a myth . 
  they conquered the area between kiev and moscow with the surrounding regions , which was a bunch of rivaling principalities at the time , but they did not conquer the largest rus state , novgorod , which was nearly a third the size of the entire rus lands at the time . 
  so no , not even the mongols fully conquered russia . 
  the battle of zela was a major victory and also the first instance of complete foreigners being used as legionaries in rome 's army . 
  i believe you and others , judging by the downvotes , misread my comment as me stating that donald is a capable populist/politician . 
  i was speaking in general terms . 
  the us has a much older democracy than most european countries though . 
  i believe you and others , judging by the downvotes , misread my comment as me stating that donald is a capable populist/politician lol . 
  i was speaking in general terms . 
  that is because germany has shitty populists . 
  well , most countries have shitty populists because most populists are shitty . 
  but i assure you , if at any moment someone actually capable and with a positive message turns up , and is a populist , he/she will wreak havoc onto whatever political scene he/she emerges from . 
  give a few examples then of a settled society doing this in the past 2-3000 years . 
  the only one i could think of is the conquistador wipe out of the men in the americas and all of the soldiers taking for themselves entire harems of native women each . 
   when a tribe conquers another and impregntes the women and kills all the men and boys , what the fuck do you think happens to the conquered genes ? 
  when did that ever happen in organized societies ? 
  i am not talking about hunter gatherers here . 
   this does n't follow . 
  they where converts because they where conquered and forced to take up the religion or remain second class citizens of the umayyad caliphate and pay jizya thats history . 
  it does , because that is what nearly always happened .

  that comes as a surprise though that people have confidence into merkel , however with polls it 's always the issue of how the questions are asked . 
  i guess i am also biased because i do n't like merkel or the way she looks , at all , so i think others are on same page with me . 
  i see . 
  thing is though that there are many countries right now in the eu with questionable positions regarding many things . 
  like even the ceta is again blocked by spain out of nowhere . 
  then you got the v4 , benelux and other countries apparently meeting up to stir a grand conspiracy against the possible french-german axis . 
  however , i really do n't know if what they are saying in the paper is something actually happening or just meaningless words . 
  people die every day from various causes . 
  i wish we could all live infinitely , but that is n't possible . 
  i am an animal , that does n't mean i wo n't have problems with people dying or being killed , i am saying that people will die regardless whether human trafficking keeps going on or is halted such as . 
  ` france-german led europe ' - i do n't see that as happening . 
  i mean , i feel like many people and politicians are very much dissatisfied with german leadership within the eu due to the refugee crisis . 
  am i wrong though ? 
  i mean , even germans and german politicians are fed up with ` her ' ideas and policies . 
  what values though ? 
  i do n't think the value of the ruling class should be regarded as the value of the country . 
  people are animals , and many value non-human animals more than humans they never met . 
  that 's why people cry when their dog dies , but do n't cry when they see someone drowning in the mediterranean on tv . 
  you do n't get anything i am saying . 
  there is more to legalising same-sex marriage than just helping people with same-sex attraction . 
  it is an ideological move which will shape the lifestyle of people such as . 
  if it is good or not - only time can tell . 
  well , it 's like feeding cats . 
  they will simply reproduce so much that you ca n't help them any more , and then more of them will die yearly than if you did n't start feeding them at all . 
  i mean i am just being realistic here . 
  yup . 
  their natality is only offset with emigration , but which again will become a problem elsewhere . 
  in croatia there were less than a hundred of them post-ww2 , now there are over 20 thousand iirc . 
  they do many problems for me , they keep coming to my neighbourhood and steal any unprotected things they find and value . 
  thanks !,

  however , to me stereotyping romania based upon them does n't make any sense . 
  it is like stereotyping russia , belgium or france based upon their muslim population . 
  as far as i know , it was agreed upon that by 2024 the 2 % target would be met . 
  i do n't think there are any hard commitments within nato on military expenditure but that they are more of suggestive nature . 
  i think the mafia is largely behind the trafficking of migrants , so they probably already have tasks for many of the migrants getting into britain , and those tasks probably are n't of good nature . 
  the left ca n't stand any hard-line opposition to their views . 
  i think such attitude will play out against themselves eventually . 
  you are all drawing wrong conclusions . 
  endorsing own nazi past is n't inherently about hating whether jews , poles or others . 
  i am glad croatia was on side of the axis during ww2 , but that does n't mean i am against any of the people that were being persecuted or genocided . 
  i liked the initiative though . 
  we already have sell-outs in europe due to foreign capital buying them . 
  foreign investments should be regulated in ways that will protect eu interests . 
  i am not naive . 
  i am aware that something is very strange about trump which makes me believe that no matter how the meeting ends up being , he wo n't change his attitude . 
  however , macron seemed to have tamed putin in paris recently . 
  maybe he knows something we do n't . 
  regardless , even though i am for an eu more independent from the us ( in which trump is helpful ) , i still would want the eu to maintain long-term friendship with the us , and meeting with the us president is part of that . 
  it is now important to croatia due to all the circumstances like the continual blackmails due to the dispute and even harsh violations of the arbitration agreement which was signed under the blackmail ( they had continually direct contact with the judges during the process through which they lobbied and influenced it ) . 
  the slovenian government even threatened to block the borders to halt tourists from coming if croatia does n't accept the outcome of the arbitration . 
  we should n't give into such type of behaviour . 
  i am glad that trump will visit france . 
  hopefully it will recover relations between eu and trump , especially since he will also visit poland and germany before that . 
  i did n't say we are , but that if slovenia did n't make such a big deal of it , croats would hardly care about the dispute at all . 
  i find it funny since it is only d-day for slovenia . 
  in croatia people would n't even know anything about that border dispute if slovenia did n't make such a big deal of it since they want access to open sea . 
  that is amazing since those boats could n't keep on with human trafficking while in such state of limbo . 
  as for people dying , people will die regardless . 
  more tolerance of human trafficking = more people engaging in dangerous activities to get to europe = more dead people . 
  glad to hear that . 
  no more human trafficking and illegal immigration please . 
  but how did brexit blow that hole ? 
  for me , the hole created by brexit is the loss of net contributions the uk made , not new projects which are possibly only due to brexit . 
   `` we wo n't have the uk with us any more , but they were net payers despite the thatcher rebate , so we will have a gap of 10 to 11 billion euros a year , '' oettinger told a press conference as he unveiled the commission 's proposals for the budget . 
  that 's not 20 billion euros . 
  this is my favourite - http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/jovan_i._dereti%c4%87 :d, 
  i know it is important , but there are mythomans in serbia , or amongst serbs such as . 
  not saying there are n't such elsewhere ( i mean people which live nearby to me think how croats are ` chosen peoplenfrom god ' and they see in every coincidence there is some kind of sacred connection ) . 
  but the thing is , i have the feeling that they are n't considered as crazy in serbia as here and that they are given much more space there . 
  12 important things for serbia happening over the span of over 600 years on one date . 
  considering that some of them are of only secondary relevance to serbia and events which were not specifically about serbia at all , i call it really mythomania . 
  also , considering that one of the mentioned event was merely an anniversary of one event of the past mentioned here already does n't make it seem much genuine either . 
  do n't believe everything the media says . 
  regardless , this has to be clear , the eu does n't exist as a uniform political entity . 
  as such , the eu ca n't really defend its own interests adequately either , whether in the balkans or elsewhere . 
  i think that recognition of kosovo is one of the examples about split policy since not all eu countries have the same official stance on recognition yet at all . 
  no it is n't why you are leaving . 
  even though i am with the uk on this , this is n't why you are leaving . 
  especially since this happened after the referendum already . 
  i am not making any claims here such as , i am saying that people are oversimplifying things and there is no way to predict whether lgbt rights are good or not , i. e. whether they will survive into the future or not . 
  same sex attraction is n't a lifestyle , being gay may already be more like that , depending on how you define gay as . 
  you claim it is irrelevant to you - it is to me just as well irrelevant if someone i know had a same-sex marriage instead of just a same-sex relation , however , it is n't just about individuals , but society as a whole . 
  and yesm legalising same-sex marriage does legitimise same sex relations and through that encourage them . 
  people feeling they would be persecuted or ashamed for being in such relations are more likely to not engage in them . 
  but , as i said , in the end we do n't know whether it is good or not since we ca n't predict the future that well . 
  as i said , legalising same-sex marriage is equivalent to promoting families revolving around them . 
  it is n't just something that will ` make people 's life easier ' , but something which will have ideological impact upon society . 
  that 's the supposed primary outcome of it . 
  the secondary in society is political alignment with the west , embracement of diversity and fragmentising ones culture ( ` multiculturalism ' ) . 
  now , whether these are good or bad , is n't something that can be predicted . 
  because maybe certain societies do n't want to promote that kind of lifestyle for gays because they do n't think it is good ( i. e. to have families with a same-sex partner ) . 
  some say that it would be better if in a society gays have family-oriented lifestyles with a same-sex partner than either a non-family-oriented lifestyle or one with an opposite sex person , however , there is no way you could predict which of those would be better , only try to argue in favour of the view you feel closest to and push that . 
  i am aware of all what you are saying , i am just saying that a high unemployment rate does n't mean they will find the necessary labour to start anything in croatia . 
  i do n't think so at all . 
  the unemployment rates do n't mean those people are either qualified or interested to work there . 
  despite high unemployment rates , croatia has a shortage of workers .

  yes but also other european industries . 
  the eu hels a lot to protect european economies .

  i have never ever ever seen a mainstream left-wing politician comment about these issues other than just crying racism . 
  oh if only they knew it was that easy !, 
  quick contact their governments !, 
  mr. internet geo-political expert has saved europe !, 
   main capital as opposed to secondary capital ? 
  honestly i 'd rather have the rain , i fucking hate snow . 
  it 's pretty for a whole few hours until it turns to slush that i have to walk through to work . 
   you fund your own pension . 
  a private pension . 
  great , but then i should n't be paying into the state 's pension system thus i should be getting a bigger paycheck . 
  so what i might as well drop dead when i exit the workforce because i did n't want any children ? 
  i see , that makes sense . 
  it 's kinda weird that the entire system depends on magic money that just appears out of nowhere though , can that even be sustainable long term ? 
  why would this be a bad thing really ? 
   give him a year , if he lasts that long , then judge . 
  sure , but i 'm not really optimistic , he apparently has former ties with hdz which is in no way a good thing . 
  they would , but then the pm would n't be some random guy that was chosen in literally hours . 
  well i personally do n't think so . 
  when the plan was still that he forms the government with most there were at least negotiations happening , it did n't feel so cloak-and-dagger like this did . 
  and also he suggested a well known person for pm ( the leader of most ) which is more sensible in my opinion . 
  him forming the government would probably still be a betrayal of the voters of both him and the most guy but definitely not on the same scale as this . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm really hoping for the business guy to do some good but i 'm not optimistic . 
   tell us what violates democratic rules ? 
  rushed , hurried , behind-the-scenes last minute `` negotiations '' and choosing a random business guy as pm literally the last day before the deadline . 
  * technically * they did n't violate anything but the whole thing is fishy as fuck and honestly in a sane system would be illegal . 
  he may be butthurt but how is he not right ? 
  who the fuck is this new guy ? 
  there was no mention of him until yesterday , the voters have every right to feel deceived . 
  plus the most guys said they would n't enter a coalition with just a single party but here we are . 
  rose tinted glasses . 
  she was at least as useless as him since everybody in her party was preoccupied with stabbing her in the back and getting ready for the criminal part of the party to reassume command . 
  yeah i do n't know what to think of this . 
  i 'm afraid he 'll just be an unwilling puppet of hdz ( the criminal organization that robbed croatian citizens of billions ) . 
  and also he literally was n't mentioned anywhere until today , how is that fair to the citizens of croatia ? 
  he should have been mentioned as a potential pm candidate before the elections . 
  why is that exactly ? 
  are the elected some kind of radicals ? 
  apparently for a significant of percentage of them , yes . 
  but is n't that their culture ? 
  should n't we be accepting their culture ? 
  they told me i should accept other cultures because no culture is better than the other , i 'm confused now . 
  [ le ] terally just logged in to comment right ? 
  people who are that stupid as teenagers wo n't be that much smarter as adults . 
  this is way beyond typical teenage rebellion . 
  my guess is the recent immigrants are radicalizing the descendants of immigrants . 
  i understand your point of view but for whatever reason muslims seem to be the exception to the `` moderates changing with the time '' . 
  recently they 've only been changing for the worse , with even 3rd generation descendants of immigrants turning to extremism . 
  i mostly blame islam itself for this because it very easily allows for this behavior , that 's why i treat it differently than christianity which has more or less been steadily becoming less radical throughout history , or at least the last 200 years . 
  i 'm only extreme when it comes to enforcing the protection of freedoms . 
  if a thing you do limits other people 's freedom then someone should stop you doing the thing , it 's that simple . 
  well yeah that 's probably a bit too extreme but things like that would work , eventually . 
  east germany is basically almost completely atheist/agnostic because of communist repression . 
  not that i 'm saying we should be beating muhammad out of them but some form of saying `` we do n't like your religion '' would probably move things in the right direction . 
  i am for liberties . 
  islam is against those liberties . 
  thus i am against islam . 
  it 's not fucking rocket science . 
  but then he 'd have to pull his head out of his own arse to go read a dictionary . 
   whine some more . 
  great level of discourse you have there . 
  better plug your ears to any criticism and hum the narrative to yourself . 
  sd probably would n't make a great governing party and probably have a great deal of bigots in their ranks but they 're clearly a reaction to some serious shit that 's been happening , they did n't get that much support for nothing , this has been a long time coming . 
  it 's clearly just neo-nazi slander and fearmongering , those poor poor immigrants would never do such a thing . 
  who 's attacking without actual arguments now ? 
   it 's a journalist 's job to ask loaded , inflammatory questions . 
  not really but even if we assume that to be true all the question for the immigrants were in the vein of : `` are you being bullied ? 
  :( :( '' with the answer : `` yes we are being bullied . 
  :( :( '' also to state without reservations that multiculturalism works in the uk is just beyond dumb . 
  the reporter kept asking loaded , inflammatory questions and only painted the immigrants as victims . 
  there was n't one shred of honest journalism to be found in that video . 
  eugh , the guardian . 
  i 'm sure sd has it 's fair share of neo-nazi douchebags but this was just way too obviously biased . 
  piss poor journalism . 
  which is exactly what i was trying to say ... 
  it is on us to accept them . 
  it is possible to just be xenophobic for the sake of being xenophobic you know . 
  if they behave by our rules it is on us to accept them that way , that 's not `` pc madness '' . 
   that it is our duty to figure out how to integrate them more successfully that is both our and their duty , why do they always put all the blame on the native population ? 
  i 'm not saying it 's not a vicious cycle , but really what else is there to do ? 
  yeah but i honestly do n't see another choice . 
  if a great power does n't end this quickly the war will rage on for perhaps even years . 
   the european left has betrayed it 's classical enlightment ideals . 
  and is now drowning into the muddy waters of postmodern relativism . 
  perfect explanation . 
  i 'm still hoping for a new left movement that will return to it 's enlightenment roots . 
  are n't the czech overreacting just a tiny bit ? 
  i do n't think many even want to go to the czech republic . 
  i mean we have tens of thousands of them crossing croatia every week and nobody is that pissy about it . 
  i 'd understand if germans protested like this though . 
   if you see them as humans at least before they go into extremism , you have a chance to reach them . 
  sure , but after they drink the kool-aid , they 're not human to me anymore , i do n't care what was the reason for them becoming like that . 
  they 're trying to paint isis supporters and fighters as `` misguided youth '' . 
  they 're fucking psychopaths and should be kept away from the rest of society or killed , i do n't believe in ` rehabilitating ' these fuckwads . 
  it 's almost like they 're being apologetic for isis . 
  fucking awful article . 
  whoop-dee-do . 
  islam is a religion with a very troubling dogma , it 's only salvageable if they completely ignore that mohammad was basically batshit insane ( which most do ) . 
  the fact that `` most * real * muslims are shocked and appaled '' is completely irrelevant , it 's still a terrible religion since it allows for this kind of behavior . 
  trust me , we have much bigger issues at hand . 
  none of the migrants actually want to stay in croatia anyway , they 'll get out by any means necessary .

europe : abridged, 
  croatian wikipedia is pretty pathetic . 
  english is almost always better . 
  even with some croatia related stuff , english has better organised and laid out articles that talk about important stuff . 
  and croatian wikipedia has over 100k articles , so it 's not a ghost town . 
  holy shit , that 's middle earth !, 
  that was pretty great , i have to say . 
  and not a single mention of h\u00e4yh\u00e4 . 
   now i wan na create one about croatia . 
  after 50 of his soldiers were held hostages and used as human shields and he was assured by mladic that bosniaks were just being transferred . 
  what was he to do after he saw his men tied with their hands around power poles while serbs were marching the bosniaks to kill sites ? 
  the very attack on a `` safe area '' showed mladic had no regard for un protocol and he would have killed the dutchbat if they stood in his way . 
  i do n't blame him for saving his men , when his men dying would have changed nothing . 
  mostly it 's cool . 
  there is a minority who still passionately hate serbs and are vocal and open about it , however they have little to no influence on the culture . 
  only occasionally their sentiments flare up for special occasions ( most recently for the whole gotovina ordeal ) but otherwise they are ignored . 
  your girlfriend was probably a part of this minority . 
  furthermore there is a layer of society which is n't openly against serbs , but prefer to have them keep to their little serb pockets and would chuck a fit if their child was to marry one . 
  but as long they have nothing to do with serbs , they 're happy to live and let live . 
  majority of people are kind of meh about it . 
  for them the war is over , and while there is no great love for serbs , they recognise that mistakes were made on both sides and shit happened and the point is to look forward and accept that we have to live with the serbs and be civilised neighbours . 
  if you are a serb living in croatia , your chances of having any dramas caused over your nationality are very very slim , unless you go out looking for it . 
  do n't think they would . 
  all of those ideas are pretty basic parts of being a croat . 
  i think majority would support it even if they are super bitter about the current situation . 
  what ? 
  the failure of the dutch battalion to protect srebrenica from mladic ? 
  i would n't blame you . 
  what were some 450 soldiers gon na do against vrs ? 
  sure it would have been poetic if dutchbat went down in a storm of bullets , but the fact is that ultimately their response was irrelevant . 
  they were n't equipped or prepared to fight that fight and they were abandoned by nato . 
  dying or surviving , it changes nothing , in which case i prefer surviving so we do n't have to cite the numbers of srebrenica victims as 8000 bosniaks and 450 dutchbat unprofor personnel kia . 
  if you want to blame anyone for the faliure to protect srebrenica `` safe area '' blame unprofor or un at large not netherlands itself . 
  well , i lack any deep understanding of finnish history or culture . 
  i do know about this dude who happens to be the most successful sniper in the history of modern war and a surrounding campaign where 300 000 finns held off 4 million soviets . 
  so , i think you can see how given those two my mind instantly goes to h\u00e4yh\u00e4 and the winter war . 
  none of this is meant to detract from many other finnish achievements and i welcome you to educated me about some other ones , should you wish to . 
  it 's not like one excludes the other . 
  what about simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 and the winter war ?

  main reason why i 'm happy that croatia is entering eu is that we 'll finally be part of things like this ... 
  is n't this going to collapse cyprus banks as people withdraw their money and banks do n't have the funds needed for day to day trading ? 
  and croatia .

  my jimmies are rustled that slovenians are in the central europe but croatia is in balkans . 
  slovenians too are dirty slavs , they belong with us . 
  been said million time i 'm sure , but just to continue echoing the sentiment , i too would not stay at any place that bans a fellow eu citizen . 
  withdrawing benefits of eu is not punishing .

  create a distributed public blockchain validated by crypto and issue each voter one time secret token ( after you verify their identity ) that they can use to anonymous add their vote to the blockchain .

  what i got from this is that she fucked up for the second time ( after first time they let it slide ) and then when that was pointed out to her she was incredolous they would not let her in anyway cause ... she tried really hard ? 
  the irony here is that she 's from a country that employs what are essentially thugs to do its border checks . 
  also , she was being deported to usa , why did n't the usa government pay for her ticket ? 
  i know somebody who got deported from germany to australia and australian government gave him a choice of a ticket to any australian state capital and he just had to pay the government back once he started working again . 
  see , i would . 
  if eu + norway and switzerland nations are competing amongst themselves then i 'd pick my favourite , but if i saw one of aforementioned nations compete against usa i 'd feel duty bound to support them . 
  is that silly ? 
  i do . 
  when people ask me where i 'm from i often say `` europe '' . 
  maily because croatia is not a big country and people do n't instantly get where it is or who we are . 
  by european they can quickly place me in a proper context without feeling stupid about not knowing where some tiny country is .

  the merkel has no limits . 
  raki is pretty good . 
  i also like the concept of harems ... 
  damn , those sanctions are really starting to set in . 
   i simply stated the facts without going into historical background . 
  it is true that serbs were a majority in most parts of bosnia in 1991 and it is true that bosniaks were overall majority in bosnia , while being located in large cities . 
  is that not true ? 
  [ the vast majority of bosnia 's population lived in large cities and areas around it , including the vast majority of serbs . 
  ] ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/bosnia/population_bosnia.jpg ) prior to agrarian reforms , a very very high percent of bosnia 's landowners were bosnian muslims . 
  ( iirc , 90 % or so ) not very many serbs . 
  the serbs living in most of those blue areas are most likely living on * stolen land * . 
  you know , illegal squatting ? 
  you can not declare something yours , which was never rightfully yours , after you 've stolen it . 
  had the serb government of old yugoslavia not passed those reforms , the muslims would have kept their land . 
  from there , it is very difficult to say with certainty that those areas which are blue now would have been blue at all in this case . 
  100 years ago is pretty recent in terms of history . 
  especially european history . 
  do you know the battle that you serbs love to celebrate ? 
  you know , the battle of kosovo ? 
  well , that happened 625 years ago . 
  and during the 1918-1919 agrarian reforms , the serb peasants fucked over the bosniaks by forcing them off their rightfully owned lands . 
  those lands that `` belong '' to the serbs in your map . 
  did the serbs originally live on the land or were they imported by the muslim landowners ? 
  who knows . 
  did the bosniaks ever receive reparations , which was part of the plan ? 
  come to think of it : serbs fucked everybody over during the original kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  besides that , my major point stands : only 54,4 % of bosnians voted during the election . 
  you 're disregarding about 1,728,998 people . 
  yeah , the fuck is wrong with these barbarians ... 
  [ what did i just read ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zfi1v4z.jpg ) i was agreeing with the user , religion is stupid when you are pretty much the same people . 
  the whole point of bosnian serbs not wanting to identify with the bosniaks is because the bosniaks are `` turks '' in the eyes of bosnian serbs . 
  they 'd rather get some sort of revenge on them . 
  however , both bosniaks and bosnian serbs picked up large amounts of turkish influence . 
  the only difference being that bosniaks are muslims and serbs are orthodox christians . 
  thus , there is no point of calling one side `` turks '' and hating them for that when you yourself picked up the same influence from the occupier . 
  the bosniak-croat conflict is another story for another time . 
  there 's a funny dialogue from a serbian movie on bosnian serb hypocrisy with regards to turks and musilims . 
  ( serbs hate turks/muslims . ),

  01:07:31 how about something sweet ? 
  tulumba ? 
  01:07:35 you fight against the muslims and eat turkish sweets ? 
  01:07:37 - what did you say ? 
  - nothing . 
  in general , your map sucks . 
   here you can find the 1991 census map : https://imgur.com/ey2rdw7[1] [ here 's a better one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/demobih1991.png )  the map does n't go into much detail . 
  no , no it does not . 
   if a municipality has an absolute majority , even in the case of 51-49 % ratio , darker color is used -- the one that represents the ethnicity with the absolute majority . 
  you did this in br\u010dko . 
  you completely disregarded the non-serb parties for the rs option and counted them as serbs . 
  there were a few . 
  i looked at the statistics from both sides of br\u010dko and came up with : for federation option : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- bosniak | 6305 | 59,7 croat | 2507 | 23,7 multi-ethnic | 1650 | 15,6 serb | 102 | 1,0 ** total ** | 10.564 | 100 for republika srpska option : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- serb | 10862 | 95,5 bosniak | 295 | 2,6 none | 153 | 1,3 croat | 60 | 0,5 ** total ** | 11.370 | 100 giving the overall numbers : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- serb | 10964 | 49,99 bosniak | 6600 | 30,09 croat | 2567 | 11,70 multi-ethnic | 1803 | 8,22 ** total ** | 21.934 | 100 a nice way to completely disregard other ethnicities living in the municipality . 
  this map does not take into account the percentage of ethnicity that actually voted in that municipality . 
  the turnout for the bosnian elections was about 54,4 % ( iirc ) , so there is a good number of people that did not vote . 
  there is a possibility of serb majority and there is the same possibility of non-serb majority . 
  let 's look at a non-dominant municipality , shall we ? 
  i choose mostar . 
  almost exactly the same number of valid votes for both presidential and parliament . 
  ( presidential : 47.209 | parliament : 46.756 ) parliament results : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- croat | 21.215 | 45,4 bosniak | 20.105 | 43,0 multi-ethnic | 4969 | 10,6 serb | 467 | 1,0 ** total ** | 46.756 | 100 presidential results : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- croat | 26.064 | 55,2 bosniak | 20.865 | 44,2 multi-ethnic | 280 | 0,6 serb | 0 | 0,0 ** total ** | 47.209 | 100 two different results .

  the habsburgs are austrian , not hungarian .

  first of all . 
  you are quite wrong about the `` spreading '' . 
  number one , the conquests were mostly expeditionary . 
  with the exception of maybe soutwest russia and the crimean peninsula . 
  exploration and skrimishes for slaves , artisans , arable land and loot . 
  the armies were no more larger then 50k . 
  i do n't know what you are imagining when you think they conquered an area but the populations mostly fled or were exterminated . 
  besides , the occupations were n't that long to have an impact as you see . 
  high cheek bones , eye shape , hair color . 
  these are slavic , not really mongoloid . 
  number 2 , if you really really want to see mixing between `` european '' and mongoloid genes . 
  i suggest you look at the likes of kazachstans ( really any - stan country ) and my favorite example is persia . 
  besides . 
  if you really do n't believe me , you can look up matrilinial and patrilinial haplogroups on google for the countries you are interesting . 
  except for the magyars which are distantly related to the huns etc. 
  are you implying conquest = settlement ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about mongol ? 
  are you retarded or do you just pretend to be ignorant ? 
  there is a shitton of those in ghana and south africa . 
  zimbabwe not so much . 
  south africa might be your best bet if you want ethnic immigration of traditionally european communties .

  then you will have no problem with chekov . 
  the guy just has a way of describing people that just clicks . 
  here are a few qoutes to get you fired up  if you ca n't distinguish people from lap-dogs , you should n't undertake philanthropic work . 
   the unhappy are egotistical , base , unjust , cruel , and even less capable of understanding one another than are idiots . 
  unhappiness does not unite people , but separates them ...  each of us is full of too many wheels , screws and valves to permit us to judge one another on a first impression or by two or three external signs . 
   you look at any poetic creature : muslin , ether , demigoddess , millions of delights ; then you look into the soul and find the most ordinary crocodile !, 
   the sea has neither meaning nor pity . 
   it is not only the prisoners who grow coarse and hardened from corporeal punishment , but those as well who perpetrate the act or are present to witness it . 
   life is a vexatious trap ; when a thinking man reaches maturity and attains to full consciousness he can not help feeling that he is in a trap from which there is no escape . 
   there is nothing more awful , insulting , and depressing than banality . 
   death can only be profitable : there 's no need to eat , drink , pay taxes , offend people , and since a person lies in a grave for hundreds or thousands of years , if you count it up the profit turns out to be enormous . 
   by poeticizing love , we imagine in those we love virtues that they often do not possess ; this then becomes the source of constant mistakes and constant distress . 
   who keeps the tavern and serves up the drinks ? 
  the peasant . 
  who squanders and drinks up money belonging to the peasant commune , the school , the church ? 
  the peasant . 
  who would steal from his neighbor , commit arson , and falsely denounce another for a bottle of vodka ? 
  the peasant . 
   people who live alone always have something on their minds that they would willingly share . 
   there are no small number of people in this world who , solitary by nature , always try to go back into their shell like a hermit crab or a snail . 
   if you really think about it , everything is wonderful in this world , everything except for our thoughts and deeds when we forget about the loftier goals of existence , about our human dignity . 
   better a debauched canary than a pious wolf . 
   country acquaintances are charming only in the country and only in the summer . 
  in the city in winter they lose half of their appeal . 
   by nature servile , people attempt at first glance to find signs of good breeding in the appearance of those who occupy more exalted stations . 
   love , friendship , respect , do not unite people as much as a common hatred for something . 
  hope this helps indibro !, 
  i read it in bosnian/croatian . 
  on russian literature . 
  basically anything by tolstoy and chekov is solid gold . 
  they are also a bit more digestable . 
  warning for chekov , not for the fainthearted . 
  the man is a depression train of feels . 
  i admit . 
  doestoyevski does to much descriptive rants . 
  the amount of detail he puts in a scene is enough to make a small play about but if you are able to power through it you get a real gem of a book .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline#list ) just the other day i was randomly reading about europe in a wiki-hole , ran into that old definition that as a continent , it 's a `` peninsula of peninsulas '' . 
  that checks out , the world average for coast/area ratio is 7.80 , quite a few european countries are above that . 
   you do realize not all can reach european quality of life or height in their civilization due to their own limitations , careful now . 
  you almost used `` untermensch '' there .

  no , i 've seen it ... in at least half of the `` come and see '' descriptions . 
  people complaining that * we 're not balkan enough * - cause i do n't think my first description exists in europe , or if it does , then not here ? 
  yeah , i 've heard that happen too . 
  except they rarely say it that honestly , they 're not gon na say `` but where 's balkan :o '' they 'll say `` urgh , too touristy .

  i do n't think their memory reaches that far , see how all they 're talking about is the 90 's .

  based on the current state of your opened chapters , you should be in eu by then . 
  so , you 'll be able to lobby for euromonies for the coastal road at the very least , using the same adriatic -  greece arguments ( i expect our lot will help with that too , it 's in all our interests that road gets built ) . 
  after that , it 's up to albania , and they already seem half-done on this map , and by that time they 'll be able to lobby in the same way , so ... as for bosnia , yeah that 's a mess . 
  i do n't think they 'll be getting into eu any time soon , and i 'm not sure how interested eu will even be to build the bosnian corridor when we all already have the coastal + the one through serbia .

  have you seen [ how to write about balkans ? 
  ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/lily-lynch/how-to-write-about-balkans ) i lmao 'd so much on that , especially this :  however , you know that news of this `` progress '' will be met with disappointment by some of your readers and colleagues . 
  complaints have already been lodged . 
  dubrovnik now seems `` too polished '' . 
  restaurant menus in some of the region 's hotspots are now `` too refined '' . 
  porto montenegro is `` over-manicured '' . 
  its `` swanky hotels '' are `` utterly soulless '' . 
  these places have become too european and thus , insufficiently balkan for adventurous europeans on bargain vacations . 
  imagine that , fearless hipsters come here for a `` daring adventure in the wild lands '' ... and get orderly `` here 's your cheque , have a good day , next please ! '', 
  on the toll booths . 
  could be that , could be also our own fault and unrealistic expectations/perceptions of `` better places '' . 
  national sport in pretty much all of ex-yu is * complaining * . 
  to listen to the people here speak , a clueless outsider would conclude we live in the middle of dr congo . 
  and then you get the oddness of some of our folk going to london for example , and then reviewing all the good stuff , but also adding `` and man , they have these * bad blocks * in the city , basically you 're not recommended to go there after 9 pm , how * weird * is that ! '', 
  but since we 're professional complainers , we do n't appreciate that we basically do n't have such blocks in our cities . 
  and that pattern repeats a lot . 
  we look at our lamer economy and hate on that , but we do n't consider why the coffee shops of stuttgart are kinda empty during the work-week , like they were when i visited in january 2006 ( even our most remote tiny-village watering holes are never empty , even if there 's a blizzard outside ) . 
  stuff like that . 
  [ relevant !,

  sooooooo ... after us and hungary finish getting connected , and we have the last stage of the coastal road done , what next ? 
  montenegro and albania , to connect the northern adriatic with greece ? 
  or - bosnia ? 
  mm , we 're very low on murder , violent crime , incarceration , internal conflict etc etc. 
  high on for example `` perceptions of criminality '' , and that one makes me wonder : is it the people overestimating how criminal this place is ( like ignoring our good violent crime stats ) , or is it just the `` perception of corruption '' ? 
  as in , soft crime that comes from sleazy politicians , capitalist pigdogs etc. 
  idk . 
  yes and no . 
  for all that we get a bad * perception * of safety by outsiders , balkan is peaceful in the majority of factors . 
  [ watch the map ] ( http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/ ) by clicking around the different indicators . 
  hell , if there are any particularly `` unsafe '' regions of europe today , it 'd be ukraine ( war , d'oh ) , russia ( homicide rate ) , and some western countries ( terrorism ) . 
  well yeah it 's peaceful now ... it was theoretically peaceful in yuga too . 
  but we still have veterans who remember `` how to war '' , so to speak . 
  ( and yeah , the scale of panic in the west seems disproportionate to me , * considering * . ), 
  as for the million + cities , i think it depends . 
  for example prague felt as peaceful/safe as zagreb/osijek to me ... more peaceful than split , which is much smaller . 
  then another example , vienna felt somewhat more `` safe '' than budapest , and they 're comparable in size .

  because you have serious connections for `` fictional jobs that were invented for social peace or connected people '' , or you 're in a field like it where you need to know code , which you learned in your spare time anyways . 
  or you 'd like to be poor , for whatever reason . 
  otherwise , you 'll go to a stem field in college , well you do n't need the `` history of art '' . 
  or you 'll go to languages , well you 'll never meet higher math again in your life . 
  you need history for neither . 
  so , you cheat those in high school ( or even primary school , up to a point ) , because our schooling is jack of all trades , master of nothing , recent graduates are kinda useless to employers , bla bla . 
  in matura : you have croatian , math , english ( or some other foreign , like german ) , plus the optional 4th ( or even 5th ) subject depending on your college . 
  like biology for medicine , history for history , and so on . 
  i went to the new matura because bologna system and its friends said my old matura did n't count , because fuck logic . 
  first : the new one is easier than what my gymnasium had before . 
  second : if you ca n't pass the croatian with a 2 , you 're an illiterate hillbilly . 
  if you ca n't pass math , you have no business entering any of the stem fields or economics or any college that asks for math , which is the majority of colleges . 
  if you ca n't pass english or german , shame on you , do you think croatia is usa and uk and does n't need at least some basic foreign ? 
  ditto for the `` optional '' 4th subject specific colleges ask for . 
  so tl ; dr : you can cheat , but it 's useless if you 'll looking to get into any college ( you 'll fail the first semester there ) , and the matura is fairly easy/basic imo , so shame on you .

  and i seem to remember all sides doing historical revisions to facts , motivations and numbers , whenever political points needed scoring .

  about [ matura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matura ) :  ( ... ) is a latin name for the high-school exit exam or `` maturity diploma '' in various countries , including albania , austria , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , hungary , italy , kosovo , liechtenstein , macedonia , montenegro , poland , serbia , slovakia , slovenia , switzerland and ukraine . 
   matura is a matriculation examination and can be compared to a-level exams or abitur . 
  & nbsp ; so , what do your high school graduates do on the last day ? 
  we have the usual march though the town , cultured activities like quadrilla included . 
  * mind you , when i graduated , we had the 4 quadrilla parts ( ? ), 
  of the dance , and then the fifth was [ numa numa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe8wzynrpnu ) because why not . 
  * afterwards we go to open concerts and get outrageously drunk , to balance the excess `` culture '' earlier in the day . 
  mm , it depends from case to case here too . 
  we 're basically building a 3rd house in the same backyard now ( 4 generations and counting !, 
  ) , so there 's always someone around to help gradma and grandpa - gramps is immobile now , but grandma is also retired so she does most of the work around him . 
  the rest of us help with the `` heavy lifting '' and such , cause grandma is also getting too old for that . 
  but if the situation was different , you have an immobile old dying person , and their children are both working ( say , there 's just the 4 people in that house ) , well it 'd be off to the retirement home as well . 
  luckily for us , we have plenty of unemployed , so !, 
  silver linings xd, 
  problem is not just the borders . 
  well , it is the borders , they were drawn up by war ( including ethnic cleansing ) , not exactly fairness or population size . 
  srpska has 49 % , but iirc they 're around 30 % of the total population . 
  so what do ? 
  and the border divisions today mostly follow ethnicity , however , even the serb-majority areas have bosniak and croat percentages , and same goes for all 3 sides . 
  then what do you do about kinda-evenly split places like mostar ? 
  and then you have issues like ... ok , to solve some of the border-gore , i 'd give the southern and some northernmost parts to croatia ( that 's basically how it looks today ) , the east would in large part go to serbia . 
  to make the countries look less ridiculous , you know ? 
  but then , what about banja luka ? 
  it 's the srpska capital and pretty far west . 
  then sarajevo is too far east . 
  and so on ... and bosniaks would n't want that to happen anyways , they 'd be the total losers of their country losing half of the population and 2/3 of the territory . 
  and finally ~ croatia incorporating herzeg-bosna would be kinda like romania incorporating moldova . 
  same for serbia and srpska . 
  we wo n't be able to handle that for quite some time yet ... or want to handle it , for that matter . 
  i 'd probably vote no if the proposal went up in 2018 . 
  [ milan marti\u0107 ordered them to leave . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_serbian_krajina#operation_storm ) and leaving out of fear does n't count , or else every single war where the civilian populace flees would count as ethnic cleansing . 
  like for example most of croatian cities that were under attack , and had an exodus , or basically ... all of bosnia . 
  now we can talk about whether they had legit reasons to be afraid ( they did ) , what the cause of that fear was ( year 45 or year 91 ? ), 
  and so on until we 're blue in the face . 
  but to have accusations of cleansing stick , you need to have an army/state literally forcing people out at gunpoint . 
  in any case , this is getting long , i wrote what i think about storm and that war [ in this thread on r/serbia . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/serbia/comments/6bbfss/25_godina_od_tuzlanske_kolone_i_pravda_stradala_u/ ) you may be surprised :p, 
  i talked about this before with you , it was n't forgotten . 
  if anything , it was remembered too much , how can you heal the wounds and make anything like `` brotherhood and unity '' if you constantly repeat crimes one side did to the other for more than 40 years after the fact ? 
  and let 's not even go into how the figures were inflated , those strange numbers of what , 1 million ? 
  whole ndh had 7 million people . 
  to put it in an insensitive way - that 'd make us as * efficient * as germans . 
  and then again , it matters that it was basically a civil war where even ethnicity split apart ( \u010cetnici , too ) , and then even the partisans were n't exactly spotless , and that was certainly swept under the carpet . 
  not a healthy cocktail . 
  this thing again . 
  you do know that ndh killed more than just serbs ? 
  jews , roma , croat opposition . 
  yes , of course serbs were the biggest victims and it was a genocide over them in both intention and effect , but there 's also the fact that the resistance - partisans - started in croatia , had quite a few croats in it , and tito was croat by birthplace , childhood , and father , while his mother was a slovene . 
  and the whole point of the partisans and the communism they brought along was doing away with nationalistic divides . 
  and they succeeded in liberating yugoslavia from both ndh and nazis . 
  the equivalent would be ... if srpska/serbia/serbs in general made their own strong resistance movement to what jna & separatists were doing , and they succeeded . 
  which obviously was n't the case . 
  that matters a lot . 
  eh , if the montenegrins were very pro-russian , they would n't have hopped on the nato train . 
  or the eu , for that matter . 
  theoretically those two are n't the enemies of russia/russia is n't their enemy ... in practice , however , it 's clear to everyone and their grandmother that they are . 
  yeah ... there was also the perception ( regardless of how true ) that serbs took up an unfair percentage of officers and bosses etc. 
  plus the government was in belgrade , it 's sort of like the brussels today , whenever `` the eu '' does something people do n't like , `` brussels did this , brussels did that , fuck brussels !! '', 
   is it important if it ends the same way ? 
  hah , on the face of it it does n't . 
  you have a problem ... you get rid of the problem , dubious morality disregarded . 
  ( like for example compare croatia and bosnia today . ), 
  as for tito , [ o7 ] ( https://i2.wp.com/www.portalnovosti.com/img/media/image/tc4h1hwg7r8j2wq01om2f1al78x.jpg ) :d no but seriously . 
  i loved it how he exhorted money from everyone . 
  tito goes to usa , says `` ohh dear the soviets are trying to build a base here , how sad . 
  and you know , i could use a new factory , fine gentlemen . '', 
  tito goes to ussr , says `` ohh dear the americans are trying to build a base here , how sad . 
  and you know , i could use a new railway , dear comrades . '',

  what , because of those who collaborated during wwii ( was n't only the croats . . ) or because of crimes committed by croats in the 90s ? 
  if you are the kind of person who thinks only serbs were victims , then that really paints you a nationalist . 
  if so , i have nothing more to say to you . 
  correct me if i misinterperated , but those three words leave little else to conclude . 
  you get to be part of the club . 
  also you get false hopes and broken dreams . 
  and you get bragging rights to your neighbors who are n't in it . 
  that 's actually quite touching . 
  glad to see everyone playing well . 
  apologies , did n't know anything about this . 
  i 'm not really on / r/croatia . 
  all i saw was guuulj disagreeing with my post and linking me to to / r/serbia that he said was turned into / r/croatia and saying `` ca n't say the same for you guys '' . 
  he did not say it was imitating / r/rvacka . 
  sorry again for no looking more into context . 
  was n't complaining about the joke , did n't realize it was a joke all were in on :p is there an alternate link to what the page looked like yesterday . 
  would have liked to see it . 
  more like you turned / r/serbia into / r/rvacka . 
  all you guys did was post ustase and primitive stuff . 
  only proves my previous comment xd . 
  had / r/croatia done the same you guys would bombard the subbredit with hate comments . 
  edit : grammar, 
  there may be no evidence to prove him guilty . 
  if it 's not found now it never will be found . 
  and should be released . 
  but he did help create a breeding ground for hatred and nationalism that led to expulsion of croats and other non-serbs from parts of vojvodina and croatia . 
  you ca n't arrest him for it , but i would n't sub to his insanity nor anyone who supports such hatred . 
  if you call him making obscene remarks involving sucking cock intelligent , well ...

  in croatian it 's `` dobrodo\u0161li '' so for serbian it would be same . 
  it 's a great bonding exercise !, 
  thats ' how it works . 
  he probably made a `` yo moma '' joke that got to the judge and he ca n't leave it behind . 
  seselj has reached elite troll status . 
  i think croatia can understand as well . 
  what they do n't want you to know is that tudjman sabotaged apollo 13 . 
  croats caused global warming , 9/11 and polio . 
  do n't try to deny history !, 
  one should always be willing to start a new chapter . 
  it 's for the best . 
  do n't fall for his trolling . 
  unhappy with their lives so the spend time inciting fights . 
  / u/crnaruka is the worst of them . 
  i thought the balkan region was interesting . 
  there are no concerns about contamination ? 
  or is the radiation that minor ? 
  simple . 
  how was the bosnian war solved ? 
  can someone explain to me why depleted uranium was used ? 
  aha , its the second hand smoke from bulgaria that is the reason !, 
  well i 'm convinced ... / s, 
   their fathers that is assuming if every one of their ancestors participated . 
  eh , they were pressure by a certain neighbor . 
  also would n't cite that attack as a win for them  .

  fab-ce fabulous central europe, 
  serbia !, 
  hand grenades go in recycling , not garbage !, 
  come on guys ... 
  oh please . 
  did you see the way bosnia was dressed ? 
  she was asking for it . 
  her friend ukraine is no different . 
  nice , we got some too . 
  ours specialize in smoke bombs . 
  considering the president of serbia is a major nationalists and talked about how `` that the boundaries of greater serbia along the virovitica-karlovac-karlobag line were not part of any imperialistic politics , but would always remain a `` dream '' for him and other radical leaders '' and that `` vukovar was a serb city and croats have nothing to go back to there '' and `` there was no genocide in srebrenica . 
  in srebrenica '' i 'd say not . 
  i think a lot of serbs want to move forward , but there are those who do n't . 
  croatia used to be in bad shape as well , but a lot has changed . 
  of course wub_wub likes to think otherwise , but one can see for themselves what the situation is . 
  he is proving your point by living in the past himself . 
  so does his president ... 
  breaking a cyrillic sign in vukovar . 
  a lot of these people were there when serb forces invaded and killed many civilians . 
  there are still tensions there . 
  breaking the sign is dumb , but how this group of people represents all of croatia is beyond stupid . 
  i mean we 've made progress . 
  there 's just a lot more to be done . 
  citizens need to realize they are key in making progress happen . 
  the whole `` hey our polaticians are corrupt , but they are our fellow country men so they know what is best '' mentality needs to end . 
  and it will . 
  and it is begginnig to . 
  the arrest of zagreb mayor bandic months ago i think is one of the big chapters of the change yo come . 
   just do n't expect miracles , countries do n't change over night croatia : trying to become a democracy since 1991 . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm going to need proof of this . 
  so this is what an unbiased documentary free of evil western propaganda looks like . 
  thing is , if he did pass away , even if it is proved so , some will say it was an assassination regardless which could cause chaos in russia . 
  so putin , please be alive and well . 
   pressure from the communists yep , this is true .

  true . 
   if you are taxated on the same level as poorer person that leads to wealth concentration but it also leads to people having a higher incentive to make more and spend more . 
  wealth concentration is inevitable . 
   like glorious oligarchy of russia where you have flat tax rate that has very little to do with their tax rates and far more to do with the entire economy of russia being sold for pennies on dollars in the 90s . 
   also , as i said , if society agrees to it then it 's not theft . 
  if society agrees on the death penalty , is it then not murder ? 
  well , to people like me who argue that taxes should be as close to a flat tax as possible , yes , yes it is theft . 
  a man making double the salary will already pay higher taxes even if the taxing percentage is the same as that of a man making half his salary , there is no need to tax people more on top of that . 
  also , i always thought that french taxes were higher on the upper end , i did not know it was capped at 40ish % , my bad . 
  well yes but , when you are dealing with sections of historiography that do not include peoples who had writing , you are kinda forced to welcome whatever you can get . 
   it simply demands that the very richest section of the population provide a bit more solidarity . 
  are n't taxes for the very rich in france already basically theft ? 
   what should the european countries have done different integrating europe so as to avoid such massive eurosceptic movements we see today ? 
  a very strict and brutally implemented illegal immigration control . 
  pan-european identitarianism/nationalism and civic propaganda . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
   did germanic pagans ever build temples ? 
  no , according to tacitus ; `` the germans do not think it in keeping with the divine majesty to confine gods within walls or to portray them in the likeness of any human countenance . 
  their holy places are woods and groves , and they apply the names of deities to that hidden presence which is seen only by the eye of reverence . '', 
  ... and also yes according to ... tacitus ; `` everything , sacred or profane , the temple of tamfana , as they called it , the special resort of all those tribes , was leveled to the ground . '', 
   the anti-christian agenda pushing became a bit hard to digest . 
  i do not see it as such , it is merely a timeline when pagans had the upper hand , the second season has a reverse setting where alfred is becoming more powerful and the christians have an equal footing . 
  i recommend giving it a try . 
  vikings is not that good anymore , the script writing became straight up imbecilic . 
  the last kingdom is a far superior show now , especially the second season . 
  i still have no idea wtf you are talking about . 
  what picture ? 
  what turks ? 
  you are offended by the thumbnail image ? 
  is that it ? 
   charles martel rampaged the south west and the south east of france for decades ... 
  yes , he campaigned ( not decades though lol ) southwards and took land and cities after odo broke his oath of fielty . 
  however , he also campaigned against muslim cities and lands in south france still under muslim control , so i still do not see how your point is `` that 's for sure '' . 
   maybe you shall open a history book before writing ridiculously pedantic comment . 
  maybe you should refrain yourself from making simplistic hyperboles , that way , when someone sees your statement as faulty , you will not have to steep to the level of just being patronizing without actually stating anything in your reply . 
  well , that was pretty neat . 
  ... what ? 
   he killed probably not , warfare was small scale at the time , and tours was his largest battle , i doubt he ever managed to amount enough christian corpses to surpass the muslim corpses . 
   raped , tortured and starved a single source describing him doing so ? 
  because `` hur dur feudal lords raped and pillaged everything around them '' is more meme than history . 
  gee , who should i declare as great , a sith lord that took over the galaxy and ruled as emperor , or some weird looking green dude forced in exile that spent the remaining years of his life on planet swamp ass ? 
   combination of superhuman tactical insight and sheer luck having the worlds greatest military in terms of equipment , training and experience at the time also probably helped a lot   also probably the only european conqueror to ever reach all the way to india before we went there by boat in the 16th century . 
  the greeks that alexander left in bactria formed their own kingdom after alexander died and they invaded india again and allegedly marched all the way to pataliputra in eastern india and ruled modern day pakistan for centuries . 
   and many in spain ignore that cid is an arab word do they ? 
  because , to my knowledge , it is widely known that el cid is merely a nickname the moors called him by . 
  the majority of french voters are pro-eu though . 
   arabs practically invented optics . 
  yes , optics in general , but not glasses . 
  corrective lenses were invented in europe . 
   try again . 
  a water clock is not a mechanical clock . 
  the first known actual example of it is from europe . 
   really ? 
  you 're going after pots and pans ? 
  pots and pans are n't glassware . 
   despite all evidence you 're staying willfully ignorant . 
  that 's is very much barbaric behavior . 
  not good !, 
  there is no evidence lol , i never even denied muslim and arab influence in getting europe back on track after the downfall of roman civilization in the west , the issue was merely your idiotic notion that it was the ottomans . 
   you took the bait and here we are . 
  you could not wait to show the world how smart you are . 
  so this is all trolling ? 
   that 's persuasive enough . 
  thank you . 
  k.  ridiculous . 
  not so , the texts you are speaking off originate from learning centers of the umayyad and abbasid caliphates , not the ottomans . 
   so what ? 
  i provided you with yeah , still nothing to do with ottomans . 
   dear lord , out of all people he picks dante as staple of european enlightenment . 
  i did n't though . 
   as i mentioned earlier , europe was barbaric hell hole before and long after dante died . 
  ridiculous statement . 
  spectacles , mechanical clocks , clear glass blowing etc. 
   you mentioned ottomans first yeah , because you called turkey as your medieval deliverer lol . 
   what makes you thing i was n't talking about byzantine empire ? 
  because i can read . 
  here is an alternative , longer and narrated 3d reconstruction video ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phjb19zeg, 
   a pan-european , pro-eu right would be a force to be reckoned with . 
  exactly my thoughts . 
  if some weird form of liberal nationalist/identitarian political party is formed , they would rock the entire continent . 
  the tragedy for us bit on the right scale is that basically all right wing parties are led by pricks and plonkers or just down right imbeciles . 
  technically , carthage just moved sideways a bit , it was still called carthage after the third punic war and , as a roman city , it flourished into a massive city . 
  they would be so much more popular if they only dropped the anti-eu dogma . 
  i will look into this , thx . 
   last year the russian army decided to refurbish 3000 t-80s source ? 
   t-14 is a prototype , far away from mass production with only a handful of them built . 
  erm , they entered serial production months ago , the question is merely how many are being produced . 
  it is a finished weapon and a major problem for us . 
   even in the absolutely worst case scenario where russia managed to produce large quantities of t-14 while we did nothing in the meantime , we could still match them toe-to-toe . 
  that is true . 
  [ oyeeee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7smd6w0qhyk ), 
  it would hurt the eu though and would not solve the problem of uncontrolled illegal migration . 
  what is bad for the eu is ineluctably bad for croatia . 
  hmm , here are a few i could think off ; [ duke ljudevit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ljudevit ) [ petar sva\u010di\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_sva%c4%8di%c4%87 ) [ nikola juri\u0161i\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_juri%c5%a1i%c4%87 ) [ petar berislavi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_berislavi%c4%87 ) [ petar kru\u017ei\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_kru%c5%bei%c4%87 ) [ nikola zrinski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_%c5%a0ubi%c4%87_zrinski ) [ matija gubec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matija_gubec ), 
   explain how exactly . 
  his funding and obsession with organizations bent on importing illegal migrants to europe is causing a rebound effect in eu politics and the rise of populism , nationalism , isolationism and euroscepticism on the continent . 
  i wo n't even go into all the financial scummery he was involved in over the decades . 
  give us 40ish billion euro 's and send them our way . 
  though , it would not work if you send them to a eu country , for the obvious reasons of that said country being unable to prevent them from leaving and going back to germany/sweden ( as they actually did and do when sent east ) . 
  money .

  the issue is that while this would n't be difficult or even especially expensive , we 're no longer the kind of people who could do that . 
  europeans and americans from a hundred years ago would have depopulated the region down to nothing and called a victory . 
  what worries me is that these people are driving us to go back to that kind of thinking . 
  this insignificant group , small and powerless outside their domain , a shadow of a shadow of the muslim empires our ancestors stood up against , is driving us to revisit our dormant demons . 
  that 's what makes them dangerous . 
  they 're turning us in to the monsters their propaganda says we are , and the damn fools have no idea just how much the underestimate the true debts of evil were are capable of if pushed to far . 
  to make it very short and clear , because the yugoslavian constitution of 1974 said so . 
  the individual republics were given the express right to increase their autonomy to the point of independence and it defined the terrorists of the republics . 
  croatia invoked it 's legal right to secede , where as the territory of the `` srbska krajina '' were committing an act of rebellion against the state . 
  because we were on the defensive and this equipment made sure the war never actually got to my part of the country . 
  we 're happy we won , but we 're celebrating bare bones survival and making the country whole . 
  sure . 
  from worst to best : racist genocidal dictatorship radical religious theocracy brutal dictatorship `` father knows best '' dictatorship absolute monarchy with idiot as ruler democracy with idiot as leader democracy with brilliant leader absolute monarchy with brilliant ruler constitutional monarchies should be counted as democracies if the ruler is a figurehead . 
  monarchies with a shared power structure have a lot of variables but are usually between the two democracies . 
  the reason the brilliant democratic leader is n't on top is because his or her time in office is limited and their powers constricted by other bodies . 
  this is also why they are above idiot rulers . 
  this list is far from complete , but does cover relevant current types of governments at least in broad strokes . 
  really ? 
  no overlap at all ? 
  while i 'm not a fan of brutal dictatorships very recent history has shown that they do in deed seem to be preferable to what happen when they are n't in charge . 
  much like in egypt , the fact that there are people who want genuine progressive change are making matters worse by painting a nice friendly face on a movement who 's base is made up of very radical muslims . 
  the progressives talk to the cameras and spread the good word on line , but as soon as they win , the islamists take over . 
  it 's not that i do n't understand the difference , it 's that the difference is unimportant . 
  the people fighting the brutal dictators for the right reasons are severely misreading their countrymen and ultimately doing them selves a disservice . 
  this is n't opinion . 
  this is exactly what happened . 
  this is the past . 
  toppling a head of state is easy , but toppling the very large number of determined islamists that make up a significant portion of the population is not . 
  as horrible as it might seem , those places needed the dictators , needed the secret police , the soldiers in the streets because withing the population there were true monsters waiting for a chance to strike . 
  again going back to egypt where toppling mubarak went as well as one could ever hope and the state was still stable and the number of secular progressive protesters was significant , it still ended in a theocracy that ended in a military coup that is seen as a step up from the theocracy . 
  so your accusing us of not doing enough spin on our relationship with deplorable trading partners ? 
  the syria and assad bit actually makes sense when you think about it . 
  the people he was killing , well we got to see how they would run a country and it turns out they run it like a islamic slave and death factory , making it a lot clearer as to why assad wanted them dead , and why we really should n't mind since we agree that they should be dead . 
  when your people are isis , you too should consider sending a few bullets their way . 
  pfff , americans hold grudges over ice water being to cold . 
  we have people returning from the middle east after fighting for isis and it 's barely on most people 's minds . 
  we 'll survive you being sulky . 
  the uk , france , germany and italy would likely bankroll the project , but assuming wages were equal for all soldiers reguardless of country of origin and were sufficient to be at least acceptable in high income countries you would get a lot of manpower from eastern europe , especially poland . 
  i also guarantee that making it mandatory for soldiers to know english and one other major european language would increase interest as the people who would normally claim the west is `` sending our boys to die in their wars '' could n't make those claims if service is actively restricted . 
  it would make for much better cohesion and exclusively tends to attract people . 
  or , much more likely , everyone being forced in to the highest bracket . 
  not everything . 
  ironically they could n't make a good looking medal if their life depended on it . 
  take the order of the german cross as an example https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_nazi_germany#/media/file:germancrossinsilver.jpg a fuzzy snowflake with a circle that has a swastika on the inside . 
  the other medals were just the old iron crosses with swastikas . 
  technically correct but it stretches the definition of `` active '' to the extreme . 
  from what i understand , it goes to sea once a year just so it can claim the title of oldest ship in active service and compete with the hms victory , the oldest commissioned ship ( but one that never goes out to sea ) the eagle is in real active , doing actual work service , old ironside is in honorary active service . 
  i think that would be the best way to put it . 
  sure , but just like not every farmer has a combine and a crop duster , not every farmer had an ox or horse or a plow . 
  it was n't uncommon for villages to have a guy who made his living renting out an ox team to his and nearby villages . 
  even if a family had the tools and animals , unless they had many , they would go to the oldest son , the younger siblings having to make do with raw muscle power . 
  it 's worth pointing out that many , not all but many , of the civilians asad was killing or trying to kill were isis or proto isis . 
  it 's somewhat hypocritical to call out asad for not being able to handle his people without violence when our response also ends at bombing them . 
  it was a rough estimate . 
  a young man , without help or a plow , using only hand tools , could tend to land roughly of that size , assuming the land is of average quality ( not too much stone or clay ) obviously , year 2 gets easier since the earth was loosened and roots and rocks removed . 
  2 people could do exponentially more as one could pull and the other steer a makeshift wooden plow , and animals and tools added to that . 
  a very strong man could likely cultivate as much as 2he on his own . 
  a very weak man might be unable to tend to a garden . 
  on a good year 1 he might feed a family . 
  on a bad year it might not give back the calories put in to it . 
  such is the way of pre industrial agriculture . 
  rough guesses all around , but centuries of experience combined with your life very much depending on them , tend to make them at least somewhat accurate . 
  traditionally , one hectare was about the amount of land one person could tend to with raw muscle strength . 
  that means hand tools only , no combines , tractors or even animal driven plows . 
  the good news is , with modern technology you can tend that peace of land with ease and with the proper use of fertilizer and modern plants , the yield will be sufficient to feed one person and leave enough over to sell . 
  the problem however is that the sale price would likely not cover the overhead . 
  modern farming tech made farming huge amounts of land very cheap , but small amounts of land would be impossibly expensive . 
  ideally you would have at least 50he per person and than 10 people or 10 families forming a small corporation to buy and use heavy equipment on all the parcels and then pay out the profits at the end of the year , with people doing the actual work also getting a wage . 
  basically , small farmers are doomed to poverty unless they grow a high value plant ( which usually require greenhouses and special expertise or are very climate dependant thus making them high value ) and 1he is not a small farmer . 
  1he is a hobby especially if it contains a house . 
  in the us settlers were given 65he in a time before modern farming and while it was a lot of land for a single family it still was n't all that much once the agricultural revolution came rolling in . 
  500he would be a decent mid sized farm co. . as long as everyone works together well and land quality and weather permitting it can end up working well , but what will end up happening is people making a go of it , failing and millions of he being sold to china . 
  i generally agree , but my concern with a new greek currency would be that it expressly could n't be stable . 
  to meet payroll for government employees as well as well as pay out pensions , they would have to print a lot . 
  if they needed a fixed , stable currency , they would just use the euro . 
  they need a currency they can freely print which is a decent idea if you 're a g8 member , less so if you 're a recently defaulted greece . 
  a fair point , but it 's arguable if the greek people wanted out of the euro zone . 
  that was n't the question asked and independent poling showed that if it were the outcome might have been flipped . 
  most people in greece realize that the sure , for all it 's flaws , is real money that you can spend at face value or trade at a fair rate anywhere in the world . 
  a new drachma , especially one issued with the express goal of depreciating it 's value would likely have trouble buying you anything in greece , let alone abroad , after a greek default . 
  if the greek people were to vote for leaving the euro and defaulting i 'd actually fully support it as well as any humanitarian aid ( food and medicine ) to be allocated to greece is things went really bad . 
  i ca n't imagine anyone actually wants greece to fail , but prolong up their system with foreign money from places like slovakia that has a fraction of greece 's per capita gdp seems obscene . 
  i feel like i need to point out that while greece voted to end austerity , the vote did not magically fill their national coffers . 
  on a very fundamental level , you simply ca n't vote to spend money you do n't have and no one is willing to give you . 
  imagine if instead of the greek people voting for spending money they do n't have it was a greek king . 
  we 'd call the man silly and delusional . 
  `` but i wan na ! '', 
  is not the basis of economic policy . 
  however , since this was a lot of people making a delusional and unobtainable demand , it somehow becomes legitimatstateyou mentioned the north and south , but you forgot that the east is firmly behind germany on this . 
  we 've heard the same bullshit the greek politicians are spewing from our own people for over 3 decades now , but unlike them , we got with the program and things have been looking up . 
  it 's not about punishing greece . 
  it 's about making them see that all the corruption , tax evasion , the do nothing jobs that make up most of the public sector , they all have to go , because europe is not enabling a failed greek state , and make no mistake , it has failed . 
  if they got all their debt forgiven tomorrow , they 'd be back here before 2030 , because all the things that crashed the greek economy in the first place are still there , stopping it from moving forward . 
  you know what 's interesting ? 
  look at the countries with the smallest numbers . 
  slovakia , slovenia , croatia , the czech republic and hungary . 
  all of the bottom 6 countries were part of austria-hungary . 
  the whole gang is back together , with the very notable exception of austria . 
  i do n't know if that 's in any way relevant , but i found it to be a neat little coincidence at the very least . 
  while we can argue about witch war is worse , theirs is bigger than ours by multiple orders of magnitude .

  there was no plan because the brilliant minds that make up the british electorate decided that asking for a plan up front , from anyone , the government , the opposition , the leave champagne , was all to much of a bother . 
  why vote for a well thought out proposal ? 
  that 's something an expert would do . 
  a real brit thinks with their gut and votes with their gut , and the gut says that planning is for pansies !, 
  yes , what kind of brain dead idiot would decide to leave the eu without having a plan ? 
  claims the guy the article was about . 
  granted the dm is not the best of sources , but your citing the guy they were accusing . 
  he 's claiming it 's deformation , that he was talking historically rather than in present day terms . 
  that might be true , but he might be trying to cover his ass and geniuses like your self are simply taking his word at face value . 
  news flash , a radical imam living in the west probably is n't going to admit he supposed sex slavery . 
  i think we need to go in the oposite direction with no 5 . 
  the terrorists and their sympathisers , as you correctly pointed out , have their own networks and while we can shut down the mainstream ones , they can certainly make new , more obscure ones . 
  if we say nothing , they get to paint as flattering a picture as they want . 
  what i would do is post as much unflattering , embarrassing and generally mean stuff as i could find . 
  they wet the bed until they were twelve , they had erectile dysfunction , they liked really wierd porn . 
  absolutely anything you could dig up . 
  make damn sure everyone sees them as a pathetic laughing stock . 
  use a still frame from when they were singing drunk karaoke . 
  show a reaction video of their parents seeing all their proverbial dirty laundry . 
  basically , give them the reality tv celebrity treatment . 
  unleash the tabloids . 
  they want to be remembered , let people remember them as the guy with the cyst on his ass . 
  we have the big , the really big guns when it comes to the media and we need to use that aggressively . 
  you have a great point mr. 1960 's man . 
  i 'm sure that our efforts to educate and integrate these people in to our society will bear fruits and i believe the fears that third generation immigrants would walk away and join an islamic murder/slave cult in the middle east by the thousands is highly overblown . 
  credible is the wrong word . 
  russia is huge , aggressive and has already snatched up large chunk of a neighboring country . 
  it 's a credible threat . 
  what you should be asking is if it 's likely the russians will invade . 
  the answer to that one is that no , it 's not very likely , but it still falls firmly in the realm of things that not only could happen , but things you would be negligent not to be prepared for . 
  forget attitudes and consider that there are girls here in europe who 's parents are telling them , wear this or we 're kicking you out of the house and if anyone asks , you tell them it 's by choice . 
  every woman who wares one by choice is acting as an accomplice . 
  the women and girls who do n't want to wear it are one of us . 
  those who do are one of them and those who would pressure anyone to wear that nonsense are our enemy . 
  i for one am not willing to sacrifice any one of us , just so they they wo n't be inconvenienced . 
  if europeans ca n't guarantee that one of our own wo n't be oppressed in broad daylight , day after day , then who the hell are we ? 
  no one who 's not from eastern europe wants to live here because it 's a tough existance at the best of times . 
  honestly , it takes a special kind of fucked up personality to send people here . 
  at best they 're condemened to poverty and misery with no prospects or future and at worst , i do n't think there 's a bottom for at worst . 
  there 's litteraly nothing , nothing at all for an uneducaited foreigner who ca n't even speek the language to do . 
  they ca n't even beg on the streets because the gypsies will use force to push them off their turf . 
  the us . 
  i read somewhere that the us spends so much , they could divide their budget 10 ways and have the have the 10 best funded military 's in the world . 
  the us airforce is the largest air force on the planet which most people know . 
  what they do n't is that the second largest air force on the planet is the us navy . 
  they spend a lot is what i 'm trying to say . 
  you will see ronal regan rise from the grave in neon pink wedding dress to marry barack obama before greece will join turkey . 
  turkey is the reason why greece has the second highest military budget in nato adjusted for population . 
  which does n't really matter . 
  continental europe does n't need a global hub , just a european one . 
  doing business with other countries through england was always risky long term since any foreign country could order that all business with them be done domestically or not at all . 
  london was always merely convenient rather than necessary . 
  a fact we would very much like to change . 
  for instance , anyone who does n't have to publically admit that they 've insulted so many world leaders that apologizing individually is not really possible . 
  they get their propaganda from other sources , and the attacks just get bunched up . 
  the guy in the you tube video might even tell them that it 's so easy to pull off , even a few european crazies did it without anyone stopping them until it was to late . 
  there 's litteraly nothing wrong with having more than 2 four year terms . 
  the very concept of term limits for the executive is a bit silly since a corrupt head of state can circumvent term limits with ease , while in countries that work , all you 're doing is fireing the best , most experienced person for the job . 
  maybe some kind of term limit is in order , but 2x4 is just to short . 
  it really should be 2x5 or even 2x6 or maybe even 1x7 because realistically , a single 7 year term lest a president govern far more than 8 years with a reelection champagne in the middle . 
  hey , if you 're up for it , we could get the gang back together and bash the ottomans , for old times sake . 
  no they do not . 
  they want the colonial twilight approach of limited engagement , pinpoint bombings , special forces , safe zones ect . 
  us getting serious means dividing the middle east in to quadrants and systematically destroying all forms of life and all means to support life from each one , one square mile at a time . 
  we absolutely can kill them all . 
  we can kill them all 100 times over . 
  we can scrub every trace of the existence of islam of muslims from the face of the earth and it would n't even be especially difficult . 
  hell , 800 years ago , the mongols already demonstrated how you do it . 
  destroy a city , come back in a few days and kill off all the survivors . 
  come back in a year and kill all the new settlers . 
  poison all but a few wells . 
  have ambushes waiting at the safe wells . 
  kill all the live stock , burn all the fields . 
  deny the enemy the ability to live of the land , deny anything the ability to live off the land . 
  hurl diseased bodies in to a city , then let a portion of the inhabitants escape to rejoin and infect their countrymen . 
  it took the near east , iraq for an example , until the late 20th century to get back to pre mongol levels . 
  afghanistan still has n't recovered . 
  they want a fight they can win . 
  what they 're provoking is a fight they really do n't want to have . 
  genocidal europe is the europe that said all quiet on the western front on a day when 3000 men lost their lives , because 3000 men was nothing . 
  their terror becomes laughable when compared to what we are capable of doing our selves . 
  their methods of guerrilla fighting do nothing if our goal is ever to simply salt the earth and be done with them . 
  they exist solely because we allow it . 
  do to our so called enlightened benevolence , their barbarism was allowed to thrive . 
  if they push us enough , they will learn that deep down we are ten times the monsters they think we are . 
  and because we 're not aggressively deporting everyone who is n't in immediate , desperate need of help , everyone get 's screwed . 
  that 's what happens when high and mighty ideals clash with practical realities . 
  reality always wins . 
  it 's fair share is all of them , or at least most of them . 
  the options are taking them in or sending them back . 
  redistribution is out of the question . 
  no one is willing to be the dumping ground for the dregs germany deems unprofitable or dangerous . 
  and would n't happen without austria 's say so anyway . 
  over half a million people went through croatia . 
  everyone was given the option to seek asylum . 
  exactly one women and her daughter took us up on the offer . 
  they 're doing fine , btw . 
  this is stupid for two very important reasons . 
  first , women who earned their jobs will have to prove them selves all over again to show that yes , they did get the job based on merit rather than some silly quota . 
  second , it 's harmful .

  the quote from the title is misleading . 
  he never said that `` bosnia is not even a country . '', 
  he just quoted somebody . 
  the stuff he said is if anything controversial but not much more . 
  media is just making a mountain out of a molehill . 
  this looks awesome ... like it belongs into a videogame :d, 
  both . 
  i compared russia with serbia because i think that the war in ukraine is pretty similar to the war on the balkans in the 90s . 
  there was no plan for bosnia . 
  it is true that tudman met milosevic on a hunting ground but it is absolutely unknown what the topic of their conversation was . 
  plus the guy claiming that they spoke about the split of bosnia was not even there . 
  but the negative stuff is overwhelming just to be fair . 
  official jna troops supported the sk with the authorisation of milosevic . 
  he proclaimed the war by himself on vidovdan 1989 which was one of the reasons slovenia and croatia wanted their independence . 
  milosevic did basically the exact same thing putin did in ukraine . 
  edit : just in case rsk 4,177 soldiers and 2,650 civilians killed or missing 300,000 displaced socialist federal republic of yugoslavia jna 1,279 soldiers killed croatia 6,788 -- 8,784 soldiers and 4,508 -- 7,186 civilians killed or missing, 
  it is easy to send a couple of people back with an airplane but it is not that easy to sent 300000 + back with it . 
  edit : gramma :p, 
  i do n't like tudman but he never tried to build a `` greater croatia '' . 
  croatia defended it 's borders and never attempted to attack serbia . 
  no , i do n't . 
  the milosevic regime helped both sk and rs to split up . 
  it is , of course , a matter of opinion if you want to see them as one party or not but it is not deniable that they worked together at least most of the time . 
   for now , it is big money and time needed to civilize chechen society . 
  it is also a big investment to repair the infrastructure russia destroyed in ukraine , not mention the economic breakdown of both parties just because of this unnecessary war . 
   may be kosovo can be independent , but they need to divide it into kosovo and serbia parts the serbian part of kosovo is really small . 
   so serbs can do nothing in kosovo expect living under guard of peacekeepers in their ghettos . 
  it would be exactly the same case just the other way around . 
  serbia declared them to second class citizens which is the reason for the independence movement in the first place . 
  it is plain stupid to give every minority its own country . 
  we would have a 3rd ww if everyone would do that . 
  it was pretty easy to return people from bosnia and croatia because their countries were much easier to reach but it is a completely different thing to return them to another continent . 
  i honestly do not thing that they will ever leave germany at least not most of them . 
  i 'm talking about the present not ww2 . 
  why do you avoid my question ? 
  there is a difference between a couple of ustasa idiots who `` support '' a nazi puppet state from 1941 and a country actively trying to get new territory . 
  do you also support free chechnya , kosovo and so on ? 
  because russia is a perfect example for `` protecting self-rule '', 
  this is like this [ greater serbia ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=greater+serbia&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1417&amp;bih=930&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewixnok679noahuftbqkhccocpiq_auibigb&amp;dpr=1 ) bullshit . 
  just making trouble because of nothing . 
  i was able to feel it in zadar . 
  i do n't want to imagine how it was at the hotspot . 
  even i was able to at least feel it . 
  do n't want to imagine how it must have been in italy : /, 
  looks horrible : / stay safe , neighbours . 
  looks like dayz ... 
  ~ twice a month and more or less the whole summer . 
  sadly the standard :\\, 
  do you live there or somewhere else ? 
  i 'm kind of curious know :d edit : should learn english :p, 
  thanks . 
  serbia did an insane job too in my opinion . 
  we are not too shabby haha * makes proud pose *, 
  no way :d haha indeed , smal world  gornje ili donje ? 
  and that 's how croatia won the olympics ... kind of : /, 
  next week on lesbos ... `` welcome to turkey ! '', 
  this is the shit i mean . 
  do you even know what you are talking about ? 
  the ussr used to torcher and kill people in gulags and so on . 
  they committed war crimes easily comparable to nazi germany and so did the partizans in yugoslavia . 
  i 'm sorry if i sound mean but do you really believe that russia is worse than the fucking soviet union ? 
  read the posts below . 
  everything wrong with the ussr was basically the same in yugoslavia . 
  - they were allowed to take a bath in the sea once a year and are not allowed to go deep into the water ( i think they said that only the legs are allowed to be in the water ) . 
  - they used to stay all they long in the sun to cover up plants if something managed to grow on the island . 
  ( it is more or less just a rock in the water which is the reason it is called goli otok ( = naked island ) ) . 
  - they got punished and isolated for denying their `` crimes '' in any way . 
  - they forbid the prisoners to kill themselves and gave them enough to eat to stay alive under this conditions without any reason because there was no way for them to ever be released . 
  - and so on ... 
  it is sad to say that but other dictators at least killed their prisoners at some point ... 
  the problem is that they imprisoned all kinds of regime critics and not only nationalists . 
  the stuff they did to their prisoners is disgusting in every way . 
  i know that i sound a little bit butthurt but i know people who used to be in these prisons and you simply ca n't believe this shit until you heard somebody innocent still arguing with himself if he is guilty or not . 
  i do n't know where to download/see it but here is the trailer of a good documentation about goli otok : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moa6cfx-ax4, 
  it had a better standard of living for about 20 to 30 years but the regime was as horrible as any other communist party at this time . 
  the thing is just that we heard about the shit stalin and co did , but who the hell knows about goli otok and the shit they did with their own people and regime critics ? 
  the tito regime had prisons worse than many nazi kz or gulags but nobody cares ... 
  that 's like our young idiots who are missing `` the good old '' yugoslavia ... 
  they think it was great just because they never experienced `` communism '' by themselves . 
  not even merkel would allow them into the union . 
  the problem is that their influence would be too high because turkey is such a big country . 
  they could make big decisions within the eu . 
  we would allow a state without european values to make decisions for us and we would allow a very corrupt regime to be a leading member of the eu . 
  this is not false , it is just insane imo . 
  why should poland want turkey in the eu ? 
  only if they are the only one vetoing . 
  you ca n't put pressure on half of the union . 
  not only the greeks ... basically every eastern european country will . 
  i feel great , 
  ... do you really want radical islamist terrorist nazis ? 
  because that is how you get radical islamist terrorist nazis ? 
  fuck you !, 
  everyone knows ... sea slav best slav :p, 
  this war could be finished yesterday if anyone would be willing to really help them . 
  it is seed to watch them slowly dying from here : /, 
  they definitely need to modernize parts of the army :p, 
  at least one time ... we did it guys !, 
  we do n't suck anymore , 
  fixed it ... im just too retarded to read the shit i write before i post it :p, 
  what i actually mena is that russia will annex belarus if they try to build relationships with the west just like they did with crimea ...

tbh , unlike some , croatian police was n't beating up the migrants ... 
  4th result - http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newsitem/2151 , 
  aw , now i feel bad for albaniaball :(, 
  i also did n't watch hetalia , so maybe the `` naze p\u014drando baka '' was n't about that , because when i clicked image search on japanese google it showed polandball comics ... 
  problem is , that 's nicole austin xd, 
  ^ influence of us capitalism, 
  dunno if they know where he 's from , but they do know about him . 
  google `` shigatsu wa kimi no uso '' , it 's really good and it features chopin 's music and they mention him a few times . 
  huh , cool . 
  i must say i find most of our literature quite boring . 
  in my experience , the main character either kills someone , dies or commits suicide in the end ( e.g. 
  bijeg , u registraturi , ... ) becomes repetitive after a while ... 
  your standards are n't very high , are they ? 
  when the hell was that f5/f6 black spot tornado south of sisak ? 
  never heard of it, 
  i think it may be sturdy head = tvrda glava = tvrdoglav = stubborn, 
  we 're really riding on nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 zrinski ... https://hr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vazetje_sigeta_grada, 
  it 's not really an * epic * ^ ( as in awesome ) poem / jk, 
  is hoxha the guy who built bunkers ? 
  albania had a dictator who liked to build bunkers , i think ? 
  they 're the best http://news-bar.hr/vijesti/svijet/bombasha-samoubojicu-u-raju-dochekala-72-djevca-iz-anonimusa but i also like when they post their `` news '' to facebook and people do n't understand it 's satire and start raging in the comments xd, 
  pretty much, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_histocompatibility_complex that is all . 
  also , dora peja\u010devi\u0107 - https://youtu.be/svhhb1_mw_a this one https://youtu.be/b2daezlgddc reminds me of your lie in april, 
  yeah , medical advances are basically the problem along with the senilization of the population , because in the past old people would n't live as long so the pension model was sustainable . 
  so the problem could be solved not by increasing the taxable workforce but by lowering the number of old people who receive the pensions ( even though i 'm not for that because it 's kinda a bastard move to screw over people who 've been working their entire life for the pension ), 
  i completely understand the issue , but the difference is that sweden is trying to use the immigrants as a workforce and a future source of taxation to get the money for pensions . 
  the problem is this solution is temporary and will only increase when the immigrants reach retirement age and want their own pensions . 
  damn it, 
  hipsterrorists, 
  actually , i read that some raf members were arrested last year trying to rob a lorry or something ? 
  do n't quote me on this, 
  supposedly gibraltar can hold a referendum to stay in the eu even if uk leaves ... 
  is n't irish the official language in ireland ? 
  as their prime minister is called taiyoseach or something ? 
  i thought husby and rinkeby were the no-go zones ? 
  there 's a lot of fearmongering in this subreddit ( downvotes incoming ! ), 
  so the us , as a comfortable , developed nation , is weak ? 
  so sweden is xenophobic like japan and distrusts foreigners ? 
  so , is this incorrect ? 
  my subjective opinion has no influence on objective facts , and that is that croatia as a catholic nation is quite homophobic . 
  if you 're not satisfied with a link from 2012 , here 's one from 2013 http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/04/croatia-gay-marriage-vote-europe-rotten-heart and i have heard of instances when gay couples were attacked in zagreb because some football hooligans saw them holding hands/kissing . 
  i still like carr, 
  touch\u00e9, 
   no one has suggested gay sex should be [ ... ] punished by death the angry mob did . 
  and just to be clear , i support lgbt rights and condemn any form of violence towards the population . 
  that homophobic people not shy of violence still exist in eastern europe, 
  http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/croatian-city-split-divided-over-gay-pride-after-violent-clashes310512/#gs.g_cvbta and some academic professors accused the police of defending the gay pride instead of saving antonija bili\u0107 , which was impossible at the time because paravinja already killed her . 
  and when boris de\u017eulovi\u0107 , an award-winning reporter , called them out on their bull **** , he got fired from slobodna dalmacija . 
  do you live in split ? 
   implying hungarian politicians are manly muscular macho guys, 
  are you reffering to police having to protect the gay pride in split so that an angry mob does n't lynch them or to the fact that the position of women in our society was described by mp kova\u010devi\u0107 as `` a woman is not fit to be wise , but she 's fit to be on a mattress '' ? 
  a few years ago an old-school chief of neurosurgery in one of more famous hospitals said `` while i 'm in charge , no woman will be a neurosurgeon '' . 
  i think one other hospital just got a first female neurosurgeon a few weeks ago . 
  so , a large portion of society here still thinks men should work and women should be housewives ... one of the mps even said `` nije \u017eena za mudraca nego za madraca '' ( a woman 's not fit to be a wise-man , but she is fit for a mattress ( i.e. 
  making babies ) ) compared to the west , it 's depressing really . 
  and then we are confused how our economy is stagnating when we could potentially employ women which make 50 % of the workforce ... 
  yeah , that older yugonostalgic generation in their 20s . 
  most of my friends are in their early 20s and most of them say things were better in yugoslavia . 
  yes , but he was against stalin and arrested people who openly supported stalin . 
  and communism as an idea is n't that bad , it 's just very difficult if not impossible to put into practice ( a clasless society where everyone has what they need and there is no `` 1 % '' ) . 
  the opposite of communism is capitalism and capitalism and privatisation f-ed up croatia after the homeland war . 
  that 's why nowadays we have people who survive by gathering plastic bottles from trash cans and return them for a few cents ( 50 lipa ) / bottle . 
  to elaborate , most of the australian emigration from croatia happened when ustashe collaborators were fleeing persecution after ww2 so they taught their children how the `` independent state '' of croatia was the god 's greatest gift to croats ... 
  then the prices of cars would become higher . 
  i think the eu gives some kind of discount to other members . 
   lies about what happened in the wars i kinda think when australian croatian expats think they know what happened in the wars better than us croats do , that that 's hilarious . 
  and just a smidge depressing . 
  doubt it . 
  in eastern europe people usually ca n't build their way up to the top without family/friend ties in the company . 
  our system is quite corrupt, 
  import tarrifs . 
  also if you 're ordering online from the eu , the shipping is more expensive, 
  i wonder if uk actually leaves will they have to pay more money for eu-imported goods ? 
  cars , for example , most come from germany so the prices will go up , right ? 
  you have a point , but i 'm just gon na write one more thing - you said `` we should oppose the government if it 's wrong '' . 
  but do you see the problem in this ? 
  who decides on what is wrong ? 
  the people ? 
  but what if the people disagree on the problem ( say , abortion ) ? 
  the majority ? 
  okay , but 2/3 majority or 50 % +1 majority ? 
  see why this issue is problematic ? 
  also , if a minority is convinced us government is doing the wrong thing and follows the declaration of independence ( that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . 
  prudence , indeed , will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed . 
  but when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government , and to provide new guards for their future security . 
  ) , for something they consider not to be `` light and transient '' ( say , life of a fetus ) , does that give them the right to overthrow the government or would that be treason ? 
  you 're saying we should oppose the government if it 's in the wrong , saying how the government not collecting information about religion and languages is wrong . 
  but if the government collects that information and it is then used to discriminate against minorities , what happens then ? 
  and it 's probably due to inherent values between eu and the us , but in , for example , germany , you could n't do and yell a nazi salute because it 's illegal , regardless of freedom of speech . 
  and also , there is another problem ( this is an extremely difficult issue ) - croatia has a law how if a minority has over a certain percent of population in a city , then public institutions need to have written signs in both languages - however , in vukovar , which has a large serbian minority , and which was occupied by serbian forces in a war 20 years ago , there should , by law , be bilingual official signs . 
  and when the government started putting up public institution signs on the buildings , nationalists started tearing down the signs with hammers in large mobs . 
  so , who is at fault here , the law , the government , the people ? 
  is discrimination off-limits or are you for implementation of it ? 
  yeah , mr. cameron was more interested in pork when he was 16 ... 
  yes , but if prostitution were legal , prostitutes would have access to healthcare and could go to police if something happened to them . 
  we also have the requisite evidence to conclude that he incited the crimes charged in the indictment ( with the exception of plunder ) through all of his inflammatory speeches , calling clearly and directly for the expulsion and forcible transfer of the non-serbs , in addition to his speeches in which he denigrated and dehumanized the croats comparing them to `` primates '' and `` vampires '' and qualifying them as cowards . 
  in the same way , he called the bosnian muslims `` balija '' or `` pogani '' which he himself translated as `` excrements '' . 
  i hold that the use of these terms , together with his constant references to `` genocide '' committed by the croats during world war two and the saying `` an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth '' and `` revenge is blind '' , vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj also took the risk that murder , torture , cruel treatment and destruction would be committed in furtherance of the common criminal purpose he shared with the other leaders in the former yugoslavia who participated in the jce , the purpose of which was to force through the perpetration of crimes , the non-serbs to leave the territories claimed by the serb forces .

yes . 
  if the british people want to leave they should leave . 
  it 's immoral to keep a peaople in a political union against their will and not letting them have a say is pure poison in the long term . 
  if the uk wants to leave it will and the longer it does n't , the more relations will be hurt when it 's divorce time . 
  most importantly however , is the fact that it 's very unlikely that england would leave . 
  a definate `` yes , we want to stay '' would shut up the voices who want a dissolution of the union . 
  i 'm just stating the facts as i understand them . 
  i really do n't have an opinion on the likes and dislikes of neo nazis and i 'm reasonably certain i would make the dislike list, 
  the nazis did n't hate jews because they were jewish . 
  they hated them because they considered them a nation of stateless parasites trying to controll the world through their banks and industry . 
  israelis are people from a european cultural background , with a state of their own , fighting people from a different culture , a lot of whom are trying to get in to europe . 
  basically , neo nazis still do n't like jews in their own country , especially if they have influence , but they have no problems with jews in israel and see muslims immigration ( a non issue in the 1930 's and 40 's ) as their principal problem . 
  not to mention , basically universal, 
  it has to . 
  it 's not just about dominance , it 's about relevance . 
  unless we unite fully , we become nobodies . 
  irrelevant little nation states that are acted upon . 
  the play things of the real powers . 
  the question is n't national independance vs a federal european government . 
  it 's losing a bit of independance to brussels , or losing most of it to washington , moscow or even beijing . 
  this may seem nuts , but that 's how these things tend to work out . 
  we are still somewhat protected by the eu , but this half mesure of a quasi superstate ca n't last . 
  we take the plunge and go all the way or it ends up breaking apart do to internal pressures . 
  it 's 6 months to 5 years for recruiting members and soliciting assistance ( financial and otherwise ) for the organization , but that 's the second part . 
  the first part that says it 's 6 months to 10 years for lending assistance , but skips the articles that define assistance . 
  however , unterst\u00fctzung ( assistance , lending aid ) is a defined legal term . 
  i do n't know exactly how it 's defined in germany , but randomly posting a picture certainly does n't fall in to the parameters . 
  buying guns , giving money , forging documents , making propaganda videos and certainly , going there to fight do fall in to the category . 
  theirs is way , way older . 
  they used those or similar flags as far back as ww2 . 
  they were such fine fellows back then that despite having their king in london to serve as a diplomat , the british still recodnized the communists as the legitimate power in yugoslavia . 
  just think about this . 
  they were so bad , churchill official gave his support to the local communists . 
  after over a century of strong relations between the uk and serbia , so strong that a piece of english soil was ceded to yugoslavia just for the birth of the crown prince in exile , they pick the commies , not because they were especially nice ( they were murderous assholes , just not as bad as the russians ) but because the chetniks were seen as worse . 
  actually , this really is a lot like the west backing iran against isis . 
  very good comparison . 
  but they were n't closer . 
  they only saw the support , never the opression . 
  even if the f 35 worked as advetrised , we do n't need a gen 5 plane . 
  any threat that would require the use of gen 5 aircraft is a threat the croatian millitary ca n't handel . 
  add to that the fact that modern gen 4 aircraft are bettletested , reliable , effective and efficient , makes this a no brainer . 
  this is very true and also helps nato keep it 's forces as standardized as possible . 
  i never really liked this concept . 
  you do n't pay taxes , you do n't have to follow local laws , you are only marginally affected by local politics , so why should you have a right to vote ? 
  in my opinion turks living in germany have a far greater right to be represented in german politics than having influence in turkey . 
  realistically , it 's doubtful any nations diaspora voting could have a significant impact , but the principal of the thing seems off . 
  good . 
  this means that when one does pass , there 'll be no doubt about her being qualified . 
  i think you 're right . 
  you can convince people that learning how to defend your country is necesary and useful and you can get people who do n't want to fight to do this kind of stuff as an alternative , but making young , productive people put their lives on hold to do useless , nonsensical bullshit for the sake of doing it together seems a bit silly . 
  in a world of constantly evolving technology where the 20 something is way more in tune woth how the modern world works than the 50 something , it 's downright suicidal . 
  china and india each have more people than the us and europe combined . 
  they have minds to spare and we need to make sure people start being creative and productive as soon as possible to make sure we make up in quality what we lack in quantity . 
  digging ditches does not help with that . 
  conscription is n't popular . 
  trying to expand the conscript pool would very likely get extream pushback and would likely end conscription in general witch would be the exact oposite of what proponents of an expanded pool would want . 
  there was an article in the economist that basicaly stated that china really wants sibiria . 
  the extra space , geographical proximity and most importantly the abundance of natural resources makes the land very attractive . 
  so now that budapest came to it 's senses and decided not to form budapetia , they saw your comment and thought : `` hey , could n't we just pick some random insignificant little village , ask them to secede and take all our debt ? '', 
  why yes , if this was how debt was handled they very much could and when the people they owe money too come knocking they can just say : `` sorry , but we do n't owe you a dime any more . 
  all hungarian debt belongs to the grand principality of hugivzafuk , population 7 and a goat . 
  call me overly optimistic , but i think he might be serious . 
  consider , the chinise gas deal showed the russians that they could cooperate , but only on chinas terms . 
  a partnership is only possible if they are content being the junior partner . 
  a russia-china-india packt makes matters even worse as they would be delegated to third place . 
  as an official or unofficial part of europe they get to be the big kid . 
  they might not get to do everything they want , but they have enough weight to toss around to be and more importantly feel relevant . 
  in the early days it did . 
  the soviets were in yugoslavia for a time before tito asked them to leave ... and they actually did . 
  before the falling out , stalin 's word carried a lot of weight . 
  that 's the point of making a point , just like you did with your slippery slope argument '' . 
  there 's a difference between `` less enthusiastic than everyone else '' and `` not missing a single opportunity to remind everyone they think the eu is n't quite as bad as cancer ... 
  yet . '', 
  the worst part was the statement that the event should n't be about eu politics . 
  well it fucking was n't until they made it about politics . 
  it was just a flag that 's there because the ceremony is in france and france is the eu . 
  had they not brought it up , no one would have even noticed , but now `` people are talking about it '' and `` some have expressed fears ... '' it 's political theater of the worst kind and `` senior british sources '' should be ashamed of them selves . 
  mine was us standard , singaporian , us black the really funny part was the first language guess : english ( aww , thanks ) , chinise , vietnamese ( wait , what ?! ), 
  why do you want to turn skandinavia in to a penis ? 
  the soviets kicked the japanese out of china . 
  they had 1.4 million troops to the japanese 1.2 million and despite fighting a well entrenched , highly profesionla veteran army of almost equal numerical strenght . 
  it took them 6 weeks . 
  6 weeks for japan to lose abou 75 % of it 's empire . 
  i think it 's fair to say the soviets could have in fact defeated japan eventually . 
  us lend lease to the ussr amounted to roughly 16 billion tonnes of good with a value of roughly 11 billion usd . 
  roughly 7000 tanks , 11000 aircraft , trucks , jeeps , uniforms , small arms ammo ... a lot of stuff , but the russian made over 106,000 tanks during the war as well as 142,000 aircraft . 
  soviet wartime gdp was about 1,4 trillion dollars total , most of witch ended up being used for the war effort . 
  while the l-l totals seem impressive , they did n't arrive in a single batch . 
  an extra 7000 tanks in 1941/42 is a war winner , but dispersed over time we get 140 us tanks shipped per month , vs 2800 soviet tanks made in the same interval . 
  us aid amounted to the soviets getting a free city of 1-2 million people . 
  a significant boon , but the soviets lost quite a few cities and regions with that kind of production power and they still soldiered on . 
  most importantly , the period when the ussr needed help most , during late ' 41 , early and mid ' 42 , they got far less aid than when the war was winding down and the rutes were getting safer . 
  hitler never got a single vote . 
  he was appointed to the position of chancellor and basically used the fact that he had 20 times more men than the 100k strong wehrmacht to secure a rigged election . 
  he had disgruntled former conscript soldiers . 
  europeans are unarmed , untrained and would face not only their own , but also their neighbours professional armies if anyone tried to pull that off today . 
  without conscription you have the anger and rhetoric , but lack the teeth the dictators of the 1930 's had . 
  germany and france are closely cooperating , france and england and closely cooperating , germany and poland , poland and the baltic states , france and spain , spain and portugal ... everyone is passively cooperating on an eu level and everyone is cooperating with their neighbours on a national level . 
  there 's no `` us vs them '' mentality . 
  the nationalist are small fringe groups that , while they are getting some support from their base , are also universally hated by every other party in their respective countries .

   refute this claim , do n't mention there are also many non-whites you mistook the intent of that statement , i meant that a lot of the ones you claim do not look white . 
  but yeah , i do see your point , however , stating them as caucasian would be a far better option . 
  arabs are not indo-european , so they are n't caucasian even by the largest stretch . 
  i also love how you managed to find the whitest possible person of every stated denomination to make a point . 
  yes , a lot of people in those countries could be considered caucasian , but calling them white is kinda sidelining the fact that a lot of them are quite dark . 
  bestly . 
   i do n't see any romans in croatia correct . 
  you also do not see much native americans in the usa anymore . 
  you also do not see anyone calling croatia pannonia or illyria or any of the numerous tribes or cultures surviving in any way , shape or form . 
  that is how migration works , from the germanics entering roman empire , to the angles and saxons entering celtic britain to the indo europeans entering europe , middle east and india , etc. 
   yet it 's pretty obvious their legacy still exists and influences the culture . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  you think it is some kind of a plus argument that some ruins and a vague notion of past european identity will remain ? 
  so it is all going to be ok because some nigerian 150 years from now will remember that there was once a croatia where he lived ? 
  that is some brick to the wall levels of submissiveness . 
  which hundreds of millions of whites are you talking about ? 
  russians in asia ? 
  no , because if i died and my body had a brain transplant from some other dude , that would no longer be me . 
   hundreds of millions of white people live in asia ... what ? 
  no , it is not . 
  we exterminated 15 % of the wildlife in 20 years with just the 5-7 billion span , 10 billion would be an apocalypse for the biosphere , let alone 80 billion . 
  unfortunately , yes . 
  that is exactly what we should do . 
  i am a different person from what i was 10 years ago , i am still me . 
  hvar does not have sandy beaches , but it is just one island . 
  stop using singular haplogroups for ethnic genetics , it is idiotic . 
  by that standard , the peoples of northern afganistan and uzbekistan are the most slavic peoples on earth . 
   whichever you prefer the correct one , which is the opposite of yours . 
  avars are n't mentioned in pannonia since the early 9th century , they were basically gone by the time hungarians migration was set . 
  croatia has sandy beaches though . 
  this is a surprise to nobody . 
  the rule of law , especially border enforcement , is long past being a joke in the eu . 
  the mediterranean navies should usher in a blockade before thousands turn into hundreds of thousands . 
  it was barely as powerful as any of those mentioned individually , let alone combined . 
   gave us the slivovitz that would be the bulgarians , it spread to serbia , bosnia and croatia later . 
   he was born there . 
  i disagree with this . 
  it should add at least another one or two generations , meaning the parents or grandparents being born there . 
   nor were communist they were communist , just not with the ending result you wish they had . 
  also , if anyone tries it again , it will have the same result . 
   president of san escobar . 
  all please stand for the [ national anthem . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=senof0vblek ), 
   make you a murderer yeah , he should have just gouged his eyes out . 
  you still destroy his life completely but if you get caught you are tried merely for bodily harm instead of murder , so the sentence is much lower . 
  gouging eyes is the way to go . 
   straight into white nationalist bullshit . 
  lol , that is barely identitarianism , nothing he said is even close to white nationalism . 
   so this whole thing reeks of hypocrisy . 
  yes , that is basically what 21st century religion is in its essence . 
  * nigeria [ it has begun . 
  ] ( http://cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/images/39/3904.png ), 
   and he walked away free , without being punished for the crimes nobody in their right mind is expecting politicians to be punished for their crimes in the modern age . 
  putin being punished was off the table from the start . 
   as for egypt , mubarak walked free irrelevant , the point is that he was overthrown . 
  these things do not happen in a single day . 
   it 's 2017 , not 1987 . 
  technology ( smartphones in particular ) has made it far easier to track and contain dissent . 
  erm , it has also made it far more difficult to contain organization and information flow from the protesters . 
  or do you forget what happened in egypt some years back ? 
  well , this one will be theirs . 
  it appears that there is a protest even there ; https://twitter.com/19slepchatov99/status/845985171912474624, 
   green ones look like groups of people yes , people icon is protesters , badge star is police doing police work . 
  go on russia.liveuamap.com on the upper right corner you will see a champagne glass icon labeled as `` key '' , once you press it , the icon info 's will appear in the sidebar . 
  perhaps , but this looks a lot stronger than past whistles . 
  the map shown here is just the zoomed out version , [ this is central moscow alone ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5zo6v5d.png ) . 
  this could have results , putin could at least be forced to react by compromising in certain aspects , like easing off on the whole authoritarianism a bit . 
  ongoing protests and political demonstrations in russia at this moment . 
  the russian spring could very well happen . 
  literally none of the examples i mentioned were military invasions . 
  even the men who sacked rome were roman auxiliary troops , they were settled peoples and a result of migration of peoples across roman borders . 
  have fun with your mental gymnastics though , it will never fail you when an argument appears . 
   that 's not what those guys 200 years ago said . 
  weird . 
   maybe everytime in history , when someone said this , it turned out to be wrong . 
  nah , they were usually right , from the german tribes entering roman empire , to the europeans entering whatever part of the americas , to the indo-europeans entering europe and the me , to the indo-europeans entering the indian subcontinent , to the slavs entering central and south eastern europe etc. 
  always the migratory bunch end up being dominant and bash the native identity , culture , language , religion and customs . 
   now you are saying it ... and i doubt anything is different just because you are saying it . 
  no , people like you just do not understand that these things take time . 
  wait a couple decades or a 100 years , then you will see . 
  actually , considering the effects of global warming on n. africa and the me , perhaps you will see it a lot sooner than you think . 
  because the irish were adamant to assimilate asap as they got off the boats . 
  a lot of the current migrants do not . 
  no stream ? 
   i 'm damn sure i read exactly the same against irish immigration to the us . 
  the difference being that the anti-irish sentiment had no basis in reality , while the other does . 
   really ? 
  the 1848 revolutions were already about that . 
  the 1848 revolutions were basically all ethnic revolutions/conflicts and were all , to my knowledge , within the right wing spectrum when looked at through our modern viewpoint of it . 
   they would just brand the european nationalists as traitors how though ? 
  if both sides claim that they want what is in the best interest of their political entity and one claims that the eu is in the best interest of the political entity , how could the other delegitimize that standpoint if the data proves otherwise ? 
   the traditional nationalists have the entire establishment behind them only in hungary and perhaps serbia , everywhere else it is a wishwash ready to be set aside . 
   you 'd need to bring something new to the table liberal nationalism by itself is something new on the table . 
   they will continue to be nationalistic as well they would be forced to relinquish a good portion of their agenda though , if they wished to remain in the wave . 
   you should rather appease the nationalists , give them something that will still represent their nation , but make sure that nations stay nations , as in , cultural groups they already have that , it is not enough . 
   it already is and it clearly is n't working . 
  i would go as far as to say that ethnic nationalism actually works better than the civic one well , we disagree on that one . 
   civic nationalism to me looks like it 's just saying big words without proposing anything , with no results other than angering the people who are n't parts of the nation . 
  civic nationalism in that form is quite new though . 
  other than the scots , nobody else even dabbled in it much .

  i think those two and those two only should be the focus of the eu and not federalisation . 
  which ofcourse its fine . 
  you are probably one of those types that screams about the lisbon agreement all the time . 
  makes sense i guess . 
  belgium does house most of the eu institutions . 
  does that have any effects on the populace in general ? 
  how is the eu percieved in belgie ? 
  definitely the transparency and bloating of a parallel supranational organisation that has the power to undermine even the wellbeing of a nation state for the greater good . 
  a small example would be banning red diesel . 
  good points . 
  has france seen any signs or symptoms from the economic crisis since 2008 ? 
  bureaucracy is a problem to you . 
  fair enough . 
  you might be on to something . 
  what else could we expect for the eu which is basically starting to become a paralel government to the aleady established states . 
  i see . 
  thank you for your opinion . 
  i really like norway btw . 
  fair enough, 
  very good statement . 
  i 'm conflicted right now . 
  no need to be rude . 
  we are opening a dialoge towards debate . 
  not ridicule . 
  well . 
  im slavic and grew up in nl . 
  i have travelled alot and seen both sides of the coin . 
  im telling you that no you giving up your sovereignty so that the eastern countries will prosper will not work . 
  besides you have already done that . 
  it seems to me that even though we want to say the eu is united it seems to me that the western countries just use the eastern and southern ones as a source of cheap labour . 
  and eastern countries are poor as fuck atm because russia . 
  thanks stalin . 
  i agree . 
  hmh . 
  good points here . 
  but for me it 's kind of the opposite . 
  whereas nations could have regulated and protected themselves through measures during the economic crisus and now the migrant crisis . 
  is n't it a bit of whishfull thinking that you will keep seeing yourself as a dane first and european second with what is going on in eu parliament . 
  e.g spindoctoring , no allowing leaving the union and the mentality of you are with us or against us like the case of switserland . 
  but since you are dutch . 
  you would willingly give up parts of your sovereignty to brussels ? 
  i mean the netherlands has been one of the members for a long time . 
  i grew up here . 
  as far as im concerned the eu is a cancer qua supranational organisation and the economic aspects could have been regulated without the involvment of it . 
  which it had intended to do . 
  i wish you well likewise . 
  belgium stronk and take care . 
  what human rights are violated . 
  please tell me . 
  oh , and did you read my edit post ? 
  just so you know i was a refugee myself during the balkan wars . 
  we lost our home , family and country , everything . 
  my parents still did not do the kind of stuff these supposed refugees in calais are doing so yeah fuck off mate . 
  fuck off with this shite already . 
  edit : just so you know . 
  these people `` without human rights '' are robbing people on highways by laying on the road . 
  multiple cases have already surfaced where some were run over . 
  furthermore let 's not forget how they attack and taunt the ferrydrivers , one was already stabbed . 
  if you ask me they do n't deserve rights since they are illegals , do n't have any documentation ( on purpose ) and come to the eu to leech off of it instead of creating something in their own countries . 
  but noooooo let 's give em human rights and protection cuz risking the safety of your citizens is less important than giving some wannabee refugee a cushy life . 
  fuck you mate and your liberal fuckbuddies . 
  what ? 
  i live in the netherlands . 
  i 'm not proud . 
  i am `` insert nationality '' but im not a european nor will i ever be . 
  in fact as soon as i get my degree i 'm bailing out . 
  do n't care . 
  high taxes , people are shite , culture as well . 
  i have to live in a neigborhood full of immigrants and i 'm scared whenever i have to leave my fucking house . 
  so yeah . 
  i 'm out . 
  got nothing against europhiles but not my cup of thee . 
  cheers, 
  it 's called yellow journalism . 
  look it up before you try to act like a psychologist . 
  i hate that fucking style of building . 
  the cities i mostly visit are being swarmed with expats that are coming back and building these cancerous monstrosities . 
  they destroyed the surounding of my base city . 
  do n't be obtuse . 
  you know what he meant . 
  unsubbed sam vec i jebo sam ratchetu po spisku . 
  check mod list . 
  i 'm kind of on your side on this one . 
  we went to war and buried the hatchet . 
  time will heal all wounds and i speak this as a refugee from the bosnian war . 
  this however does not excuse what the albanians are doing . 
  what are you on about ? 
  jeban sam . 
  is this for real ? 
  alright fuck this . 
  unsubbed . 
  take that objectivity and shove it up your imperialist ass . 
  it seems alright for a brit to defend a chetnik . 
  did you vote in favor of him ? 
  should n't have started a world war then m80 . 
  oooo noo you didnt . 
  remove serb . 
  oluja best day of my lyfe . 
  krajina no more !, 
  yes !,

  yugoslavia owed nothing to the soviets ( the red army entering from bulgaria assisted in the liberation of belgrade and some parts of vojvodina ( serbia north of the danube ) at a point when liberation was already inevitable . 
  they ended up giving stalin and the soviets a resounding ` no ' at the end of the 40 's and nothing happened . 
  i think you forgot someone . 
  who cares ? 
  it 's not like what stalin had to say counted for much in yugoslavia . 
  also , bogu iza leda - behind god 's back . 
   come to think of it , what would we be uniting around anyway ? 
  squatting , alcohol , tracksuits . 
  i 'm from rijeka but i live in the us . 
  anytime i go back burek is one of the first things i have to have . 
  the best burek place in the city i 'm from is run by an albanian family that came up 50-60 years ago . 
  there 's one in the area i 'm in and it 's a great place , it 's just pretty far on the opposite side of town and on the way out . 
  there are also two shops that sell our stuff ( it 's where we get things like ajvar , napolitanke , bronhi , etc. ), 
  as well as a bunch of other balkan/eastern european groceries . 
  all in all it 's not that bad but i 'd love to have better access to bakery-quality burek ( the oily one ) . 
  still waiting for an albanian to open a chain of buregd\u017einica in the us . 
  nothing yet :(, 
  please do n't link to it . 
  did you sing bog je srbin ? 
  looks like they treated croatia as some sort of ex-yugoslav team . 
  silly really . 
  we have had a kosovar albanian play for us in the past though in [ ardian kozniku ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ardian_kozniku ) . 
  and weirder names . 
  i live in the us , watching the opener today with some countrymen and potentially some former countrymen . 
  funkstar de luxe - sun is shining ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dmliukzb7i ) [ air - la femme d'argent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ninoxrxze9k ), 
  oh , you also forgot chifameno ( some call it ukomanje ) , the reverse of tre\u0161ete . 
  well , i 'm just not sure if scopa = trijumf/vierzich . 
  i know it 's played though . 
  it 's quite fun with three players , less so with two . 
  to op , my grandfather once tried to teach me a game called \u017dandar ( as in gendarmerie ) that is also played with triestine but he could n't quite remember the rules of the game . 
  ever heard of it ? 
  i believe scopa is also played in croatia , though under the name trijumf ( triumph ) or vierzich ( german for 40 ) . 
  what 's up with latvia and lithuania ? 
  edit : thanks for the responses , both make a lot of sense . 
  i think it was u/bognesrbin who would post the same link with some snarky comment in any thread about the floods he could find . 
  ** croatia ** it flares up here and there but it 's fisticuffs and some property damage at worst . 
  when compared to the kind of crap that goes on in serbia ( where a lot of supporters/leadership are involved in organized crime - a capo was just shot and killed in front of a nightclub in belgrade ) , it 's nothing . 
  the ultras in the city i 'm from are even viewed quite positively by the city 's population but i ca n't really comment on whether this is the case in other cities . 
  moldova is southwestern russian exclave ... for now . 
  money that could 've been invested in eastern poland . 
  yes . 
  there are no articles in slovene so it could technically also be read as ` for the new europe . ', 
  ah yes . 
  i thought you were implying that austrians can mail in their ballots . 
  it would make sense that austria would be that far ahead of us . 
  croats abroad will be voting this weekend . 
  votes are then sent to the state voting commission and added to domestic counts . 
  it 's a trivial number though and should n't change any results . 
  this is my opinion , but he was also the taxman who was trying to raise taxes on a cashstrapped population so few , if any , will shed any tears over his departure . 
  he 's likely to be replaced by another one of milanovic 's incompetent doormats ( linic was old old school - something milanovic has done a lot to purge the party of - i disagree with it ) who will follow the new party line of thumbing one 's ass and deflecting blame . 
  all of these languages ( particularly ours with one letter = one sound ) are more logical than english . 
  slovene is a distinct language from serbian , croatian , or serbo-croatian . 
  the latter two are two different vocabularies using essentially the same rulebook . 
  why bring the western balkans into.this ? 
  some of us do n't use russian gas at the moment , why start now ? 
  it 's probably an understatement of how bad it is . 
  the reporting is shoddy and i think it only counts those that have signed up at the unemployment office . 
  both sets of terms sound silly . 
   there is also the argument however that the barnett formula , the mechanism that determines how money is allocated from westminster to holyrood , is inefficient and relies too much upon the good will of westminster key question is does an independent scotland have more money to work with than the scotland that receives money from westminster ? 
  the article says they 're a christmas dish but in my experience they 're more commonly made for easter . 
  also , [ pinca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pinca ) . 
  same in croatia . 
  i do n't really think there is one yet . 
  poles have only recently started arriving in significant numbers whereas germans have been coming in hordes for a while . 
  perhaps a bit frugal , but i think overall croats like poles because of cultural similarities . 
   my german friend has a lot of experience with british tourists . 
  the funniest thing she said was that you can always spot the british . 
  they 're red ones who never forget to drink but always forget to put any lotion on . 
  this is sort of the stereotype for germans in croatia . 
  tickets not costing an arm and a leg . 
  being confused for each other . 
  slovenia has a short coastline , slovakia is landlocked . 
  some language families do n't have articles , yes , but there are quite a few european languages that do have them . 
  i think most is an overstatement . 
  i like to drink a lot of liquid so beer is nice because i can have quite a bit without getting drunk ( which is not something i 'm aiming for ) . 
  ca n't really do that with wine ( which i do like to have , i just have to have water or some other drink on the side ) or liquor ( if it 's more than an apperitif no thanks ) . 
   it might be a cultural thing believing in conspiracy theories is definitely a staple of our culture as well as our neighbors ' cultures . 
   and he has couple academic degrees to prove that he 's not an idiot . 
  these are not mutually exclusive . 
  disappearances of russian luxury cars have already increased three-fold . 
  in unrelated news , the price of luxury cars in albania has been halved in the last 24 hours . 
  building of structures to alleviate flooding have been going on for a while . 
  also , i 'm inclined to say that venice is a cash cow for italy and makes more than is paid back into it by the government . 
  it is , like the netherlands , also a very flat place . 
  i can see all the mines and see where they end ... how useful . 
  does dnepropetrovsk really fit in with those other two though ? 
  i was under the impression that it was quite pro-ukrainian . 
  i mentioned the lasting adverse effects on slavonia earlier and i should 've thought better of it . 
  while the cases do contain mention of reparations ( which is why i brought slavonia up , as an example ) , i 'd like to make it clear that i do n't think they should be paid or exchanged . 
  i do n't know what should be done nor do i think justice can be served to those who deserve it ( they are either dead , have already been tried for lesser crimes , or have effectively covered up any admissible evidence ) . 
  it is effectively state-sponsored bickering of sections of the countries ' populations and i 'd rather there were no suits at all ( i realize croatia had a while to withdraw before serbia filed its counter ) . 
  what irked me about the post was that it was an uninformed glossing over of large parts of the conflict and implied that victims should be treated differently because some were `` the real '' victims and others were not . 
  * i 'm * not trying to prove anything . 
  if croatia wants to sue serbia and serbia wants to sue croatia back to please their aggrieved populations , i do n't see why they should n't be able to . 
  it is their legal right to do so . 
  i 'm not a hard-liner and the judgement of the cases wo n't affect me in any way , but / u/john _ norway 's comment was stupid and seemed to cheapen the suffering that many endured on all sides . 
  people should n't be precluded from seeking justice because of their countrymen 's actions . 
  and the serbs who were driven out of croatia were born in croatia , why is serbia counter-suing croatia ? 
  sounds silly , does n't it ? 
  a lot of your `` extra '' letters are vowels .

  so , i reckon there 's support for this , you should just check slovenian news sites . 
  they have problems with what their politicians do domestically , not how they handle things internationally .

  til some church papers equals to whole nation , you 'd fit right in with the guardian journalism . 
  oh my , you indeed have your knickers in a twist . 
  no one denied that romania cooperates with v4 , lots of countries cooperate with them through that framework ( croatia too ) . 
  what i linked just had more relevance to the topic at hand since those are the words from the same person that prompted this whole post and discussion , and it explicitly mentioned an union inside an union . 
  besides , romania has that [ craiova group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ) going on for it . 
   but hey , maybe that dodgy boomerang you call croatia is really special . 
  i wonder how did we survive before you joined eu to tell us what we can . 
  pray tell , i wonder myself as well - how did you ? 
  it was not really a suggestion but rather some joking , both of the comments you latched onto were in jest . 
  i thought your first comment was in jest as well but now i 'm not so sure . 
  regardless :  while you 're as out of it as we are ( if not even more ) [ actually ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-29/austria-populists-soften-eu-stance-as-brexit-shapes-campaigning ) , there 's a mention or two :  to gain more influence over eu policy , austria should form a `` union within the union '' together with slovenia , croatia , the czech republic and hungary , hofer said . 
  the alliance of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -- the benelux countries -- shows that small nations can increase their power if they cooperate , he said . 
   maybe it 's a good idea to cut short this cockiness . . because romania is arguably of higher strategic importance for v4 ( existing gas pipes , transport corridors , seaport ... ) and therefore probably has a higher chance of ever `` joining v4 '' than croatia . 
  i know you were just * butthurt * by his comments , but i still feel like i need to correct you on this one , because croatia was historically pretty important to austria/hungary/whateverthenamewasatthetime as the southern end of central europe with quite a nice access to adriatic sea . 
  pula was the main port for the navy and rijeka was a port of utmost importance to hungary ( which is why we had some not so nice things like ` rije\u010dka krpica ' ) . 
  today , it 's not that important due to negligence , trieste and koper stole a good chunk of its transport , but with proper care and investing it could be brought up to speed again to everyone 's benefit . 
  also , as far as energy supply goes , croatia has a better position to provide for central europe , since to the north we can cover most of central europe with very little pipe mileage and even easily connect it to the baltic lng terminals . 
  there were already talks and plans for krk lng terminal which would do this , and were encouraged by americans ( especially during the ukraine crisis ) in order to diversify european energy suppliers . 
  also , if you look up the historical inspiration of visegrad group , you 'll notice that charles i of hungary has also had the title of king of croatia , so we were there in the beginning . 
   hofer . 
   zeman built his campaign on slamming those filthy foreigners there 's your link . 
  what a trainwreck of an article . 
  it 's an ` opinion piece ' all right . 
  no , the red square was in power when we joined the eu and we also applied for membership during their governance ( in 2003 ) . 
  however , the negotiations were handled and brought to an end in 2011 by the blue square . 
  both parties had joining eu as their goal . 
  no , they 've been here since the 90 's , yellow and burgundy squares are new . 
  the purple one is a new political party , but it 's made of veteran politicians , so we ca n't really call it something new . 
   did any fellow croatians ? 
  no , that 's just sensationalistic bbc for you . 
  they had some bs ` article ' about these elections a few days ago as well , you can check it if you 're in for a wtf . 
  but [ unlike blizzard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wrw3c2njee ) , i doubt they ever said it out loud .

  or not , because at least you 'd know to avoid one , and these attacks happen relatively randomly so you ca n't really avoid , it 's just a matter of luck to not be there .

  if you wish to look for legislation , [ this index ] ( https://rainbow-europe.org/ ) has a good breakdown for each european country regarding lbgt rights . 
  our president [ managed to sneak into top 50 ] ( http://www.forbes.com/profile/kolinda-grabar-kitarovi263/?list=power-women ) as well . 
  croatia did n't , because it is n't a legal successor to independent state of croatia , but to [ socialist republic of croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_republic_of_croatia ) , which itself is legal successor to pre-wwii kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  unlike serbia , who in fact is the legal successor of 90 's yugoslavia . 
  besides , [ world war ii reparations to yugoslavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_reparations_towards_yugoslavia ) were handled by germany . 
  took you long enough to mention wwii though . 
  honestly , that 's not even that much of a problem here . 
  what 's more concering is this :  serbia must first scrap its law on universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases committed in the former yugoslavia that 's like germany having a law on universal jurisdiction in war crime cases committed in the third reich . 
  i honestly do n't understand what eu is thinking here because it goes against their legislation , but it 's not like i was too hopeful about eu to begin with .

   do males commit suicide twice as much in poland compared to germany or are females just less suicidal ? 
  none of that . 
  it 's just a male to female suicides ratio i.e. 
  how many men commit suicide for every woman 's suicide . 
  i 'll make up these numbers just to illustrate my point : male suicides / female suicides poland = 400 / 50 germany = 3 500 000 / 1 000 00 once again , i exaggerated some numbers just so it 's easier to understand , do n't take these numbers as facts . 
  from these you can see that germany males commit suicide a lot more than twice as much compared to poland . 
  you can also read into it as women being more suicidal since a bigger number of women out of the female ( or total if you wish ) population kill themselves . 
  so , the map is just what it says . 
  there 's not much beyond that and there 's no point in trying to read into it too much and come with conclusions like those two of yours .

  [ city case ] ( http://www.promet-makarska.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/split-city.jpg ), 
  does a bear shit in the woods ?

  when hdz came to power the price of 1 km jumped 40 % and kept going up . 
  they even made an exit near the village where their pm was born and employed people from there to work ... . it 's the least used exit on all highways in croatia . 
  i know you did . 
  i am just explaining why would i prefer brussels to our politicians . 
  i did . 
  nationalism was a big part of the war , but economy was also an issue . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 used nationalism to get to power . 
  yugoslavia was ruled by 8 member committee , one from each republic and autonomous region ( kosovo and vojvodina ) . 
  after getting his people to power in serbia , kosovo , vojvodina and montenegro milo\u0161evi\u0107 had 4 out of 8 votes . 
  slovenia and croatia really did n't like that . 
  and that 's why we wanted to secede . 
   no , but as soon as our politicians finish building the highway highway building was one of the biggest criminal enterprises of the former government . 
  they stole billions . 
  http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/29051/hac-za-bojenje-tunela-placa-43c6-mil-kuna.html hac ( public company that is running highways ) paid twice to paint two tunnels !!!, 
  twice !, 
  30 euros per square meter of the tunnel in the end . 
  and this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia#gdp_per_capita_of_major_cities you can see ljubljana and zagreb ahead of belgrade in development . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia#collapse_of_the_yugoslav_economy  governments of individual republics refused to pay federal taxes or enforce federal import fees ( border police and customs services were under the jurisdiction of republics ) , ** and the government of serbia even managed to use the federal money printing facility in belgrade to issue itself a short-term credit . 
  ** the federal government was forced to raise the exchange rate for the german mark first to 9 and then to 13 dinars . 
  the economic struggle also heightened already tense relations among the republics and between the republics and belgrade . 
  just a tidbit . 
   in the 1990 multi-party elections , economic policy was at the centre of the political debate as separatist coalitions ousted the communists in sr croatia , sr bosnia and herzegovina , and slovenia . 
  just as economic collapse spurred the drift toward separation , separation in turn exacerbated the economic crisis . 
  cooperation among the republics virtually ceased and , with one being at another 's throat , both the economy and the nation itself embarked on a vicious downward spiral . 
  the process sped along as the republican leadership , deliberately fostered social and economic divisions to strengthen their own hands . 
  we already lost 20 % in the last 6-7 years . 
  and our moronic government took more loans to cover for public sector spending ... 
   i am 100 % serious . 
  our politicians have stolen billions and billions of our money in the past 25 years . 
  all the public sector workers get jobs based on family relationships . 
  it seems like you live in croatia . 
  wages that are too high ? 
  you guys have economy that lived on debt and you still refuse to reform . 
  croatia has similar problems and i would really like that our politicians learn something from this , first of all that you ca n't just take loans forever . 
  instead of reforming and cutting public sector we have debt growing ... same shit and we are heading into your direction because politicians do n't want to deal with problems and just take more loans . 
  we lost 20 % of gdp in the last 6-7 years and yet , somehow , our budget got even bigger . 
  you ca n't spend what you do n't make ... well , you can for some time , but then you have to pay even more on interest . 
  only thing keeping us from bankruptcy are low interest rates and we are fucked when they go up . 
  i 'd like one for croatia as well . 
   nobody can possibly be jealous of that agreement you do n't live in a balkan country . 
   what is happening today though is germany wants to acquire greece . 
   you can vote against it . 
  we want it cause we need it but nobody is forcing you . 
  just as i said . 
  you need it , you voted to get it . 
  others vote not to give it you . 
  very simple . 
  democracy . 
   well , look how th situation in yugoslavia developed from nothing to full-blown war in a short time , it took 5 years of serbian nationalistic propaganda to stir the war . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 started his bullshit in 1987 on kosovo , so no , it was n't a short time . 
   not even money , just nationalistic feelings . 
  actually , it was about money . 
  some of underlaying problems were about the money and slovenian and croatian politicians were campaigning for fiscal independence from belgrade . 
  we were more talking how we wo n't have to send our money to belgrade during first election than anything else . 
  yugoslavia had common budget and more prosperous republics were supporting those less prosperous . 
  our tourism was paying for power plants in serbia and so on ... 
  why would they ? 
  why would someone pay greek bills ? 
  they would prefer to spend the money on their countries . 
  just as greeks want to spend money on greece , finns probably want to spend money on finland . 
  dutch would probably like to spend money on the netherlands . 
  slovenians prefer spending money on slovenia . 
  greeks have democratic right to vote for other people 's money and those people should just give it to them ? 
  germany has voters too . 
  slovenia too . 
  finland too ... maybe those voters do n't want to pay for greece and instead prefer to spend money on their own countries ? 
  what the fuck did tsipras think he will get with a referendum ? 
   do you honestly believe that the path the troika has set greece on is going to work out ? 
  in the long run it would work . 
  and greece does need reforms . 
  they ca n't live on loans forever . 
  as for democracy , yes , the greeks had their referendum , but other countries also have democracy and voters . 
  why should finnish democratically elected government fall because greeks are bankrupt ? 
   greek democracy and what about democracy in other eu countries ? 
  should finnish government fall because greece wants more money ? 
  why should we honor greek democracy , but not finnish democracy ? 
  this is fucking stupid argument . 
  people in many eu countries ** do not ** support giving more of their money to greece . 
  whatever you do in the long run is usually better . 
  greece will suffer in both cases and in both cases in the long run it will be better . 
  in the end both camps are right . 
  all you need is to take long enough period for your `` predictions '' . 
   perhaps non-euro countries are n't involved in the bailout and so they are n't needed . 
  exactly, 
   which was just 2-3 years after this . 
  we had to enter bosnia after operation storm in croatia and take some towns to make them come to the table . 
   even if the cost of that is forgiving some of the debt . 
  people are forgetting it 's not just that , greece needs another big bailout on top of that . 
  i have a friend who was in manja\u010da after surrendering ... he ended up with ptsd and killing two people . 
   it was certain that they would be slaughtered . 
  it was n't . 
  same here . 
  you have many people considering [ mirko norac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirko_norac ) a hero , but he is just a war criminal and a coward . 
  there is nothing heroic in taking people from shelters and killing them . 
  that 's not what heroes do . 
  ok , one or two bombs . 
  forgot about that . 
  nato never bombed anything in croatia . 
  they had some bombing in bosnia , but they did n't support in our military operations with bombings . 
  us did have a drone base on one of the islands and shared intelligence and that 's it .

the internet as a buisness tool is still a * new * and * suspicious * idea here , so do n't expect much going on through internet here , even though it is slowly changing for the better . 
  we have just recently and it seems relcutantly accepted the fact that we * should * make things like schedules , bus/ferry/train timetables , and various other basic info available online . 
  we now have to master the fact that we should keep that info up-to-date , accurate and reliable , and maybe ( keeping-my-fingers-crossed ) one day we will come to a great idea that we should also make it comfortable to use , which means having shiny , pretty and actually usable ui but it 's not * too * bad . 
  i think we are now somwehere in 2008 level . 
  at least buying things through internet ( for now credit cards only , no paypal ) , is now available , even though i think most people here do n't even consider it, 
  i 've visited bologna !, 
  mostly cause there happened to be a ryanair super cheap promotion at the time best decision ever . 
  the city really has it 's own vibe and style , with the towers and the arches and columns in almost every street, 
   years which really matter rather events . 
  invasion of poland , operation barbarossa , pearl harbor , stalingrad , d-day ( i am on purpose sticking just to european theatre ) if i had to choose one invasion of russia  noun associated with the warfare period irrational hate  noun associated with the end of the war bleiburg ( crime of the victorious partisan liberation army over the defeated remains of fascists ) i am not fascist apologist or anything , this is just something in croatia is usually mentioned when talking about `` end of war ''  the role of your country in the war yugoslavia or ndh ? 
  ndh is a murdering , vicious horrible fascist puppet state which should never have existed and us croats should be deeply ashamed of it ( which sadly may not be the case ) yugoslavia 's role may be a slight delay in operation barbarossa , and more important partisan warfare probably the biggest and most effective in whole europe , tying many axis troops  the perception of your country-men who fought within the wehrmacht or waffen-ss my personal opinion they were either cold hearted murders and psychopaths , or people seriously deluded into thinking they are just fighting for a independent croatia , which makes it sadder  the role of national partisans within your country huge . 
  they started as heroes . 
  ended up with mass killings and retributions making them not much different then their enemy . 
  so you have issues with the ( whale ) hunt itself ? 
  i did n't really get what is this principle that makes it unacceptable ? 
  is it the fear that this sustainable and necessary hunt grows or becomes excuse for a unsustainable and unnecessary one ? 
  this does not seem valid logic, 
   but it 's necessary not to accept in general that ** such ** hunts are acceptable . 
  the word `` such '' in your sentence should indicate that this kind of hunt is specific , while you seem to incorrectly use it like it is a synonym for `` any '' and `` all '' . 
  in essence this `` such '' hunt is small scale , sustainable , ecological , and a case has been made for it to be necessary for local population . 
  if it would be large scale , unsustainable , unnecessary and hurting the whale population it would n't be * such * hunt anymore so * such * hunts are perfectly acceptable , but we have to be careful that * such * hunt does not turn into * not such * hunt which might not be acceptable, 
  forgotten ? 
  and you dare call yourself b-ville patriot ? 
  so no news from belfast , bordeaux or bucharest ? 
  again , your argument suffers from the same issue , and that is that it severely and purposly understates and masks the severness of the action of the slovenian side , and just assumes and * pretends * resignations are enough for arbitration to continue ( and by such it is not a material breach ) . 
  which is non legally speaking bullshit and you know it . 
  the slovenian judge and representative through the course of trial conspired to share privilaged information , break rules to add documentation based on this information as well as lobby the other judges into their favour . 
  in the past throughout the trial . 
  it makes the entire past process contaminated and in breach of agreement . 
  if documents were given illegally and statements made with knowledge of judges inner discussions , all those must be scraped . 
  also we dont know if a judge might have been conviced into a opinion in a private dinner with your judge , which if happened is also against the rules . 
  just resigning does not delete previous wrongful actions and breaches and as such those are direct essential breach in the tribunal 's task to be fair , just , unbiased and in correspondance to international law . 
  in any law , even international , such actions should bringat least a mistrail or retrail , and in this case be considered a essential breach of the agreement oh , and if the tribunal is in doubt , sorry we can not only ask the tribunal itself to make a judgment . 
  you dont ask a pottentialy corrupt judge to make a judgment if he is corrupt . 
  which is all why article 60 can and should be applied , and we can all agree on it , no ? 
   both of your claims are false , please read the arbitration agreement and look at article 9 , paragraph 1 and article 11 , paragraph 3 . 
  9 paragraph 1 , only showed that slovenians lift their restrictions , and a. 11 paragraph ** 2 ** states my second point that it goes into force * immediatly * ( after the week ) , while p. 3 states the procedures timelines start after ascension into eu , leaving it open to interpretation , but let 's just leave it at that . 
  ----- your statement  being `` dishonest '' and `` cheating '' is not breaching the agreement . 
  even if true , and it 's not , just proves the point that this agreement is a absurd legal document and one should get out of it . 
  i am not a lawyer so i am not familiar with the difference between ** material ** and ** procedural ** so i do not know why do you insist the breach was just `` procedural '' and the resigning of the judge and the representative was enough ? 
  it 's a very bold statement and you did not back it up with anything ? 
   individual judges or representatives are not the institution itself , they can be replaced sorry what ? 
  where does this say in the agreement that just replacing them is enough ? 
  the representatives themselves are appointed by the parties , so their actions are the actions of the party , in this case slovenia . 
  even if not , the fact the woman in question is part of the government , definitely means it is the action of the party in question   a material breach of a treaty , for the purposes of this article , consists in : ( b ) the violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of the treaty . 
   again , exactly which part of the agreement did slovenia break ? 
  as you yourself said , and considering your representative means slovenia : a10.p1 a6.p5 and if the claims of adding evidence after deadline apply : a6.p1 and if such behaviour is in breach of court of arbitration optional rules : a6.p2 i find all of those `` essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of the treaty '' , i find confidentiality very essential . 
  i would now , seemingly you have time and skills , ask you to study and interpret to me the set of international laws called upon in the a4 a ) and b ) , and more closely the one in a6.p2 which lay down more laws and rules for the agreement and the tribunal which are not present in the agreement itself . 
  -- but honestly , your whole argument is one big attempt to claim that by technicalities : - cheating is not covered by the agreement ; - cheating is not slovenian party 's responsibility ; - and an even bigger stretch on how communication and breach of secrecy between your representative and judge is n't a ** material ** breach covered by theun charter . 
  ( not to mention that after-deadline adding of documents would definitely mean a material breach even by your stretch of the definition of `` material '' , if it occurred ), 
  technically , croatia * signed * the arbitrary agreement in exchange slovenia 's parliament to * vote yes to allow * it to enter eu ( and actually if another country blocked croatia entering the eu for some other reason , arbitrary agreement would still take place , so it 's not like those things were dependent ) both of this things happened , so that part is fulfilled even if i am wrong , croatia 's legal argument is that slovenia is the one that actually broke the contract and as such croatia 's legal obligations are nullified . 
  and all that what croatia is doing is anyway perfectly legal . 
  we find no ethical or legal or `` consistency '' arguments for us to leave eu if * you * guys cheated and us finding , with evidence , this procedure to be unjust . 
  even if the lobbying of your side was a failure , and other judges resisted and are totally unbiased , just the doubt that this lobbying ( and not to mention other issues such as sharing information from the court , and planting new evidence outside of procedure ) occurred is enough for us to find any decision such a court would make unacceptable , and frankly we , or anyone else for that matter , should resist, 
  do you guys have no honor ? 
  you cheated , plain simple . 
  and , i am sorry , but slovenian side actions broke our trust into other judges , slovenian own intentions and sense of decency as well as in the arbitrary agreement as a proper means to solve the issue , as you obviously dont give a shit about it 's rules . 
  you guys sre the ones that should apologize and do your best to keep it going , offer retrial or new terms , not just two resignations and turning this situation into our fault with calls for us to quit eu ? 
  ah the good ol' balkan . 
  your posts are actually like a walk through 90 's propaganda from the usual : `` the other side is doing it too , for sure !, 
  even worse probably ! '', 
  and connected : `` we said we are sorry ( we are actually just sorry for being caught ) , why must we now also suffer the consequences of our actions ??? '', 
  with of course : `` let 's stop talking about this siutation and what we did , but bombard you with biasly interpretated events from history to show our enemy is just evil '' to the most omnious : `` yeah sure we are doing bad stuff , but it is actually justified in defense of justice ! '', 
   when it does n't go their way . 
  is that a new term for : `` when other side gets caught admitting cheating , breaking rules and possibly illegally influencing the other judges '' ? 
  i am guessing they are counting either workers here on a work visa , who i guess would n't count in national census , or also people with dual citizenship, 
  i was in belgrade 2 months ago , and i was just hit with the number of such migrants . 
  we do n't have this in croatia . 
  yet . 
  they were sitting on the squares mostly the one around bus station , or walking around , going from hostel to hostel . 
  my hostel had quite a number of them , and i remember the receptionist explaining all sort of rules to some of these guys who wanted to rent a bed . 
  like they had to leave the country and go back in , or to another that they can not register them until 24 hours pass , even though they had some paper authorizing them or sth even though the guy just wanted to take a shower and go to sleep and had money to pay . 
  he just had to come back in the afternoon for it to be legal . 
  i was very confused , but was just leaving and did not have time to ask . 
  do you know what was going on ? 
  i do n't think it is adding any `` pseudoscience to science '' as i just do n't see it as `` adding '' anything . 
  people are just asking about his beliefs , it ai n't science in any way and he might be aware of it , unlike you . 
  i could easily argue he is explicitly trying not to `` add anything to the science '' by choosing not to comment on the particular questions , but however you are interpreting it otherwise, 
  you are assuming and attributing way too much . 
  i really do n't think expressing belief in intelligent design can be compared to creationism or evolution denial . 
  if for no other reason , then because intelligent design does not say other theories are false and lies . 
  they just say a scientifically unprovable statement ( hence it is called belief ) that they think that whatever way it happened , it happened by some divine power and will . 
  so if you do n't have examples of him directly denying evolution or advocating creationism and bad science , you should relax, 
  i agree with you . 
  just to propose a solution : there are ( at least on paper ) measures and processes in democracies to change laws and regulations . 
  even if all politicians should turn a deaf ear , a civil citizen action through referendum or something could repeal the laws . 
  uber can back any such action financially if it so they desire , but they should not do what they are doing now and that is outright ignoring the current framework . 
  and i find their loophole and terminology differences exploitation ridiculous , immoral , and probably illegal . 
  if other people driving people in their cars have to pay some registration fee and have some licenses , so should ubers as they are providing ultimately the same service of driving people around in cars also , i have to say i have some conceptual issues when thinking about uber and its business model , mostly about the fact they themselves provide full application including regulatory procedures . 
  rating systems , good customer services , paying going through them etc , and it seems to be working great . 
  however it is all going only through uber itself . 
  it is not a third party service , it is not independent nor necessarily objective and fair . 
  i am not even that worried that it will become misused , abused or corrupted , even though all those are valid concerns . 
  i am worried that such a system will necessarily lead to a monopoly of uber as a service . 
  in the end , it will be you could work for uber ( or some equally large competitor ) or not at all . 
  and it worries me . 
  this worry is a part of my current uneasy feeling about this global social networking and internetofthings phenomena , where it seems that the applications and services used by most people kill competition , and lead to monopolies or oligopolies, 
   the fact someone thought this is some sort of normal thing to do is just sad well it is war there , for quite a long time now . 
  what became normal there changed quite drastically from what is normal `` here '', 
   while it may seem silly , even though the two sets of tests produce the same outcome , currently having done the us test does not mean the product is eu certified - to gain eu certification for the same thing , it must actually undergo the eu tests .

  the only difference is that i speak english , german and swedish , so i can undestand the names of the months . 
  but if a reporter is ignorant and grew up in such a surroundings ( say , * dalmatinska zagora * ) , i could see that she would n't know the alternative names . 
  though , it would be kinda embarrasing if someone were that dumb ... 
  not really that complicated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kanji https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiragana \u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306e\u5834\u5408\u3067\u306f \u3001 2\u3064\u306e\u8868\u8a18\u4f53\u7cfb\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059 \u3002, 
  no , i 'm serious  honestly , i could care less , just saying that i never heard anyone use `` vazduh '' in croatia . 
  maybe in bosnia ? 
  does n't japanese also have that ? 
  kanji and hiragana ? 
  ( katakana is n't usually used except for foreign names ), 
  because when you are u bioskopu mo\u017ee\u0161 da vidi\u0161 kako \u0107e auti da odlete u vazduh . 
  or when you are u kinu mo\u017ee\u0161 vidjeti kako \u0107e auti odletjeti u zrak . 
  they are similar , but if you read the first sentence to a young croatian , he would n't understand what you want to say . 
   croatia also had a pretty weak performance i do n't think it 's weak compared to some other tonight . 
  nina rocked . 
  also , cyprus sounds like : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5fbdprejiu, 
  maybe they 'll show something good next year ? 
  i betted that iceland , armenia and austria would pass and that greece and bosnia-herzegovina would n't , lost 10 kn . 
  iceland was my favourite :(, 
  that 's not common for europe , maybe for france ... 
  that 's a racoon . 
  sweden wants to eliminate racoon dogs ( also known as tanuki ), 
  thanks !, 
  i translated the 4 short videos from the whole 45 minute show : on the left are gajski and sladoljev ( g - and s - ) , anti-vaxxers , and on the right are richter and te\u0161ovi\u0107 ( r + and t + ) , pro-vaccination : 1  t + : what is going to happen over the next few weeks , we 'll see . 
  that 's how our last [ measles ] epidemic started , to remind you , in 2014/15 , some time is needed for the epidemic cases to start appearing . 
  namely , we are currently at an end of an incubation period of measles which is around 14 days . 
  so , according to that , we can expect new cases , and we 'll see that soon enough , over the next few days ...  g - : the vaccines have n't been adequately investigated , which criteria and standards should be fulfilled to recommend vaccination is known , especially for mass vaccination , and that 's 1st that the disease should be serious , widespread , not treatable , not preventable by some other means apart from vaccination and that the vaccine must be effective and safe . 
  in the same way , in case of every individual illness , it should be determined if the concept of collective immunity applies . 
   r + : the [ vaccination ] calender is , compared to most european countries , much too sparse . 
  too poor , actually - we really vaccinate against the most basic of illnesses , in the us they vaccinate against 10 more diseases , extra . 
  so , concerning too much vaccination , that 's definitely not the case . 
  the number of shots and that kind of trauma was lowered by implementing 6 in 1 vaccine , which is not more than 10 shots until 8th grade . 
  everything dr. gajski is problematizing has been answered . 
  we can always discuss it again from the beginning , but one thing at a time . 
  we ca n't discuss everything at once because it 'll seem like we do n't know anything in the end , since we do know . 
  we do know , there is scientific evidence , not only that but there are indisputable facts our experience has shown . 
  i 'll mention the events in the early 1990s in former soviet countries where that country collapsed , that system collapsed , in russia and countries behind the caucasus one year they registered 39,000 cases of diphtheria . 
  here , whole europe was in an uproar when a child died in barcelona in 2015 and one year later in brussles , from diphtheria . 
  there , they had 39,000 cases , of which at least 10 % died . 
  i do n't know what they used to treat others . 
  when you stop vaccinating , those diseases come back . 
  because the pathogen exists . 
  the only pathogen which disappeared is variola ( smallpox ) . 
  however , all the other pathogens are here . 
   s - : the real density of the calender you can see in natural acquisition of the immunity . 
  in our blood you have tens of thousands of antibodies , practically since birth until death , which are remade through a much denser vaccination calender . 
  there are no side-effects . 
  ( host : and the needle is problematic because ? ), 
  the needle is problematic because it carries an issue of technical input of immunological provocation into the organism in a completely unnatural way . 
   t + : that 's simply not the case . 
  on a daily basis we can respond to millions of different antigens . 
  vaccines contain a few antigens , not millions of antigens . 
  2  s - : every shot represent an immunological mobbing which lasts for months . 
  so a newborn is under immunological mobbing , for ... for years . 
  it simply does n't stop . 
  and the most problematic thing occurs - the immune system is overstimulated . 
  in the milleu where it happens , there is a high probability that the immune system starts recognising its own tissues , itself , as foreign . 
   r + : for me , as a pediatrician , the needle/shot is a problem because it represents a trauma to the child . 
  and that that 's some kind of `` trauma of the immune system '' that is simply untrue . 
   t + : i am of the opinion , maybe it 's completely false , that the media gives a lot , i would even say too much , coverage to the people which are against vaccination , i mean , who claim `` the facts '' which most often are n't , actually - not `` most often '' , they have n't been checked , [ let 's be real here ] ( http://www.vereencenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/getty_rm_photo_of_cold_water_on_burnt_hand.jpg ) . 
   g - : there are n't any evidence that the vaccination has lead to eradication of infectious diseases which killed millions of people in the past , there are scientific papers , whole books even , which show it happened mainly due to improving living conditions , nutrition , habitation , education and the likes . 
   ( host : how would you replace the needle ? ), 
   s - : simple . 
  how we acquire natural immunity , how i described earlier . 
  we acquire it through the mucosa . 
  the skin is there to prevent what we violently do with the needle . 
  skin is here - the biggest organ . 
   ( h : so , oral vaccines ? ), 
   s - : in any way the immunological information can enter the mucosa . 
  into respiratory tract , gi tract , in any other way 3  s - : if there is an error , and there is , in technical equipment of the vaccine , and i 'm certain they 're connected with autoimmune diseases , you ca n't ignore that there 's been an explosion , even a layman nowadays can count at least 20 of syndromes connected to autoimmune diseases . 
  you ca n't deny that . 
  and medical science must see that . 
  but better than medical science , conscious parents can see that . 
  not only autism , but many shapes from the epileptic spectrum , behavioral issues , all of those are neurological disorders which are probably , and some definitely connected to vaccination . 
   t + : the main fear of autoimmune diseases exists regarding two vaccines , to be clear - existed [ as in , not anymore ] , vaccines against hepatitis b and human papillomavirus . 
  however , when you compare the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups , the incidence of autoimmune diseases between those two populations is identical . 
  what does that mean ? 
  the incidence of autoimmune diseases is much greater in female population than male population , and secondly , most often than not the first symptoms of autoimmune diseases appear exactly around the age when , some time ago , people were receiving vaccination against hep-b and nowadays against hpv . 
  and predominantely female children receive the latter . 
  thus , the connection between those two facts has never been scientifically proven . 
  never . 
   ( h : how safe are vaccines in croatia ? ), 
   g - : the same as everywhere else - we do n't know . 
  because vaccines have n't been adequately investigated in that way . 
  a few days ago , robert kennedy i think , us lawyer , and robert deniro offered i think 100,000 $ to the one who releases a study which proves the safety of vaccines . 
   r + : the vaccines in croatia are safe since those are all vaccines registered within the european community . 
  all of them . 
  4  g - : the obligation of vaccination is not a medical science debate . 
  it needs to be discussed with other speakers , such as a lawyer , a politician , an economist , a sociologist , and the patient . 
  it 's a whole different debate - an ethical , legal , political debate . 
   ( h : how should the system look according to you ? 
  freedom of choice ? ), 
   g - : the system should look so that there is * at least * the freedom of choice , but that all the vaccines , individually and in combinaitons , to bring into question their recommendation . 
  because we have no scientific basis even to recommend some vaccines , let alone to legally force them upon someone . 
   ( h : however , no country in the world , afaik , has of yet withdrawn their recommendation of vaccines )  g - : no , but that does n't mean that it 's something that 's necessary and which needs to be done . 
  the medical science today is not the same as the one 50-70 years ago . 
   t + : 20 years ago there was a big difference in percentage of vaccinated people in countries which had obligatory vaccination calenders and recommended ones . 
  today that 's not the case . 
  there are countries which do n't have obligatory calenders , a brilliant example of which is israel , which does n't have vaccination rates below 95 % for any antigen in their calender . 
  people there know that one ultra-orthodox group of jewish people does n't vaccinate their children , nobody touches them and everybody else gets vaccinated , and it 's not presented as a bogeyman . 
  the anti-vaccination movement does n't exist at all .

  these statistics and words mean nothing just of themselves . 
  first generation may or may not willingly assimilate into larger society of their new home . 
  second generation already takes on qualities of their birth place through society outside family naturally . 
  they are 50-50 at worst . 
  but their children should be fully assimilated unless something is preventing this , something like second generation not being part of larger society , instead only part of immigrant society . 
  i 'm not point at austria , it 's simply generally so . 
  if a third generation has n't already fully assimilated , then they live in a closed society which is not part of larger society of a country they live in . 
  this is the case of our traditional autochtonus minorities who lived in other country for centuries while maintaining their identity , customs and culture . 
  why ? 
  because they mostly lived in villages - societies , fully populated by people of their own ethnicity , and got exposure to majority only when migrating to majority populated city . 
  modern immigrants do n't live in ethnic villages , most move into towns and cities and make only a tiny fraction of local population . 
  if they do n't assimilate fully within three generations , it means they simply do n't associate with majority population enough , and that is a problem , that 's how we got roma problem . 
  we pretend they do n't exist , and they pretend our rules and norms do n't apply to them . 
  second generation grows up as they are raised by parents , but third generation ; whatever their faults are , it 's fully the blame of the host country , it 's society and education . 
  we also have ten times longer border . 
  language matters to assimilation more than migration . 
  it 's possible that roma migration went through croatia northwards , so that people were called , or they called themselves , croats because they came from croatia , even they were in croatia only for a generation or less . 
  at the same time , croats themselves migrated to hungary and slovakia in large numbers flleing from ottomans , and over the centuries through normal migrations as we were the same country . 
  chroat is pretty similarly pronounced to hrvat , but somewhere in deeps of history ch was lost and became only c , and other languages adopted the word according to their own language sound and rules . 
  it can be unacceptable as much as it wants , it 's part of war , it 's even a weapon of war , and you wo n't get rid of it . 
  war is shocking , it contains blown up brainless heads , destroyed houses , vengeful people and has no glory , honour or innocents . 
  anyone who thinks otherwise would get a very rude awakening should they ever find themselves in a war zone . 
  any war zone , anywhere , at any time . 
  that 's exactly what you 're suggesting by saying that croatian was purged of `` serbisms '' and new words were invented to make it more different . 
  your logic dictates that serbian is more akin to proper croatian what it would have been without evil lingo-nazis . 
  because they had 1/3 of the weapons during the war . 
  there was another yugoslavia before tito . 
  in that first one , for instance , cyrillic appeared all over croatia on public buildings . 
  among other things . 
  you are not saying that croatian is sebian , you are just saying that serbian is the natural state of our language and croatian is a forced mutation which basically exists because croats do n't want to speak serbian . 
  which is rather the same thing , . 
  i thought you 're claiming it 's one of the recently invented words after one of your imaginary purges . 
  ok , i 'll be serious now :  also croatian language had two-three purges , especially around wwi and wwii and recently in the '90s . 
  serbian words were n't purged , serbian standard language was purged . 
  serbo-croatian was basically melting croatian and serbian standards into one . 
  croatian and serbian standards were created similar ( almost identical ) , but separate and what yugoslavia did was proclaim both valid everywhere . 
  much of yugoslav official vocabulary was from serbian standard like things related to politics , governance and specially military . 
  military was full serbian , despite croatian having centuries of it 's own linguistic tradition in military matters . 
  we just reversed back to our own vocabulary . 
  you are constantly confusing croatian standard language with croatian spoken language . 
  hiljadu is used by some croats even today , specially older people who grew up in yugoslavia , but also some younger people under influence of serbian popular culture ( ` iljadu kuna is more likely to be heard in turbofolk club than tisu\u0107u kuna ) . 
  that has nothing to do with what is taught at school . 
  croatian language , as collection of dialects spoken in croatia , is incredibly rich and varied , serbian does n't come anywhere near it . 
  we speak dialects in our daily lives , but we learn standard in school and out of 6 or 7 words for tomato that we have , one of them being paradajz , only one is accepted in standard language and that is the one which is supposed to be used in school : raj\u010dica . 
  and croats are fine with that , we 've been fine with that for a few centuries . 
  the problem is in serbs who think that everything is anti-serbian conspiracy and everything exists to undermine supposed serbianess of non-serb south slavs . 
  \u0160e\u0161elj much ? 
   nowdays `` hiljadu '' would be considered `` serbism '' and you would get yelled at by your teacher if you used in croatia . 
  and yet tisu\u0107u is the original slavic word for 1000 and it 's actually the serbs who diverged from us and started using the new greek word - hiljadu . 
  alps and other high mountains tend to be quite cold places . 
  they are also part of the statistic . 
  more precisely , we shipped old weapons we do n't want to have any more , but completely suitable to those battlefields . 
  and then , completely unrelated , within months we started buying surplus american weapons , few years old , cheaply . 
  absolutely no relation between the two . 
  the whole drava river along the border of croatia and hungary ( at both sides ) is protected area , and at the place where drava enters danube , just east of osijek across drava , is [ kopa\u010dki rit nature park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kopa%c4%8dki_rit ) , quite famous for birds . 
  in fact 300 years ago the whole eastern slavonia , between drava , sava and danube , was one huge wetland that was dried in 1800 's . 
  kopa\u010dki rit and part of spa\u010dva forest down south ( near sava river ) are all that remains of it ( although spa\u010dva is artificial forest in a sense that trees are grown per plan , it 's been used for logging for centuries and is more like tree farm . 
  still , it 's prime hunting location in this part of the country ) . 
  it 's all in inaccessable swamp area that 's under water half of the year , which is why it 's still uncleared . 
  it used to be mined south of osijek all the way almost to bosnian border , which is almost all cleared now . 
  but that 's agricultural flatlands and easiest to clear . 
  what remains around zadar should be a priority , and around plitvice . 
  it looks cool , just needs some renovation and modernisation . 
  i think the apartments are impressive . 
  detailed and current map of minefields . 
  in some croatian dialects and serbian it 's buba\u0161vaba . 
  standard croatian is \u017eohar . 
  \u0160vaba is also another ( non official ) word for germans . 
  there was ragusa city state in one of the games . 
  what he means is croats have no territory where they have autonomy and self rule . 
  in balkans if you do n't own and control territory you do n't have rights , and if you live somewhere but do n't have autonomy you 're expected to rebel . 
  which is why there was ethnic cleansing , clean territory means secure territory . 
  and no amount of there being no real difference in wealth , freedoms and lifestyle of croat and his muslim neighbour down the street will convince them otherwise , and no amount of statistics pointing at futility of rs 's economic existence will convince them that they 're worst off part of federation because serbs rule rs alone and therefore they win . 
  and no one wants unitary bosnia except bosniaks because in everyone 's mind whole bosnia then becomes bosniak territory as they 're the majority . 
  unlike the popular misconception , the wars were n't about religion or nationalism , it was all about territory . 
  who gets what and how homogenous it is . 
  average person with opinion . 
  on anything . 
  we had huge population influx into the cities and these people had to live somewhere , quickly . 
  double that for countries which had ww2 destruction . 
  ok , my comment was deleted due to url shortener . 
  let 's try again . 
  it 's a stereotype that slavonia looks poor , based on most people looking at statystics and never actually being in slavonia . 
  houses are the same pretty much everywhere ( in the north ) except slavonia has a lot of traditional old houses which look tiny from the street but go deep into the yard . 
  there 's also some ruined house or empty plot here and there , ca n't be helped , people left in war and never returned and there 's no one to buy them . 
  as far as keeping the houses neat goes , i say from experience that i expected the north , for instance , to be all in silver and gold since they 're known for being clean and orderly , but surprisingly it looked exactly like home , except narrower streets and lack of foot paths . 
  [ so this ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/@45.2816968,18.7909635,3a,60y,238.82h,77.72t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss5vgb42_xwgmgfb8ljgc4a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=hr ) is a typical newer neighborhood in slavonia , as it is in my town ( also without foot paths , i hate that , but it 's a rare one ) . 
  same in every other . 
  and [ this ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/@45.2836985,18.8200766,3a,75y,129.03h,67.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seriliwhb7v7fwxactdukha!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=hr ) is the old kind of neighborhood with typical 2 window houses which had to be identical . 
  i specifically chose this street , there 's one still unrestored house and the street transitions into new modern houses so the difference is obvious . 
  however , despite being on the edge of town , they are n't really suburbs . 
  they are urban areas with all urban stuff in walking distance , 15 minutes from town center . 
  it 's called suburbia because it 's neither urban nor rural . 
  i consider the first circle of villages around towns the suburbia in croatia since , except in zagreb , there are no neighborhoods which are beyond 20 minutes from city centers as all other cities are quite compact , even the bigger ones . 
  so as far as my town is concerned , [ this is ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/@45.3313319,18.8484102,3a,60y,227.96h,75.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sihdvo8dckccyjxdauljqwg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=hr ) and [ this ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/@45.2838544,18.6801147,3a,75y,121h,75.29t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1soapy21cnlhsgpgk9vzvr3g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=hr ) is suburbia . 
  and yes , again no foot paths , that remark is biting me now . 
  if yugoslavia was 339 , croatia must be around 450 and slovenia around 550 . 
  or around hungary and czechoslovakia . 
  you are both wrong , in this context it translates as `` troll '' . 
  houses seem too high for croatia at first because i 'd say it 's closer to 60-40 , but then i remembered that 50 % of croatians live in villages which are all houses , and over half of the people in cities live in houses .

  slavs have a history of being under germany , hungary and turkey so they made this movement to revive their slavic culture and stick together as they were the same people living in different lands . 
  than ussr happened as well as stalinism , and unfortunately gave socialism a bad name and made all slavic people bitter towards the idea, 
   slovenians i mean linguistically and genetically yeah , culturally they are slavic but have * extreme * austrian/german influence . 
  there are even some dialects of slovenian that pronounce the `` u '' ( `` oo sound '' ) as the german/french `` u '' . 
  cuisine and the likewise , slovenian people are really , really heavily influenced by austria . 
   bulgarians genetically not really , linguistically and culturally they ( along with serbians and macedonians ) are oriented towards southern russian/ukrainians . 
  loads of turkish influence in bulgaria , equivalent to austrian influence in slovenia , possibly even more . 
   bosnians if by bosnians you mean muslim bosnians then yes , they are linguistically and surprisingly genetically slavic as well . 
  culturally , while retaining major slavic folklore ( baba yaga ) , they are even more so influenced by turks because of their religion . 
  i do n't know , despite the fact that bosnian muslims are slavic , it 's just so hard even as a croatian from bosnia to tie islam , circumcision , allah , the hijab ( in mosques , bosniak women usually do n't wear it outside ) and slavs together . 
  like it just does n't `` fit ''  albanians no . 
  tbh for croatian people , serbia bosnia and bulgaria are where `` balkan '' begins . 
  and now for serbia bosnia and bulgaria , albania is where balkan begins . 
  in albania , well that 's kind of it . 
  yes , i agree with russian imperialism thing !, 
  i do n't care if you mix the slovak slivovica with the bosnian one and call it the same thing ( it kind of is anyway ) , but when ( usually ) russia steps foot in a slavic country and then claims something along the lines of `` let me run this because we are the same people ( which yeah we kind of are but still ) '' then it sounds kind of staliny . 
  if we 're all the same people from the same origin , why do n't we all we all work together and cooperate with each other instead of just territory hogging ? 
  of course we 're all just people and we 're all equal and the same , that 's a given . 
  however when you look at it like that it 's not funny and kind of boring . 
  so itt , it 's already established we 're all equal , but focus on the thoughts and feelings of subdivisions and communities in europe . 
  after watching many videos of slavic/central european folklore , i began to see the many cultural commonalities between croatia and it 's surrounding countries . 
  i decided to make this compilation and post it here so that r/europe could see that any division , no matter the type ( religious , geographical , magyar ) is relatively small . 
  it 's amazing to see just how undivided you really are , at least within the same cultural sphere as you lol couple of notes : this took * really * long to do and it 's only the first part . 
  inb4 the pics are awkwardly cut and some are n't 1080p . 
  yeah there are a couple reasons for that : - finding some of these pictures was really hard - sometimes a picture would appear to be really similar to a region in croatia , but for some reason i just could n't pin my finger on which region so that greatly lengthened the process - sometimes there 's a particular variant of a folk costume that i knew existed but i could n't find a picture of . 
  for example , in this part i really wanted to include [ romania ] ( http://f.tqn.com/y/goeasteurope/1/s/s/n/-/-/girls-national-romanian-folk-dress.jpg ) and [ moldova ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3336/3562238202_10090852de.jpg ) as well as other [ slovak ] ( http://vodafest.org/sites/default/files/dsc_1840_custom.jpg ) pics but i just did not know the region of croatia or its diaspora had similar outfits . 
  but i know they have something like that if anybody wants to help contribute , any pms would be greatly appreciated . 
  i used google images , wikipedia and a facebook page for the croatian costumes and mainly google images for the other ones . 
  however i can tell you right now , the facebook page for croatian folk costumes had so much more info than the google images page , so i can only imagine how many outfits i skipped out in other countries because of my limited resources . 
  thanks for any feedback and i hoped you guys enjoyed it . 
  the countries i 'm looking to do in part 2 are : serbia bosnia montenegro albania/kosova bulgaria ( if applicable ) romania moldova italy czech republic germany/austria yes it 's a lot , and with the limited options google gives you , it 's very tedious . 
  on top of that while i consider myself pretty knowledgeable on croatian folklore , i do n't know every region by heart so i may know something is similar to croatian , but i just wo n't know * to what * is it similar . 
  any help is greatly appreciated in finding resources for these countries , or if you know of any other pics i could add to this album . 
   he 's attempted to contact europeans on turks who 've spoken against him so he can punish those at home what ? 
  the wording is a little tricky here sorry . 
  let me guess , he 's right wing ? 
  ah yes , tell us again of how it was in fact the communists who killed innocent croatians who they mistakenly associated with fascists . 
  and then tell us yet again of how it was the fascists who slaughtered innocent people in jasenovac . 
  i personally have members of my family killed by the nazis and the communists , and can i just say that croatia needs to start focusing on croatia and not ndh/yugoslavia . 
  i do n't know how those who are n't too affected by its history would feel , but all i can say is while as a human it 's always sad to see someone pass , this is a day for eastern europe , particularly the balkans . 
  any remnant of the tyranny that plagued our modest peninsula for centuries has now finally gone . 
  though it 's imprint is still firmly rooted in the balkans , now the last of the ass backwards autocrats that set our countries back so many years and contributed to or endorsed the dividing , raping , murdering , and slaughtering of our populations , is dead . 
  and with him the last living symbol of the despot empire . 
  our grandma 's are the ex-commie police,

  oh my god that is the most eastern european thing i have ever seen . 
  reminds me of 1984 . 
  ancient macedonians are unrelated to and have nothign to do with modern slav macedonians other than the fact that present day macedonia overlaps with ancient macedonia, 
  in terms of syntax , stress , and lexis . 
  while the other languages would be able to master russian faster , macedonians understand the fastest off the bat . 
  should hae clarified that, 
  i 'm not too familiar , but i believe in school for a limited amount of time serbo-croatian speakers would have about 20 minutes a day dedicated to syntax and grammar of macedonian and slovenian , as the lexis and stress of the languages was similar enough to get by without education . 
  i think it was the same in slovenia and macedonia as well . 
  though despite being in the same country , aside from a couple of culinary traits and jokes , slovenia and macedonia shared little relationships with each other . 
  their culture , history , mentality are as different as germany and bulgarias . 
  russian was mandatory in yugoslavia until 1948 , where after it was n't mandatory but was still one of the only secoond languages availible to learn in schools ( until about the mid 60s ) while slovenia , croatia and bosnia mainly took to learn english and german , montengro , serbia and especially macedonia stuck with russian . 
  this is for a couple reasons : - macedonian is the closest language to russian out of all official laguages of yugoslavia - macedonia exclusively used the cyrillic script - virtually every macedonian knew how to speak serbo-croatian and understood bulgarian , further making it easier for them to adapt - macedonians are slav orthodox people as russians are , providing cultural similarties and familiarizing the langauge through culture . 
  likewise , macedonia was given special attention in this case .

  abortion was legal all up until ' 66 , at which point it became not illegal , but restricted . 
  indeed , abortion was allowed to women whose fetus was malformed , was the product of rape or incest , or if the mothers life was in danger . 
  in addition , on demand abortion was legal if the woman had had more than 3 kids or was over 40 . 
  well in any other circumstance you 'd be right , but it 's in those specific circumstances that they would * not * be punished .

  meh , there also was period for 20 years when homosexuality was legal and you could serve as an openly gay politician or be an openly gay [ media personality ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgy_chicherin ) , yet i do n't think many would jump to the fact that the ex-soviet union was a bastion for gay rights . 
  gay was more or less shoved under the mat in communism , never openly discussed yet suspects were tolerated within individual communities . 
  same with abortion , except abortion was far less taboo and would actually be talked about in society, 
  wow , thanks soviet union . 
  there 's one we never thought we 'd say amiright comrades, 
  croat here .

eu - croatia actually . 
  article says  if within six months the problem is not solved , the eu could introduce visas for us diplomats , the commission warned . 
  yes , there will always be serbs who hate croats and croats who hate serbs and want the worst to them . 
  but those are minorities , and politically and officially speaking , croatia would never veto serbia 's accession to eu . 
  why would croatia veto it ? 
  if anything we said multiple times that we are happy to help any of our neighboring countries to get in , and that includes serbia . 
  also , do n't go 500 meters away from shore on your sea mattress when wind is blowing . 
  i mean , seriously , it happened few times that i am enjoying my ride on boat just to see some czech on the sea waving me to help him . 
  also , [ this ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.index.hr%2fvijesti%2fclanak%2fspaseni-ceski-turisti-zapeli-padobranom-za-bungee-jumping-dizalicu-i-visjeli-pola-sata%2f694218.aspx&amp;act=url ) . 
  no love for croatia ? 
  i like the design very much , nice work . 
  as croatia who entered eu few months ago , can confirm . 
  well , at least pm clearly stated that while he is on head of the government this referendum will not be held . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cabttqgnu0#t=74 ) , for those of you who can understand croatian . 
  sure tell them , and i have apartments and host gays every year , and they are telling their friend what a wonderful time they had so even their friends come , and they are coming back every year . 
  so tell what you want , but be sure that for every person who is like you there is 1000 of them who were actually here and know real situation . 
  do n't be as ignorant as people who voted for this . 
  you generalize far too much . 
  why would you never go to vacation here ? 
  if it 's because you generally do n't like croatia , that 's ok . 
  but if it 's because you are scared of your life or something , or you think you will be insulted daily that 's completely and absolutely wrong view . 
  for example , this summer cruise ship with 5000 gays was in my town , dubrovnik . 
  that 's 10 % of dubrovnik population since it 's small city . 
  and let me tell you there was no single incident , and by that i mean none . 
  no name calling or bullying , be it verbal or physical . 
  also , since you 've never been here on vacation you ca n't judge the whole population . 
  where do you even get your views from ? 
  how do you know italy is so much nicer if you have never been here ? 
  just come , experience , and then you can tell we are bunch of barbarians if you really think so . 
  you do n't understand why people go here on vacation because your view of croatia is completely skewed . 
  unlike you telling someone to `` please never come to denmark '' , i ask you , please come to croatia . 
  that 's why i said `` at least not so easy '' . 
  i know a lot of people , especially older , who were asked to `` sign this , it 's saying that marriage is between man and women ! '', 
  and that 's the only reason they signed . 
  i know this is anecdotal but it 's not hard to imagine that it happened a lot . 
  excellent , this should be on the top . 
  the situation here is a little bit different . 
  government did n't want this referendum because they are against defining marriage in constitution as union of exclusively man and women . 
  both leading party with their coalition publicly advised everybody to vote against and thus oppose discrimination of minorities . 
  even the president said that he will vote against . 
  it 's the people who collected signatures ( 10 % is needed , afaik ) and then government is obliged to make referendum happen . 
  and how they collected signatures is really sneaky , they basically asked people `` do you agree that marriage is union between man and women '' and of course , your average uninformed croat would say yes , without even thinking about gays . 
  if the question was `` do you think we should forbid gays to get married , not just by law but by constitution '' they would n't get needed amount of signatures , at least not so easy . 
  we still do n't know specifics about `` civil union '' so we will have to wait and see will adoption be possible , i hope it will . 
  certainly that 's the biggest issue . 
  and when i say issue i mean a lot of people opposing it , even though current government is all for it , as far as i can see . 
  just back from voting , maybe for the first time ever i am fully satisfied with what i voted for and that is against . 
  unfortunately , in my opinion that is not what average croat will do . 
  it 's worth mentioning that this would n't lower rights that gay couples have since this is just defining the word `` marriage '' as union between man and women . 
  procedure already started to define union of people of same sex with other word , while having equal rights . 
  edit : if you want to understand whole situation , read [ this .

  considering the dedication they have to really make the best product possible i would n't be surprised if their reasonably priced car is also much better than those of other companies . 
  i do n't know . 
  those other companies are not even near to tesla when it comes to quality . 
  either they can travel too few km or they lack power or something else . 
  tesla is really complete product . 
  they have big advantage when it comes to cost for driving 100 km . 
  here are some numbers : ok , so spec sheet says that lower end model ( 60 kwh ) can travel about 350 km in one charge . 
  that 's about 17 kwh per 100 km . 
  for the sake of argument lets round it to 20 kwh per 100 km . 
  electricity price for 1 kwh during night in croatia is 7 cents , let 's round it to 10 . 
  so the final price for 100 km is exactly 2 euro . 
  remember it could be less , i rounded it to bigger number . 
  now let 's take your average gasoline car . 
  i would say that car of tesla quality could easily burn 10 liters per 100 km , but for the sake of argument let 's say it 's 7 liters per 100 km . 
  price of fuel in croatia is about 1.30 for 1l give or take 10 cents . 
  simple calculation says that for traveling 100 km regular car uses about 9 euros . 
  that 's 4.5 times more than tesla . 
  those are some pretty huge differences if you ask me . 
  i would be so happy if i could spend 10 instead of 50 euros on traveling every month . 
  tesla will eventually make reasonably priced car ( musk said that 's their plan ) and if it is any good i will also be the first one to buy it . 
  even if you buy some car that goes for 5 liters per 100 km it 's still much more expensive per 100km . 
  not even to mention driving in city traffic every day where electric cars are unbeatable . 
  have you been to mine ? 
  have you ? 
  have you ? 
  yes , of course . 
  and i have never regreted opening . 
  it 's usually someone looking for a house of my neighbors , tourists looking for apartments , mailman , guy that reads electricity consumption etc. 
  why would i not open it . 
  i had no idea that we have such a huge concentration of ports in croatia . 
  it says right there on the left side that for uk and ireland this is for first foreign language . 
  starbucks was supposed to open in zagreb but decided to gave up in the last moment apparently because of the culture of drinking coffee in croatia . 
  croatians love to drink coffee for hours and hours , and apparently that contradicts to starbucks business model where you take the coffee and get out of the store . 
  you would have zero problems living with 1000 euro/month in croatia since that 's about 300 euro more than average monthly salary . 
  i would say that if you intend to live alone in the capital you can get nice place for 300 - 400 euros a month and that includes water , electricity , gas , internet etc. 
  so you would still have 600 - 700 euro for food and everything else which is more than enough especially if you are willing to cook by yourself . 
  that way you could even get some spare money and travel along the coast during summer . 
  i have relatives that live in zagreb as a students and they are living normal life with 600-700 euro per month . 
  umm , yeah if you are living in the center of tourists town during summer . 
  but if you want to live in , for example , capital you could have a pretty decent life for 1000 euro/month . 
  average salary here is 700 euro/month so there 's that . 
  so true . 
  they could at least get some modern digital pads . 
  the one that i saw in banks around here have dpi of , i do n't know , 10 . 
  my signature looks like pixelated shit . 
  ** croatia ** * eu might sanction us because our pm does not want to admit that he made a mistake , basically . 
  * medical workers went on strike five days ago and the end is nowhere in sight . 
  basically they complain about low wages .

  not nearly on the same scale as the us . 
  really ? 
  it 's fairly common here , not at all out of place , even for non teenagers . 
   in germany at least , the only violence was committed by racists and neo-nazis . 
  you must be sheltered as all hell if you really believe that . 
  well alright then , good luck to you . 
  i was under the impression that you want to get in under false pretenses . 
  so why does he get to demand a life in a rich country and people have to bend over backwards to give it to him but people from only somewhat poorer countries have to earn it ? 
  if your life is not in immediate danger you are not a refugee . 
  the only legal way for you to get into the netherlands is as a skilled worker . 
  hungarians are n't huns or descendants of huns . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  i thought we stopped talking about the mosque a few comment levels ago . 
  either way building a huge fucking mosque in a city without a muslim majority shows the tendency of islam to spread it 's tentacles wherever it fucking can . 
  imagine the outrage if the catholic church wanted to build a giant cathedral in saudi arabia . 
   i think islam is backward too but what do you mean you will never be `` ok with muslims '' ? 
  well that 's pretty much it , it 's backwards . 
  it 's not compatible with the very tenets of liberal democracy . 
   do you want them banned from the country ? 
  do you want their religion to be prohibited ? 
  jailed ? 
  what do you propose we do with the muslims in romania ? 
  nope , nope and nope . 
  i 'd just want them to not be shipped en masse to europe . 
  if they come little by little then we have a chance of assimilating them . 
  right now with the current influx that wo n't be happening any time soon . 
  oh absolutely , it 's just that they do n't seem to want to earn a living and pay taxes , they generally want to live off welfare . 
  also they do n't seem to integrate easily . 
  the situation is more complex than `` whitey keeping the poor brown people down ;( '', 
   why are croats going to germany , uk etc. 
  because there are more well paying jobs there . 
  and that 's my whole fucking point . 
  they 're not refugees , they 're economic immigrants . 
  the real refugees are just fucking happy they 're not dead and stay in turkey or wherever . 
  again , why are they hopping on trucks in calais headed towards the uk then ? 
  are you really saying it 's because they 're feeling overcrowded a bit ? 
  come on now . 
  so why does n't the tiny fraction also stay there , or at least nearer countries like greece or romania or bulgaria ? 
  why does it have to be the uk ? 
  apparently even france is n't enough nowadays when you look at the situation in calais . 
   while the others are fleeing their country so they do n't die . 
  so why do most of them want to go to sweden or the uk and not just the first country where they wo n't be in immediate danger ? 
  * * you 're a pretentious asshole . 
  you were literally raped by a shampoo bottle . 
  you poor thing , is taking a shower triggering for you now ? 
  either way my point still stands . 
  if you start at a better position you 're more likely to do better than others who did n't . 
  our politics are shit , that 's true , but the article clearly has a bias . 
  which is coincidentally also literally 8 slovenes . 
  slovenia has historically had a higher living standard than the rest of the balkans , even in yugoslavia , followed by croatia , then serbia . 
  this corresponds to how things are even today . 
  also the war never touched slovenia . 
  the article is sensationalist bullshit so the media can shit on greece even more . 
  oh shut up , no they would n't . 
  they 'd probably get similar comments depending on where in croatia they are but nothing worse . 
  if they did this in the centre of zagreb nothing much would happen , not even that many comments . 
  sure it 's still shitty but come on nobody would be killed . 
  yep , croatia is likely next in line if things do n't start shaping up soon . 
  you 're doing just fine . 
  keep it up !, 
  i find it fascinating how people can only think in black and white like that when we live in an age where you have access to an amazing amount of information . 
  yes we definitely need more input from people who do n't have the whole picture , that will surely help . 
  i guess to make the shit they 're spouting slightly more credible ? 
  wow the serb apologism is off the charts in this thread . 
  nobody ever fucking calls for massacres of civilians , that 's obvious . 
  imagine if an russian politician said that about ukrainians today , all fucking hell would break loose , but apparently 20 years ago it was a `` pretty good mindset '' . 
  at least we have smart , all-knowing people like you telling us dumb knuckle-dragging balkanoids how to behave and what to think , so there 's still hope !, 
  the amount of people dead does n't make this any less hypocritical . 
  a thousand or 6 million , he 's still an awful shit of a human being and him doing this is clearly just a political stunt . 
  just 20 years ago he was screaming `` for every serb you kill we kill 100 muslims '' . 
  his pro-eu stance is a charade and him visiting srebrenica is a charade . 
  the bosniaks have every right to be pissed , this man should be nowhere near politics , let alone a fucking prime minister . 
  there will be more people in the world than high-skilled jobs . 
  we do n't exactly need 7 billion doctors and engineers . 
  but it did happen . 
  people just moved to other low-skill jobs . 
  what happens when we automate all low-skill jobs ? 
  i constantly see comments saying the greeks should pay for their fuckups in the past and that syriza are frauds . 
  they 're not saying literally what i wrote but it the same general message . 
  but are n't all greeks just lazy and greedy ? 
  is n't that the problem ? 
  / r/europe has mislead me !, 
  why is it so hard for people to come to terms with the fact that not everything is fucking black or white ? 
  neither germany nor greece are completely blameless . 
  greece did bad things in the past that it 's paying for now but the imf is completely rigid and narrow-minded and are n't helping the situation at all . 
  yeah , give it a few years . 
  they will all be named muhammad . 
  yeah but imf has exactly one way of doing things , and it does n't seem like it was ever really a good solution . 
  at least he did n't have autism while he lived , right guys ? 
  right ? 
  actions need to be taken so people do n't have to be afraid to show stupid inflammatory drawings on tv or a newspaper . 
  restricting immigration severely would be a damn good fucking start . 
  you can ship them really fancy artisanal pasta and say it 's worth 15k a box . 
   but i wo n't be surprised or pay attention to you when you get the reaction you want . 
  so what people should just keep being scared of offending muslims ? 
  charles manson was a psychopathic cult leader . 
  they 're trying to say mohammad was also one . 
  it 's hardly a mystery what they were trying to convey . 
   the greeks drowned themselves . 
  do we sacrifice ourselves to jump for them ?

  hmmm but littlefinger needs to be the ignored and underestimated but improbably rich underdog .

  are you going to break the wheel , germoney ? 
  no , apparently you concern yourself by insulting random people at 3 in the morning . 
  bad timing , that . 
   bosna finally big and stronk  bosna finally free of hungary  ottomans invade  `` you 're on your own bosna '', 
  you think that i 'm the first to ask ? 
  or the first to notice the * strangeness * in behavior from several accounts with the same flair , same type of rhetoric , same topics , same opinions ? 
  we 're talking accounts that hardly ever comment on * anything else , with any other opinion * . 
  always pro-serb and srpska ( not the same thing !, 
  ) , against bosnia , croatia and kosovo . 
  posts , comments , same arguments , always . 
  even the * timing * of posts and comments is suspicious . 
  that 's [ agenda pushing . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and it just so happens that these accounts inspire up to - in my impression - 2/3 of the balkan flame-wars . 
  do you think it 's an accident that :  random pro-srpska post  inflammatory comments  random redditors ask `` tvrtko is that you '' if it looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck , then it 's probably a ~ ~ duck ~ ~ balkan troll . 
  but thank you , oh wise redditor , for sticking your nose where it does n't belong and enlightening me about how these * local trolls * function , you must definitely know better !, 
  croatia and serbia would tell you the opposite , you 're `` our descendant '' that `` made some different life choices a few centuries ago '' . 
  or something like that . 
  it goes back and back , to the point where nationality did n't quite exist as it does today . 
  more than 1000 years ago , bosnia was settled by `` croats '' , in the meantime there were border-shifts , also serbs showed up at some point , and we united with hungary ( do n't ask ) , then bosnia split away from the then hungary ( croatia ) for a while as its own kingdom , then shortly afterwards ottomans invaded , aaaaand in the end we never got western bosnia back ; - ; nowadays i 'm not even sure how related to us the `` croats '' in bosnia are . 
  or how related to `` croats '' * i * am :o if you ask me , such a thing can hardly be traced more than 3-4 generations ago , when grand-grand-grand-whatever said `` i 'm x '' . 
  in this confusing case , x are mostly [ `` ercegovci '' ] ( http://forum.net.hr/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver.discussions.components.files/31/4604.hercegovci_2d00_velika_5f00_fs.jpg ) if you ask me . 
  uhm , well ... 
  i 'm sorry bosnia ? 
  i also agree that the allied shelling and burning of civilians counts as a war crime . 
  and when it comes to certain actions of the allies in wwii , i 'm even suspicious about `` well it was a war and those were military targets '' . 
  problem pops up once you realize and admit one very ugly and unavoidable fact about war : cities . 
  people watch these ridiculous hollywood movies and imagine that armies neatly line up on some empty field , or that civilians all hide in some safe bunker ... utter bullcrap . 
  cities are always the no 1 target in * every * war , you ca n't `` take '' a country without taking its cities and transport networks , and those are always operated by , and full of - civilians . 
  innocents die in every single war . 
  so at a certain point in debate , it becomes rather useless to search for `` who 's clean '' , because nobody is * ever * clean . 
  so on my example , i draw a line between wwi , which was a series of land-grabs and pissing contests if you ask me ( everyone looks almost equally grey to me ) , and wwii , where certain actors had literal large-scale extermination as a goal . 
   a small group deliberately manipulated and incited nationalistic and religious violence . 
  true on the face of it , nobody in ex-yu needed this shit , and especially not bosnia , being such a diverse country . 
  however , blaming it on a small group of great leaders/brainwashers is also no good . 
  it 'd be the equivalent of blaming putinbots for trump 's election , or trump 's great `` meme-magic '' for brainwashing `` those idiots '' . 
  such a line of thinking ignores that there are real underlying problems that trump 's voters felt nobody else was addressing . 
  in other words , all those people who took up arms against the neighbors they spent decades living with - they need to take a good long look in the mirror and stop blaming `` someone else '' . 
  but correct me if i 'm wrong , holodomor did n't have much to do with the soviet struggle against nazi germany , no ? 
  that was stalin being his stalin-self , regardless of outsiders . 
  a much closer equivalent to yugoslavia would be what the red army did on its march , directly in response to nazis . 
  bengal famine ... that one looks more apt , though again , it 'd work better if the british empire starved germans/italians/japanese directly . 
  from what i vaguely know about the bengal famine , that 'd be the equivalent of croatia starving istria , which did n't happen . 
  people who did n't get the memo that 1945 has ended , i think . 
  no , but it also obscures truth . 
   `` both sides in wwii are guilty . '', 
  see how wrong that is ? 
  neither the severity of the crimes , nor the motivation behind them , is in any way equivalent . 
  giving context and pointing out that no-one is completely innocent in a war ( which works for basically every war ) does not equate to concluding something like `` they were all wrong '' , which implies something as gross as saying `` well the allied bombing of germany is just as bad as the holocaust '' . 
  give it enough time , and it 'll turn out that our ( non-existent at the time ) tanks rolled into serbia to `` rescue the oppressed croatian/bosnian minorities . '', 
  see vladimir , you were n't the first to come up with that fiction !, 
  that was a trial for karad\u017ei\u0107 , not slobo . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/51l6xp/milosevic_died_therefore_hes_completely_innocent/ interesting bit :   the march 24th karadzic judgment states that `` the chamber is not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence presented in this case to find that slobodan milosevic agreed with the common plan '' to permanently remove bosnian muslims and bosnian croats from bosnian serb claimed territory . 
   ok , this argument is flimsy for a few reasons . 
  firstly , the crucial three words are `` in this case '' . 
  ** this trial is about karadzic , not milosevic . 
  the prosecution were not trying to prove milosevic 's guilt , which was only relevant insofar as it related to karadzic 's . 
  ** secondly , wilcoxson appears not to understand how joint criminal enterprise works . 
  this passage refers purely to whether or not the jce indictees agreed with the ` common plan ' of ethnic cleansing sought by karadzic and co -- whether they participated in it anyway is a different question . 
  ** and undoubtedly milosevic did -- he set karadzic up with his army , paramilitaries and weapons , and continued provide him with material and logistical support more or less throughout the war . 
  ** *** whether that qualifies as aiding and abetting the crimes or just complicity in them is debatable , but both certainly constitute criminal responsibility . 
  yes they were . 
  i 'm talking about why they thought croats will kill them . 
  to me , what happened in krajina in year '91 seems the most relevant cause . 
  ohhh dear you 're literally lying right know , and i can prove it .

  a group of rebels in bosnia , rebels with the same ethnicity as serbia , given literally all their supplies by serbia , even up to paychecks for the officers ( obviously , srpska had next to no economy on its own , same for sao krajina in croatia ) , and also serbia is their representative in all major negotiations with outsiders ... and serbia tries to avoid responsibility .

  i do n't quite understand all of it either . 
  i * think * that the gist is : yugoslavia fell apart , and now the ex-yu countries are participating in their favorite sport called land grab . 
  the reporter goes in turn around the states - slovenia & croatia , bosnia , serbia , kosovo , macedonia , and finally montenegro . 
  asking about their grand tactics . 
  slovenia tries to explain the plan but is always interrupted by croatia , who alternately feigns innocence or rambles about `` historical borders '' . 
  bosnia ... is offering coffee and souvenirs . 
  serbia plays an explanatory folk-song about `` ai n't noone can do anything against us '' . 
  kosovo ( while serbia sharpens knives ) invites his kids .

  i remember that being one of the big arguments against the necessity of nukes . 
  ( that 's not to argue that it was n't in usa 's best interests to end the war in the fastest way possible , as they did . 
  but that 's a different argument . ), 
  ha , you 're talking to someone that ( foggily , cause too young ) remembers an irl war . 
  does that count ? 
  :p and i 'd rather not fight in any war , if possible . 
  if it happened that i 'm a soldier in that situation , yeah i 'm almost positive that i 'd be more concerned with saving my own damn life , than that of some random civilians i do n't know . 
  so sure , i 'd rather go home instead of keep fighting for years . 
  does n't make my self-preserving opinions and choices right , and i think that if at some later point i tried to argue that the event that got me home * was n't * a war crime , more detached people would rightly call bullshit . 
  oh , i think i should have made myself clearer . 
  i think it goes like this : if we do n't do x , y will happen . 
  let 's say we calculated that y is worse than x by 50 % or 100 % . 
  ok , so , we do x. 
  but x is * also * horrible , it 's just less horrible , but that does n't negate the point that x is bad . 
  or something like that . 
  war is imo shitty regardless of why you 're fighting it , but that does n't mean that i think there are no legitimate causes for war ( especially if it 's defensive ) , or that `` all sides are the same '' , correction would be `` give me any war and i 'll find at least some war crimes done by the more-good-guy side '' . 
  so in my specific case , i 'm not sure whether bombing hiroshima and nagasaki in such a way was truly necessary , and i consider it a war crime , but i also acknowledge that * it worked * to end the war , and i also think that japan was not only the aggressor , * their * crimes were greater . 
  ( similar goes for nazis and holocaust vs the crimes done against german civilians . ), 
  i do feel that the random `` good-ish '' guys in war xyz committing crimes often gets swept under the rug though , which imo is n't helping . 
  learn from history , bla bla . 
  ... why are you even responding to me anymore ? 
  obviously we do n't see eye to eye , and that 's not going to change . 
  here , last ditch attempt , as simple as i can make it : you can drop a certain number of firebombs , cluster bombs , whatever bombs , and not kill hundreds of thousands of people . 
  ( obviously , given * enough * bombardment , the same number of people will die . 
  numbers of victims also obviously depend on how good your aim is , how much you care to aim precisely , the type of bomb we 're talking etc. ), 
  you can not do the same with nukes , all they ever do is mass-destroy an area . 
  if i still have n't made myself clear to you with that , it 's useless . 
  i 'm done talking with you . 
  i never said that the other bombings are n't crimes . 
  i mentioned hiroshima and nagasaki since i assumed they 're the most * well-known * bombings of japan . 
  and if you read my other comments in this thread , you 'd see that i acknowledge that a certain amount of collateral damage is * tolerated * even today , so obviously the acceptable terms of conduct would be even looser in the context of wwii . 
  but . 
  nukes are weapons of mass destruction , no way around it . 
  their whole * purpose * is to level and radioactively poison an area , and on such a scale , that you can barely argue that they 're `` legitimate if dropped over some military targets that happen to be in cities '' . 
  i consider the use of nukes over - or `` close enough '' to - any inhabited area a war crime * by default * , regardless of who does it and why . 
  [ and imo it 's a matter of shame for humanity that weapons like this were ever developed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsar_bomba#test ), 
  not that much , actually . 
  i vaguely remember that he 's an eurosceptic ( cause that affects me , lol ) , he 's leader of labour , and he 's usually cited as the reason the opposition to tories is lame in uk . 
  the context always goes like `` corbyn '' , and that 's it , his name is taken as self-explanatory among brits ( and people who follow uk politics ) , which i take to mean that a literal clown would make for a more credible leader of the opposition . 
  i think he has all the charisma of a cactus plant ? 
  oh , and i heard that the press has n't been easy on him ... 
  i ran into accusations of a smear-campaign . 
  ... and i think his party does n't like him either ? 
  or , the traditional voters of labor ? 
  ( so i thought he 'd work out as a good short-hand for how incompetent our sdp leader/opposition is . ), 
  collateral damage is one thing , bullets and bombs `` going astray '' is as old as bullets and bombs . 
  leveling cities and calling it `` collateral damage '' is such a thin excuse it 's positively transparent . 
   as for restrictions on bombings of cities in war , nothing at the time of wwii covered it as a side-note , `` genocide '' is a term that 's been coined in 1944 , specifically for the case of nazi policies , and has been first used as a legal term in nuremberg trials . 
  does that mean that all the events we call genocide that happened before wwii - are n't ? 
  someone should tell the armenians !, 
  no but seriously now , while i 'm not a fan of applying laws retroactively , here we 're discussing whether hiroshima and nagasaki had all the elements of a war crime by modern understanding . 
  if we 'll go by legalese , all sorts of hideous events though history end up being `` well it was n't bad because the laws of the time allowed it '' . 
  i 'm even less of a fan of moral relativism excusing horrible things . 
  wait . 
  so nagasaki and hiroshima had legitimate military targets , and it 's perfectly legal and sensible to bomb those in a war . 
  that 's like ... hmm . 
  ok , i have a recent modern equivalent . 
  `` it 's legitimate to bomb hospitals because they 're treating soldiers , same soldiers who will then get up and fight us again . '', 
  i actually heard that reasoning , nevermind the fact that most of the people in such hospitals are civilians , and they die all the same . 
  it all sounds like a very nonsense argument to me . 
  as i said elsewhere in this thread , i 'm not denying that this bombing achieved its tactical military goal . 
  i 'm saying that dropping nukes on mostly-civilian cities , and this after the military leadership knew perfectly well what nukes do to their surroundings , means that the hundreds of thousands of civilians that * predictably * died ca n't even be excused under `` oops , never knew that 'll happen '' or `` oops , we mis-aimed , civilians got accidentally caught in the cross-fire , what can you do , it happens in war , etc etc '' . 
  the leadership made a conscious decision to level two cities , same cities that were mostly full of civilians . 
  what if 's and `` what would have happened if they had n't '' and `` do civilian deaths happen in every single war '' is beyond the point when we 're discussing `` is this a war crime ? '', 
  i 'm not denying that these bombings did their work successfully ( and in my opinion there are several different effects that can be counted as `` success '' in that story ) . 
  i 'm just saying that it was a terrible war crime and a successful military tactic at the same time ... but then again , i have critical opinions on what war is , and how it works out for the populace . 
  the short of it is : forget about the airbrushed versions of war you see in hollywood blockbusters and epic ballads . 
  be it considered legitimate or not , war is ugly . 
   it is stupid to call it a warcrime if firebombing of other japanese cities do n't count as one . 
  civilian deaths are war crimes , simple as that . 
  they 're ... * tolerated * until a certain point ( or proven intention to kill civilians ) because civilians usually get caught in the crossfire ( that 's what happens when you make plans to `` take '' any city ) . 
  but i seriously doubt that * anyone * could feign ignorance about what these nukes would do to civilian cities . 
  nukes are the opposite of `` precise '' . 
   im not saying that it was not horrible but people overlook many lives saved as a result of japanese surrender . 
  scrap that train of thought , because `` if we had n't , it would have been worse '' can be used to excuse every single war crime , ever . 
  `` if we do n't bomb the twin towers of new york , these americans will keep bombing the middle east '' was likely used as an excuse by bin laden at some point . 
  oh , it 's in the western world as well . 
  the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki being a war crime is somehow still [ `` debatable . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atomic_bombings_of_hiroshima_and_nagasaki#debate_over_bombings ) ( this is despite the fact that usa quite literally dropped two nuclear bombs on two * mostly civilian * cities and killed 129,000 -- 226,000 people , because * terror tactics * are forgivable if you 're `` a good guy '' . 
  if that is not a war crime , then nothing short of holocaust is . ), 
  then the other day we had some british redditors professing that they never heard of the british raj . 
  i think that sweeping the bad stuff under the carpet , or at least downplaying it by certain levels of omission , happens just about everywhere . 
  ( except for germany , maybe . ), 
  ohh , wish i could be reading that whole inaccurately named `` trilogy '' for the first time again < 3  `` the story so far :  in the beginning the universe was created . 
  this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move . '', 
  i 'm quoting some french redditor :  `` we go on a strike to complain about x ''  `` we go home and complain about the strike '', 
  ah , but you can say that for the next 10 or more years . 
  it 's like people pointing out that le pen losing means she 'll just probably regroup in 2022 if france does n't improve in the next 5 years . 
  true on the face of it ( lord knows eu needs improvements , and france has legit problems ) , but that kind of thinking leads you to the conclusion that eu is in a state of eternal crisis . 
  all sorts of problems will keep showing up forever , at some point crying `` crisis , crisis , hide yo children '' and/or `` brexit , frexit , nexit , grexit , italexit '' just turns into useless panicking . 
  * and a hatred towards the meme z-exit . 
  \\  `` i do n't know if you got it '' \\  `` but i think that political correctness is bad '' \\  '' ... amirite ? '', 
  because it feels like a useless correction . 
  everybody knows , so what 's the point of a correction that everybody knows is unnecessary ? 
  call all this `` victory for europe/we 're all european today/etc etc '' a figure of speech/metaphor , if it helps . 
  that 's the first part . 
  the 2nd part is the people who say they 're `` anti-eu but pro-europe '' , and that 's the reason they go around correcting everyone , and this feels like a logical fallacy to many ( most ? ), 
  of the people on this sub . 
  i assumed that bobkellylikes is in this 2nd group ( assumed based on my experience with redditors ) , hence this fruitless comment chain .

  ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/image/solomon.stephen/rz7zve8vwbi/aaaaaaaaa7a/qcxn_d7cuxq/croatia-bosnia%20copy.jpg ) also , here 's one for [ slovenia !, 
  ] ( https://letsfeelslovenia.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/slovenia-totally-looks-like-a-running-chicken.jpg?w=640 ), 
  no , i meant , there actually were some killings from the side of the army . 
  44 people , if i recall correctly ? 
  civilian-to-civilian was another ... few hundred ? 
  so , in the context of the scale - 200 000 soldiers , 4 days ' operation that liberated something like 1/5 of our territory - it could have been much worse , that 's what i mean by `` comparatively few '' . 
  but it still did happen , and obviously the goal should be that * none * happen . 
  also , i 'm not a fan of excusing or downplaying revenge-crimes . 
  yes , revenge is something that happens among people because that 's how people are , and storm needs to be taken in the context of an ugly 4-year war where croats were made refugees and worse in their own country . 
  i understand that . 
  but i do n't support `` but they did it first/they did worse '' . 
  frankly , who gives a shit about `` but they 're worse '' , we should strive to be as good as we can be , not `` less bad '' . 
  if that makes sense . 
  til about the falklands thing . 
   croatian army did n't comit any war crimes that 's a stretch . 
  there were some , killing , destruction of homes . 
  the thing about storm is that most crimes were committed in the aftermath by people who were n't the army , and that both the army and the not-army crimes were comparatively * few * , given the scale and speed of the operation . 
  so that 's good , that the whole thing was done pretty professionally ( as professional as it gets in war , anyways ) , but claiming that we 're 100 % saint is silly . 
  i do n't think there 's ever been a war where one side is 100 % saint . 
  so on a philosophical side , this is the reason people should do whatever they can to avoid war , period . 
  even if it 's * just * and considered worth it ( like , appeasement would only make things even worse ) , people need to know that it 's never * pretty * . 
  well , at least you 're taking your downboats manfully . 
  but seriously now , yes these threads tend to be trainwrecks so you did n't exactly say something that 's not true , but keep in mind that the issue is still pretty raw for many people . 
  even if the redditors in question do n't remember the war because they were kids , or not even born yet , most of them have parents that do - scars take a while to fade . 
  i just literally told you we respected arbitration decisions that are far more harmful for us than the ridiculous dispute with slovenia . 
  and we do n't have problems with every neighboring country . 
  we have unsolved borders with every ex-yu country we border , * same as you * , because yugoslavia never settled its internal borders properly . 
  you 're simply lucky that you border only one ex-yu country , so please , take your smug attitude and shove it up where the sun does n't shine . 
  you want more sea ? 
  you think it 's not fair you do n't have a lot of sea ? 
  go bark at italy , they 're the ones that have most of your `` rightful clay '' . 
  ohhh , but you do n't * dare * bark at italy , do n't you , you 're not so tough against nations that can break you like a doll . 
  idiots . 
  both of us . 
  instead of helping each other , like old allies we should be - not like we 're anything more than an afterthought for these `` fine rich euros '' we so admire , like spineless little fangirls , hoping senpai will protect our interests for once - we claw at each other and block each other 's progress . 
  are you feeling * smart about all that * , `` slovenian '' ? 
  ohh , come on , keep your whataboutism consistent at least . 
  you started with wwii , remember ? 
  for your information , we went along perfectly well with the ina-mol arbitration , even though ina is a dozen times more relevant for us than that bathtub of water . 
  we did n't catch the hungarians cheating in the court , though . 
  i hardly believe any anecdote that anyone here says , regardless of nationality . 
  far too many liars . 
  the closest thing to an objective , verified truth comes from the courts - international ones like in hague , because said unrelated foreigners do n't give 3 shits about any of us here - they have no reason to pick some side . 
  we 're too irrelevant for them to establish some propaganda narrative . 
  \\  brings up wwii ohhh , nevermind , i 'm wasting time with you . 
  move to slavonia , get bonus mosquitoes on top of that ( . _ . ), 
  why oh why did our ancestors not stay in poland ... ... on second thought , scratch that . 
  well , bosniaks would first have to admit that there is such a thing as * burek with cheese * , and well . 
  it 's just not happening , we 've been trying to have them see the light for ages , it 's useless . 
  shhh bby it 's ok , burek is love : *, 
  did they also `` feel poor babies to the zoo lions like in sarajevo '' ? 
  [ just be mindful of the anti-towel-anschluss crackdown < 3 ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/lifestyle/20861-no-reservations-mayor-of-brela-keeping-order-on-local-beaches ), 
  for what it 's worth , the whole thing kept rolling through bosnia afterwards ( under a different name , sure , but i see it as one big operation in several stages ) , and the gains made by arbih , hv , hvo ( and usa ) there finally forced slobo & co to the negotiating table for dayton . 
  on a whole , yes that war was stupid , we should have split up peacefully like czechs and slovaks . 
  or , if there had been more wisdom and respect for each other , yugoslavia could have been kept whole as a looser confederation or something like that . 
  but , since that train passed by 1991 , yes we do celebrate victory in an ugly defensive war that lasted 4 years and could have turned us into an equivalent of kurds . 
  if we had attacked you and tried to annex all of serbia except vojvodina , ethnic cleansing and/or choking of your nationality included , you 'd damn well celebrate fighting us off . 
  i had exactly zero choice about where i 'll be born . 
  i did n't even exist , much less have opinions or actions . 
  as for the choices of my ancestors , again , i had zero to do with that , there 's no `` inheritance of responsibility or credit '' there . 
  if , during my lifetime , i move to some other place , decide to * become * something else , then we can talk about my actions . 
  and we can even argue about the credit given to my ancestors , ok let 's say for the sake of the argument that they were clever , hard-working people . 
  but ... so were/could have been plenty others who sicked up as children and died before procreating , or some others who died in battlefields , etc etc. 
  so , * luck * again played its part . 
  uhhh ... well , i 'm proud to be part of the eu . 
  i think it 's a very good idea , despite its flaws and various growing pains , and furthermore , i actively voted to join the eu . 
  proud to be european ? 
  um , no , not really , why would i be ? 
  i see that as nothing more than an arguably lucky accident of birth . 
  and i say arguable , because as i see it , half or more of european history is a history of conflict ... where i do n't see reason to identify with random strangers , especially not when said strangers spent a decent amount of time trying to exploit or kill my ancestors for greed or pride or whatever . 
  i suppose that random people may feel the same about their nationality - accident of birth . 
  for me , that does n't quite work simply because of the 90 's where my family again made a choice - and a very difficult one , at that - to make this country an independent nation of croats . 
  i guess that this feeling will pass with time , may be already dimming with the newer generations . 
  i 'm talking about all sorts of places all over croatia . 
  for example , osijek . 
  some estimates say that it lost 80 % of its population during the siege/shelling . 
  iirc nobody ever got trialed for * that * , and it 's not called ethnic cleansing , unlike vukovar for example . 
  even though the army doing the siege was the same one that leveled vukovar , with presumably the same goals . 
  i guess it comes down to effects in the end ? 
  ( or the scale of the shelling ? ), 
  osijek never fell , so ... 
  but the shelling - civilian buildings also get shelled , period . 
  i 'm no military expert , so i 'm listening to those that are ~ hague actually tried to retroactively establish some `` 200 meters rule '' . 
  as in , if a shell falls closer than 200 meters from civilian objects/areas , it falls under criminal negligence at least . 
  but of course , not only did that same rule not exist in the 90 's , army people say that it makes no sense . 
  something about nobody 's aim being * that * precise , especially in the less-than-ideal circumstances of actual war where soldiers get stressed out , have poor visibility sometimes , etc etc. 
  also , same army people also argued that establishment of that rule would only make things worse , because armies would abuse it - spread themselves out among civilians more , use them as meat shield . 
  so , from that standpoint , the court accusation fell through . 
  mind you , i 'm not arguing that crimes were n't committed at all , be it killing or destruction of property . 
  that 's a fact . 
  but , the whole case was `` did the croatian army intentionally force the serbs to flee , was ethnic cleansing the goal of the operation ? '', 
  and well , the court finally decided that it was not , in large part because the same serbs largely fled before the army even reached them . 
  milan marti\u0107 gave the evacuation order , army went into mostly empty settlements - that 's also a fact . 
  now , whether these same serbs had reasons to be afraid , to doubt tu\u0111man 's assurances , whether i 'd rather not risk it as well if i was in their shoes , that 's a different story . 
  people all over croatia fled their cities because of the shelling by serb forces . 
  and yet , not one of these instances of civilian flight are called ethnic cleansing , it 's not even a matter of trial , but a matter of there being no accusations thrown in the first place . 
  because that 's not what ethnic cleansing is . 
  if it was , literally * every war * would be ethnic cleansing . 
  -9 , -19 even , you can always warm up . 
  cooling down is more difficult ... that is , i need to give up and finally buy ac .

  i 'd say slovenia or hungary , maybe even slovakia or austria . 
  probably because of cuisine and folklore . 
  plus they all have that dance move where the people run underneath the handkerchiefs . 
  where i live , when i tell people i 'm croatian , they automatically say something along the lines of `` oh , that 's like polish right ? '', 
  if not poland than they 'll say something like `` oh , you 're croatian ?!, 
  i have a serbian friend , his/her name is _______ '' i guess this one pertains more to the lesser known countries , since most people are very informed of the more `` famous '' countries , like italy or france : s, 
  mine would be `` used to be yugoslavia '' which is followed by a look of clarity from the confused stranger . 
  if they do n't know what that country was , i go with `` it 's like poland '' or `` it 's to the right of italy '' and then they get the picture .

  from most to least common i usually get : - ukrainian - polish - russian - italian ( this one was the rarest , i 've only gotten like 2 guesses with this one ) i 've heard some exceptional guesses , like swedish ( height i 'm guessing ) and portuguese ( body hair i 'm guessing . ), 
  so post what other ethnicity people though you were throughout life , it 's nice to see what everyone else thinks of the europeans . 
  croat here . 
  before i say anything i just wan na say that there 's a reason why communism fell and capitalism is still standing . 
  my goal here is not to be anti-capitalist . 
  however , though i personally did n't live there , communism in yugoslavia seemed relatively ok . lots of social liberties , socialized services , education and healthcare , high literacy rate and everyone was entitled to the same political and legal rights . 
  that 's not to say there was n't a downside , as nationalism was heavily suppressed in a country with multiple nations and traditional religions . 
  of course , there is the obvious restriction of political speech and the obligation of complying to the government regardless if the people disagree with them or not . 
  so there downsides to it as well . 
  overall though , i 'd say it does n't appear to be all that bad . 
  far from perfect but not bad . 
  there are a lot of polish and croatians people where i live who say they do not like communism . 
  on top of that , from what i hear from r/europe , neither do a lot of other eastern europeans . 
  what is the reason for this ? 
  was it because communism separated the church and state and polish people are very catholic ? 
  was it because eastern europe ( save yugoslavia , although it too experienced it more or less indirectly ) was under soviet influence ? 
  it 's completely understandable these factors would put you off from communism , but i 'm just asking if those are all the reasons why . 
  edit : i should 've reworded my question . 
  i was referring to the formerly socialist states of eastern europe that called themselves communist . 
  communism never existed in real life ever . 
  in other words , how do others who do n't speak your language , think it sounds like ? 
  for me , i constantly get polish . 
  i 'd say 95 % of the time people guess i 'm speaking polish , and the other 5 % is split between ukrainian/russian or the rare italian . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkgkzzwutgy ) is croatian being spoken . 
  would you have guessed if you were n't told ? 
  so , what language do foreigners think you speak , as opposed to what language you really speak ? 
  srry france , italy , spain and germany , you ca n't really partcipate :( my personal opinions : sounds like russian : romanian , portuguese , albanian , lithuanian , latvian sounds like spanish : greek sounds like german : czech , rarely polish sounds like finnish : hungarian , estonian, 
  edit : added some stuff edit # 2 : it seems i 'm not making myself clear , so i 'll quote an earlier comment . 
   the point was n't to highlight how good communism was , it was to highlight how many drastically positive changes were made transitioning into communism and how generations were brought up in that kind of atmosphere . 
  the question is why has n't that atmosphere of sudden progression to economical and social aspects of life continued in ee alright , i posted a thread kind of similar to this one a while back . 
  i wanted to post this thread after [ this timeline ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eymt3hw.gif ) was posted to r/europe but i forgot . 
  it was the communist jokes thread that reminded me . 
  concerning just that timeline alone ( although that 's not the main focus , just something that pushed me to write this ) , i commented this on the original reddit post . 
   what surprises me is eastern europe . 
  believe it or not eastern europe had permissive laws concerning homosexuality as early as the 1910s . 
  it surprises me that in places where homosexual and heterosexual relationships were `` considered equal in the eyes of the law '' ( vladimir lenins words , and indirectly the words of all the former communist countries of europe ) have such a large opposition to something that was almost legal back in communism . 
  though frowned upon ( very frowned upon ) , it was legally better to be gay in the 1940s in any communist eastern european country than it was to be in almost any other country anywhere . 
  why eastern europe is the way it is , i 'm not sure , we really are a weird people . 
   edit : clarification homosexuality was legal . 
  homosexual marriage was just shy of being legal so basically that ties into my bigger question of why ? 
  all formerly communist states of eastern europe ( from czech republic/slovenia to russia ) seem to be relatively conservative and right wing , sometimes both economically and socially ( russia 's authoritarianism , poland 's healthcare , serbia 's gun laws etc. . . ) . 
  however it seems as this would be almost the exact opposite expected behavior from formerly socialist countries . 
  of course everyone can pick out the bad of communist times , some of which were highlighted in the aforementioned [ communist jokes thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45o5p5/czechoslovak_jokes_about_the_communist_regime/ ) , however surely no one would reject the few good things it brought . 
  gender and racial equality was present , university tuition was nationalized , health and dental care were priorities ( and it too , was nationalized ) * almost * everyone had a home ( albeit in things like [ these ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_becljms84ng/syma-t2hzki/aaaaaaaabts/2meiu0fgrc8/s400/ist-kapija-bg---konjarnik.jpg ) ) and the rent paid within those apartments was more symbolic than anything . 
  women had 1 full year paid maternity leave with at least 70 % of their pay ( source : family lived in yugoslavia ) , you had unlimited sick days and at ~ one month of full paid vacation . 
  the gap between the rich and the poor was * exponentially * less evident , which helped augment the social atmosphere , as people are ultimately more divided by class than nationality . 
  even if all of that was n't there , communist mottos included stuff like `` brotherhood and unity '' . 
  the `` why '' question means : if eastern europe was conditioned into these `` social '' conditions for so long , why has it been making `` regressions '' so to speak . 
  i 'm not talking about regressions in foreign relations , trade , or economy , obviously those have changed . 
  however , all the stuff that i mentioned above is considered `` good '' ; so in transitioning out of communism , why did n't eastern europe dump all the authoritarianism away , and keep the things that worked ? 
  western and northern europe are definitely in most cases , social democracies . 
  i really envy their qualities of life ( * especially * scandinavia 's ) . 
  however , we eastern europeans are a people who come from a socialist background , so why is eastern europe in such a bad state ? 
  if we could have nationalized tuition , full gender equality ( equal pay for equal work , whcih still does n't happen in the most developped nations to this day ) health services , rent etc. . . in those former communist days , what 's stopping us from introducing those changes now ? 
  is it because we 're conservative , or is it a fear of communism ? 
  yes of course , it 's stupid , yes of course , it 's a huge exaggeration and of course it does n't nearly apply to everyone , however i kind of like it when people label my country as stoic , apathetic , hardcore eastern europeans that still have that ex-communist discipline and think that this whole `` sensitive , sissy , hipster culture '' is all a crock of horse crap ... because you know , it shows that we are stronk i guess a positive stereotype would be the fact that we have a beautiful country , but imo every country has `` beauty '' so it 's not that special . 
  so europe , what stereotypes about your country do you secretly enjoy , but would never admit to foreigners ? 
  [ removed ], 
  when you hear about other slavic countries , do you automatically think `` oh those are our people '' or do you not care ? 
  i know that in bosnia , we had a influx of ukrainians during the time of yugoslavia ( old yugoslavia , pre-communism ) . 
  i remember hearing ukrainian people speaking to each other when i was younger and thought `` why are these people speaking croatian so weird '' . 
  i thought i 'd ask to see how the situation sits in europe between slavs . 
  is pan-slavism still a thing ? 
  by contrast , how do you non-slavic europeans feel about slavic people ? 
  do you group us all in the same category , ( e.g `` oh , serbian people , goddamn ruskies '' ) or are we different to you ? 
  do you feel like we are all in our little gang or do you feel like we 're just the ex-communist rubble of eastern europe ? 
  nice break in conversation topics from the hitler-merkel newspaper parody thing . 
  #edit : to all the people bringing up ussr , i think the idea of pan-slavism was heavily incorporated into every slavic eastern european country . 
  for example , one of the most widely-sung songs in sfr yugoslavia , [ `` uz mar\u0161ala tita ( with marshal tito ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1yzxsspotm ) , contains the following lyrics ( transliterated to cyrillic because in the mood of the thread why not ) : `` rod prastari svi smo , a goti mi nismo slavenstva smo drevnoga \u010dest \u0420\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e \u0410 \u0413\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442 '' which means `` we are all of an ancient kindred , but goths we are not . 
  we hail from an ancient slavdom '' talk about [ anti-facism ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4l3gmg/surprising_folklore_similarities_between_croatia/ ) #edit # 2 : [ a map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/slaviceurope.png ) for the uninformed, 
  croat here . 
  croatia 's geographical beauty may be highlighted in its coast , but it 's folkloric treasures are definitely found in the north : [ baranja ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m50scgj.jpg ) definitely sticks out , it was under hungarian influence for a long time so it resembles its eastern european neighbors ( romania , slovakia , western ukraine ) . 
  lots of detail and full of color [ zagorje ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5j06q9g.jpg ) is another one . 
  throughout history this was tossed around between austrian and hungarian rule , prompting for a very `` central '' european look . 
  this last one is technically cheating , but by far the most captivating folk outfits of the croatians are from the ones who [ live in ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4xf9hgu.jpg ) [ slovakia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7grpxig.jpg ) . 
  these are croatians who escaped from the turks during ottoman rule and fled to slovakia ... which was later annexed by the turks . 
  there are historical populations of croats in hungary , serbia , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , bosnia , austria , montenegro , kosovo and italy . 
  a modern folk outfit that is still worn even to this day ( mostly by croats from bosnia ) can be seen [ throughout the streets , worn by young and old ] ( http://i.imgur.com/evxerof.jpg ) bonus : cuz i like the [ boots ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dox48js.jpg ) this is from podravina , which was also under hungary for a long time . 
  we have [ better red boots ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ashc0ee.jpg ) but i ca n't find a good picture where they wear solid colored ones . 
  croatia has beautiful coasts with a classy , mediterranean cuisine to munch in while you tour the coast line in a boat . 
  i 'm very glad this has been extensively highlighted in media . 
  but croatia also has some really cool historic architecture , like its [ castles ] ( http://citypal.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/veliki-tabor-4.jpg ) that are located [ in ] ( http://kamauf-zagreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trakoscan2.jpg ) the [ north ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/castle_donji_miholjac.jpg ) , which you can enjoy watching while eating your nice [ austro-hungarian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/palatschinke.jpg ) [ cuisine ] ( http://recepti.fr/slike/201005031405570.buhtle.jpg ) the sea and islands are nice but more often than not croatia is viewed by foreigners ( especially from north america , most of whom know very little about eastern europe in general ) as a continuation of italy , because of extensive exposure to the coasts . 
  also , croatia should not be lumped into [ balkan ] ( https://youtu.be/cr1xng9kyii?t=2m20s ) turbo folk . 
  i for one at least , do not like the pervasive turkish/eastern influence that is somehow becoming more and more present in [ most notably ] ex-yugoslavia ( not slovenia but especially serbia/bosnia ) , bulgaria , albania etc. . . 
  it can be catchy sometimes but most times it just ends up looking like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/74aeien0ysc?t=1m17s ) while we do have modern music in croatia , when thinking of the `` cultural idenity '' of a country , i 'd like to draw more attention to our [ northern ] ( https://youtu.be/am9cmgw13na?t=1h6m59s ) music , with instruments other than the [ tamburica ] ( https://youtu.be/7c7ocf2641o?t=10m57s ) edit : forgot some very important [ attractions ] ( http://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/rocket-zagreb-communist.jpg?42b3f7 ) for our [ tourists to see ] ( http://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/communist-rocket-zagreb.jpg?42b3f7 ), 
  i 've talked about this before on this sub , and i was met with some hostility from people . 
  ex-yugoslavs are welcome to chime in here too . 
  of course communism was a totalitarian evil imposed from the outside .

  you are probably talking about bosniaks , who would n't be happy if you called them `` literally the same thing '' as serbs . 
  i do n't know , that 's just my opinion which does n't mean shit . 
  i guess christianity plays a big role in that because it brought georgia and armenia closer to russia which certainly is european . 
  meh , i consider them all european . 
  except maybe azerbaijan , they 're like turkey , not really european , but not really asian either . 
  the only part of europe more fucked up than the balkans . 
  you 're right , i did n't consider that . 
   studied eu law as part of my law degree and still had to double check the amount of member states that 's kinda embarassing , do n't you think ? 
   your mom 's sexual partners ?

   btw is the gingerbread heart in anyway connected to some history of zagreb ? 
  yes !, 
  here 's a wiki article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/licitar, 
  advent in vienna is awesome . 
  i also recommend [ advent in zagreb ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ovtb71lwq ) , it only started a couple of years ago and it 's not as big as those in this article , but the city is really beautiful during that time . 
  here you have four eu contries that share the same values . 
  or do you think that only values promoted by germany , france or uk are the * true * eu values ? 
  that 's not ok but forcing those policies on the countries that clearly do n't want them ( not just the governments , the people too ) is ok ? 
  who says they do n't want to be in eu ? 
  bosnian state and protection agency director said that the killer is probably a member of wahabbi movement . 
  also , witnesses said to the police that he was dressed like one . 
   frankly , it was business for me . 
  that 's why you lost the war . 
  people reading his comments that have next to no idea what happened in vukovar might take out from his comments that the invasion was justified or that the both sides were equal or something . 
  he gives an interesting perspective , i agree , but does that mean that his comments are immune to criticism ? 
  please do n't try to justify what you and your comrades did in vukovar . 
   of course they did . 
  not nearly as much as we did , but armor and artillery were present . 
  well , yes . 
  croats did have some artillery but not much and often used improvised bombs . 
  and croats did n't have that . 
  as it says in the wiki article i linked in the op , the shelling and rockets hit the city at the rate of 12000 per day !, 
  for three fucking months !, 
  * that 's * what destroyed the city . 
  thanks you, 
  to be fair , this happened 24 years ago . 
  i ca n't english . 
  i 've been there a couple of times . 
  there 's a big number of buildings that are still damaged , sadly . 
  the city is fairly divided between croats and serbs and it never quite recovered from the war . 
  the future is not looking very bright for the young people from vukovar . 
  exactly . 
  he was talking about dismantling slovenia , of course . 
  yup . 
  it was n't known that it 's a false alarm when i posted it , otherwise i would n't have . 
   after frightening moments , in which pedestrians scattered , the episode appears to have been a ** false alarm ** . 
  there are pretty much no rules about spelling words , similarly spelled words can sound completely different and vice-versa . 
  that 's how democracy works , sometimes you get leaders you did n't vote for . 
  angela merkel is not an eu-official , she 's chancellor of * germany * . 
  eu has some authority over both croatia and germany , but germany does n't have any authority over croatia ( and vice-versa , ofcourse ) . 
  http://uk.reuters.com/article/idukkbn0p31zb20150623?irpc=932 ( article from june ), 
  true , but the germans elected her so she has authority to make decisions in their name . 
  we ( croatians ) did n't elect her and she has no authority here . 
  the only time article 5 was ever invoked was after 9/11 . 
  parisians , what 's it like in your city right now ? 
  are people scared to go outside ? 
  what ? 
  so what , you just cross it ? 
  [ picture of the said fence ] ( http://imgur.com/tiznfzl ), 
   serbia never targeted mosques just because they were mosques if the action of serbs in bosnia and croatia are any indication , then they have done exactly that in kosovo too . 
  yes , but you make it seem like party 's stance on migrant crisis is the only criterium by which you should decide who to vote for . 
  it * is * a problem , but it 's not the most important thing right now in croatia . 
  migrant crisis is n't seen as a big problem in croatia and it pretty much was n't even mentioned in the pre-election campaign . 
  we have bigger problems . 
  i just came back from the polling station . 
  the results of the election will be very interesting whatever happens , the polls put the two main coalitions very close . 
  i expect that the patriotic coalition ( right-wing , led by hdz ) will get more seats in the parliament than the croatia grows coalition ( left-wing , led by sdp ) , but not enough to form the government . 
  that 's why the next couple of weeks are going to be very interesting in croatia . 
  best experience : brewery tour in plzen , that was really interesting and fun . 
  got to try cold beer from those giant barrels too . 
  worst experience : i got ripped off at the exchange office in prague when i changed some euros to krunas , but that was my fault for not being careful . 
  it depends , is that girl a kid ? 
  and what are `` tree girls '' ? 
  i 'm just saying it sucks there were kids on the plane , i 'm not trying to undermine deaths of the rest of the people . 
  17 kids on the airplane ... fuck that, 
  yup , it 's definitely more southern . 
  it was under italian influence for a long time . 
  dalmatia is south europe . 
  this is terrible but sadly unavoidable if the fence is to stay . 
   need to start denying these assholes at the border before they turn europe into the same shithole they fled from . 
  you basically called every migrant an asshole , just saying that 's not ok . agree with your second comment , though . 
  dude cmon, 
  it 's great .

  do you know that he has already been convicted of corruption before ? 
  i 'm arguing with you because you did n't even read your own fucking article . 
   dodik 's ally , zeljka cvijanovic , was facing defeat by a more moderate candidate , mladen ivanic , in the vote for the serb seat on the bosnian state presidency , in which serbs , croats and muslims , known as bosniaks , share power . 
  ivanic is seen as potentially a more cooperative partner in the tripartite presidency , which could help strengthen bosnia 's weak central institutions .

  not anytime soon .

  and is about 1,000 times more nationalistic than the next closest nationalist ? 
  to save you from having to use your brain : dodik 's power is waning .

  it 's fact that serb nationalism was the primary and largest factor of the dissipation of yugoslavia .

  and by lion 's share , i mean 80-90 % of it . 
  let 's put it this way : the catalans today have a 100 % valid point in secession . 
  repression under francisco franco , etc. 
  the serbs between 1990 - present never had valid points in any type of secession .

  who in france is actually going to care enough to enforce the 5 years to a degree where it ca n't be avoided by simply lying ? 
  `` oh , of course i lived here for 5 years . 
  i have bills sent to me at my address here where i live together with my 15 roommates . '', 
  you would need local officials to care . 
  they wo n't . 
  they 'll be more than happy to let people live at home since it 's no burden on them and granting them citizenship gives no significant extra benefits over what they would get from just being eu citizens . 
  i seriously believe you 're just being a crybaby because i pointed out the idea was stupid as an outsider . 
  if i was a brit saying the exact same thing you would be agreeing with me . 
  you would have no issue believing the french , dutch and swedish officials wo n't care enough to do their job . 
  this is a warning . 
  letting in anyone preferentially is a horrible idea . 
  if you think it 's not , fine by me . 
  you being lax can only hurt you . 
  it 's not your fault . 
  you 're dutch . 
  you 're the people who thought giving immigrants money to go back home would n't be abused . 
  let me try to explain this in the simplest way i can without using crayons . 
  if getting in to the uk the normal way is harder than getting in to the uk by getting citizenship in another eu member state with preferential status , then people will do it the easy way . 
  because the british wo n't like this system being abused , they 'll take away special status or never give it out in the first place . 
  it 's far to easy for eu citizens to get citizenship in any other eu country for this system to be anything other than a flop . 
  if i 'm missing something feel free to point it out , because all i 'm getting from you is `` error , error , does not compute '', 
  it 's a good argument to not have any loopholes . 
  are you really this blind . 
  i 'm flat out telling you that if you let so much as one country have preference , you might as well give it to all of them because that will be the ultimate effect . 
  if you want to keep people out , the only viable approach is to treat everyone with equal suspicion . 
  i 'm giving you the headline of the stunning news report about the stunning failure of the preferential country system a few years in advance and all you can come up with is `` ha , ha , this means my dumb idea is morally justified '' sure . 
  but it 's still dumb . 
  you got your warning . 
  if you choose to ignore it that 's fine , just do n't bitch when the most obvious outcome in the world happens and it all terribly backfires . 
  this is n't a logic statement . 
  if you make a loophole , people will abuse it . 
  it 's genuinely scary to me that this is n't blatantly obvious , scarier still that even when it 's pointed out you are still willingly blind to it . 
  5 years is nothing . 
  most new members had similarly long waiting periods . 
  you also do n't have to live in france . 
  you 're thinking like a westerner . 
  you just have to pretend to live in france for 5 years . 
  or people are cutting out the middle man and going directly to the uk while they still can . 
  remember , people here we 're doing this stuff when crossing the border meant potentially getting shoot and getting deposited meant going to a soviet prison . 
  now we can do everything legally . 
  the system is way to easy to beat to have any chance of working . 
  and here 's where the divide between east and west really shows . 
  to a brit and to most westerners , this sounds like a plausible option . 
  to us in the east ... this is a joke , right ? 
  if they give preference to any eu country , they will inevitably give access to citizens from every eu country . 
  why ? 
  because all eu citizens can live and work anywhere in the eu , which means that the cost of granting citizenship to someone from bulgaria or romania ect . 
  comes at virtually no cost , but has immense value . 
  this incentive structure is obviously flawed as the eu members that have preferential status are incentivised to give citizenship to those eu citizens willing but unable to move to the uk . 
  requirements will ether become more lenient for eu citizens or their enforcement will become more lax since sending people off the england is certainly preferable to having them linger . 
  even if this does n't become policy , people will seek and find ways to exploit any back door offered to them . 
  if there 's a requirement that says people need to be citizens for x number of years , they 'll forge documents , bribe officials or just wait . 
  if there is a loophole and there will be plenty , of that i am certain , it will be exploited . 
  the second it 's put the paper , any agreement will be scoured , every flaw discovered , tested and successful attempts will be documented and replicated . 
  you 're dealing with people who had to deal with communist style bureaucracy on a daily level . 
  the powers that be in the west simply lack the institutional knowledge to deal with that kind of experience and determination . 
  wrong kind of slav you dim whit . 
  and we 're back to the original problem . 
  you 're assholes and you 're hellbent on being the other . 
  you get to be assholes while being one of us . 
  when you 're not one of us and are still assholes , then we hate you . 
  how 's that for unity of purpose . 
  not every eu member agrees the eu is better off without you , but no one disputes that you are the most annoying people on the continent . 
  no , because it has n't happened yet . 
  no british troops have arrived in estonia since the 50 left a few months back . 
  that 's the future which is a different time from the past or present . 
  that 's romania . 
  a different country from estonia . 
  50 you sent 50 troops to estonia . 
  you also sent 4 planes and you left a few months ago . 
  there 's a permanent rotation going on where two countries send 4 jets each and troops to support them and they stay for four months and then leave again until they 're up again . 
  i would argue that the ussr was basically a non hereditary tsardom . 
  just like the french revolution created the french empire and the american revolution essentially left the colonies under a model of government most similar to what they already had prior to the british overreach , the russian revolution ousted one set of absolute leaders for another with the aristocracy being replaced by the nomenclature , blood replaced by `` party loyalty '' and ... well blood in most cases . 
  technically there was more vertical mobility . 
  i farmer could rise to a position of prominence , but it was obvious that every year more and more positions of power were filled with people who shared a last name with someone else high up . 
  the russians ended up back with the only system they really knew and even today we arguably have tsar vladimir and his oligarchs . 
  apparently no one is a very common name then . 
  how would rushing to negotiations be a disaster ? 
  if the uk can afford to walk away with nothing it really does n't matter when negotiations start . 
  if the uk ca n't afford to walk away with nothing , then it does n't matter when negotiations start because you 're negotiating from a position of weakness . 
  by starting the process immediately you at least have the ability to bluff . 
  now everyone 's seen your hand . 
  you need a deal . 
  you treat the eu with very open hostility . 
  you 're meeting nato obligations , but in terms of actually contributing to the defense of the east front you did exactly as much as france or germany , and poland and belgium and denmark for that matter . 
  when spewing nonsense about controlling your own borders , you 're specifically talking about us . 
  you have to be . 
  romanians and poles coming to steal your jobs . 
  no freedom of movement so that none of us undesirables can soil your pristine country . 
  the french and the germans are assholes , but they 're our assholes . 
  they have their own geopolitical agendas , but they still want to peruse them from within the eu . 
  they 're willing to ignore immediate benefits for the long term prosperity of the group . 
  if you left on friendly terms , if the debate was about divergent views and the uk deciding to peg their position in regards to the union here and let the rest of us move to a more federal system , that would have been fine . 
  the uk reduces it 's role and influence as the rest of the eu grows closer and eventually , the uk is out , or maybe it 's not depending on the mood of the day . 
  but no . 
  you could n't have that . 
  you had to spew slanderous nonsense about all of us . 
  you claimed the eastern expansion was thrust upon you , that turkey and syria might be made members against your will , that your sovereignty was under attack by regulations you ether wrote , help write or voted for . 
  you claimed we were taking your money and giving nothing in return .

  although , serbia is its own biggest blocker . 
  they wo n't join the eu before they recognize kosovo . 
  you think it would be okay if , for example , austria called for an anti-erdogan protest in istanbul ? 
  we have that , too . 
  the company is called dukat and they named the '' greek-type '' yogurt [ dukatos ] ( http://www.jatrgovac.com/usdocs/dukatos-natur-150g.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know if that 's also racist or not . 
  zagreb : prettiest - [ national theatre ] ( http://9227-presscdn-0-11.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/img_2145.jpg ) ugliest - [ this commie megabuilding ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wzwiz.jpg ), 
   is that a croat using ... cyrillic ? 
  it was an attempt , but my croatian brain refuses to read it like anything other than ksa-ksa-ksa  we win ** again ** !, 
  you serbs say that all the time as if you 've ever won anything against us before xaxaxa, 
  we have a saying '' pick up the cream '' and it means to come in the last moment when everything is already over to collect all the credit . 
  i think it 's pretty relevant . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's from serbia, 
   who are the greatest people of ** your country ** ? 
   their golden age also known as the reign of suleiman the magnificent , who died during his battle against us . 
  it was 3.000 good croatian ( and hungarian ) men against 100.000 kebab . 
  btw , habsburg monarchy also participated in battle of vienna in 1683 . 
  she was born in the kingdom of poland , i know that she was n't ethnically polish, 
   theres ~ ~ two ~ ~ things that serbia must do to join the eu actually , there 's [ 35 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ), 
  i guess that 's better than [ uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlc8ilvlzoq ), 
  we did that a [ century before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_szigetv%c3%a1r ) . 
  no , it 's the opposite !, 
  ever heard of lech , czech and rus ? 
  well , you do n't know the complete story . 
  hrvat was their father . 
  ( at least in our legends , which are 100 % confirmed true ), 
  there is no single reason , but it 's a combination of appreciation of german mentality , german influence and stockholm syndrome . 
  it 's also partly because germany is the only one out of 5 biggest countries in europe that realizes we exist . 
   montenegro : hard workers [ lol ] ( https://youtu.be/fevzul1d-zk?t=200 ), 
   tengerfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r '' biograd na moru '' , capital of old croatian kingdom , before the queen consort of croatia , helena , gave the throne to her hungarian brother . 
   k\u00e1rolyv\u00e1ros karlovac , got name after it 's founder , austrian archduke karl  esz\u00e9k okay , osijek is yours . 
  but it 's not on the sea and it 's poor , so take it if you want . 
   ver\u0151ce virovitica , wirowititz in german . 
  it also sounds german so you ca n't have that . 
  oh , nothing sounds more magyar than '' fiume '', 
   that 's very not-catholic of him . 
  you disquallified yourself nope , you all fell in the trap and now believe in evolution . 
  earth is 6000 years old . 
   sorry that was us nope , you were on the other side . 
  that polish whore roxelana told her husband suleiman to spread kebab all over europe and we stopped him !, 
   but at time of commonwealth our motto was `` if god is with us , then who is against us ? '', 
  oh , too bad you abandoned it . 
  our national motto is '' god and croats ''  we were going to make ban on `` in vitro '' and abortion we banned gay marriage in constitution and our minister of education does n't believe in that bullshit called the evolution . 
   we have the biggest monument of jezus . 
  we have [ the smallest cathedral ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_the_holy_cross,_nin ) in the world . 
  because less is more in catholicism , amateurs !, 
   maria is our queen . 
  ( we sing `` maria our queen '' ) we do that to , except our marija [ glows in the dark ] ( http://www.medjugorje.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/glowing-statue.jpg ) because she loves us more than others . 
   we were asking `` where is saint cross ? '', 
  we sent a song called [ '' mary magdalene '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sehoc_qijnk ) to the eurovision . 
  our most popular singer has a song called [ '' hail mary '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyvktvwqifa )  and we christianized lithuania bitch , please . 
  we saved vienna from kebab . 
  so we are basically why europe is not kabab today . 
  that 's why our border is so weird !, 
   we also have catholic radio and catholic tv do you have to specifically call them '' catholic '' ? 
  because our national television and radio are catholic . 
  the pope was from the region in poland known as the motherland of croats , called white croatia . 
  italians could share , too !, 
  if yugoslavia was only slovenians and croats it would probably still exist today, 
  you give us a corridor to austria so we do n't have to pay for vignette and we give you a corridor to the international waters !, 
  they are trying to conquer 3 m2 of our sea so that they can have access to the international waters . 
  that 's not how you look for jobs . 
  you need to join a political party first . 
  of course not !, 
  it 's serbia 's biggest musical achievement , other than composing our anthem and winning the eurovision in 2007 . 
  but what about [ serbia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mjyz6yu8vk ) ? 
  but that one is true , no ? 
  italy and norway are hilarious !, 
  lithuania is especially confusing, 
  in germany ? 
  it all depends on what you are going to use it for . 
  spanish would be much easier for you to learn because it has more in common with your native tongue than russian . 
  slavic languages have 7 cases , which is 3 more than german . 
  but if you are planning to be in trade related business or something similar , russian is probably more useful in europe as it opens doors to a large market of russia and kazakhstan . 
  but it 's not ** the ** eiffel tower, 
  i do n't think anyone does that except serbia and macedonia, 
  yugoslavia was not in a cold war like ussr and its satellites . 
  therefore it was more open and people lived quite well . 
  that 's why there are so many people in ex-yu countries who are still nostalgic about that period . 
  the real question is why malta is always forgotten about . 
  it could be in a few years . 
  depends on who wins the election in september . 
  he was dismissed by the parliament , but he will still be in function until a new government is formed , which will happen after the election in september . 
  it 's a bay called after cape savudrija , also known as the westernmost point in istria and croatia . 
  more importantly , it is also known to be more western than cape madona in slovenia . 
  i know they are . 
  but it 's still surprising to me . 
  perhaps the catholic church is not as powerful in spain and portugal as it is in croatia and italy . 
  i find it so unusual that a catholic country in southern europe is so lgbt friendly . 
  have spaniards always been more open-minded than one would expect ? 
  [ beautiful times ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eabd-yxql0 )  piranski zaliv is that how slovenes call our savudrijska vala ? 
  never heard of that . 
  sounds illegitimate, 
  no , no , cro no give . 
  ask ita . 
  karl erjavec might be looking for a new job , 
  my german teacher wore black all the time and never smiled . 
  she yelled in german when we misbehaved so everyone was terrified and therefore learned german quite well . 
  sea slavs second best slavs . 
  here it 's mostly because of austrian and german influence .

  you ca n't even imagine what kind of shit they do ... we had a link on / r/croatia recently , screenshot from the list of public workers in city of split . 
  they have three people working on their webpage ... one fucking simple webpage with cms that needs maybe an hour of work a day if you really have something important to put there . 
  a secretary in split has an assistant . 
  you have situations where they employ people to make coffee ... that 's their fucking job . 
  no cleaning , they need another one for that . 
  and so on and on and on ... . 
  i really hope we get greek treatment and get rid of this nonsense . 
  during 6 years of recession ... not a single person lost their job in public sector . 
  none . 
  they actually employed even more people , while private sector is dying and is shedding jobs daily . 
  lol , they are supporting is in syria and they want to join eu ? 
  i was supporting them before , but there is no place for erdogan and his policies in europe . 
   in other words , putin is a copycat . 
  he took milo\u0161evi\u0107 's textbook and copied it . 
  what is going on in ukraine is like what happened in croatia in 1991 . 
   it isnt ironic for a serb to say this serbs never declared republics in another country or something , no ? 
  really ? 
  there are famous bulgarians ? 
  the eagle people have spoken . 
  edge of tomorrow has similar fuckup iirc, 
   huh ? 
  first you write that you never payed increased prices then that the costs are built in the price . 
  many shops offer discounts for cash payments in croatia . 
   i am not going to post any of ours ...     they 're a bit embarrassing . 
  what 's wrong with [ vila velebita ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbdzkfmg1wy ) or [ marjane , marjane ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyf0on17qmw ) ? 
  one of her latest hits : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zto1hpamds, 
  ya ... and we sold shitloads of weapons to `` jordan '' recently . 
  and no iranian plane ever landed in croatia with weapons for bosniaks with us approval . 
  you might get lucky, 
  clouds breaking up here in vara\u017edin , northern croatia and i am seeing sun . 
  you might be lucky and actually get nice weather . 
  too bad it will be sunny next week : pp, 
  built yes , but most advanced parts , like engines and powertrains are designed in romania . 
  same goes for \u0160koda , they use available parts from vw . 
  there is nothing bad in it , good for you to have a quality product that can move romanian industry forward . 
  hey !!, 
  ... not my fault , someone posted this in / r/croatia and i thought it would be nice to resubmit here , he should pay for that sandwich  ) ), 
  but , but ... karma ? 
   guess we were lucky ? 
  yes . 
   please help if we start to get invaded . 
  that 's what nato is for . 
  you could join . 
  it lacked radar , we had missiles and launchers , but did n't buy the whole thing in the end . 
  there are rumors it ended in the usa . 
  it `` disappeared '' from our warehouse . 
  this is completely false . 
  our mod denied anything like this and what jutarnji list published is a wild speculation based on rumors and some truths . 
  yes , we were looking at blackhawks , but they mention some mysterious letter that came from the usa in which they offered us this deal . 
  whole article in jutarnji is made of truths , half truths and possible lies and i would n't trust them at all . 
  and the article you linked ... is even worse . 
  my comment in / r/ukrainianconflict / about the original article . 
  sorry , but i would n't trust jutarnji list on something like this . 
  it might happen , but it was denied by croatian mod . 
  we did send dozens of plane loads to jordan ( akhm , akhm ) recently and are sending ammo and weapons to kurds , but this is just a very wild rumor . 
  edit : : by the way , we just got 200 and something mraps from the usa, 
  fiat has ferrari and maserati , lambo is owned by vw . 
   maserati yes , increased and will continue to do it with the new suv that will be launched soon , but it is still not a brand that produces cars for the mases and it never will , but it is becoming hugely profitable . 
  ghibli is making them shitloads of money . 
  they 'll have ferrari  maserati  alfa romeo as sport brands and no other manufacturer can offer that . 
   what about maserati , is it also dying ? 
  they have 350 % increase in global sales . 
  they are currently doing more than great and they expect to sell even more once they launch suv and new sports car , alfieri . 
   alfa romeo only sells the giulietta at this moment . 
  mito and 4c . 
   the italian auto brands are going down . 
  maserati has 350 % increase in global sales and is projecting even more . 
  they let chechnya go , did n't they ? 
  he was n't russian . 
  it will probably get worse in serbia since all the water from bosnia and croatia will end there and sava is at highest ever levels and still rising . 
   nonsense .

  http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/prihodi-padaju-deficit-raste-a-slavko-linic-sve-popularniji-clanak-613276 i wondered from where did all that crap came . 
  i even submitted this article to / r/croatia because it makes some sense in the beginning , but after reading all that crap i deleted it . 
  ahhhhhh ... 
  i used it because . hr is crap and never actually connected the dots what . sh is . 
  yap , much better and much higher quality . 
   it 's funny you have people that can write that with a straight face  ) ) it 's crap like this why there is so much controversy right now . 
  this is stupid beyond stupid ... 
  i do n't even have proper words how stupid this is . 
  croatian wiki is piece of shit full of right wing ideology . 
  when trying to find anything about ww2 for some discussion i had i used either english or serbian wiki , unless you are looking for glorification of ustashe regime there are no good ww2 articles on croatian wiki . 
  recent history is n't any better . 
  not very different from here . 
  here you have ministry of science owing millions in social security contributions or national tv owing few hundred million in unpaid vat and so on ... tax authority just closed some hotels on the coast during the highest tourist season because they did n't pay social security contributions and they are closing bars all over the place if they do n't `` fiscalize '' their receipts . 
  state is n't paying what they are supposed to pay , but if you do n't pay them ... they 'll close your business . 
  we do have many problems like greece , maybe on a smaller scale , but they are basically the same . 
  starting from corruption to overblown public sector and tax evasion ... 
  there were 48 billion kuna ( our current budget is 118 billion kuna ) of unpaid taxes and social security contributions at the beginning of the year . 
  tens of thousands of workers do n't get paid for months and so on ... people actually work for nothing . 
  also , i own a small business and have to deal with state shit almost daily ... including vat and secoial security contributions ... our justice system is a joke , if you finish work and print a receipt you have to pay vat and there is nu guarantee you 'll get paid ... 
  i tried to go to the court to get 5000 euros and after 18 months i still have n't seen a cent of it . 
  and i had to pay 150 euros just to submit papers to the court and then i had to hire a lawyer and in the end i 'll prolly get shit while spending all that money . 
  so ... please ... 
  i think i understand very well . 
  in croatia our tax authority introduced `` fiscalization '' ... every receipt is submitted to them via internet . 
  some bars on the coast are reporting over 1000 % increase in their daily revenue compared to the same period last year .

  i see it on tv on channels like bbc , orf , zdf , and even on shitty networks like hrt , cnn etc all the time . 
  they talk about them together because it 's happening at the same time . 
  i do n't see any problems with that . 
   for expample european countries are selling weapons to saudis . 
  this was never a secret and it was in the news all the time . 
   at least most of them are . 
  only slovenia , croatia and maybe montenegro . 
  i ca n't think of anything which is currently better in any other ex-yu republic . 
   by winning elections against i do n't think that this is an option tbh . 
  he has to much influence to be stopped in a `` democratic '' way . 
  pls correct me if i 'm wrong but wans ' t the conflict calmed before the army operations in an kurdish town ( i think it was cizre but i 'm not sure ) . 
  why are there so many attacks recently ? 
  one side will lie and nobody will be able to say who is right . 
  like always : /, 
  no keep it . 
  we do n't want it : i, 
  well done , susjed !, 
  on their own ground yes . 
  but i 'm not sure it they are able to secure the air on `` enemy '' ground that fast . 
  the point i try to make is that russia has no chance to invade a nato country and hold the area . 
  i do n't think that this is as important as it was back in ww2 . 
  big amounts of soldier in one place would get bombed to hell in a modern conflict . 
   it 's better to integrate smaller , but wholly european , units together and have it gradually grow larger . 
  there are only benefits from a logistic military standpoint . 
  points like a united air-defense for all the smaller eu-members and so on . 
  croatia ( and other members ) has planes which require to leave our airspace just to make a turn :d, 
  there budget is not even the problem imo . 
  their main problem is that most of their stuff is outdated . 
  we were already able to see how the soviet era stuff performed and it was horrible . 
  you guys seem to think that the eu is much more `` connected '' than it actually is . 
  do n't get me wrong i would really like to see us closer together but the reality is that there is a long way to go until we are able to build a working military together . 
  i agree !, 
  italy gib 1/2 carrier : i, 
  no they would destroy them . 
  russia is n't nearly as strong as many think it is . 
  sounds like tump the brexit party or most right wing parties in europe ... pretty sad : /, 
  hmmm ... now that you say it . 
   but bosnia and kosovo have the highest number of isis fighter per capita in europe . 
  it sounds stupid but i do n't think that this is something unusual for the 2 countries with the biggest muslim population in europe . 
  was n't the reason for the incident in the police station more nationalistic than islamistic ? 
  serbia has not the military to fight a war against anybody and bosnia has no effective army . 
  kosovo is protected by the nato and the other neighbors have no major disputes with serbia . 
  the first targets of these people would be the other 2 ethnic groups in bosnia . 
  the fact that there was not a single case ( terror attacks etc ) in bosnia where islamists did something to either serbs or croats shows that there is no big problem . 
  it would be nice af if the eu would simply ban whatsapp . 
  we have so much better alternatives but everyone sticks to whatsapp for some reason . 
  holy shit not again ... 
  there will be no war or anything . 
  they keep saying it since the last war stopped and nothing ever happened . 
  they usually use topics like this to avoid speaking about more important things like economy or corruption . 
  when 2 id 's are too expensive ... 
  shut your mouth evil slovenian or we will crash our glorious planes over your country . 
  a cluster shell is nothing compared to our mig 's falling apart !, 
  there are huge differences . 
  you ca n't compare some junk news sources from western countries with major russian news networks like sputnik or rt. 
  only idiots think that sources like for example daily mail , the times or sky news are trustworthy in any way . 
  holy fucking shit ... 
  it is just for parades and so on . 
  i do n't think that they use it . 
  they moved their army ( jna ) in a already established country . 
  how the hell is it possible that croatia is the aggressor . 
  please read at least a fucking wikipedia article before making such stupid claims . 
  i think that wikipedia got a relatively accurate list of our equipment . 
  ( maybe a bit outdated though ), 
  i do n't even what happened with it after the whole dispute . 
  i think the problem was that the plane was a old one from somewhere else and not even restored at all or something . 
  i 'm not sure though ... 
  they still juse ak 's . 
  we have modern bullpup rifles . 
  they still use btr 50 's . 
  we have modern patria lav 's . 
  the best light vehicle they use is the hmmwv . 
  we have new oshkosh 's . 
  their artillery is still from the soviet era . 
  we have 15 panzerhaubitze 2000 . 
  ( but we still have much soviet junk ) just to name a few things ... 
  they offered them autonomy ... they refused . 
  slovenia , croatia and bosnia had every right to split up . 
  where would we end in every minority would like to declare new fictive states just becasue they live in a foreign country ? 
   ( you know the ones that had in living memory been slaughtering serbs in a concentration camp ) becasue croats in general are still nazis today ... do you know that per % more croats served in the partizan army during ww2 than from any other yugoslav country ? 
  do you know that tudman was a partizan himself ? 
  the serbian propaganda at this time was effective . 
   i hate them ? 
  sorry mixed you up with somebody else here . 
  i mean they hate the nato . 
  i will fix it . 
   in a serb mind they fought a defensive war so croatians do n't expel them from their homes in croatia . 
  but most of them know that they were the aggressor . 
  another reason i forgot to mention could be kosovo of course . 
   yeah i dont buy that and neither do most serbs why ? 
   or by exploding in mid-air and then the debris kills the enemies . 
  cluster shells - made in croatia . 
  so they hate them because they stopped you to invade other countries ? 
  this would be like germany hating america for stopping the nazis . 
  not even the serbs supported the milosevic regime at the end . 
  could you stop calling it herceg bosna . 
  it does not exist . 
  i said that i am shure that the nato would stay mostly on our side . 
  especially because because one of us is a member . 
  they will argue as always and nothing will happen ... as always .

  this is the anthem of the eu . 
  my favourite [ ode to joy video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcxulfgt938 ), 
  he 's talking about kosovo, 
  bosnia and herzegovina for obvious reasons . 
  the comment before yours was referencing croatian war of independence ( in the ninties ) , and yours was about wwii . 
  wrong war mate btw partisans were founded in croatia and in the first year majority of them were croatians, 
  first time i 've seen it therefore first time it was posted . 
  hello !, 
   how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  every day for at least an hour . 
   how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  every day at least once , sometimes more if there are some news i 'm interested in that 's being discussed in / r/europe . 
   what country are you normally resident in ? 
  croatia  do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  croatian , bosnian , serbian , montenegrin . 
  i 'm a polyglot . 
  :d  what interests you about europe ? 
  many things ; its history , the eu , relations between individual countries etc. 
   what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  favourite thing - there are people from every european country here , it 's interesting how people 's opinions may differ based on their nationality or location . 
  least favourite thing - downvoting based on someone 's opinion or nationality . 
  sadly , it happens way more than it should . 
   do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  i 'm a moderator of / r/croatia , but that 's a pretty small community compared to / r/europe . 
   why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  i think it could be a nice experience and i believe i could help make this sub a more enjoyable place . 
   why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  i 'm gon na be available as much as i can , i 'm pretty objective when it comes to moderator things like removing posts that break the rules or replying to modmail . 
   do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  i do n't . 
   what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  i 'm aware that it was introduced with a good intention but it did n't work well because people felt like you were censoring them . 
  so when you got rid of the megathread , the sub got even more cluttered by the imigration posts than before . 
  imo the megathread should have never been introduced and maybe the front page would n't be so clutterd then as it is now . 
   what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i do n't know how to use automoderator or css . 
   would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  one hundred duck sized horses , providing they can not fly . 
   what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why porn . 
  no need to explain . 
  i do n't think these counts of olympic medals are fair ; one skier ( or swimmer ) can win multiple medals but when a basketball team ( or any other team ) finishes in top three on the tournament it only counts as one medal for the country . 
  damn right you did, 
  \\ #justbalkanthings, 
  prague . 
  it 's beautiful , relatively cheap and has beer . 
  ah , petica was awesome . 
  hrt even showed all the big european derbies like el clasico , arsenal-chelsea or milan-inter derbies . 
  now they only show half of the cl . 
  haha is he still doing them ? 
  why ? 
   if left wo n't compromise now , it will be too late later ( i used to be lefty on this , but i see that we need to stop this * now * to avoid crazies getting in power ) so you do n't see the migrant crisis as a problem that needs to be solved because it will lead to many bigger problems in the future , you only want to solve it now when it looks like right-wing parties may win the elections in many european countries ? 
  where ? 
  it seems like they had no choice . 
  happy national day , ma\u0111ari !, 
  great , good for you mods . 
  it did take you some time but the important thing is those megathreads are gone . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assumption_of_mary ), 
  u wot, 
  i 'm gon na do that for you tonight . 
  they cant gib it cuz its not theirs, 
  i think `` jebem ti mater '' ( * ( i ) fuck your mother * ) is even more common . 
  it 's the same in croatian, 
  i call it majmun . 
  no we should n't , that 's not our territory . 
  that the communist serbs that work for the yugoslavian secret police are guilty for everything bad that happens in croatia . 
  lol are you serious ? 
   basketball you are good but croatia has a good team too , we shall see who has the better team in this year 's eurobasket !, 
   voleyball do men also play that sport ? 
  :p  shooting what , like with ak-47 ? 
  our team was terrible , congrats to serbs for the victory , totally deserved . 
  important thing is we qualified for the olympics , that 's a bit more important competition imo . 
  i just realized you 're a troll , goodbye . 
  he 's working for the french company general geoscience and he was kidnapped on his way to work . 
  i do n't know where the fuck did you pull your information from but it 's wrong and in future , before making such retarded conclusions , inform yourself , you wo n't look like a complete idiot then . 
  does \u0160e\u0161elj have a secret stash of croatian flags or what ? 
  what 's the purpose of the french parade on the day of the fall of bastille or of the russian parade on their victory day ? 
  to show what the army that 's parading ( and in croatia 's case , the police , health and fire department too ) have at their disposal and what they 're capable of . 
  imo it 's a very dignified celebration that also looks awesome . 
   why not do something peaceful which would bring you closer to the * european idea * ? 
  we 're a member of the eu , we 're pretty familiar with the * european idea * . 
  today 's holiday is a celebration of the end of the war . 
  to answer your question , slovenia was also in war with serbia ( yugoslavia ) , but only for 10 days . 
  after that , the yugoslav army retreated from slovenia and focused on bosnia and croatia . 
  one of the reasons for that isthere was n't a large number of serbs in slovenia , as opposed to bosnia and croatia . 
  he 's talking about slavonia , the eastern part of croatia , not slovenia , 
  these are the new guys . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
   there is nothing that would lead me to believe this is a result of some crazed tank rampage . 
  not even numerous wittnesses ? 
  i suppose not , when you refuse to believe in something , nothing will change your mind . 
  enjoy living in ignorance . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o32wi3_od0 it 's pretty unbelieveable , i know . 
  but sadly , it 's true . 
  why ? 
  that 's from knin , not zagreb . 
  some expect over 100000 people in knin today , of course there will be some extremist idiots among them . 
  go back to youtube , please .

  i 'm not sure i understand you ... 
  we can call them americans ... 
  insult ? 
  he did n't insult anyone . 
  what 's black snow ? 
   try saying that 5 times in a row i ca n't say that one time in a row . 
   eurovision fan \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  when i heard of monsters and men for the first time i thought they were from ireland !, 
  on the `` old school '' map , serbia , montenegro and kosovo are still one country . 
  it 's really not that hard to google . 
  fuck anarchism !, 
  fuck every government then !, 
  just downvote and move on . 
  no need to take a screenshot . 
  i know , but it 's interesting that a word that 's in one language normal is considered an insult in other language . 
  fun fact : albanians call themselves shiptar . 
  we should write all titles in capital letters because that way they sound more important , right ? 
  he ca n't elaborate because he does n't know what he 's talking about . 
  he talks to us like we 're children or something . 
  come to croatia baby . 
  yeah well fuck you too, 
  still mad about knocking you out of qualifications for euro 2008 ? 
  i always wanted to go there !, 
  we do n't . 
  - it 's located between austria and switzerland - they speak german - capital is vaduz - their national football team suck but they still somehow managed to score two goals when they played against us, 
  maybe . 
  kosovo is never doing ok . 
  super mario is croatian :p, 
  no problem mate , always happy to help . 
  a map . 
  yeah i do n't know what the hell is he talking about . 
  obviously the best country in the world is croatia . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  what the fuck, 
  and in euro 2012 :(, 
  ... i know only three songs on your list . 
  i 'm from croatia and my least favourite european country is spain . 
  i really do n't know why , but i just do n't like it . 
  yeah !, 
  i vote for croatian . 
  catholic church *, 
  of course he did , do n't listen to potato . 
  yeah i had no idea that that was lyrics from that beatles song , thanks for the link !, 
  did you know that the majority of zucca 's images show paris as a thriving , lively city filled with food , laughter and young families ? 
  i think it is . 
  aww that 's exactly the kind of relationship we have with our neigbours !, 
  lol, 
  bosnian are the best . 
  lol montenegro you do n't exist, 
  that 's different and you know that . 
  yeah i 'm aware of that , i was half-joking . 
  however , since one part of turkey is in europe , i consider them a european country . 
  but ... they 're in uefa !, 
   just wait a decade or two - these systems will be overtaken by the systems with free education . 
  i hope so , but i doubt it . 
  2008 was a rough year . 
  fellow croats , this is embarassing . 
  we need to keep up with our eastern friends . 
  guess you were right . 
  i 'm pretty confused . 
  is he or is he not a leader of that party ? 
  how come costa rica is so high on the list ? 
  yeah but he 's still in charge of social-democratic party as he said . 
  he was convicted for corruption and people still vote for him ? 
  why ? 
  here in croatia it 's great for cheap candy and ice-creams , and its vegatables and fruit are usually pretty fresh , but other than that it 's all some unknown german brands . 
  ah , the famous past-future tense . 
  do n't disturb me while i 'm watching the game jebote, 
  joke thread was last week . 
  hvala metaleks , ljudina si . 
  ajde sad brzo pi\u0161i edit i kreditiraj me . 
  taenk , would n't it be better if you posted this thread later ? 
  not in 2am ? 
  there are n't many comments here . 
  we 'll beat them ... lol, 
  sorry about that, 
  yeah mine too, 
  i 'm not really into basketball and i did n't watch today 's game , but what i heard from people who watched it that spain was playing pretty bad and we still managed to lose 28 points . 
  so , i guess they deserved booing . 
  we used to be better ... 
  okay, 
   some opinions are more correct than others , and some are just wrong . 
  i agree , but i do n't agree that that 's a reason for downvote . 
  you should downvote a comment that is irrelevant to discussion , that is rude or offensive and of course troll comments . 
  my comments were relevant , they were n't offensive and i was n't trolling . 
  i just had different opinion . 
   most serbs are quite used to it . 
  yup . 
  i feel sorry for you for having to deal with all this anti-serbian propaganda . 
  when i see that my comment is * hidden * because i have different fucking opinion than the majority of the subreddit , i just lose the will to discuss anything in that thread . 
   we discussed this few days ago on / r/croatia . 
  uh , no , we did n't `` discuss '' anything in / r/croatia . 
  unless you count downvoting everyone with different opinion discussing . 
  it 's like liverpool . 
   google or microsoft ? 
  why not apple ? 
  they 've changed a lot since then . 
  exactly . 
  if they could read it for 20 years , they can now too . 
  because / r/europe downvotes things they do n't like even if they are true .

  ukraine side-note : ex-yuga , seriously ? 
  you 're more miserable than * moldova * ?? 
  i know that complaining a lot is a national pastime here , but some perspective would be nice . _ . 
  also estonia , hungary , portugal etc. 
  i can see greece being miserable because of `` pay denbts ! '', 
  and ukraine because of their `` oppressed russian minorities '' , but what gives ? 
  portugal is apparently sadder than venezuela . 
  the article does n't actually say `` how '' europe can do that , aside from  europeans love to complain about donald trump and the collapse of the liberal order , but have done very little to support the struggle for turkish democracy right next door . 
  it is not too late to deter erdogan from his path -- and europe has enough economic leverage and political clout to do so . 
  trying to nicely ask does n't work . 
  support the struggle for democracy , how exactly ? 
  somehow magic the imprisoned journalists and kurdish leaders into freedom ? 
  or cut off the economic ties ? 
  that does n't necessarily work , or at least it may not work very fast . 
  erdogan and his lot can just use that as more fuel for propaganda ( this can last for years ) , or maybe even find other economic partners who do n't care about our european values that much . 
   people are not religious , do n't believe in god , but many believe in `` some '' higher life force or spirits but is n't that just different wording for `` god '' ? 
  apparently this study just asked `` do you believe in god ? '', 
  i think that 's a too vague question . 
  if you asked me whether i believe in a personal jesus who died for my sins , and all that dogma , i 'd say no . 
  but if you asked if i believe in higher force/actually a very drunken trolling programmer who set the natural laws of this world and may be hiding in one of the 13 ( ?!? ), 
  space dimensions , i 'd say `` uuh , probably ? '', 
  which basically translates to just a different * form * of god . 
  what about the more `` unofficial '' rules ? 
  for example , over here you could theoretically be religious . 
  but in practice , once my grandfather wanted to get a job as a high school teacher , well he had to baptize his sons in secret because `` good little comrades are atheist . '', 
  if he had gotten dismissed , of course religion would n't be written up as the * official * reason . 
  right , but i think the approach from the article is pretty wrong . 
  building up a capable army is one of the easier things , at least in comparison to building up something more complex like industry/finance/schooling system . 
  and for context , * every 5th person living in the world today is chinese . 
  * if push came to shove , i think the `` smaller '' countries - except for usa - would be unpleasantly surprised by china 's ability to wage war . 
  ( they have nukes too , should it come to worst . ), 
  and as for soft power ... uhhh . 
  is uk ahead of china because of the commonwealth ? 
  not sure how much that one counts . 
  meanwhile uk 's relations to their own close neighbors and trading partners - eu - are pretty messy at the moment . 
  afaik their closest ally right now is usa lead by the likes of donald trump . 
  and when i look at my house , seemingly half of it is `` made in china '' . 
  that looks like more legit soft power if you ask me ... 
  ok , not eu . 
  but the idea of * any * separate european country being more powerful than china seems ridiculous . 
  iirc it worked when macedonia/serbia closed borders ( at least , the balkan flow was stemmed even before the agreement with turkey ) . 
  but i do n't know if it 's even possible to guard greece , too many islands too close to turkey - what are they going to do , sink their boats ? 
  mind you just letting them know that greece is as far as they 're going to get might do most of the job . 
  do n't you old nan me !, 
  but seriously now , at least theoretically we have to join ... eventually ... by the time asoiaf books are finished ? 
  tbh we do n't even care all that much , for one thing we 'd have to secure our hilariously shaped borders better . 
  but is n't everyone but ireland obliged to join eventually ? 
  and ireland just got the opt-out because of uk ( they 'll probably keep it ) . 
  mind you schengen can be delayed a lot ... but not indefinitely , at least in theory . 
  in case you were wondering , it 's [ zagreb cathedral ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-usyperjyrag/uuamracbqhi/aaaaaaaacec/rtgwatbfxue/s1600/704px-zagreb_cathedral_areal_1.jpg ) at 105 m. ( it has `` bandages '' on it because they 've been restoring it as far as i can remember visiting . ), 
  side-note : so now i got curious about the height of st. vitus cathedral in prague , my impression of it was `` whoah '' , so i thought it 'd be much taller . 
  it is n't , shorter by 8 meters . 
  to be fair , it just ... 
  [ looms . 
  ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/place/st.+vitus+cathedral/@50.0905163,14.3996579,3a,75y,58.97h,145.83t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-ns59am8wto4%2fv7agigddrri%2faaaaaaaaavg%2f6z__jf54gs08ubps9swiszdb7xc9a20wqcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh6.googleusercontent.com%2f-ns59am8wto4%2fv7agigddrri%2faaaaaaaaavg%2f6z__jf54gs08ubps9swiszdb7xc9a20wqcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya241.1434-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i7680!8i3840!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x470b951e38024f5b:0x69ad3850f2d989a2!2sst.+vitus+cathedral!8m2!3d50.0908918!4d14.4005114!3m4!1s0x470b951e38024f5b:0x69ad3850f2d989a2!8m2!3d50.0908918!4d14.4005114!6m1!1e1 ), 
  to be fair , those 3 sadly have something in common : nobody gives a toss about them . 
  too eastern , too poor , too whatever . 
  not in nato , not in eu , no prospects of joining any time soon . 
  there 's only so far russia could go in terms of open aggression in europe - they do n't have the men or the money to fund an army that 'd be necessary to go even as far as poland/germany . 
  ( hilariously , at lot of their economy is dependent on europe . ), 
  i could see them taking a bite out of the 3 baltics , but i seriously think that eu would intervene in that case . 
  and while eu may not be armed to the teeth at the moment , believe me when i say it does n't take very long - a year or two - to double or triple the size of your army , if you 're determined to do it . 
  i 'm talking about the beginning of the war , meaning 91/92 . 
  we had very little - next to nothing - at the time , hell our * regular police * made up a significant part of the `` army '' . 
  within the next year or so , we got plenty of these smuggled weapons , also we straight up [ stole a lot of stuff from the jna bases scattered around , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_barracks ) and then we basically turned into a war-economy in the next few years . 
  that does n't change the fact that the initial loses of around 1/3 of the croatian territory would n't have been as bad if we were n't almost defenseless in the beginning . 
  and as for bosnia , that was a bit later in the timeline ( 92 -  95 ) , by that time we sort-of had a functional army . 
  plus , over there everyone fought everyone at different periods ( part of the reason why their war was a much uglier ) , the `` difference '' is that bosniaks and croats mostly fought together against serbs in the beginning and end . 
  which is a lame difference , as far as these things go . 
  could be true , for all i know . 
  ( i do n't know . ), 
  but in that case , it does n't apply to us , we 're mostly kebab-free ( in fact we were usually the traditional euro condom against kebab . _ . ) . 
  if you ask the folks on the street here , the impression is that despite paying lip service to peace and democracy and all that , un/west did n't want yugoslavia to break up , so this embargo was an easy way for them to `` sadly wring their hands , omg there was a short ugly war , who could have guessed , what can you do '' . 
  so it 's a good thing that some countries like germany and hungary ignored that in practice and sent weapons to us anyways . 
  well , them or their smugglers , it 's hard to tell how much the officials turn a blind eye to such things , plausible deniability etc. 
  eh , these [ clinton tapes ] ( https://www.amazon.com/clinton-tapes-wrestling-history-president-ebook/dp/b002poeqtk ) have been around for a while . 
  you can question their validity of course , but [ what op submitted is in there . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/books/excerpt-clinton-tapes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) and when it comes to the weapons embargo , it 's a fact that the west/un put it in place despite knowing full well that such an embargo left jna as the only prepared/functional army in ex-yugoslavia in the early 90 's , the same jna that turned into a de facto serbian army . 
  why they did that is a matter of debate . 
  also maybe australia , i heard they have a bit of a climate change deniers infestation going on . 
  i suspect it 's more `` full psychopath '' than full retard . 
  because fuck what the environment looks like in 100 years , they wo n't be alive at that time , and there 's oily money to be made now . 
  i just hope that it ends up being not-that-relevant . 
  iirc china is * bigly * investing into green energy ( because they 're choking already , d'oh ) , similar goes for europe , hopefully similar will go for india and other growing giants . 
  worst are the periods 7-8 , 12-14 , and 18-20 hours , those ferry all the high school kids . 
  sometimes i actually wait for the next one to arrive if i 'm not in a hurry , anything is better than ... feeling all that `` i ca n't even '' wafting in my direction . 
  is n't a big part of that the developing `` 3rd world '' ? 
  as in , i read somewhere that the number of people below poverty line dropped by 50 % , or 2 billion to 1 billion , within the twenty years of 1990-2010 . 
  and iirc most of that population below the line ( and many that are/were close to it ) was n't from europe . 
  so in a sense , it 's harder to raise your gdp if it 's already pretty high , than it is to improve from rock bottom . 
  a while back i browsed some of the archived top posts on this sub , plus stuff that concerns my region . 
  and the ones from 2 years ago , it 's not uncommon to see someone with an uk flag acting like , well , a part of the eu . 
  like for example when we joined up . 
  nowadays you have a lot of anger/shame/saltiness from `` both sides '' of the channel and remain/leave factions . 
  makes all those old posts look even sadder : <,
